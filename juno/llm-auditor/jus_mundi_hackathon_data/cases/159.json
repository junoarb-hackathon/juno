I agree too that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction with respect to the Tax on the Value of the Production of Electrical Energy (TVPEE) (Award, paras. 402-405).\n\n2.\n\nI regret, however, that I am not able to support the conclusion of the Majority on liability and quantum, to the effect that Spain has violated Article 10 of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) (Award, paras. 480-490, 508-513). This conclusion, with the consequences that are said to follow in relation to other findings and the assessment in relation to quantum of damages (Award, paras. 682-688), is premised on certain findings of fact by the Majority, namely that the Claimants:\n\n(i) had an expectation that the tariff regime established by RD 661/2007 was immutable during the reasonable life of their investments,\n\n(ii) relied on that expectation in making their investments, and\n\n(iii) carried out the necessary exercise in due diligence required by the Energy Charter Treaty.\n\nAs set out below, these findings of fact are entirely unsupported by evidence on the record, and reached without reasoning or explanation. Accordingly, I dissent from the finding of a violation of Article 10, on the basis of the record before the Tribunal in this case. I regret, further, that the Majority has failed to set out a legal standard applicable to its conclusion on legitimate expectations, and provided no explanation or reasons on a number of important points, not least the substitution of its views on Spanish law for those adopted by the Spanish Supreme Court on the meaning and effect of RD 661/2007.\n\n3.\n\nIt is telling that the Majority devotes just a page of a 273-page Award to this central issue, and offers no real response to the points raised in this dissent (see Award, para. 491). The system of investor-State arbitration is a fragile creature, and one that attracts an increasingly critical eye. This Award \u2013 long on description of the Parties' arguments, short on scrutiny of the actual evidentiary record and reasoning as to the legal principles to be applied \u2013 will not enhance confidence in the system, or a sense of its legitimacy.\n\n**FACTS**\n---------\n\n4.\n\nThis case was brought by two Claimants, OperaFund Eco-Invest SICAV PLC (*OperaFund*), existing under the laws of the Republic of Malta, and Schwab Holding AG (*Schwab*), established under the laws of the Swiss Confederation. They made their investments in Spain in July 2008 and April 2009 respectively, in the renewable energy sector.1\n\nAward, paras. 2 & 173.\n\n5.\n\nThey did so in the context of global, regional and national efforts to address human-induced climate change, aimed at the reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide from the energy sector. Against the background of the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC, the European Union adopted legislation committing Member States, including Spain, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation included measures to encourage the use of renewable and other new technologies.\n\n6.\n\nIn November 1997 the European Commission published a White Paper on renewable energy, which set out a strategy and action plan to increase the share of renewables in the EU, to reach 12% of energy consumption.2 An EU Directive subsequently required EU Member States, including Spain, to set indicative national targets for electricity produced from renewable resources, in line with \"the global indicative target of 12% of gross national energy consumption by 2010 and in particular with the 22.1% indicative share of electricity produced from renewably energy sources in total Community electricity consumption by 2010.\"3 New targets were set in January 2007, aimed at further cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, improved energy efficiency, and at least a 20% share of energy consumption from renewables, all by 2020.4\n\n*Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy \u2013 White Paper for a Community Strategy and Action Plan*, COM(97)599 final (26/11/1997).\n\nDirective 2001/77/EC, on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market, Article 3(4).\n\nThese targets were enacted in EU Directive 2009/28/EC, which replaced the 2001 Directive. See Article 3(1).\n\n7.\n\nSpain adopted national rules to implement these EU requirements. In 1997 it passed legislation to achieve the goal that 12% of energy consumption should be from renewables by 2010,5 and introduced a \"special regime\" to remunerate qualifying renewable energy producers. Royal Decree (RD) 2818/1998 established a remuneration regime for the generation of electricity from renewables introducing a feed-in tariff for energy generated.6\n\nAct 54/1997 on the Electricity Sector, R-0059.\n\nRD 2818/1998, of 23 December, on the production of electrical energy by facilities supplies with renewable energy, waste or cogeneration resources or sources, R-0067.\n\n8.\n\nSix years later, RD 2818/1998 was replaced by RD 436/2004, to amend the previous system of subsidies, prices, incentives and methodology.7 Three years later, in 2007, RD 661/2007 was adopted, to replace RD 436/2004 with a different set of rules on tariffs.8 Within two years, amendments were then made to RD 661/2007, following the adoption of EU Directive 2009/28/EC. These were introduced, in part, to address a tariff deficit that had occurred as a result of the global financial crisis that took root in 2007, as well as the availability of new technologies.9 In 2010, Spain introduced further amendments to RD 661/2007, including reward limits on the quantity of electricity produced by photovoltaic plants and new tariff levels,10 and on the number of hours of operation,11 and seeking to avoid over-remuneration of existing investors.12 In 2014 a new energy regulation was adopted, entirely replacing the tariffs set in RD 661/2007.13\n\nRD 436/2004, dated 12 March, establishing the methodology for the updating and systematisation of the legal and economic regime for electric energy production in the special regime, R-0069.\n\nRD 661/2007, of 25 May, regulating the activity of electricity production under the special regime and the production of certain facilities with similar technologies under the ordinary regime, R-0071.\n\nRD-L 6/2009, of 30 April, adopting certain measures in the energy sector and approving the social tariff, R-0057.\n\nRD 1565/2010, of 19 November, which regulates and modifies certain aspects of the electricity production activities in the Special Regime, R-0074.\n\nRD 1614/2010, of 7 December, regulating and modifying certain aspects related to electric energy production using thermoelectric solar and wind power technologies, R-0075.\n\nRD-L 14/2010, of 23 December, establishing urgent measures to correct the tariff deficit in the electricity industry, R-0058.\n\nRD 413/2014, of 6 June, which regulates the electricity production activity from renewable energy sources, cogeneration and waste, R-0080.\n\n9.\n\nBetween 1994, when Spain first legislated to promote the use of renewable energy, and 2009, when both Claimants had made their first investment, the regulatory framework was changed on multiple occasions.14 The changes were prompted by a range of factors, including the desire to increase standards of environmental protection, make use of new and cheaper technologies, and reduce costs and budget deficits in the face of an unprecedented global financial crisis that began in the spring of 2008 and caused a contraction in Spain's economy of -3.6% in the GDP between 2008 and 2010.15\n\nMost of the sixteen items of legislation or regulation here listed were taken from the legal opinions the Claimants provided to the Tribunal, with an indication in italics of those that explicitly referred to changes. This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but to provide an overview of the legislative changes in that period:  \n1. RD 2366/1994, on the Production of Electrical Energy;  \n2. Act 40/1994, on the Organization of the National Electric System;  \n3. Act 54/1997, on the Electric Sector;  \n4. RD 2019/1997, organising and regulating the electric energy production market;  \n5. Ministerial Order, dated December 17, 1998, *modifying* the Order dated December 29, 1997, *developing* certain aspects of RD 2019/1997, organising and regulating the electric energy production market;   \n6. RD 1663/2000, on connection of photovoltaic facilities to the low voltage network;  \n7. RD 842/2002, *approving* the technical electric regulation for low voltage;  \n8. RD 1432/2002, establishing the method for approving or modifying the average or reference electricity tariff;  \n9. RD 436/2004, *establishing the method for updating and systematising the economic and legal framework* for the production of electric energy under the special regime;  \n10. RD 1454/2005, *modifying* certain dispositions related to the electric sector;  \n11. RD 1556/2005, *establishing* the electric tariff for 2006;  \n12. RD-Law 7/2006, *adopting urgent measures* in the energy sector;  \n13. RD 809/2006, which *revises* the electric tariff as of July 1, 2006;  \n14. RD 661/2007, by which the electricity production activity under the special regime is regulated;  \n15. Act 17/2007, which *adapts* Act 54/1997, on the electric sector to European Directive EC/2003/54, of the European Parliament and the Council, on common rules for the internal market; and  \n16. RD 1110/2007, approving the unified regulation on the power system measurement points.\n\nThese numbers are based on GDP growth data provided by the IMF. In 2009, Spain's GDP decreased by 3.6%. In 2010 no changes were registered and there were further contractions in 2011, 2012 and 2013 of 1%, 2.9% and 1.7% respectively.\n\n10.\n\nThis was the background against which the Claimants invested in two photovoltaic renewable energy projects, one in Majorca (the PASO Palma Sol Project), the other in Badajoz (the ECO 3 Project). The investments were made in the form of shares in special purpose vehicles (SPVs), which owned the PV installations in Spain, and participative loans granted to the SPVs. Both projects were developed in 2004, sponsored in part by Deutsche Bank, which subsequently provided loan finance to OperaFund and Schwab. Deutsche Bank lent \u20ac57.71 million to Paso Palma Sol (in which OperaFund held a 75% stake, and Schwab a 25% stake). For ECO 3, HSH Nordbank agreed to lent up to \u20ac66.95 million (OperaFund acquired a 100% equity stake in ECO 3 with third-party financing loans).16 For the Majorca Project, the funds provided by Deutsche Bank were granted as a loan facility with a repayment period of 22 years; for the Badajoz Project the repayment period was between 19-20 years, depending on the final amount.17\n\nBrattle Quantum Report, CER-2, paras. 26-30.\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits, para. 200; Common Terms of Agreement, 28 January 2009, C-0060; Facilities Agreement, 2 July 2008 C-0061.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimants' case is that they invested on the basis of an expectation that the tariff regime established by RD 661/2007 - which would *inter alia* give them a rate of return of 7.8% after tax \u2013 was immutable in relation to their investments, and that Spain subsequently altered the legal framework in such a manner as to frustrate that expectation by lowering the rate of return.\n\n**LAW**\n-------\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants' case is based on the interpretation and application of Article 10(1) ECT, on the promotion, protection and treatment of investments. This provides, in relevant part, that Spain was required to \"encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area\", and that such conditions included \"a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment.\"\n\n13.\n\nThe Majority concludes, at paragraphs 480 to 490 and paragraphs 508 to 513 of the Award, that the Respondent's regulatory changes made after 2008 violated Article 10, by infringing the Claimants' rights under the fair and equitable treatment (FET) standard. The Majority's finding is premised exclusively on an interpretation of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, to the effect that its terms gave rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of the Claimants that their investment would not be subject to regulatory change of the kind that later occurred (Award, para. 483-485). The Majority states that \"it is hard to imagine a more explicit stabilisation assurance than the one mentioned in Art. 44(3)\" (Award, para. 485). It finds that it \"does not see a lack of due diligence by the Claimants\" in relation to RD 661/2007 and its Article 44(3) (Award, para. 487).\n\n14.\n\nOn the basis of the law, the facts and the submissions on the record before the Tribunal, I consider these conclusions to be without foundation.18\n\nThis Dissent is based on the record in these proceedings and is limited to this Award. It expresses no view on other cases on which the evidentiary record may have been different.\n\n15.\n\nIn determining the principles to be applied to \"legitimate expectations\" as part of the FET standard in Article 10 ECT, and whether it has been breached, the Parties made submissions on a great number of arbitral awards. In reaching its conclusion the Majority offers no substantive assessment of that case-law, and no reasoning on the legal standard it has identified and then applied in reaching its conclusions.\n\n16.\n\nA starting point on the applicable legal standard is the proposition, which is reflected in the case-law, that a breach of the FET standard may be occasioned where legal and business stability, or the legal framework, has been altered in such a way as to frustrate legitimate and reasonable expectations or guarantees of stability.19 Correct as it may be, the proposition does not of itself offer the principles that fall to be applied in determining the source and scope of the Claimants' expectation, or the requirement that falls on an investor to establish that its expectation is based on some degree of due diligence.\n\nAward, para. 510.

The Claimants do not claim a contractual basis for their supposed expectation. Rather, their argument is that a legitimate expectation arose from \"specific guarantees in legislation\", namely Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007. The Majority treats the expectation as being derived exclusively from a general legislative act, a source of \"general application\" (para. 485). The proposition that an investor's expectation could be based on a specific guarantee in legislation is not of itself problematic.20 The problem is what Article 44(3) says and does not say.\n\n*Enron Corporation v Argentina* (Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, van den Berg, Tschanz), 22 May 2007, paras. 264-6. The point is also made in the award of *Antaris v Czech Republic* (Lord Collins, Born, Tomka), 2 May 2018, at paragraph 360 (Principle 4), but since that Award was not cited by either party, and since para. 360 purports to do no more than summarise the findings of earlier Awards, I place no reliance upon it in reaching my conclusions.\n\n18.\n\nArticle 44(3) of RD 661/2007 provides that \"*The revisions of the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated in this section shall not affect facilities for which the commissioning certificate had been granted prior to January 1 of the second year following the year in which the revision had been performed.*\" The Majority concludes that the Claimants' investments were made, between July 2008 and July 2009, in reliance on an expectation that they would, for decades, receive the economic rights provided by RD 661/2007, and that pursuant to its Article 44(3) those economics rights would \"not [be] subject to regulatory change\" (Award, para. 484). The Majority describes Article 44(3) as an \"explicit stabilisation assurance\" (para. 485). But is it?\n\n19.\n\nArticle 44(3) provides in terms that so long as RD 661/2007 remains in force, without amendment, the Claimants' returns would be based on that provision. In that limited sense, at least, Article 44(3) provides some degree of stability: so long as Article 44(3) and RD 661/2007 applied, the Claimants were entitled to receive the economic rights provided by the regulated tariff in accordance with that legislation. That, however, is not the end of the matter, since RD 661/2007, as a general legislative act, could in principle be amended or replaced. RD 661/2007 does not state in terms, or otherwise, that Article 44(3) could not be changed, or that it would not be changed, or that pre-existing rights would be grandfathered if the provision was repealed and replaced. Could Article 44(3) be amended or replaced? Could RD 661/2007 be repealed and replaced by a new Royal Decree, providing for a different tariff regime? Those questions are not addressed by RD 661/2007 itself. Moreover, the Majority has cited to no source or authority to support the proposition that Spain could not change the law, or that it ever said that Article 44(3) or RD 661/2007 could not be changed, or would not be changed. The Majority has read an immutability into the text of Article 44(3) that is simply not there. It has done so without reasoning.\n\n20.\n\nIn this regard, context is important. A reasonable and diligent investor would have been aware that the legal regime had recently changed, that earlier Royal Decrees had been changed: RD 661/2007 replaced RD 436/2004, which itself replaced RD 2818/1998. One might have thought that the regularity with which Royal Decrees were adopted and then replaced might cause a reasonable and diligent investor to take some steps to inform itself as to the risk of future changes. Indeed, the majority recognises, belatedly and in contradiction with its own conclusion, that \"[t]here is no dispute that the laws changed in the past and would change in the future\" (para. 486), although it provides no view as to which change would be permissible, and which would not. Yet the evidence makes clear that no due diligence was carried out on that vital point, and the Majority has pointed to none.\n\n21.\n\nSignificantly, the Spanish courts had addressed the question of immutability of tariffs and related regimes, and done so before the Claimants invested. In March 2007, for example, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled that there is no vested right to receive a specific subsidy in the future, instead only recognising that the law provides for a reasonable rate of return on investments.21 It gave further judgments to that effect on 3 December 2009 (ruling that RD 436/2004 did not provide for a freezing of the remuneration system, and modification of the system lay within the State's discretionary power);22 on 19 June 2012 (ruling that an obligation to offer a reasonable rate of return did not imply the continuance of a premium for the entire life of the facility, and amendments and adjustments were plausible and may be required);23 and on 25 June 2013 (ruling that the Government was not prevented from approving measures that altered the regime).24 On 21 January 2016 the Supreme Court went even further: it rejected the claim that the regime provided by RD 661/2007 extended indefinitely so as to apply a tariff regime forever, or that changes to the rates would undermine principles of legal security or legitimate expectations of an investor.25 The Majority passes in total silence on the substance of these judgments on Spanish law, taking refuge in the claim that they are of no relevance. In so doing, the Majority substitutes its interpretation of a Spanish Royal Decree \u2013 whether it provides an expectation \u2013 for that adopted by the Supreme Court, and it does so without explanation or reasoning.26 If an international arbitral tribunal is going to rule that a highest national court has got its own national law wrong \u2013 and done so on multiple occasions \u2013 it must at the very least provide an explanation, setting out why its view of Article 44(3) is to be preferred. The failure of the Majority to do so is grave.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 348 & 582; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 525; Claimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 198(iii); all discussing Judgment of the Supreme Court, 20 March 2007 (EDJ 2007/18059), R-0119; Judgment of the Supreme Court, 9 October 2007, R-0120. See also Article in CINCO DIAS: *\"The Supreme Court allows retroactive change in premiums\"* (22 April 2010), R-0210.\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court, 3 December 2009 (EDJ 2009/307349), R-0121.\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court, 19 June 2012 (EDJ 2012/124000), R-0127.\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court, 25 June 2013 (EDJ 2013/127521), R-0131.\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court, 21 January 2016 (appeal 627/2012), R-0135.\n\nThe Majority's approach to the Supreme Court appears somewhat quixotic, citing one decision (with apparent approval) in relation to the issue of 'transparency' (para. 526), whilst retaining a regrettable silence on this aspect of the case, taking refuge in the supposed irrelevance of the judgment of the highest court in Spain (para. 492).\n\n22.\n\nThe Majority is silent too on the relevant ICSID case-law, not least the jurisprudence which makes clear that \"provisions of *general* legislation applicable to a plurality of persons or a category of persons, do not create legitimate expectations that there will be no change in the law\".27 The Majority simply decides \u2013 *ex cathedra*, without reasoning \u2013 that the tariff regime of RD 661/2007 was immutable, that a provision of general application could not be replaced or changed so as to subject the Claimants' investments to a less favourable (yet still profitable) regime.\n\n*Philip Morris Brands SA\u0300RL v Uruguay* (Bernardini, Born, Crawford), 8 July 2016, para. 426.\n\n23.\n\nUnreasoned, the conclusion of the Majority on the interpretation of RD 661/2007 is apt to undermine the legitimacy of, and trust in, a system of investor-state arbitration which accords to international arbitrators a vital responsibility to exercise caution if they are going to substitute their views for those of a country's highest court. No doubt there are circumstances in which an international arbitral tribunal can tell a national court that it has got its own law wrong, but if it is going to follow that path it must provide full and complete reasons.\n\n*Due diligence*\n---------------\n\n24.\n\nMy conclusion on the interpretation of RD 661/2007 and its Article 44(3), which accords with the rulings of the Spanish Supreme Court, disposes of the matter. If RD 661/2007 did not provide for an immutable regime, there cannot be an expectation in this case that it did so. However, let us assume that the Spanish courts (and I) are wrong as to the proper interpretation of RD 661/2007 and Article 44(3), and that it did create an expectation that the tariff regime would not be changed in relation to the Claimants' investments. The ICSID authorities argued by the parties alone are not enough to get the Claimants home: the jurisprudence makes clear that the Claimants were required to demonstrate that they had engaged in a minimum exercise of due diligence to confirm their expectation had legs.\n\n25.\n\nAs noted above, the Majority asserts that it \"does not see a lack of due diligence by the Claimants\" (para. 487), but offers no reasoned explanation for that summary conclusion, and no reference to the abundance of evidence in the record to the contrary. It offers no indication as to the principles it applied in determining the extent of a due diligence exercise, and is silent on the jurisprudence as to the extent of due diligence that is required by an investor who claims a legitimate expectation on the basis of a law of general application, such as RD 661/2007.\n\n26.\n\nThe arbitral tribunal in *Philip Morris Brands SA\u0300RL v Uruguay* addressed the matter as follows: \"[g]iven the State's regulatory powers, in order to rely on legitimate expectations the investor should inquire in advance regarding the prospects of a change in the regulatory framework in light of the then prevailing or reasonably to be expected changes in the economic and social conditions of the host State.\"28\n\n*Philip Morris*, para. 427.\n\n27.\n\nThe obligation to \"inquire in advance\" is not a high standard, yet the record before the Tribunal shows that it is not one that the Claimants have met. Indeed, the evidence before the Tribunal shows that the Claimants made no inquiry at all in advance of their investments as to the prospects of RD 661/2007, or its Article 44(3), being changed. This is despite the fact, as noted, that by the time OperaFund and Schwab made their investments (July 2008 and April 2009 respectively):\n\n(i) RD 661/2007 had been preceded by a multitude of changes in the previous decade (and at least one of those acts, RD 436/2004, had an analogous \"stabilisation\" clause to Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007),29\n\n(ii) the Spanish Supreme Court had ruled in March 2007 that a Royal Decree could be changed, and there could be no expectation that it would not be,\n\n(iii) EU rules were known to be evolving, and\n\n(iv) a global financial crisis was underway.\n\nArticle 40.3 of RD 436/2004 reads: \"The tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from any of the revisions referred to in this section shall apply only to the facilities that became operational after the date of entry into force referred to in the preceding paragraph, without retroactivity to previous tariffs and premiums.\" For further analysis, see Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 511-515.\n\n28.\n\nAgainst this background, one might have thought that a reasonable and diligent investor would turn its mind to the possibility of yet another change in the regulatory framework, given the \"prevailing or reasonably to be expected changes in the economic and social conditions\" in Spain in 2008 and 2009. Such an investor would seek to inform itself as to the extent of the risk, including the possibility that the tariff regime provided for by Article 44(3) might be changed. Given that the risk was regulatory \u2013 did RD 661/2007 and/or Article 44(3) set in stone the tariff regime \u2013 a reasonable and diligent investor might have been expected to make an inquiry with an expert in Spanish law, a Spanish lawyer or law firm, perhaps.\n\n29.\n\nWhat did the Claimants do? Remarkably little, if anything, according to the evidentiary record. As confirmed in a post-hearing brief, the Claimants placed reliance on just two legal opinions. Both were offered by the Cuatrecasas law firm, and neither is helpful to the Claimants' case.30\n\nSchwab claimed that the Cuatrecasas' reports were confirmed to Claimants by another law firm as well as their project managers, but no documentary evidence was tendered in support of the contention. See: Transcript, Day 2, pg, 59, ln. 24 \u2013 pg. 60, ln. 17; pg. 66, ln. 2-11.\n\n30.\n\nThe two Cuatrecasas' legal opinions on which OperaFund and Schwab are said to have placed exclusive and complete reliance are:\n\n\u2022 a July 2006 report (\"*Opinion in the interest of Deutsche Bank \u2013 Applicable structure for PV projects in Spain*\"), which was issued before RD 661/2007 had even been contemplated;31 and\n\n\u2022 an October 2007 report (\"*Opinion in the interest of Deutsche Bank \u2013 Applicable structure for PV projects in Spain*\"), analysing the legal regime applicable to PASO and ECO 3, including certain aspects of RD 661/2007.32\n\n*Opinion in the interest of DEUTSCHE BANK \u2013 Applicable structure for PV projects in Spain*, July 2006, C-0211.\n\n*Opinion in the interest of DEUTSCHE BANK \u2013 Applicable structure for PV projects in Spain,* C-0095.\n\n31.\n\nThe two legal opinions are notable for reasons that are not helpful to the Claimants. First, they were addressed not to OperaFund and Schwab but to Deutsche Bank, who financed the investments. Second, both opinions contain a disclaimer, to the effect that they were produced \"for the exclusive use\" of Deutsche Bank, and could not be used \"by other persons\" without the prior written permission of Cuatrecasas33 (no such written permission was in evidence before the Tribunal). Third, and most significantly, the opinions say nothing about the risk of change to the regulatory framework of RD 661/2007. Section 11 of the first opinion is on \"Risks concerning legal modifications\", but it is concerned only with RD 436/2004 (and recognises a risk of change, which proved to be correct). The second opinion has no equivalent section, and is completely silent on risks of regulatory change to RD 661/2007; it expresses no opinion as to whether the framework set forth in RD 661/2007 could be relied upon for the life of the investments, or less, and makes no reference to Article 44(3), not even once. What the two Cuatrecasas' opinions do refer to is the fact of multiple prior changes, identifying no less than fourteen acts of legislation that have come and gone in the past decade.34 A reasonable reader would conclude that what has happened before \u2013 regulatory change \u2013 could happen again, as it did.\n\nC-0211, p. 25 & C-0095, p. 26.\n\nSee C-0095, pg. 3 & C-0211, pg. 3-4 and footnote 14 above.\n\n32.\n\nThis is the only evidence as to due diligence before the Tribunal, and the only evidence to which the Majority refers. Remarkably, the Majority asserts that \"Claimants' reliance on a legal opinion by Cuatrecasas was also sufficient at least in confirming their expectations, because the Tribunal cannot see what other better means of information they could have obtained than that provided by what seems to have been the most competent law firm for these matters in Spain\" (para. 487). It is astonishing that the Majority relies on the October 2007 Cuatrecasas' legal opinion as confirming the Claimants' \"expectations\" that they could rely on the tariff arrangements in RD 661/2007 without any risk of change. In that opinion Cuatrecasas offers no opinion on regulatory risks, does not mention Article 44(3), and says nothing to support the conclusion that the tariffs in force in 2008/9 were immutable for the Claimants. No other evidence on the record told the Claimants they could rely on the Article 44(3) regime for the life of their projects.\n\n33.\n\nIn the course of the hearing, witness testimony was given which confirmed that Deutsche Bank, the project sponsors and providers of loan finance to the Claimants, proceeded only on the basis of the regulatory framework set forth in RD 436/2004, which offered a less advantageous regime and rates of return, not RD 661/2007. Mr Bauermeister formerly a project manager with Deutsche Bank and now an executive board member of DeanSolar, involved in the technical and commercial management of PASO and ECO 3, who appeared as a fact witness for the Claimants, repeatedly stated that the investments in the PASO and ECO 3 projects were made on the basis of RD 436/2004, not RD 661/2007. \"436 was the major regulation for us, and 661 happened later\"35, he said in response to one question. In response to another, he confirmed that Deutsche Bank's involvement was not premised at all on RD 661/2007, or on any expectations in relation to the regulatory framework it provided: \"The expectation of Deutsche Bank, we were working with 436 as the basic decree.\"36 And then:\n\nArbitrator Sands: \"As your company proceeded to take the decisions to invest, did it proceed on the basis of the regulatory framework in RD 436? Was that the basis upon which the investments were made?\"   \nMr Bauermeister: \"436, yes.\"37\n\nTranscript, Day 2, pg. 25, ln. 3-5.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, pg. 26, ln. 1-3.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, pg. 24, ln. 15-19.\n\n34.\n\nThis evidence was not challenged, and it explains why the two Cuatrecasas legal opinions have nothing to say about any expectation as to stability that was said to be offered by RD 661/2007. It confirms that the two opinions were prepared for another purpose, and do not allow any reliance to be placed on them to establish any expectation of Deutsche Bank or the Claimants in relation to RD 661/2007. The testimony was not contradicted by Mr Kofmel, member of the executive board of Schwab, who stated that \"as far as future regulatory changes were concerned, I wasn't interested in those, because it was very clear to me that there would be no retroactivity as regards our investment.\"38 He did not identify any evidence to support that view. It seems there is none on the record, from which it can be inferred that none was given.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, pg. 73, ln. 1-4.\n\n35.\n\nIn sum, there is no evidence \u2013 none \u2013 in the record to show that OperaFund or Schwab were induced to make their investment by reliance upon Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, or that they carried out any exercise in due diligence that addressed future regulatory change, or that they ever received advice that there was no risk of regulatory change. In particular, there exists on the record:\n\n(i) no document prepared by Deutsche Bank or anyone else to the effect that the Claimants could rely on a representation in Article 44(3), or elsewhere, that there would or could be no change in the regulatory framework;\n\n(ii) no legal advice stating that Article 44(3) would or could not change, or lawfully be changed in accordance with Spanish law (or the Energy Charter Treaty); and\n\n(iii) no internal document of either OperaFund or Schwab to support the claim that either Claimant had the expectation that RD 661/2007 and/or Article 44(3) would or could not change in accordance with Spanish law (or the Energy Charter Treaty).\n\n36.\n\nThere is no evidence that the Claimants had an expectation, or that it was premised on any exercise of due diligence. I am unable to understand the basis for the contrary conclusion of the Majority. My co-arbitrators have pointed to no evidence to show that Claimants conducted any sort of due diligence with regard to the risk of changes in the regulatory framework offered by RD 661/2007. The absence of such a due diligence, and the failure of it to produce confirmation of the existence of an expectation on which the Majority finds the Claimants to have relied, makes clear the conclusion that there was no basis for such an expectation.\n\n37.\n\nA proper and reasonable assessment of evidence is a part of the judicial and arbitral function, a part of the reasoning process. A conclusion that is not based on actual evidence is not a reasoned conclusion, unless the evidence is irrelevant, which is not what the Majority concludes. The assessment of evidence is a time consuming exercise, and it may lead to different conclusion for cases that are based on a similar fact matrix. An arbitral award must be based on the evidence that is actually before the Tribunal. In this case the evidence cannot be said to be open to interpretation, it is incontrovertible. There is no evidence to show that the Claimants were induced to make their investments on the basis of a representation made by or attributable to the Respondent that they could rely on the tariff regime applicable at the time the investments were made for the life of those investments. There is no evidence to show that the Claimants engaged in an exercise of due diligence to address the risk of regulatory change. There is no evidence to show that the Claimants sought or obtained advice on the risk of regulatory change. The conclusions of the Majority to the contrary are entirely unsupported by any evidence before the Tribunal and, in this way, bereft of reasons.\n\n*Rates of return*\n-----------------\n\n38.\n\nNo doubt the measures adopted by the Respondent between 2010 and 2014 affected the extent of the economic returns generated by the investments. In the face of the global financial crisis, the reality and consequences of which were not challenged, the Respondent was bound to act to limit an economic crisis and reduce a burgeoning budget deficit. It did so by reducing the rate of return on the Claimants' investments, from 7.8% to 6.1% (or 5.7% on the Claimants' case) after tax. The plants were still profitable, but they were less profitable. The rate of return granted by Spain was, nonetheless, still aligned with those granted by other European Union Member States.39\n\nSuch as France, Italy, Estonia and Latvia. See: *Decision of the European Commission C(2017) 7384 final \u2013 State aid SA.40348 (2015/NN) \u2013 Spain, Support for electricity generation from renewable energy sources, cogeneration and* waste, 10 November 2017, RL-0080, para. 120.\n\n39.\n\nGiven the circumstances faced by Spain, the change that occurred did not \"exceed the exercise of the host State's normal regulatory power in the pursuance of a public interest\", and it did not \"modify the regulatory framework relied upon by the investor at the time of its investment outside the acceptable margin of change.\"40 The Respondent was faced with a delicate balancing act: it had to reduce public expenditures without imposing excessive burdens on consumers of electricity and citizens, while at the same time continuing to encourage environmental protection and the renewable energy sector, and protecting the legitimate rights of existing investors in the sector.\n\n*Philip Morris*, 8 July 2016, para. 388 (recognising a \"margin of appreciation enjoyed by national regulatory agencies when dealing with public policy determinations.\") and para. 423.\n\n40.\n\nThe case-law turns its back on the kind of absolute immutability embraced by the Majority, making clear, that \"the requirements of legitimate expectations and legal stability as manifestations of the FET standard do not affect the State's rights to exercise its sovereign authority to legislate and to adapt its legal system to changing circumstances\".41 The case-law confirms that Spain was not required to elevate the interests of the investors above all other considerations; the application of the FET standard allows for a balancing exercise by the State.42\n\n*Philip Morris*, para. 422.\n\n*Saluka Investments B.V. v Czech Republic* (Watts, Fortier, Behrens), 17 March 2006, paras. 305-306; *Electrabel SA v Hungary* (Veeder, Kaufmann-Kohler, Stern), 25 November 2015, para. 165.\n\n41.\n\nThe path taken by Spain was the subject of consideration and consultation. No doubt a range of alternative options were available to it. The Respondent might have decided to sacrifice the Claimants' investments, or it might have decided to protect the Claimants' economic returns and profitability and imposed greater costs on electricity consumers, or on the public purse, knowing that such an approach risked exacerbating the economic crisis. It chose neither path, opting instead for something of a middle course, a revised and reduced rate of economic return that nevertheless fell within parameters, accepted and approved by the European Commission.43\n\n*Decision of the European Commission 10.11.2017 C(2017) 7384 final*, RL-0080, para. 120. See also: *Response from the European Commission on Petition No 2520/2014 on the situation of the photovoltaic sector and the legality of the changes made to the law by the Spanish government*, R-0160; Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 326-329.\n\n42.\n\nIn short, the Claimants were not deprived of their investments, although the income generated by them was reduced. That reduction fell within \"the acceptable margin of change\"; against the background of the economic and environmental challenges faced by Spain, and the generous rates of return offered by RD 661/2007, which created a bubble of great profitability for investors, Spain opted instead for a balanced approach. I accept the conclusions of the Respondent's experts: \"imagining that what was originally considered to be reasonable was 7% we would contend that this 1% difference falls within a very reasonable level of discretion or consideration of the regulator of whatever new economic factors occur in the market that the regulator has to regulate.\"44\n\nTranscript, Day 4, pg. 188, ln. 10-15.\n\n43.\n\nAccordingly, I do not concur with the Majority's conclusion that Spain breached its obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT to provide fundamental stability of the economic and legal regime in place, or that it is liable for any damages, or that it should pay any of the costs of this arbitration or the Claimants' costs. Nor am I able to accept, as the Majority puts it, that the FET requirement of Article 10 ECT protects against changes in the \"essential characteristics of the regulatory regime relied upon by investors\", and that those \"essential characteristics\" were altered (paras. 508, 513). It is notable that the Majority's conclusion is premised on the supposed reliance and \"expectations\" of the Claimants in relation to RD 661/2007 (paras. 512-13), a conclusion that is entirely unsupported by the evidence in the record.\n\n44.\n\nIn the absence of evidence, the decision of the Majority will be seen as prioritising the interests of foreign investors over and above the interests of all other social actors. That it does so in the face of the evidentiary record before the Tribunal is a matter of considerable concern. The Majority has treated the ECT rules on FET as being akin to an insurance mechanism, one that allows the Claimants to benefit from a regulatory framework that was widely seen to be generous in creating windfall profits in the face of an unprecedented economic crisis and historically low rates of interest.45 Mr Caldwell, the expert witness tendered by Claimants, in effect confirmed that an immutable, high rate of return coupled with unexpected and historically low interest rates resulted in a windfall for an investor with which the State was stuck.46 His answer seems wholly unrealistic, in a real world in which governments seek to balance the demands of competing interests. It is also unsupported by the case-law, which confirms that in the absence of a specific promise or representation made by the State to the investor, \"the latter may not rely on a bilateral investment treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the risk of any changes in the host State's legal and economic framework\".47 The expectation of an immutable rate of return identified by the Majority is not supported by the evidence or the case-law. It is an approach that is neither legitimate nor reasonable.48\n\nFor effects of excessive tariffs, see for example: Mahalingam, A. & Reiner, D.M.: *Energy subsidies at times of economic crisis: A comparative study and scenario analysis of Italy and Spain,* Energy Policy Research Group -Working Paper, 23 January 2016, retrieved at: https://www.eprg.group.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1603- PDF.pdf ; *New York Times - Spain's Solar Market Crash Offers a Cautionary Tale About Feed-In Tariffs,* 18 August 2009, retrieved at: https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/gwire/2009/08/18/18greenwire-spains-solar- market-crash-offers-a-cautionary-88308.html?pagewanted=1 ; *Financial Times - Shadow Falls Across Spanish Solar Energy Industry,* 31 May 2010, retrieved at: https://www.ft.com/content/275db4d0-6cdf-11df-91c8-00144feab49a.\n\nTranscript, Day 4, pg. 107, ln. 22 - pg.108, ln. 7.\n\n*Philip Morris*, para. 423-424, citing to: *EDF (Services) Ltd v Romania* (Bernardini, Derains, Rovine), 8 October 2009, para. 219.\n\n*Philip Morris*, para. 424 (*Antaris*, Principle 10).\n\n**A concluding matter**\n-----------------------\n\n45.\n\nBy way of conclusion, I wish to raise a final point of concern. It arises in relation to the Claimants' supposed exercise in due diligence, as noted above, and reliance said to have been placed on the two legal opinions prepared by the Cuatrecasas law firm. The opinions were prepared in 2006 and 2007 for Deutsche Bank, the project sponsors, who were at the time advised by the law firm. Cuatrecasas subsequently represented the Claimants in these proceedings, notwithstanding the apparently different legal interests and arguments of Deutsche Bank (as noted above, Deutsche Bank relied on RD 436/2004, whereas Claimants argued they relied on RD 661/2007). Claimants' repayment period of 22 years of the debt owed to Deutsche Bank has not yet expired.\n\n46.\n\nIn the course of the hearing Cuatrecasas sought to defend the legal opinions it wrote in 2006 and 2007. As noted, those legal opinions went to the heart of the due diligence issue, and offered no assurance \u2013 or even a view \u2013 as to risk of future regulatory changes in relation to RD 661/2007. Yet in legal submission Cuatrecasas sought to persuade the Tribunal that the legal opinions it wrote for Deutsche Bank \u2013 which testified before the Tribunal that it placed reliance on RD 436/2004 \u2013 could be relied upon by two other clients for an entirely different purpose, namely to establish reliance on a different regulatory framework (RD 661/2007) and the conduct of a proper exercise in due diligence.\n\n47.\n\nThis was doubly unfortunate. First, it is generally accepted that a witness (or potential witness) in legal proceedings should not also act as counsel in the same proceedings, yet Cuatrecasas made submissions on two legal opinions it had prepared, when it could have been giving witness testimony on the preparation of those opinions. Second, the avoidance of an actual or potential conflict of interest (Cuatrecasas' duty as adviser to Deutsche Bank is to be treated as distinct from its duty as counsel to the Claimants in these proceedings) is a necessary pre-requisite to confidence in the legitimacy of a legal order. The revolving door that seemed to operate in this case, between the bank that lent and the investors who borrowed, on the one hand, and the law firm that advised both, on the other, will hardly enhance public perceptions as to the legitimacy of the system of investor-state arbitration. If the system of investor-State arbitration is to retain \u2013 or, in the views of some, regain \u2013 its legitimacy, it is imperative that the very strictest standards are applied in the quest to avoid perceptions of conflict."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**FREQUENTLY USED ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Short Form** | **Long Title** |\n| \u00a7 / \u00a7\u00a7 | paragraph / paragraphs |\n| ABV | Asset Based Valuation |\n| Act 2/2011 | Act 2/2011, of 4 March, on Sustainable Economy [C-0115] / [R-0045] |\n| Act 3/2013 | Act 3/2013, of 4 June, on the creation of the CNMC, BOE, 5 June 2013 [C-0043] / [R-0046] |\n| Act 14/2000 | Act 14/2000, of 29 December, on fiscal, administrative and social order measures [C-0062] |\n| Act 15/2012 | Act 15/2012, of 27 December, on Fiscal Measures for Energetic Sustainability [C-0112] / [R-0003] |\n| Act 17/2007 | Act 17/2007, of 4 July 2007, modifying Act 54/1997 for adaptation thereof in accordance with the provisions of Directive 2003/54/EC, of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 26 June 2003, concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity [C-0299] |\n| Act 17/2012 | Act 17/2012, of 27 December, on the General State Budgets for 2013, Fifth Additional Provision [R-0023] / [R-0246] |\n| Act 19/2013 | Act 19/2013, of 9 December, of transparency, access to public information and good governance, BOE, 10 December 2013 [C-0152] |\n| Act 24/2013 | Act 24/2013, of 26 December, on the Electric Power Sector [C-0116] / [R-0047] (also referred to as \"EPA 2013\" in pleadings) |\n| Act 40/1994 | Act 40/1994, of 30 December, on the Organization of the National Electric System [C-0053] / [R-0037] |\n| Act 47/2003 | Act 47/2003, of 26 November, on General Budgets [R-0024] |\n| Act 54/1997 | Act 54/1997, of 27 November, on the Electricity Sector (\"Electrical Power Act\") [C-0055bis] / [R-0059] (also referred to as \"EPA 1997\" and \"LSE 1997\" in pleadings) |\n| Act 58/2003 | Act 58/2003, of 17 December, on General Taxation [R-0006] |\n| AEE | Asociaci\u00f3n Empresarial E\u00f3lica |\n| APPA | Association of Renewable Energy Producers |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of 10 April 2006 |\n| ASIF | Photovoltaic Industry Association |\n| BCG | Boston Consulting Group |\n| BIT | Bilateral Investment Treaty |\n| C.Costs-I | Claimants' Statement of Costs (18 October 2018) |\n| C.Costs-II | Claimants' Reply Submission on Costs (25 October 2018) |\n| C-# | Claimants' Exhibit |\n| C-I | Claimants' Memorial on the Merits (27 October 2016) |\n| C-II | Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdictional Objections (30 November 2017) |\n| C-III | Claimants' Reply on the Merits (Corrected Version) (19 December 2017) |\n| C-IV | Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (27 April 2018) |\n| CER-# | Claimants' Expert Report |\n| CLA-# | Claimants' Legal Exhibit |\n| CNE | Spain's National Energy Commission (Until June 2013) |\n| CNMC | National Markets and Competition Commission, successor entity to CNE |\n| CPHB-I | Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief (27 August 2018) |\n| CPHB-II | Claimants' Rebuttal Post-Hearing Brief (4 October 2018) |\n| CPI | Consumer Price Index |\n| CWS-# | Claimants' Witness Statement |\n| DBAFL | Deutsche Bank AG, Asset Finance & Leasing Renewable Energies |\n| EC | European Commission |\n| EC Amicus | European Commission *Amicus Curiae* Brief (29 September 2017) |\n| EC Application | European Commission's Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party (16 January 2017) |\n| ECO 3 | Ecoinversi\u00f3n en Extremadura 3, S.L. |\n| EU | European Union |\n| FIT | Feed-in Tariff |\n| FMV | Fair Market Value |\n| IDAE | Institute for Energy Diversification and Savings |\n| IFIC | International Feed-in Cooperation |\n| ILC Draft Articles | ILC's Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts |\n| kWh | Kilowatt-hour |\n| LSE | Act 54/1997 |\n| Majorca SPVs | Paso-Palma Sol's 24 wholly-owned operating subsidiaries |\n| MCPS | Most Constant Protection and Security |\n| MINETUR | Ministry of Industry, Energy, Tourism |\n| MO HAP/703/2013 | Ministerial Order HAP/703/2013, of 29 April, which approves Form 583 \"Tax on the value of the production of electrical energy.

THE TRIBUNAL'S TERMINOLOGY AND REASONING**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully examined all the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties throughout these proceedings. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to reiterate in this Award all such arguments or evidence, which are well-known to the Parties. Further, insofar as any matter has not been specifically identified or recorded in the body of this Award, this does not mean that it has not been taken into full consideration. The Tribunal discusses only those submissions which it considers most relevant for its decisions. The Tribunal's reasons, without repeating all the arguments advanced by the Parties, address what the Tribunal considers to be the determinative factors required to decide on the Requests of the Parties.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal's use of one Party's terminology is without prejudice and in no way reflects the Tribunal's understanding of a particular issue. Rather, effort has been made to use consistent terminology throughout this Award to facilitate understanding. Likewise, the order in which the references are presented is not a reflection of a source's value in the eyes of the Tribunal. Instead, effort has been made to format the footnotes consistently and to cite all documents referenced by the Parties.\n\n**II. THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n-----------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 23 October 2015, Claimants proposed the appointment of Prof. Dr. August Reinisch as arbitrator. He accepted the appointment on 30 October 2015 and ICSID notified the Parties of his acceptance of this appointment on 2 November 2015. His contact details are as follows:\n\nProf. MMag. Dr. August Reinisch, LL.M.  \nDepartment of European, International and Comparative Law   \nSection of International Law and International Relations   \nUniversity of Vienna  \nSchottenbastei 10-16  \nA-1010 Vienna  \nAustria  \nTel.: +43 1-4277/35307  \nFax: +43 1-4277/9353  \nEmail: august.reinisch@univie.ac.at\n\n7.\n\nOn 23 October 2015, Claimants informed the ICSID Secretariat that, since more than 60 days had elapsed since the date of registration of the Request for Arbitration (\"RfA\"), Claimants confirmed that they opt for the formula provided in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention to have the Tribunal constituted as soon as possible. Claimants proposed the appointment of Mr. Gary B. Born as President of the Tribunal. ICSID invited Respondent's response to this proposal on the same day.\n\n8.\n\nOn 13 November 2015, Respondent opposed the appointment of Mr. Born as President of the Tribunal and proposed the appointment of Prof. Philippe Sands QC (British / French) as arbitrator. ICSID notified the Parties of Prof. Sands's acceptance of this appointment on 25 November 2015. Prof. Sands's contact details are as follows:\n\nProf. Philippe Sands QC  \nMatrix Chambers  \nGriffin Building  \nGray's Inn  \nLondon, WC1R 5LN  \nUnited Kingdom  \nPhone: +44 20 7404 3447  \nFax: +44 20 7404 3448  \nEmail: philippesands@matrixlaw.co.uk\n\n9.\n\nOn 18 December 2015, Counsel for the Parties sent the ICSID Secretariat the Parties' agreed method of appointment of the Presiding Arbitrator. On 21 and 22 December 2015, Claimants and Respondent respectively agreed to the ballot procedure proposed by ICSID to select a Tribunal President. On 4 February 2016, Claimants informed the Tribunal that the Parties had not agreed on a Tribunal President and requested the ICSID Secretary General to appoint the presiding arbitrator in accordance with sections 2(b) and 2(c) of the Parties' Agreement on the Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. On 10 March 2016, ICSID proposed a ballot of five (5) candidates for appointment as President of the Tribunal. On 17 March 2016, after receiving ballots from the Parties, ICSID informed the Parties of the results of the Parties' ballot procedure to elect a President. The Parties elected Prof. Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel (German). Prof. B\u00f6ckstiegel's contact details are as follows:\n\nProf. Dr. Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel  \nParkstr. 38  \nD-51427 Bergisch Gladbach, Germany  \nTel.: +49 (0)2204 66268  \nFax: +49 (0)2204 21812  \nEmail: kh@khboeckstiegel.com\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n10.\n\nClaimants filed their RfA against the Kingdom of Spain on 31 July 2015. This was supplemented by a further communication on 10 August 2015.\n\n11.\n\nICSID registered the RfA, as supplemented, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention on 11 August 2015.\n\n12.\n\nOn 4 August 2015, ICSID confirmed receipt of the RfA and transmitted the same, together with all accompanying exhibits and authorities, to Respondent.\n\n13.\n\nOn 23 October 2015, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr. Francisco Grob, a Chilean lawyer who joined the ICSID Secretariat in April 2015, would be assisting in this case. ICSID informed the Parties that, although Mr. Grob assisted the law firm Herbert Smith Freehills in a non-ICSID arbitration against the Kingdom of Spain during his August 2014 \u2013 February 2015 internship, Mr. Grob's role, access to the file, and participation was limited. ICSID informed the Parties that it has no concerns about Mr. Grob's impartiality and independence.\n\n14.\n\nOn 1 April 2016, the ICSID Secretariat requested that the Parties make their advance payments, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3).\n\n15.\n\nOn 6 April 2016, the Tribunal proposed that the First Session be held by teleconference.\n\n16.\n\nOn 14 April 2016, following the Parties' respective communications of 13 and 14 April and after confirming the availability of the Parties, the Tribunal decided to schedule its first session for 24 May 2016. The Tribunal provided the Parties a draft of Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO-1\") and invited them to liaise regarding the draft and to submit their proposals by 2 May 2016.\n\n17.\n\nAfter the Tribunal invited the Parties to liaise regarding draft PO-1, including the timetable, the Parties agreed to amendments to the draft and submitted these to the Tribunal on 29 April 2016.\n\n18.\n\nOn 29 April 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had reached agreement on some parts of PO-1, but that their discussions regarding the procedural calendar were ongoing.\n\n19.\n\nOn 9 May 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they reached agreement on the procedural calendar contained in PO-1, Annex A.\n\n20.\n\nOn 19 May 2016, the Tribunal circulated an agenda for this meeting and a list of attendees to the Parties. The first session of the Tribunal with representatives of the Parties was held on 24 May 2016, by way of teleconference that was recorded. The Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that they had no objection to the appointment of any member of the Tribunal.\n\n21.\n\nOn 27 May 2016, Claimants reported to the Tribunal that the Parties have agreed that non-disputing parties (1) shall be subject to the Tribunal's determination as to costs and (2) shall bear their own costs in any case, but that disagreement as to the proposed Article 9.5 regarding the payment of a costs advance by a non-disputing party remained. Claimants also alleged that Respondent and the European Commission (\"EC\") were coordinating in this and other proceedings and, thus, the EC cannot be considered a true *amicus curiae* or non-disputing party.\n\n22.\n\nOn 2 June 2016, Respondents rejected the allegation of coordination between Respondent and the EC. Respondent also objected to a requirement to require *amicus* to pay any advance.\n\n23.\n\nOn 7 June 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on the Tribunal draft of PO-1 by 13 June 2016.\n\n24.\n\nOn 13 June 2016, Claimants submitted that the Draft PO-1 is in conformity with the points discussed at the First Session of 24 May 2016. In addition, Claimants forwarded the EC's Decision of 13 April 2016 to the Tribunal, which Claimants alleged served as further evidence that the EC had already decided to intervene in the present case. Respondent did not submit further comments on the draft.\n\n25.\n\nOn 14 June 2016, the ICSID Secretariat transmitted Claimants' comments (13 June 2016) regarding the Draft PO-1 to the Tribunal.\n\n26.\n\nOn 20 June 2016, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO-1\")** and transmitted the same to the Parties.\n\n27.\n\nOn 27 October 2016, Claimants submitted (1) their Memorial on the Merits (\"C-I\"), (2) Exhibits C-0041 \u2013 C-0214, (3) Legal Authorities CL-0001 to CL-0146, (4) Expert Reports from the Brattle Group with corresponding exhibits, and (5) the Witness Statement of Mr. Lars Bauermeister with corresponding exhibits, to the Tribunal. ICSID acknowledged their 8 November 2016 receipt of these on 11 November 2016.\n\n28.\n\nOn 16 January 2017, the EC filed its Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party (\"EC Application\"). ICSID confirmed receipt on 17 January 2017.\n\n29.\n\nOn 23 January 2017, the Tribunal forwarded the EC's Application to the Parties. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), the Tribunal indicated that it would invite the Parties to provide their observations on the EC's Application following the Tribunal's receipt of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial.\n\n30.\n\nOn 10 March 2017, Respondent submitted its (1) Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction (\"R-I\"), (2) Witness Statement of Mr. Carlos Montoya (9 March 2017), (3) Expert Report of Accuracy (10 March 2017), and (4) Exhibits R-0001 \u2013 R-0232 to the Tribunal.\n\n31.\n\nOn 8 May 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide their observations to the EC's Application, by 22 May 2017.\n\n32.\n\nOn 18 May 2017 and without copying the Tribunal, the Parties exchanged their responses to the other side's objections to produce.\n\n33.\n\nOn 22 May 2017, the Parties submitted their observations on the EC's Application.\n\n34.\n\nOn 23 May 2017, the Parties wrote to the Tribunal to report their agreement that their Observations to the EC's Application would be submitted solely in English.\n\n35.\n\nOn 13 June 2017, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 2 (\"PO-2\") Regarding the EC Application to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party**, sending it to the Parties and the EC.\n\n36.\n\nOn 13 June 2017, Respondent filed its Responses to Claimants' Objections to Respondent's Requests to Produce.\n\n37.\n\nOn 13 June 2017, Claimants filed their Request to Produce, containing their Responses to the Objections raised by the Respondent, together with five additional exhibits.\n\n38.\n\nOn 15 June 2017, Claimants wrote to the Tribunal and objected to Sections 8.7 \u2013 8.9 of PO-2 and requested further elaboration on the Tribunal's decision to allow the EC to attend the Hearing, notwithstanding Claimants' objection.\n\n39.\n\nOn 19 June 2017, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of Claimants' 15 June 2017 letter and invited Respondent to submit any comments that it may have thereon by 22 June 2017.\n\n40.\n\nOn 23 June 2017, Respondent offered its comments regarding the potential value of the EC's intervention as *amicus curiae*.\n\n41.\n\nOn 26 June 2017, the Tribunal responded to the Parties and explained that, if the Tribunal considered that it would be assisted by the third party's attendance and availability to provide explanations and answers to questions of the Tribunal at the Hearing, the Tribunal was authorized to fulfill that purpose of Article 37(2).\n\n42.\n\nOn 30 June 2017, the Parties, having not agreed on the documents to be disclosed to the EC to enable the EC to file its *amicus* submission, filed their respective comments with the Tribunal.\n\n43.\n\nOn 10 July 2017, the Tribunal proposed the appointment of Dr. Katherine Simpson as Tribunal Assistant and sent her CV and Declaration of Independence to the Parties for their consideration. The Tribunal requested that the Parties submit any comments regarding Dr. Simpson's appointment by 13 July 2017.\n\n44.\n\nOn 11 July 2017, the Tribunal, taking note of the comments received from the Parties regarding PO-2 \u00a7 8.3, ordered the disclosure to the EC of limited documents or paragraphs thereof to enable the EC to complete its *amicus* submission. This exception to the duty of confidentiality was justified to fulfill the purpose of Article 37(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Further, the Tribunal ordered the EC to file its submission electronically and in hard copy by 29 September 2017, so as to enable Claimants to comment on the EC's submission in their next memorial, due on 30 November 2017.\n\n45.\n\nOn 18 July 2017, the Tribunal noted that the Parties had no objections and appointed Dr. Katherine Simpson as Tribunal Assistant. In response to Claimants' reference to the ICC Note on such appointments, the Tribunal indicated that, while it had no problem with the description of the function in that Note, it did not consider it appropriate to include such rules of another arbitration institution in its procedural provisions. The Tribunal explained that ICSID practice was capable and sufficient to assure that Tribunal Assistants were not authorized for activities that were exclusively reserved for the arbitrators.\n\n46.\n\nOn 26 July 2017, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 3 (\"PO-3\") Regarding Production of Documents**, attaching the Redfern Schedules thereto as Annexes A and B.\n\n47.\n\nOn 29 September 2017, the EC submitted its Amicus Curiae Brief to the Tribunal.\n\n48.\n\nOn 13 November 2017, Claimants filed \"Claimants' Application on Respondent's Non Compliance with Procedural Order No. 3\" with the Tribunal.\n\n49.\n\nOn 30 November 2017, Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdictional Objections (\"C-II\").\n\n50.\n\nOn 14 December 2017, Claimants submitted their Reply on the Merits to the Tribunal.\n\n51.\n\nOn 18 December 2017, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to extend Claimants' deadline for submitting the Spanish translation of the Reply on the Merits and accompanying documents to 15 January 2018, and to extend Respondent's deadline for submitting its Rejoinder on the Merits until 2 March 2018.\n\n52.\n\nOn 19 December 2017, Claimants submitted their corrected Reply on the Merits (\"C-III\"), together with an *errata* mark-up. On the same day, the Tribunal approved the Parties' agreement to extend the deadlines for the Claimants' submission of the Spanish translation of their Reply on the Merits and accompanying documents (to 15 January 2018) and for Respondent's submission of its Rejoinder on the Merits (to 2 March 2018).\n\n53.\n\nOn 17 January 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to extend the deadlines for the submission of Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction to 2 March 2018 and of Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction to 23 April 2018. The Tribunal agreed to this modification on 7 February 2018.\n\n54.\n\nOn 20 February 2018, the Parties requested to extend the deadlines for the submission of Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction to 9 March 2018, and on Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction to 30 April 2018. The Tribunal agreed to this further extension on 21 February 2018.\n\n55.\n\nOn 27 February 2018, Claimants requested to place the Award rendered in the SCC Arbitration (2015/063) *Novenergia II \u2013 Energy & Environment (SCA) (Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, SICAR v. The Kingdom of Spain* dated 15 February 2018 (\"*Novenergia* Award\") in the record. On the same day, Respondent requested an additional 5 days to respond to Claimants' request. The Tribunal granted Respondent's request and invited Respondent to submit its comments by 7 March 2018.\n\n56.\n\nOn 9 March 2018, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits (\"R-II\"), in Spanish.\n\n57.\n\nOn 10 March 2018, Claimants requested the opportunity to respond to Respondent's comments of 7 March 2018. The following day, the Tribunal granted the Claimants' request and invited their submission by 14 March 2018.\n\n58.\n\nOn 12 March 2018, Claimants submitted their comments on Respondent's submission of 7 March 2018. Respondent requested the Tribunal's consent that Respondent briefly reply to them.\n\n59.\n\nOn 12 March 2018, Respondents submitted corrections to the Rejoinder on the Merits (Spanish version) and requested permission to upload final versions of the exhibit lists to BOX.\n\n60.\n\nOn 14 March 2018, Respondent submitted its comments on Claimants' request to introduce the *Novenergia* Award.\n\n61.\n\nOn 17 March 2018, the Tribunal decided to admit the *Novenergia* Award, ordering Claimants to submit the Award with a new exhibit number to be admitted to the file in these proceedings. The Tribunal also invited the Parties to submit their Notifications of Witnesses and Experts they wish to examine at the Hearing by 11 May 2018.\n\n62.\n\nOn 23 April 2018, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to correct clerical errors in its submission of 9 March 2018, such that they could be considered during Hearing preparation.\n\n63.\n\nOn 25 April 2018, by simultaneous submission, the Parties informed the Tribunal that the Hearing could be held exclusively during the week starting 11 June 2018 and requested that the Tribunal cancel the booking of the World Bank's facilities in Paris for the second week (beginning 18 June 2018). The Tribunal informed the Parties of its agreement with the Parties' proposals on the following day. The Tribunal also advised that it would send the Parties a draft procedural order concerning the details of the Hearing.\n\n64.\n\nOn 27 April 2018, Respondent replied to the Tribunal's letter of 23 April 2018 that it would send a revised pleading the following week.\n\n65.\n\nOn 27 April 2018, Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (\"C-IV\").\n\n66.\n\nOn 4 May 2018, the Tribunal sent the Parties its draft of Procedural Order No. 4 Regarding the Details of the Hearing, for their review and comment by 11 May 2018.\n\n67.\n\nOn 8 May 2018, the Parties jointly requested that the Tribunal accept Witness Notifications on 10 May, the responses to the draft PO-4 on 14 May, and to schedule the Pre-Hearing teleconference for 28 or 29 May.\n\n68.\n\nOn 10 May 2018, the Parties submitted their Witness Notifications.\n\n69.\n\nOn 14 May 2018, the Parties submitted their comments to the draft of PO-4 and their proposed Hearing agendas to the Tribunal.\n\n70.\n\nOn 16 May 2018, the EC requested leave from the Tribunal to submit an update to its written observations, in light of the recent judgment of the CJEU in the Case C-284/16 *Achmea v.

The Chairman invited the Parties' representatives to confer with Dr. Simpson and Mr. Grob regarding these issues, after Opening Statements. At this meeting, the Party representatives agreed to proceed with the Hearing, with Respondent agreeing to strike from the record any new document to which Claimants object, and Claimants agreeing to use the previously submitted joint USB while reserving the right to object to the use of any potentially new document contained therein in cross examination. The Parties further agreed to submit a new, corrected Joint USB to the Tribunal following the Hearing. This agreement was memorialized in Procedural Order No. 6.\n\nOn 18 June 2018, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 6 (\"PO-6\") Regarding the Procedure After the Hearing**. In addition to setting a timetable for the further submissions, PO-6 ruled as follows:\n\n*2.1 By 27 August, 2018, the Parties shall simultaneously submit the English-language version of their Post-Hearing Briefs, Limited to a maximum of 50 pages (double-spaced) in length and in font Times New Roman 12, containing the following: 2.1.1. Any comments they have regarding issues raised at the Hearing;*\n\n*2.1.2. In separate sections of the brief, any comments the Parties have regarding each of the following questions of the Tribunal (which are without prejudice as to the final relevance given by the Tribunal to such questions and the comments received):*\n\n*a) What, if any, is the application and effect in this case, situated as it is in the field of environmental protection, of the \"* margin of appreciation enjoyed by national regulatory agencies when dealing with public policy determinations *\" (ICSID Case No. ARB 10/7,* Philip Morris v Uruguay*, Award, 8 July 2016, \u00a7 388**, [CL-0178]). [sic \u2013 RL-0088]*\n\n*b) In a short chart, the Parties are invited to identify what they consider to be, in comparison to the present case, the common denominators and main differences of the factual and legal background in the following cases:*\n\n*-* Charanne B.V. and Construction Investments S.A.R.L. v. Kingdom of Spain *(SCC Case 062/2012), Final Award, January 21, 2016**, and dissenting opinion by Prof. Guido S.

Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1, Award, 16 May 2018* *[CL-0220].*\n\n*c) What, if any, is the stand-alone impact of (1) Royal Decree 1565/2010 and Royal Decree Law 14/2010 (considered together), (2) Law 15/2012, and (3) the subsequent measures (taken together) on Claimants' overall damages claim?*\n\n84.\n\nOn 20 June 2018, Respondent proposed adding a further category to question (c) of PO-6 to single out the impact, if any, of RD-Law 2/2013 on Claimants' overall damages claim.\n\n85.\n\nOn 21 June 2018, the Tribunal invited Claimants' response to Respondent's proposal. Claimants responded on 25 June 2018 that they had no objection to the proposed modification.\n\n86.\n\nOn 26 June 2018, the Tribunal accepted Respondent's proposal to amend question (c) in PO-6.\n\n87.\n\nOn 11 July 2018 and after the Parties and the Court Reporters revised them, the Tribunal issued the final transcripts of the Hearing.\n\n88.\n\nOn 23 July 2018, Claimants requested leave to submit the *Antin v. Spain* Award (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31) to the Tribunal. On 24 July 2018, the Tribunal invited Respondent's comments on Claimants' request. Respondent submitted these on 25 July 2018.\n\n89.\n\nOn 30 July 2018, the Tribunal decided to authorize the introduction of the *Antin* Award and Respondent's Application for Rectification, no later than 3 August 2018, with comments thereto to be submitted along with the Parties' post-hearing briefs, by 27 August 2018. The Tribunal stated that it would not make a decision at this point regarding the decision on rectification of the *Antin* Award and Respondent's possible application for annulment.\n\n90.\n\nOn 31 July 2018, Respondent submitted its Request for Rectification of the *Antin* Award (Exhibit R-0359) to the Tribunal.\n\n91.\n\nOn 1 August 2018, Claimants submitted the *Antin* Award (CL-0222) to the Tribunal.\n\n92.\n\nOn 17 and 18 August 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to increase the length of their post-hearing briefs by 5 pages, to accommodate their comments on the *Antin* Award.\n\n93.\n\nOn 22 August 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it approved of the agreement to increase the page limit of the post-hearing briefs to 55 pages.\n\n94.\n\nOn 27 August 2018, by simultaneous submission, the Parties provided their post-hearing briefs to the Tribunal. Respondent's brief was accompanied by two separate documents answering the Tribunal's questions regarding the \"*stand-alone*\" effect of measures, in response to the Tribunal's question. Respondent also inquired as to whether Spanish-language translations would be required of the post-hearing brief.\n\n95.\n\nOn 28 August 2018, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal requesting consent to reply to Claimants' post-hearing brief or, in the alternative, that sections of Claimants' post-hearing brief be stricken from the record and that this be taken into consideration in a later costs award.\n\n96.\n\nOn 29 August 2018, Claimants responded, alleging that Respondent submitted new evidence with their post-hearing submission and requested leave to submit their expert's report in response.\n\n97.\n\nOn 6 September 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties. It decided to admit the post-hearing briefs as submitted and to allow each Party to file a second post-hearing brief, but only in rebuttal to the other Party's first post-hearing brief, including any new documents as long as they are in rebuttal only. The Tribunal also noted the jurisdictional decision of 31 August 2018 in the *Vattenfall AB and others v. Federal Republic of Germany* case and offered the Parties the opportunity to comment thereon. The Tribunal clarified that it intends not to admit the introduction of any further awards, but rather to close the procedure and deliberate based on the file as it would stand after the second round of post-hearing briefs and the cost claims had been submitted by the Parties.\n\n98.\n\nOn 11 September 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to extend the deadline for the submission of their second-round post-hearing brief and the submissions on costs. The Tribunal approved the extension on the same day.\n\n99.\n\nOn 18 September 2018, Respondent requested the Tribunal's directions on whether it would require that pleadings be submitted in Spanish. The Tribunal invited Claimants' response, and they stated that Spanish translations should be required. Thereafter, on 1 October 2018, the Tribunal decided that PO-1 \u00a7 11(4) should be followed and Respondent was, therefore, required to provide Spanish translations of its past and future submissions.\n\n100.\n\nOn 4 October 2018, the Parties simultaneously submitted their second-round post-hearing briefs to the Tribunal, together with supporting documentation, to the Tribunal.\n\n101.\n\nOn 18 October 2018, the Parties simultaneously submitted their statements of costs to the Tribunal.\n\n102.\n\nOn 19 October 2018, again by simultaneous submission, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to only submit their costs arguments in electronic format and to not require the translation of those submissions into Spanish. The Tribunal approved of the Parties' agreement on 25 October 2018.\n\n103.\n\nOn 25 October 2018 the Parties simultaneously submitted their responses to the other side's statement of costs, together with supporting documentation, to the Tribunal. Claimants' submission included new legal exhibits numbered CL-0222 \u2013 CL-0244. Respondent's submission included a new exhibit, numbered RL-0113.\n\n104.\n\nOn 28 January 2019, Respondent requested the Tribunal's leave to introduce into the record an additional legal authority, the \"*Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, of 15 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in* Achmea *and on Investment Protection in the European Union*\" (\"Declaration\"), together with a written submission commenting exclusively on the relevance of said Declaration. On the same day, the Tribunal invited Claimants to comment on Respondent's Request, by 5 February 2019.\n\n105.\n\nOn 5 February 2019, Claimants responded in opposition to Respondent's Request and asked that the Tribunal provide an estimate of the timing of an award.\n\n106.\n\nOn 11 February 2019, the Tribunal decided to admit (1) the Declaration, (2) the other related declarations made by France, Finland (with other States), and Hungary of 16 January 2019, and (3) the opinion of 29 January 2019 by the ECJ's Advocate General Bot in Opinion 1/17 into the file. The Tribunal invited the Parties to present their brief written observations on these materials, not to exceed 10 pages, simultaneously by 26 February 2019. The Tribunal further stated that it expected to issue the Award before summer 2019.\n\n107.\n\nThe Parties each submitted their written observations on 25 February 2019.\n\n108.\n\nOn 26 February 2019, the Tribunal invited Claimants to respond to Respondent's comments as to costs. Claimants provided this timely response on 12 March 2019.\n\n109.\n\nOn 5 June 2019, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed in accordance with Rule 38(1) of the ICISD Arbitration Rules.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n**A. CLAIMANTS' REQUESTS**\n--------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Prayer for Relief contained in Claimants' Reply Submission on Costs (\"C.Costs-II\") represents Claimants' complete Prayer for Relief, and repeats prior requests contained in Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief (\"CPHB-I\"), Claimants' Memorial on the Merits (\"C-I\"), Corrected Reply on the Merits5 (\"C-III\"), and their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (\"C-IV\").

For the foregoing reasons, the Claimants respectfully request that the Arbitral Tribunal (i) admit the present Reply Submission on Costs; and (ii) issue an Award as follows:*\n\n*(i) DECLARING that the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear all claims submitted by OperaFund and Schwab under the Energy Charter Treaty and, consequently, rejecting each of the preliminary objections that the Respondent raised against the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal;*\n\n*(ii) DECLARING that Respondent's actions and omissions with respect to OperaFund and Schwab's Investment in the PV subsector in Spain amount to breaches of Respondent's obligations under Part III of the Energy Charter Treaty, as well as under the applicable rules and principles of international law;*\n\n*(iii) ORDERING Respondent to pay to OperaFund compensation in the amount of **EUR 36,800,000** and to Schwab compensation in the amount of **EUR 3,300,000** (amounts which may be increased to provide full compensation); or alternatively, an amount based on the alternative \"But-for\" scenario presented in Brattle Second Quantum Report of 13 December 2017, that is, to pay to OperaFund compensation in the amount of EUR 39,000,000 and to Schwab compensation in the amount of EUR 3,000,000;*\n\n*(iv) ORDERING the Respondent to pay to the Claimants the entire costs of the arbitration and all costs incurred by the Claimants as detailed above in this Reply Submission on Costs, totaling EUR (Euro) 2,267,669.57, USD (United States Dollars) 525,000.00 and CHF (Swiss Francs) 26,850.15; and also including, in particular but without limitation, the legal costs incurred by the Claimants in order to address the jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent and the related intervention of the European Commission as amicus curiae in the present proceedings [footnote: Petition (iv) updated with respect to the Prayer for Relief included in the Claimants' First PHB (which did not include the Claimants' incurred costs)]*\n\n*(v) ORDERING Respondent to pay to OperaFund and Schwab pre- and post-award interest accrued on all amounts claimed, compounded monthly, until full payment thereof, at the rates specified by OperaFund and Schwab (1.59% compounded monthly for pre-award interest; and 3.59% compounded monthly for post-award interest);*\n\n*(vi) DECLARING that the Arbitral Tribunal's Award is made net of all taxes and/or withholdings, and ORDERING Spain to indemnify Claimants for any tax liability or withholding that may be imposed in Spain, Malta or Switzerland, in relation to the compensation awarded in the Tribunal's Award; and*\n\n*(vi) ORDERING any such further relief as the Arbitral Tribunal may deem appropriate.6*\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 675 \u2013 676.\n\nC.Costs-II \u00a7 50.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT'S REQUESTS**\n----------------------------\n\n111.\n\nRespondent's request for relief in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction (\"R-I\")7 was restated in Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction (\"R-II\") as follows:\n\n*1477. In light of the arguments expressed therein, the Kingdom of Spain respectfully requests the Arbitral Tribunal to:*\n\n*a) declare its lack of jurisdiction to hear the claims of the Claimants, or if applicable their inadmissibility, in accordance with what is set forth in section III of this Document, referring to Jurisdictional Objections;*\n\n*b) Subsidiarily, in the event that the Arbitral Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction to hear this dispute, to dismiss all the Claimants' claims regarding the Merits, as the Kingdom of Spain has not breached the ECT in any way, pursuant to Sections IV and V herein, referring to the Facts and the Merits, respectively;*\n\n*c) Secondarily, to dismiss all the Claimants' claims for damages, as said Claimants are not entitled to compensation, in accordance with section VI of this Document; and*\n\n*d) Order the Claimant to pay all costs and expenses derived from this arbitration, including ICSID administrative expenses, arbitrators' fees, and the fees of the legal representatives of the Kingdom of Spain, their experts and advisers, as well as any other cost or expense that has been incurred, all of this including a reasonable rate of interest from the date on which these costs are incurred until the date of their actual payment.*\n\n*1478. The Kingdom of Spain reserves the right to supplement, modify or complement these pleadings and present any and all additional arguments that may be necessary in accordance with the ICSID rules of arbitration, procedural orders and the directives of the Arbitral Tribunal in order to respond to all allegations made by the Claimant in regards to this matter*.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 1283 \u2013 1284.\n\n112.\n\nRespondent made the following Request for Relief in its post-hearing submission (\"RPHB-I\")8:\n\n*223. In view of the arguments put forward, the Arbitral Tribunal is respectfully requested to:*\n\n*a) Declare its lack of jurisdiction to hear the Claimants' claims;*\n\n*b) Secondarily, dismiss the Claimants' claims on the merits, since the Kingdom of Spain has not violated the ECT;*\n\n*c) Secondarily, dismiss all claims for compensation from the Claimants, as they do not have the right to any compensation; and*\n\n*d) Order the Claimants to pay all costs and expenses derived from the arbitration, all updated at a reasonable interest rate, from the date on which the costs are incurred until the day on which they are paid*.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 223.\n\n113.\n\nIn its second costs submission (\"R.Costs-II\"), Respondent made the following Petitum, which is consistent with the Petitum contained in its first submission on costs (\"R.Costs-I\")9:\n\n*24. Accordingly, the Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal grant an award pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention ordering that the Claimants bear the costs of this arbitration, as well as the Respondent's costs for legal representation, in the amount of EUR 1,541,677.39. The Respondents [sic] reserves the right to seek additional costs arising subsequent to the filing of the Statement of Costs.*\n\n*24.[sic] Further, the Respondent submits that it should not be liable for any of the Claimants' arbitration or representative costs.*\n\n*25. Finally and in the alternative, should the Tribunal render an award condemning Spain to pay in whole or in part, the costs of this procedure, the Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal: i) excludes from Claimants' Submission of costs realted [sic] to \"other expesnes[sic]\" and ii) reduces Counsel for Claimants' fees to a reasonable amount.*\n\n*26. The Respondent expreslly[sic] reserves its right to submit further arguments in this regard, if it deems it necessary according to the Procedural Orders, the ICSID Convention, and the Arbitration Rules applicable to this case.10*\n\nR.

STATEMENT OF FACTS**\n-------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe following summary of facts is based on the Parties' submissions and is without prejudice to the relevance of these facts for the decisions of the Tribunal. While the events leading to this arbitration are largely not in dispute, where the characterization of many events described herein is, each Party's views are summarized, without prejudice.\n\n115.\n\nClaimants submitted that Respondent's international activities began in 2004 when, following the International Conference for Renewable Energies, Spain and Germany led the creation of an institutional framework known as the International Feed-In Cooperation (\"IFIC\") to promote the feed-in model.11 On 27 January 2005, Spain and 6 other EU Member States organized the first IFIC workshop at the Institute for Energy Diversification and Savings (\"IDAE\") premises in Madrid.12 IDAE is an agency of the Ministry of Energy, Tourism and Digital Agenda, through the Ministry of Energy, on which it is organically dependent.13 The Parties agree that IDAE's purpose is to help the Respondent improve energy efficiency and use of renewable energy and other low-carbon technologies and that IDAE has played an essential role in Respondent's energy policies.14 Claimants argue that, in addition, IDAE had a role in \"*promoting the regulatory framework applicable to renewable energy producers to attract investments.*\"15\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 214, 216; M.

Two kinds of Acts can be distinguished:*\n\n\u2022 *Organic Acts : those reserved for the regulation of certain matters provided for in the Constitution (Fundamental Rights and Public Liberties, general electoral system, among others). An absolute majority of the Congress of Deputies is required for their approval.*\n\n\u2022 *Ordinary Acts : these regulate matters not reserved by the Constitution to an Organic Act. A simple majority of the Congress of Deputies is sufficient for their approval.*\n\n- *Royal Decree-Act* [Royal Decree-Law] *this is a regulation with force of Law whereby the Government is authorised by the Constitution to approve them in situations of extraordinary need or urgency. The approval of a Royal Decree-Act is subject to strict conditions, controls and limits and its subsequent parliamentary validation.*\n\n*- Royal Decree : a Royal Decree is a regulatory standard that emanates from the Government. It complements or implements the Acts and is hierarchically inferior to them. It can regulate within the authorisations granted by the Act and cannot breach the Law.*\n\n*- The Ministerial Order : regulation emanating from one or several ministerial Departments. Within the energy framework, the most frequent type is a Ministerial Order emanating from the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism.*\n\n*[\u2026] Resolutions, meanwhile, are not regulations but decisions with a lower rank than Ministerial Order which emanate from competent bodies of the Administration, involving technical content*.37\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 234 \u2013 235 (internal citations omitted).\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 234 \u2013 235 (emphasis in original).\n\n121.\n\nRespondent explains that the energy sector and the Spanish supportive scheme \"*is a highly regulated and subsidized sector paid by consumers and is governed by the principle of hierarchy of norms that determines (i) that the rights and obligations of the operators can never be contained in a law with the rank of a RD, but in an Act and (ii) any RD must always be consistent with the principles of the Act that it develops*.\"38\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 19(b), 131; Tr.

Even following the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, EU Member States retained their competences on energy matters, such that the new treaty could not supersede the ECT. EU treaties subsequent to the ECT did not change the content of the EU Member States' *inter se* obligations under the ECT, and energy remained a shared competency between the EU and its Member States. The ECT continues to apply to intra-EU disputes after the Treaties of Amsterdam, Nice, and Lisbon, as does the ECHR.358\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 43 \u2013 45; Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, done in Vienna on 23 May 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331 (hereinafter \"VCLT\") **[CL-0007]** / **[RL-0010]** ; *see also* EC's Application, \u00a7 3; EC Amicus Brief, \u00a7\u00a7 129 \u2013 137.\n\n295.\n\nRespondent incorrectly invokes Article 25 of the ECT to suggest that EU law prevails over the ECT, ignoring Article 16 of the ECT.359 No problems with the ECT's compatibility with EU law exist.360 Any compatibility of regimes between EU law and the ECT would be resolved in the ECT's favor by virtue of Article 16 of the ECT, which gives precedence to the provisions of either the ECT or other international agreement that are most favourable to the investor or investment.361 Even if this Tribunal considered that a \"*conflict of treaties*\" could exist (finding that the TFEU and the ECT have the same subject matter), the Tribunal should apply Article 16 of the ECT, which, in the words of the *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain* decision \"*affords precedence of the more favorable investor-protection provisions of Article 26 of the ECT [\u2026] over any conflicting provision of the EU treaties*.\"362 Article 25 of the ECT only refers to the non-extension of preferential treatment stemming from economic integration agreements to non-signatories of those agreements. It does not prohibit the application of the ECT to intra-EU disputes or establish that EU law supersedes the investor's protection warranted by the ECT in intra-EU relations.363 The primacy of EU law does not have any application in the context of the ECT, whether on jurisdictional issues or on the merits.364\n\nC-IV \u00a7 10 (*citing* R-II \u00a7\u00a7 118 \u2013 120).\n\nC-II \u00a7 38; *Eastern Sugar v.

But \"*[i]t is not for this Tribunal to redraft the Treaty which has been agreed by the Contracting Parties to the ECT*.\"388 Even if there existed any type of conflict between the ECT and the TFEU (*quod non*, in the eyes of the *Vattenfall* tribunal since both instruments do not share the \"*same subject matter*\"), the conflict would have to be resolved by applying the *lex specialis* in Article 16 of the ECT that gives preference to the ECT dispute settlement mechanism.389\n\nCPHB-II \u00a7 20; *Vattenfall AB; 2.

Arguments by Respondent**\n------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nSince the Tribunal must resolve disputes in line with the ECT and other principles and rules of international law under Article 26(6) of the ECT, the Tribunal must apply EU Law and the ECT under equal conditions.390 Under the principle of primacy, it is EU Law and not the ECT that is the international law that must be applied to resolve this dispute.391\n\nR-I \u00a7 57; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 73 \u2013 77, 149; ECT, Art. 26(6) **[CL-0009]** ; *Electrabel, S.A. v. the Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No.ARB/07/19), Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012 (\"*Electrabel v.

These treaties include those governing the EU, which prevail over the ECT in intra-EU relations.393 As recognized in Article 25 of the ECT and the Declaration of the European Communities and their Member States, the Treaties Establishing the European Communities pre-date the ECT and share and exceed the objectives of the ECT. The protection of the ECT is superseded by EU regulations, which post-date the ECT and prevail due to the principle of primacy.394 Any hypothetical conflict is resolved by Article 25 of the ECT, which recognizes that the primacy of EU law in intra-EU relations and prevents an EU right from being extended to nationals of the ECT signatory states that are not members of the EU, through an MFN clause.395 Further, the ECT itself recognizes the primacy of EU law.396 As recognized in Article 25 of the ECT and as elaborated in the CJEU judgment of *Costa v. ENEL*,397 the principle of primacy means that EU Law must be applied to intra-community relations in preference to or prevailing over other law, displacing any other national or international provision.398 Article 25 of the ECT recognizes that the process of economic integration of the EU is more advanced than the ECT and, ultimately, more favorable to the Investor.399\n\nR-I \u00a7 74.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 156 \u2013 161; ECT, Art. 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.8 **[CL-0009]** ; Treaty on European Union and Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Charter of Fundamental Rights (2012/C/326/02) consolidated version.

The Brattle Report also assumed that the Spanish Supportive Scheme was approved in compliance with EU Directives on RE, which set out the State Aid nature of such schemes. The application and interpretation of EU Law is, thus, necessary for the resolution of this dispute.405\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 14 (Requirement 1); R.

Day 2 46:3-5, 46:13-16, 49:1-4 (Kofmel).\n\n311.\n\nContrary to Claimants' assessment, the conflict between the ECT and the EU legal order is not limited to the enforcement of an award, nor may it be resolved by the EC's determination of whether payment of an Award would constitute State Aid. This conflict affects the core of the dispute, as (1) the EU legal order must be applied to the present dispute with prevalence over any other international rules, and (2) Claimants are asking for additional State Aid, which can only be granted by the EC.406\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 16.\n\n312.\n\nThe *Vattenfall* Decision is irrelevant and neither invalidates or affects Respondent's position regarding the *Achmea* Judgment because the *Vattenfall* (1) proceeds from a radically flawed premise of international law and (2) did not address the relevance of *Achmea*.407 The *Vattenfall* tribunal simply ruled out the application of EU law to the assessment of its own jurisdiction, by means of a *sui generis* interpretation of Article 26(6) and\u00a042(1) of the ICSID Convention, despite having concurred with the parties and the EC that EU law constituted International Law as defined in Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ. This decision, thus, is internally inconsistent and unsupported by arbitral case law and doctrine.408 The *Vattenfall* tribunal's interpretation of Article 26(6) of the ECT and Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention is contrary to the principles of treaty interpretation contained in Article 31 and 32 of the VCLT and to arbitral precedent, including *Electrabel S.A. v.

The *Vattenfall* decision also misinterprets Article 351 of the TFEU.414 As reasoned in *Electrabel* :\n\n*the ECT's historical genesis and its text are such that the ECT should be interpreted, if possible, in harmony with EU law. (\u2026) [F]or three important legal reasons. The first derives from the ECT's genesis: it would have made no sense for the European Union to promote and subscribe to the ECT if that had meant entering into obligations inconsistent with EU law. The second derives from one of the ECT's objectives: it is an instrument clearly intended to combat anti-competitive conduct, which is the same objective as the European Union's objective in combating unlawful State aid. The third derives from the ECT's implicit recognition that decisions by the European Commission are legally binding on all EU Member States which are party to the ECT.*415\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7 18; *Vattenfall* Decision, \u00a7\u00a7 225 *et seq*. **[CL-0223] / [RL-0113]**.\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7 19, *Electrabel v.

While recognizing the tribunal's power and duty to apply EU law, it decided not to apply the *Achmea* Judgment, which is clearly binding under EU law.416 The *Masdar* Award's findings regarding the applicability of EU law on the jurisdictional phase was at odds with its decision on the facts, merits, and on quantum, where that tribunal failed to analyze how, according to the EC Decision on State Aid, EU law shapes the expectations of an investor.417 Likewise, the *Novenergia* tribunal recognized that (1) the Spanish regulatory framework comes from EU Law, (2) it should comply with EU Law on State Aid, and (3) EU Law's relevance for the resolution of the dispute, as international law, under Article 26(6) of the ECT. Nonetheless, that Tribunal failed to apply EU Law because it reasoned that none of the claimant's claims were submitted based on EU law and failed to reference EU Law on the merits.418 Respondent explains that \"*the applicable law for the resolution of the case is determined by Article 26(6) of the ECT, which undeniable [sic] comprises the EU Law, and the same should be applied iuria novit curia by the Arbitral Tribunal, even if the parties do not invoke it. That's why, Novenergia's findings on jurisdiction and the merits are flawed, since it does not apply the international rules imposed by the ECT, i.e., the EU Law*.\"419\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 205.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 207.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 193 \u2013 194; *Novenergia*, \u00a7\u00a7 456, 460 **[CL-0213]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 195.\n\n**3. Statements by the European Commission**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nWhen both the EU and its Member States become parties to a multilateral agreement, it is the EU's legal order that informs the latter's behavior and actions and, therefore, constitutes a \"*relevant rule of international law applicable in the relations between the parties*\" in the sense of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT.420\n\nEC Amicus \u00a7\u00a7 90, 66 (*citing Oil Platforms* regarding systemic coherence).\n\n317.\n\nEU law provides a complete set of substantive and procedural rules for investment protection, and the Internal Market rules govern and protect the life-cycle of an investment.421 The intra-EU application of the ECT would create the risk of a substantive conflict between EU law on energy and investment protection and the rules of the ECT.422\n\nC-II \u00a7\u00a7 25 \u2013 34 (substantive rules); 35 \u2013 36 (procedural); 41 (court).\n\nEC Amicus \u00a7\u00a7 17, 37 \u2013 39.\n\n318.\n\nBased on Articles 30(4)(a) or 41(1)(b) of the VCLT or Article 351 of the TFEU, the EU Treaties prevail over the ECT:423\n\n*Article 30(3) VCLT provides that when all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under Article 59 VCLT, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty. Article 30(4) and (5) of the VCLT specify that when the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the earlier one, as between States parties to both treaties the same rule applies, provided that the provisions of Article 41 VCLT are respected*.424\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 3, 15, 123.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 132 \u2013 133.\n\n319.\n\nHere, the ECT and the EU Treaties relate to the same subject matter: energy. If one assumes that the provisions on investment protection in Chapter III and Article 26 of the ECT have created *inter se* obligations between EU Member States, *quod non,* the EU Member States would be party to successive treaties that relate to the same subject matter.425 Here, the ECT is the earlier Treaty, preceding Treaty of Accession of Malta to the EU and the Treaty of Lisbon.426 Under Article 30(4)(a) of the VCLT, the ECT only applies to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those later treaties.427 The provisions of the ECT on investment protection (Chapter III) and dispute settlement (Article 26) are not compatible with EU law and are, therefore, not applicable.428 The same result is reached by application of Article 351(2) of the TFEU (formerly Article 307 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, \"TEC\"), pursuant to which the Member State must apply all appropriate means to remove any incompatibility with EU law arising from prior international agreements.429*Pacta sunt servanda* does not apply to treaties concluded between EU Member States.430\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 135.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 136.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 137.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 60(3), 61 \u2013 67, 124 \u2013 127, 137.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 125.\n\n320.\n\nThe *inter se* obligations between EU Member States would have been superseded on the basis of Article 41(1)(b) of the VCLT, pursuant to which a treaty can be amended by a later treaty if it does not (1) affect the enjoyment by other parties of their rights under the treaty or performance of their obligations and (2) relate to a provision, derogation from which is incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose of the treaty. Here, by the Accession Treaty of Malta to the EU and the Treaty of Lisbon, the investment protection rules of EU law were reaffirmed. This treaty could be interpreted as an amendment pursuant to Article 41(1)(b) VCLT.431 The suppression of *inter se* obligations between EU Member States only concerns those EU Member States. In the case of investor-State arbitration such as the one foreseen in Article 26 of the ECT, this is compatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose of the ECT as a whole: the possibility of investor-State arbitration between investors from non-EU Member States and either the EU or EU Member States remains untouched.432\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 131.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 129 \u2013 130.\n\n321.\n\nThe ECT lacks an explicit disconnection clause, but this is not material for the interpretation of the ECT. EU Member States are presumed to be aware of the rules governing the distribution of competencies in the supranational organization they have created. Disconnection clauses have traditionally been used in international treaties where the EU could not become a Contracting Party itself. Such a clause serves as a \"*reminder*\" of the EU's existence. The ECT contains detailed provisions by means of which Contracting Parties have been made aware of the special features of the legal order of the European Communities.433\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 107 \u2013 121.\n\n**4.

Even if, as Respondent argues, in addition to the ECT itself, this provision would make EU law applicable as part of the \"*applicable rules and principles of international law*\", in the view of the Tribunal it is clear that EU law does not prevail over any provisions of the ECT relevant in the present arbitration. Article 16(2) of the ECT expressly provides:\n\n***Article 16 Relation to Other Agreements***\n\n*Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject matter of Part III or V of this Treaty,*\n\n*(1) nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate from any provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under that agreement; and*\n\n*(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty, where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment.*\n\n328.\n\nSubsection (1) of this provision is not relevant for the present arbitration, as the Claims raised by Claimants rely only on and call for application only of the ECT and not for any application of EU law. However, subsection (2) makes it expressly clear that Parts III and IV of the ECT \u2013 which are precisely those dealing with *Investment Promotion and Protection* and *Dispute Settlement* relevant for this arbitration \u2013 remain fully applicable.\n\n329.\n\nFurther, Articles 21 and 25 of the ECT show that, insofar as the Member States of the ECT wanted to carve out certain matters from application of the ECT, they did so expressly. In this context, the Tribunal, without the need to repeat the details of the reasoning, agrees with that of the *Vattenfall* Tribunal in its interpretation of international law and in particular, the law of treaties codified under the VCLT, that, to the extent that the EC or the EU Member States saw an incompatibility between EU law and the ECT negotiation, the conflict would have to be resolved by applying the *lex specialis* in Article 16 of the ECT.438\n\n*Vattenfall* Decision, \u00a7 229 **[CL-0223]** / **[RL-0113]**.\n\n330.\n\nIn view of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that all substantive provisions of the ECT remain fully applicable and EU law is not part of the applicable substantive law in this case.\n\n331.\n\nWhether and, if so, to which extent EU law has to be taken into account for determining the Tribunal's jurisdiction will be discussed below.\n\n**VII.

JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTION 1: THE INTRA-EU OBJECTIONS / WHETHER RESPONDENT HAS CONSENTED TO THE ARBITRATION OF INTRA-EU DISPUTES**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n336.\n\nThe Tribunal should declare that it lacks jurisdiction over the present intra-EU dispute brought by a Maltese investor (OperaFund) against Respondent because (1) access to arbitration under Article 26(1) of the ECT is only available in a dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor of a different Contracting Party \u2013 a requirement not satisfied here \u2013 and (2) the valid interpretation of the arbitration clause of Article 26 of the ECT excludes arbitration between investors from the EU and Member States.446\n\nR-I \u00a7 5; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 8, 70 \u2013 78, 162; Respondent's Submission (25 February 2019), \u00a7\u00a7 1 \u2013 2; *Electrabel v. Hungary*, Decision on Jurisdiction **[CL-0094] / [RL-0002]** (*rejecting* intra-EU arbitration in the context of the ECT).\n\n337.\n\nFirst, the dual nationality requirement of Article 26(1) of the ECT, combined with the European nationality recognized under Article 20 of the TFEU, excludes OperaFund's dispute from the Tribunal's jurisdiction because OperaFund has dual citizenship: Maltese and European. OperaFund is a European investor investing in Europe, and both the Kingdom of Spain and Malta belong to the EU, which is also a Contracting Party to the ECT. An EU Member State cannot be \"*another contracting party*\" in relation to another Member State under Article 26 of the ECT.447\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 5, 61, 62, 73.\n\n338.\n\nUnder Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention,448 dual nationals that have the nationality of the Respondent State cannot seek ICSID arbitration, and this is the case with OperaFund. While Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention refers to natural persons, it must also be applied to cases where legal entities have dual nationality, as occurs in the case of national legal entities of the Member States of the EU. Accordingly, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over this matter, as Claimant OperaFund meets neither the dual nationality requirement of Article 26 of the ECT nor Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention.449\n\n\"*(2) 'National of another Contracting State' means: (a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute\"* (emphasis added)\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 108 \u2013 112; R-I \u00a7\u00a7 49 \u2013 53 (*citing* C-I \u00a7 34); TEU and TFEU, Art. 20 **[RL-0001]** ; Art. 25(2)(a) ICSID Convention; Energy Charter webpage, \"Members and Observers\" **[R-0228]** ; EU Webpage, \"EU Countries\" **[R-0229]**.\n\n339.\n\nSecond, analyzing Article 26 of the ECT in light of EU law, one also sees that there is no valid offer to arbitrate because EU Member States are not competent to bind themselves to one another under Part III of the ECT.450 By acceding to the EU, the Member States transferred the competency for treatment of EU investors and investments within the EU to the EC. This prevents \u2013 and indeed has prevented \u2013 Member States from entering into investment treaties that establish protections that overlap or differ from the rights to which any EU citizen is entitled under EU law.451\n\nR-II \u00a7 139.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 114, 140, 162.\n\n340.\n\nWithin the EU, the only \"*foreign investors*\" are those who come from non-Member States.452 This reality is contained in the ECT itself: Article 1(2) defines \"*Contracting Party*\" as \"*a state or Regional Economic Integration Organisation [\"REIO\"], which has consented to be bound by this Treaty and for which the Treaty is in force*.\"453 In addition, Article 1(3) of the ECT's definition of REIO as one \"*constituted by states to which they have transferred competence over certain matters a number of which are governed by this Treaty*\" expressly recognizes that there are matters governed by the ECT that should be negotiated by the REIO \u2013 here, the EU \u2013 because its Member States do not have the competence over them.454 This is reflected in and confirmed by the Article 1(1) definition of \"*territory*\" of the REIO,455 and the voting rights contained in Article 36(7), which give the EU a number of votes equal to its number of Member States, and preclude the EU and its Member States from voting simultaneously: each may only vote within its scope of competencies.456\n\nR-II \u00a7 140; R-I \u00a7\u00a7 66 \u2013 69; Judgment from the Court of Justice of the European Union, of 11 March 2010, Case C 384/08, Attanasio Group [2010] ECR I 2055, \u00a7 43 **[RL-0020]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 141.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 141 \u2013 143; R-I \u00a7 70.\n\nR-I \u00a7 73.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 76; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 144 \u2013 146.\n\n341.\n\nInterpreted in accordance with its context and purpose of speeding the recovery of Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall though cooperation in the energy sector, Article 26 of the ECT provides no grounds for submitting disputes between an intra-EU investor and an EU Member State to arbitration.457 Respondent's position is confirmed by the CJEU's 6 March 2018 judgment in *Achmea*, which examined whether investment arbitration proceedings are compatible with EU law:458\n\n*Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States\u2026, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept*.459\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 87 \u2013 90.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 66, 83 \u2013 84; *Achmea* Judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 35 \u2013 37, 41, 45, 46, 49, 55, 56 **[RL-0104]** ; Action brought on 6 November 2015 \u2014 European Food and Others/Commission (Case T-624/15).

Both (1) and (2) are protected and guaranteed by the Member States' obligation to submit disputes to the European court system (Article 344 TFEU) and the obligation of the legal authorities to raise preliminary judgments (Article 267 TFEU), which guarantee the uniform application of EU law.460\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 67 \u2013 71, 84 \u2013 85, 87 \u2013 89, 97 \u2013 99, 129 \u2013 136; Final Commission Decision C(2016) 7827, of 28 November 2016, regarding case number SA.40171 in the State Aid Register (2015/NN)\u2013 Czech Republic **[RL-0070]** ; EC State Aid Decision (11 November 2017) **[RL-0080]** ; *Achmea* Judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 35, 36, 37, 41, 45, 46, 49, 55, 56 **[RL-0104]** ; European Commission - Press release. \"Commission asks Member States to terminate their intra-EU bilateral investment treaties\" 18 June 2015 **[R-0245]**.\n\n343.\n\nApplying the *Achmea* Judgment, this Tribunal should declare its lack of jurisdiction over the present dispute. First, this Tribunal is called upon to interpret and apply EU Law, as Claimants' witnesses invested relying on the EU Legal Order and Brattle assumed that the Spanish Supportive Scheme complied with EU Law.461 Second, it is not in dispute that intra-EU investment arbitration tribunals are not part of the judicial system and that, third, there is no possibility of complete judicial control by a national judge at the annulment or recognition stages.462 Fourth, agreements concluded by Member States need to safeguard the principle of autonomy of EU law and, as conceded by Claimants' counsel, this Tribunal is not an EU judicial body and, therefore, cannot safeguard the autonomy of EU Law.463 The Tribunal should, therefore, declare that it lacks jurisdiction over this dispute.464\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 14; Tr.

Hungary*, Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 4,158 **[CL-0094] / [RL-0002]**.\n\n*See e.g*.

No matter relating to the Internal Market may be submitted to arbitration.470 The institutional and judicial framework of the EU provides the appropriate judicial appeals and actions when the rights of investors are breached: the investor may claim damages and report any violation of EU law. When a national court fails to fulfill its obligations under EU law, the injured party has grounds to file a claim for damages from the Member State. This system to promote and protect investments requires that no distinction is made within the EU between investors from one Member State or another. Only foreign investors may seek arbitration to defends rights granted under Article 10(1) of the ECT.471 Article 26 of the ECT does not provide a preferential ordering to its methods of dispute resolution, and Claimants have not explained how arbitration is more favorable for investors or investments. Under Article 26 of the ECT, the Parties could have the possibility of recourse to international conciliation or to the ordinary or Administrative Tribunals of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute.472\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 55, 78, 84; TEU and TFEU, Art. 344 **[RL-0001]** ; *Electrabel v.

Had it considered such, it would have found that it is not, because it is not subject to the mechanisms capable of ensuring the full effectiveness of the EU Rules and, particularly, it cannot refer to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling.481 The *Vattenfall* tribunal failed to analyze whether the effectiveness of EU rules could be ensured in the phases of enforcement and execution of the arbitral award. It must, however, be concluded that no such control is possible, given the applicable rules on annulment and enforcement of the ICSID Convention, which determine that such phases escape completely the control of EU Courts.482 Finally, the *Vattenfall* Tribunal failed to analyze whether an arbitration mechanism would be in accordance with EU Law and its autonomy.483 The *Vattenfall* Decisions reference to *Masdar's* reliance on the Opinion of the Advocate General Wathelet is striking because, contrary to that, the *Achmea* Judgment rejected it in its entirety.484\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7\u00a7 20 \u2013 23; *Vattenfall* Decision, \u00a7 161 **[CL-0223] / [RL-0113]**.\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7\u00a7 24 \u2013 25; *Achmea* Judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 39 \u2013 49 **[RL-0104]**.\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7 26; *Achmea* Judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 50 \u2013 55 **[RL-0104]** ; Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet, \u00a7\u00a7 252 \u2013 253 **[CL-0188]**.\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7 27; *Achmea* Judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 56 \u2013 60 **[RL-0104]** ; *Vattenfall* Decision, \u00a7 144 **[CL-0223] / [RL-0113]**.\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7 28; RPHB-I \u00a7 205 \u2013 206; *Masdar*, \u00a7\u00a7 681, 682 **[CL-0220]** ; *Achmea* Judgment, \u00a7 57 **[RL-0104]** ; Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet, \u00a7\u00a7 163 \u2013 168 **[CL-0188]**.\n\n349.\n\nIn its later Submission on the Member State Declarations on *Achmea* and the Opinion 01/17 of AG Bot, Respondent noted that all Member States acknowledge the EC's position as to the incompatibility with EU law of investor-State arbitration between a Member State and an investor from another Member State. EU law offers a comprehensive and effective legal framework to intra-EU investors when they invest in another Member State, a regulation that precludes any arbitration on such matters subtracting them from the EU judicial system.485\n\nRespondent's Submission (25 February 2019), \u00a7 7.\n\n350.\n\nThe Declarations are significant and relevant to the Tribunal's interpretation of the ECT because EU law is among the \"*applicable rules and principles of international law*\" specified in Article 26(6) of the ECT, to be applied in this case.486 The 22-Member State Declaration resolves the conflict between EU law and the ECT because the ECT must be interpreted in a way that accords with EU law. Where that is not possible, that provision of the ECT is inapplicable. Article 26 of the ECT cannot be considered a valid consent to arbitration in the case of intra-EU disputes for it would be incompatible with the autonomy and primacy of EU law, and the Declaration reinforces the need to solve any potential conflict in favor of EU law.487\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 13 \u2013 18.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 19 \u2013 25.\n\n351.\n\nThe Declaration issued by 5 EU Member States, including Malta, does not contradict this.488 AG Bot's Opinion concluded that the CJEU should declare the compatibility between CETA and the EU Treaties based on four elements: \"*a) the context of the agreement; b) the possible impact on the autonomy of EU Law of a dispute settlement mechanism as the one designed in the agreement; c) the effects on the principle of equal treatment; and d) finally, the compatibility of the mechanism with the right of access to an independent and impartial Tribunal*.\"489 From this, one sees that all agreements concluded by the EU must be compatible with constitutional principles stemming therefrom, including the autonomy of the EU legal order.490 The test of whether the exclusive powers of the EU judicial system are ensured is by reference to either by the possibility of the arbitration tribunal to refer to the CJEU or rather by the possibility of control by the EU judicial system in the enforcement and/or annulment stages. With these in mind, the basic principles of the EU, meaning autonomy, loyal cooperation and mutual trust, are respected by the international agreement, by ensuring the exclusive powers of the EU judicial system and specifically the CJEU.491\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 26 \u2013 27.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 31.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 45.\n\n*Id*.\n\n**2.

Claimants accepted Respondent's offer to arbitrate under Article 26(3) of the ECT prior to the *Achmea* Judgment, and Article 26(3)(a) of the ECT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention proscribe the unilateral withdrawal of consent once given, which is provided unconditionally.512 The fact that one of the Claimants is a national of an EU Member State that is a Contracting Party other than the Respondent, and that Malta and Respondent are EU Member States does not change anything: the ECT has intra-EU effects.513\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 34 - 36; C-IV \u00a7 12.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 7; Tr.

Spain*, the definition of REIO provided in Article 1(3) of the ECT and its voting rights provided in Article 36(7) do not affect this.520 The CJEU confirmed in its Opinion 2/15 concerning the Free Trade Agreement between the EU and the Republic of Singapore that there are shared competences of the EU Member States at an international level.521 There is no violation of Article 3(2) of the TFEU: the rules of competence of the EU and its Member States do not mean that intra-EU disputes are legally impossible.522 The ECT's scope of application is broader than the concept of energy established in Article 4(2) of the TFEU. The Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force in 2009 did not change this, as Member States still retain their competences on energy matters.523 EU treaties subsequent to the ECT did not change the content of EU Member State *inter se* obligations under the ECT.

Thus, while 22 Member States believe that the ECT does not apply to intra-EU disputes, 5 others \u2013 including the Republic of Malta, read *Achmea* restrictively, stating that it only concerns the application of EU Law in relation to intra-EU BITs. Hungary, making its own declaration, believes that *Achmea* is silent on the investor-state dispute resolution clause in the ECT and that it does not concern any pending or prospective arbitration proceedings initiated under the ECT. It is obvious that, for Switzerland, the intra-EU issue is *res inter alios acta*.540\n\nClaimants' Submission (25 February 2019), \u00a7 4.\n\n365.\n\nAs a matter of international law, the EU-22 Declaration does not reflect any consensus among EU Member States and cannot unilaterally modify the application of the ECT to intra-EU disputes.541 Likewise, the Opinion of AG Bot is not binding upon the CJEU, nor is the Tribunal bound by it. It concerns a different treaty. Unlike the CETA, the ECT was established in 1994 when EU Member States, Third States, and the EU established a special set of rules to deal with investments in the energy sector.542 The CETA and the ECT do not share the same subject matter. Even if they did, however, any conflict should be resolved by the Tribunal in the ECT's favor, according to Article 16 of the ECT. Undoubtedly, having access to a neutral, independent tribunal, as per the ECT, is more favourable than not having such an option, as under the EU Treaties.543\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 6 \u2013 11.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 15.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 17.\n\n366.\n\nWhile AG Bot's opinion is of little importance, the conclusion that \"*the domestic law of each Party, of which EU law forms part in the case of the Member States, can be taken into account by the Tribunal only as a matter of fact*\" is noteworthy.544 AG Bot also correctly identified that the ECT falls within the exception provided for by paragraph 57 of the *Achmea* judgment.545\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 18(i).\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 18(ii).\n\n367.\n\nFinally, neither the EU-22 Declaration nor the CJEU can override the impossibility for Respondent to withdraw its consent pursuant to the second sentence of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.546 It is undisputed that the Claimants consented to arbitration on July 31, 2015 when they accepted the Respondent's offer of Article 26 ECT with their filing of the request for arbitration.547 Thus, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal affirm its jurisdiction over the totality of the case and the Claimants and, consequently, to dismiss the Respondent's intra-EU objection.548\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 20 \u2013 23.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 24 \u2013 25.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 26.\n\n**3. The European Commission**\n------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nInsofar as OperaFund is concerned, this dispute is an intra-EU dispute between an investor from one EU Member State and the Kingdom of Spain, based on an international treaty \u2013 which is part of EU law \u2013 covering a field that is regulated by EU law. The Parties agree that the contested measures transpose the First and Second Directive on Renewable Energy of 2001 and 2009 into Spanish law. The Contested Measures constitute State Aid in the sense of Article 107(1) of the TFEU.549\n\nEC Amicus \u00a7 2.\n\n369.\n\nThe EC suggested three options for the resolution of the present dispute. The EC's proposal to suspend proceedings pending the ruling in *Achmea* is now moot. Next, the Tribunal could declare that it lacks the competence to hear the case. Finally, the EC urged the Tribunal to suspend proceedings until the EC has taken a view on Spain's notification regarding Spain's national RE support scheme, which was notified to the EC on the basis of Article 108(3) of the TFEU as constituting State Aid pursuant to Article 108(1) TFEU.550\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 145 \u2013 149.\n\n370.\n\nThe published awards concerning intra-EU BITs that give the ECT intra-EU effect proceed from the faulty premise that EU Member States remain free to conclude international agreements *inter se* because the internal competence for energy in the internal market is qualified as a \"*shared competence*\" in Article 4(2)(a) of the TFEU.551 This is based on an incorrect understanding of Article 2(2) of the TFEU, which only regulates to what extent an EU Member State may legislate within its own territory, but does not define the extent to which an EU Member State may enter into international agreements, including with other Member States.552 The CJEU addressed this issue in *Pringle*, finding that, under Article 3(2) of the TFEU \"*Member States are prohibited from concluding an agreement between themselves which might affect common rules or alter their scope*.\"553 Thus, as a result of the exclusive external competence of the EU for RE, any international agreement between EU Member States *inter se* is incompatible with EU Law.554\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 21.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 22.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 17, 20 \u2013 23.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 17, 24.\n\n371.\n\nAs RE falls within the external exclusive competence of the EU, the EU \u2013 and not its Member States \u2013 are bound under international law by the ECT. This has the consequence that (1) the EU is the internationally responsible party for a breach of provisions on investment protection and promotion and (2) Article 26 of the ECT does not allow an EU investor to initiate arbitration proceedings against a Member State because the dispute would be one between the EU and an EU investor from the EU.555 The EC also argues that EU investors are unable to bring claims against the EU:\n\n[b]*y defining area with reference to the agreement establishing the REIO, the ECT wants to make it clear that EU investors cannot bring claims against the Union. That aim would, however, be put into jeopardy if one were to allow EU investors to bring a claim against an EU Member State: Indeed, EU law is usually implemented by actions of the Member States, as the Union lacks - with very narrow exceptions mainly in the area of competition law - enforcement tools. EU investors, therefore, in most cases, will find national acts of execution of Union law, which they could challenge by bringing a claim against the EU Member State executing Union law, rather than against the Union itself. This can well be illustrated in the present case, where the measure contested by the Claimant constitutes the transposition of an obligation flowing from the First and Second Renewable Energy Directives*.556\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 107 \u2013 121.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 85.\n\n372.\n\nArticle 26 of the ECT must be interpreted on the basis of Article 31 of the VCLT \"*in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose*\" and with the assistance of \"*the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion*\"557 Such interpretation shows that, rather than create *inter se* relationships between EU Member States, the ECT created international obligations only between third countries and the competent subject of international law in the area of EU law \u2013 either the EU, or the Member States (for areas of Member State competence). This is analogous to the situation of the WTO agreement.558 Article 1(2) of the ECT supports this, defining \"*Contracting Party*\" as either the State or the REIO, defined in Article 1(3). A Contracting Party is bound only by parts of the ECT \u2013 i.e., the parts for which it enjoys international competence. The fact that the EU and the Member States only vote on matters where each has competence, with the EU voting with the number of votes equal to the number of its Member States, supports this. The term \"*Area*\" defined in Article 1(10) further recognized the relationships between the Contracting Parties that are members of the REIO (the EU).559 While other tribunals have considered that the term \"*Area*\" must be defined depending on who the respondent is, this view is not convincing because (1) it deprives part of Article 1(10) of its *effet utile*, ignoring the text \"*under the provisions contained in the agreement establishing that Organization*\" and (2) it disregards the importance that the ECT placed in Article 1(3) on the transfer of competence from the EU Member States to the EU.560 The term \"*another*\" contained in Article 26 of the ECT also excludes disputes brought by EU investors against a Member State.561 The interpretation proposed by the EC avoids \"*respondent shopping*\", which is not allowed under the ECT, as confirmed by the statement submitted by the EU to the Secretariat of the ECT pursuant to Article 26(3)(ii) of the ECT.562\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 70.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 71.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 73 \u2013 80.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 81 \u2013 84.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 87 \u2013 88.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 86.\n\n373.\n\nA systemic or harmonious interpretation of the ECT discussed at length in *Electrabel* leads to the conclusion that there is no valid offer for arbitration under EU law. If the Tribunal agrees that EU law constitutes \"*relevant rules of international law applicable to the relations between the parties*\", then an interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT on the basis of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT leads to the conclusion that there is no valid offer to arbitrate from Spain to Maltese investors. Due to a lack of valid consent, the Tribunal would not be competent to hear the case.563\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 58 \u2013 69.\n\n374.\n\nThe interpretation based on the context, object and purpose of the ECT shows that the EU Member States did not intend to create *inter se* obligations between them. The historical process of creating the European Energy Charter and the ECT (as the translation of the European Energy Charter \u2013 a policy document \u2013 into international law), shows that the ECT aimed to create an international framework for cooperation in the energy sector between the European Communities, Russia, the Commonwealth of Independent States (\"CIS\"), and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The ECT was perceived as part of the European Communities' external \u2013 not internal - energy policy.564 The EC argues that, at the time, \"*the ECT provisions on investment protection fell into the Union's undisputed exclusive external competence under the common Commercial Policy*.\"565\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 89 \u2013 103.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 105.\n\n375.\n\nIntra-EU investor-state dispute settlement is not compatible with EU law and this renders the offers for intra-EU investment arbitration in intra-EU BIT and ECT cases invalid. The offer by Spain to investors from Malta ceased as of the date of Malta's accession to the EU, on 1 May 2004.566 Said offer would violate Article 3(2) of the TFEU, because the EU has exclusive external competence in the field of renewable energy at least since 2001, as the Court held in *Green Network*.567\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 4, 15.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 17 \u2013 20.\n\n376.\n\nThe submission of intra-EU disputes to treaty-based investor-State arbitration under the ECT violates Articles 267 and 344 TFEU and the principles of unity, autonomy and effectiveness.568 Through the preliminary ruling mechanism established by Article 267 of the TFEU, the EU can ensure that, in all circumstances, the law has the same effect in all Member States and avoid divergences in interpretation. The dispute settlement system is exhaustive for intra-EU disputes and, if any Member State creates such an additional mechanism, those States are in violation of Article 19 of the TEU and 344 of the TFEU.569 Article 26 of the ECT creates a new, separate dispute settlement system, for subjects that would otherwise be covered by the exhaustive dispute settlement procedures envisaged in Article 258 \u2013 260, 263, and 267 of the TFEU.570 By submitting this dispute to arbitration, the Member States violate Article 267 of the TFEU because this system does not have the possibility or obligation to refer preliminary questions to the CJEU pursuant to Article 267 of the TFEU.571 Only one Arbitral Tribunal (*EURAM v. Slovakia*) has considered this problem, but incorrectly transposed case law from the field of commercial arbitration to the field of investment arbitration and did not address the underlying problem \u2013 one which is not solved by the possibility of ICSID annulment (which obliges ICSID to apply and interpret EU law without the possibility of requesting a preliminary ruling).572\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 13.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 40.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 42.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 43.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 44 \u2013 46.\n\n377.\n\nArticle 344 of the TFEU is the expression of the general principle that an international agreement cannot affect the allocation of powers fixed by the EU Treaties or the autonomy of the EU system covers an agreement by which EU Members States agree to submit intra-EU investment disputes to a new dispute settlement structure outside the EU Treaties.573 Tribunals in *Electrabel*, *Charanne*, *RREEF*, *Eiser* and *Blusun* wrongly interpreted Article 344 of the TFEU, believing that it only applies in disputes between two EU Member States and not to disputes between an investor and an EU Member State.574 Unlike commercial arbitration, which the CJEU accepts, an investment treaty is an act of public international law and the subject matter of investor-State arbitration is not a contractual relationship, but rather concerns the behavior of States in their capacity as public authority and the exercise of public policy prerogatives.575 Nothing in the ECT prevents the Tribunal from fixing its seat outside of the EU, which facilitates that circumvention of the control on the application and interpretation of EU Law by judges of a Member State.576 The EU confirmed its position that intra-EU investor-state dispute resolution is contrary to EU law when signing the International Energy Charter.577\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 55.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 47, 53, 54, 57.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 48 \u2013 51.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 52.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 56.\n\n**4. The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n378.\n\nRegarding this intra-EU objection, the Tribunal is aware of the decisions issued by other tribunals in similar cases in ECT and ICSID arbitrations, and particularly also on the very similar scenarios regarding the disputed measures by the Kingdom of Spain which is also the Respondent in the present case. Indeed, in Section 2.1.2. of PO-6 after the Hearing on the merits, the Tribunal expressly invited the Parties' comments as follows:\n\n*By 27 August, 2018, the Parties shall simultaneously submit the English-language version of their Post-Hearing Briefs, Limited to a maximum of 50 pages (double-spaced) in length and in font Times New Roman 12, containing the following:*\n\n*2.1.1.

The Tribunal agrees with all the recent conclusions of other tribunals to the effect that, also after the *Achmea* Judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU, the intra-EU objection is not justified, and the Tribunal has indeed jurisdiction in the present case. The Tribunal considers it sufficient to shortly indicate the major determinative reasons on which it relies for this conclusion.\n\n381.\n\nThe first reason is that in the present case, jurisdiction is based on the ECT, while in the *Achmea* Case it was alleged to be based only on a BIT between two EU Member States. The *Achmea* Judgment makes no mention of the ECT and the reasoning of the Court does not cover or apply to arbitrations based on the ECT. In this respect, the present Tribunal particularly agrees with the reasoning provided by the *Vattenfall* tribunal. In particular, the *Vattenfall* tribunal correctly found that there was nothing in the ECT to indicate the parties had intended to carve out intra-EU disputes while it would have been \"*a simple matter*\" to include such a carve-out but there was no indication that this had been intended. And indeed, as mentioned by the *Vattenfall* tribunal, it is also telling that the ECT lacks a \"*disconnection clause*\" providing that it would not apply as to between EU member states. The EU has included such clauses in other treaties to which it is a party and the negotiating history of the ECT reveals that an EU proposal to include such a clause was dropped from the draft treaty.\n\n382.\n\nFurther, neither *Achmea* (explicitly limiting its scope to intra-EU BITs and leaving an assessment of the ECT open) nor EU law generally (Article 344 TFEU, being limited to inter-state disputes) prevents member states to agree on investment arbitration in the framework of the ECT.\n\n383.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal considers that there is also no basis for Respondent's argument that the EU Treaty by virtue of the accession of Malta superseded the ECT. There is no identity of subject matter, the ECT provides for very different remedies against Spain than the TFEU, not at least the possibility to access an investment tribunal in case of breaches and it contains guarantees against uncompensated expropriation as well as against violations of FET, FPS and other standards which are not contained in the TFEU. Furthermore, the lack of a disconnection clause is important; it cannot be presumed that such a clause is implicit. Rather, the ECT fully applies and provides jurisdiction in the present case.\n\n384.\n\nThe second major reason is that, in the *Achmea* Case the alleged jurisdiction was based on the respective BIT between two EU Member States pursuant to the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, while the present case is an ICSID arbitration. *i.e.* a multilateral public international law treaty for the specific purpose of resolving investment disputes between private parties and a State (here, Spain). Thus, this Tribunal is placed in a public international law context and not in a national or regional context. With regard to the relevance of the *Achmea* Judgment for the present arbitration, the Tribunal notes that the *Achmea* Judgment relies expressly on the following aspects:\n\n\u2022 The place of arbitration was Frankfurt, Germany, with the result that German law applied to the arbitration proceedings,578\n\n\u2022 The judicial review of the validity of the award was within the competence of the German courts and was exercised by those courts,579\n\n\u2022 That it was in this review process that the German Federal Court of Justice (*Bundesgerichtshof*) submitted the preliminary questions to the European Court of Justice.580\n\n*Achmea* Judgment, \u00a7 10 **[RL-0104]**.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 52 and 53.\n\n*Id*. at 23.\n\n385.\n\nNone of these factors exist in the present case:\n\n\u2022 While the place of arbitration according to PO-1 \u00a7 10.1 is Washington, D.C.,581 it is not US law, but exclusively the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules which are applicable to the proceedings.\n\n\u2022 The judicial review of the validity of the award is not in the competence of US courts or of any other national courts, but subject exclusively to the annulment procedure according to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention,\n\n\u2022 This annulment review leads to a final decision by an international *ad hoc* committee, which is not subject to further review by any other court.\n\nPO-1 \u00a7 10.1.\n\n386.\n\nFurther, Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention provide as follows:\n\n***Article 53***\n\n(1) *The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.*\n\n(2) *For the purposes of this Section, \"award\" shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52.*\n\n***Article 54***\n\n(1) *Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State. A Contracting State with a federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent state.*\n\n387.\n\nThereby, Spain as a party to the ICSID Convention is expressly bound by the Tribunal's Award in the present case, has no option of appeal outside the ICSID system, and has to recognize the present Award as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by this Award within its territory as if it were a final judgment of a court in Spain. The *Achmea* Judgment contains no reference to the ICSID Convention or to ICSID Arbitration. Therefore, and in view of the above-mentioned determinative differences between the *Achmea* Case and the present one, the *Achmea* Judgment cannot be understood or interpreted as creating or supporting an argument that, by its membership in the EU, Spain is not bound by the ICSID Convention.\n\n388.\n\nIn view of the above considerations, the present Tribunal, as all recent arbitral decisions dealing with the disputed measures in Spain, concludes that the intra-EU objection is not justified and that it does have jurisdiction.\n\n**B.

In 2014, the EC ratified the taxation nature of the TVPEE and its conformity with EU Law by closing a Pilot Procedure it initiated in 2013 in response to a complaint that the TVPEE infringed EU Law. This shows that the EC has not doubted that the TVPEE is a tax.594\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 140 \u2013 154; R-II \u00a7 172; ECT, Art. 21(7)(a), 26(6) **[RL-0006]** ; *Saipem S.p.A. v.

It is a complex economic system that functions independently from the Spanish Government, yet under the CNMC's supervision and control.

The Spanish Constitutional Court did not reach a conclusion on whether the TVPEE is consistent with the Spanish Constitution618 and did not ratify the *bona fide* nature of the TVPEE as a tax.619 Nor did the EC ratify the TVPEE's tax nature or its conformity with EU law, as has been suggested by Respondent.620 The TVPEE does not meet Respondent's 3-part criterion to be considered a \"*tax*\" under International Law \u2013 the TVPEE fails to serve a legitimate \"*public purpose*.\" Respondent's criterion ignores those established by the *Yukos* tribunal \u2013 the only tribunal to have considered the classification of taxes for the purposes of the ECT.621 Subsequent authorities on which Respondent has relied either have no bearing on this position or have no bearing on this issue \u2013 none changes the inevitable conclusion that the TVPEE is not a *bona fide* tax.622\n\nC-II \u00a7 110.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 129; Order 202/2016, of 13 December 2016, of the Constitutional Court **[C-0248]** ; Press Release, \"El impuesto sobre la energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica favorece el uso de energ\u00edas sucias\", *Panorama,* 17 November 2017 **[C-0249]**.\n\nC-II \u00a7 139.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 148; Case file of the procedure EU Pilot 5526/13/TAXU relating to the TVPEE (Tax on the value of the production of electrical energy), which records the closure thereof by the European Commission in the absence of evidence that there is an infringement of EU law by the TVPEE **[R-0025]**.\n\nC-II \u00a7\u00a7 120 \u2013 121, 137 \u2013 142; Act 15/2012, Section 2 of the Explanatory Preamble, Second Additional Provision **[C-0112]** / **[R-0003]** ; *compare Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v.

The tribunals in the *Eiser* (by majority) and the *Isolux* (unanimous) found that they lacked jurisdiction.625 The dissenting opinion in *Eiser* does not challenge the majority's declaration of its lack of jurisdiction in relation to the TVPEE.626 The *Novenergia* tribunal and, lastly, the *Masdar* tribunal likewise concluded that they lacked jurisdiction over the TVPEE.627\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 212 \u2013 215; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 215 \u2013 219; *Isolux*, \u00a7\u00a7 717 \u2013 741 **[RL-0004]** / **[RL-0076]** ; *Eiser*, \u00a7\u00a7 266 \u2013 272 **[CL-0148]** / **[RL-0077]** / **[RL-0078]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7 215; R-II \u00a7 218; *Eiser*, \u00a7 271 **[CL-0148]** / **[RL-0077]** / **[RL-0078]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 211(iii); *Masdar*, \u00a7 621 **[CL-0220]**.\n\n404.\n\nWhile the present Tribunal is by no means bound by this earlier jurisprudence, it agrees with the conclusions reached. Indeed, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimants' arguments focusing on contributing to finance public expenses and a tax being based on economic capacity. Even under these criteria supporting the SES could be viewed as serving a public purpose and applying it to income seems to be related to economic capacity. Rather, the Tribunal finds the three criteria mentioned by Respondent as rather convincing. Indeed, the TVPEE is a tax under international law, as understood in arbitral case-law, because it is (1) established by law, (2) imposes obligations on a class of people, and (3) that obligation implies paying money to the State for public purposes.628 As Respondent has pointed out, the TVPEE's general applicability is linked to the environmental nature of the tax: there are environmental effects in all facilities for electric power generation, whether based on the existence of the facilities themselves or on their use of the transport and distribution networks.629 There is no discrimination against RE producers in terms of repercussion, whether legal or economic.630 The TVPEE is a tax on income for the purposes of the ECT.631 The TVPEE is specifically included among the operating costs of RE producers that are taken into account to calculate the specific remuneration for those producers, per MO IET/1045/2014.632\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 174 \u2013 191; Black's Law Dictionary, Ninth Edition, Bryan A.

III **[CL-0037]**.\n\n407.\n\nThere is no inconsistency in Claimants' arguments because Article 21(1) of the ECT applies taxes, even taxes other than those on income or capital, to the extent that they are *bona fide*.635 If the Tribunal considers the TVPEE a tax, however, it would be a tax other than on income or capital, and would benefit from the MFN clause of Article 10(7) of the ECT, as indicated in Article 21(3).636 Article 21(7)(b) does not define what are \"*taxes imposed on total income, on total capital and on elements of income or capital*\" (the \"*Term*\").637 In order to interpret the Term in Article 21(7)(b), the Tribunal should resort to the far more specific and comprehensive Article 2.2 of the OECD Model Tax Convention, because it was the ECTs writers' intention that the Term and Article 2.2 would have the same meaning.638 While the Term as developed by the OECD is vague, scholars have argued that the Term could have an autonomous meaning according to which \"*income is understood as the money value of net accretion of one's economic power during a certain period of time*\",639 which finds support in the OECD's interpretive guides.640 Under this approach, the Term under Article 2.2 of the OECD Model Tax Convention does not include taxes on gross revenues, such as the TVPEE, but rather only taxes on \"*net income or profits*.\" Focusing on the taxes listed in double taxation treaties, taxes on gross amounts \u2013 like the TVPEE \u2013 are only covered by the Double Taxation Treaties to the extent that they are imposed on entities without a taxable presence in Spain. Both approaches lead to the same conclusion: the TVPEE is not a tax on income under the ECT.641 Accordingly, under Article 10(7) of the ECT, the Respondent must accord Claimants the same treatment concerning the TVPEE as it accords to other foreign investors.642\n\nC-IV \u00a7\u00a7 92 \u2013 93.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 91.\n\nC-II \u00a7 155; C-IV \u00a7 94.\n\nC-II \u00a7 158 \u2013 161; C-IV \u00a7 97; OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (July 2010), p. 75 \u2013 77 **[C-0250]** ; P.

If the TVPEE is a taxation measure under the ECT (and, therefore, Article 10(1) of the ECT is not applicable to the TVPEE), its nature as a tax on income has been proven. Claimants' alternative claim is internally contradictory: the TVPEE cannot simultaneously be a tax under Article 10(1) of the ECT but not a tax on income for the purposes of Article 21(3) of the ECT.652 Respondent requests that the Tribunal declare that the protection standards of FET, MCPS, Non-Impairment, and Umbrella Clause are not applicable to the TVPEE by virtue of the MFN principle of Article 10(7) of the ECT, pursuant to Article 21(3) of the ECT.653 Even if Article 21(3) applied to the TVPEE, the ECT expressly prohibits extending MFN treatment to taxation measures, as intended by Claimants.654\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 217 \u2013 218, 224 \u2013 225; R-II \u00a7 220 \u2013 227; ECT, Art. 21(1) and (3) **[RL-0006]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 6, 216, 229, 1022 -\u2013 1026; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 6 \u2013 7, 167, 239, 245 \u2013 246.\n\nR-II \u00a7 240.\n\n413.\n\nIn accordance with Article 21(3) of the ECT, Article 10(7) does not apply to taxes on income, *i.e*., direct taxes.655 Article 10(7) of the ECT applies, with certain limitations, to indirect taxes \u2013 such as those levying indirect manifestations of the economic capacity of taxpayers, such as consumption. Indirect taxes are those that are legally passed on to another person.656 The Secretariat of the Energy has made clear that Article 21(7), in any event, can be applied to indirect taxes (which the TVPEE is not).657 Under Article 21(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT, MFN treatment cannot be imposed with respect to \"*any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation of any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound*.\"658 The BITs invoked by Claimants are such international agreements.

The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n414.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls the following sections from Article 21 of the ECT:\n\n*(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*(3) Article 10(2) and (7) shall apply to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties other than those on income or on capital, except that such provisions shall not apply to:*\n\n*(a) impose most favoured nation obligations with respect to advantages accorded by a Contracting Party pursuant to the tax provisions of any convention, agreement or arrangement described in subparagraph (7)(a)(ii) or resulting from membership of any Regional Economic Integration Organization; or*\n\n*(b) any Taxation Measure aimed at ensuring the effective collection of taxes, except where the measure arbitrarily discriminates against an Investor of another Contracting Party or arbitrarily restricts benefits accorded under the Investment provisions of this Treaty.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*(7) For the purposes of this Article:*\n\n*(a) The term \"Taxation Measure\" includes:*\n\n*(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein; and*\n\n*(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation or of any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound.*\n\n415.\n\nAbove at paragraph 405, the Tribunal found that the TVPEE is a tax on income under the ECT. Having concluded that the TVPEE is a tax under the ECT, the Tribunal need not consider whether, through Article 21 of the ECT, Article 10(7) of the ECT may be applied in such a manner as to impose MFN-obligations, as argued by Claimants.\n\n**VIII.

Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n416.\n\nThe normative content of FET, including that in Article 10(1) of the ECT, encompasses, \"*among others, the respect for the legitimate expectations of the investors, including the specific commitments entered into the State with them; the prohibition to act arbitrarily or in a discriminatory manner; and the duty to act in a transparent way and with due regard to due process of law*.\"660 FET is the *Grundnorm* or the golden rule of the protection of foreign investments. The FET is an absolute standard, not a relative one.661 Under the ECT, FET is autonomous, different from, and beyond the minimum standard of treatment of customary international law (\"MST\").662\n\nC-I \u00a7 634; *Electrabel v.

Had the Contracting Parties to the ECT intended to limit their FET obligations to the MST, they could have made that intention clear.669 In no way does Article 10(1) of the ECT's declaration in its penultimate sentence that \"*in no case shall such Investment be accorded treatment less favorable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations*\" alter that conclusion: rather, it confirms the understanding of the ECT's signatories that FET is not equal to MST.670\n\nC-III \u00a7 379; *Liman v.

Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n421.\n\nPer Article 2 of the ECT, the terms of the ECT must be analyzed in accordance with their common meaning in their context and in light of the object and purpose of the ECT.680 Ultimately, the ECT was an attempt to export the energy market model that existed in the EU beyond its frontiers681 and aimed to create an efficient energy market that (1) would grant foreign investors domestic or non-discriminatory treatment that would be no worse than the MST and (2) would foster market-oriented price formation.682 Where Article 10(1) obliges investments already made to be granted \"*treatment no less favorable than that required by International Law*\", it is referring to the MST.683\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 979 \u2013 980; C-I \u00a7 632.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 982 \u2013 983; ECT, Preamble, Objectives, p. 8 **[RL-0006]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 984 \u2013 985; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 31, 1046 \u2013 1053, 1060, 1095; ECT, Title I **[RL-0006]** (for citations in French, *see* p. 7) **[RL-0007]**, Italian *see* p. 7 **[RL-0008]** ; German *see* p. 9 **[RL-0009]** ; \"*The Energy Charter Treaty: A Reader's Guide*\", Energy Charter Secretariat, p. 16 **[RL-0053]** ; \"The Energy Charter Treaty and Related Documents\", 17 December 1991, Consolidated version, TITLE I Objectives, p. 8, 15 **[RL-0073]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7 990.\n\n422.\n\nRespondent states that \"*the FET minimum standard is the common standard in investment treaties*\", and it is not admissible to claim that the ECT introduced a standard that is superior to that existing in other treaties.684 The ECT's greatest ambition is non-discrimination, though that has not yet been fully achieved.685 Respondent explains that \"*the maximum aspiration of the ECT is national treatment, as this treatment is applied to foreign investments when it is more favorable to foreign investors than the FET standard*.\"686 The FET minimum standard is the common standard in investment treaties, and it is not admissible to claim that the ECT introduced a standard that is superior to that existing in other treaties.687\n\nR-II \u00a7 1049.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 986, 989; *International Investment under the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty\"* in T W W\u00e4lde The Energy Charter Treaty: An East-West Gateway for Investment and Trade (Kluwer Law International, 1996) **[RL-0051]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 1062.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 1061; *International Investment under the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty\"* in T W W\u00e4lde The Energy Charter Treaty: An East-West Gateway for Investment and Trade (Kluwer Law International, 1996) **[RL-0051]**.\n\n423.\n\nFor the period prior to investment, national and MFN treatment were reserved for the signing of a \"*supplemental treaty*\", which still has not been signed. For the moment after the investment is made, the guarantee of national treatment and the MFN clause apply to the foreign investor, with limitations.688 This guarantee of national treatment is subject to an exception related to the payment of subsides and public aid.689 This Article 10(8) exception is applicable to this case, where Claimants are claiming the payment of subsidies or State Aid for the production of energy. The \"*supplementary treaty*\" referred to in Article 10(8) has not been signed, and there is no obligation for signatory states of the ECT to grant foreign investors \"*national treatment*\" in the matter of programs by which a Contracting Party provides grants or \"*other financial assistance*\" to the investor.690 In regulating state subsidies to promote trade or investment abroad, Article 9(4) of the ECT provides that nothing in Article 9 shall prevent a Contracting Party from taking measures.691\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 986 \u2013 988; *\"An Overview of the Energy Charter Treaty\"*, C Bamberger, in T W W\u00e4lde (ed), The Energy Charter Treaty: An East-West Gateway for Investment and Trade, (Kluwer Law International, 1996) **[RL-0052]** ; \"*Investment Arbitration Under the Energy Charter Treaty: From Dispute Settlement to Treaty Implementation*\", T.

The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n424.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT provides:\n\n*Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party. (footnotes omitted)*\n\n425.\n\nThe \"*commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment\"* (FET) is mentioned expressly as a separate obligation, as is indicated by the word \"*also*\" introducing the obligation that follows. The express inclusion of this commitment in Article 10 also clarifies that its standard is autonomous, and beyond the MST. As clarified in *Liman v. Kazakhstan,* had the Contracting Parties to the ECT intended to limit their FET obligations to the MST, they could and would have made that intention clear.692\n\nC-III \u00a7 379; *Liman v. Kazakhstan*, \u00a7 263 **[CL-0073]**.\n\n426.\n\nAs the same wording for FET is found in a great number of BITs, for the present case, it will have to be interpreted taking note of the large jurisprudence established in this regard. In that jurisprudence, it is generally recognized, and the present Tribunal agrees, that the FET commitment in particular includes the respect of the legitimate expectations of the investor. As clarified in *Electrabel*, \"*[f]air and equitable treatment is connected in the ECT to the encouragement to provide stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions for investors*.\"693 And as the same tribunal stated, \"*[i]t is widely accepted that the most important function of the fair and equitable treatment standard is the protection of the investor's reasonable and legitimate expectations*.\"694 The Tribunal also notes that other arbitral tribunals have considered the protection of legitimate investor expectations as even the \"*dominant*\"695 or \"*primary element*\",696 the \"*dominant feature*\",697 or \"*one of the major components*\"698 of FET.\n\n*Electrabel v.

Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n427.\n\nThe most important function of the FET standard is the protection of the investor's legitimate and reasonable expectations.699 Legitimate expectations are part of the normative content of FET, and these are created when a State's conduct is such that an investor may reasonably rely on that conduct as being consistent. Prof. Dolzer identified five requirements for a successful FET claim grounded on legitimate expectations: (1) the objective conduct of the host State inducing legitimate expectations on the part of the foreign investor; (2) reliance on that conduct on the part of the foreign investor; (3) frustration of investor's legitimate expectations by subsequent conduct of the host State; (4) unilateralism of conduct of the host State; and (5) damages for the investor.700 Commitments, promises, or assurances attributable to the competent organs or representatives of the host State, whether explicit or implicit, general or specific, even where contained in the State's domestic legislation, may create legitimate expectations in investors.701\n\nC-I \u00a7 639; *see e.g.* *Anatolie Stati, Gabriel Stati, Ascom Group S.A. and Terra Raf Trans Traiding Ltd v.

RD 661/2007 increased the FITs by 82% with respect to RD 436/2004.742 This change is why ECO 3 was not divided into smaller facilities: the developer relied on the increased RD 661/2007 FITs for PV plants over 100kW and up to 10 MWs.743 Thus, neither Deutsche Bank nor Claimants relied on the 1.5 \u2013 2% return rate of RD 436/2004. Rather, Deutsche Bank's expectations would have been to obtain a return of 6.7 \u2013 8.2% for both projects under RD 436/2004 or 6.5% \u2013 8 8% (El Paso) and 7.1 \u2013 7.7% (ECO 3) under RD 661/2007.744 Further, Claimants' investments were made between July 2008 and July 2009, in full reliance upon the fact that the PV plants were finally registered in the RAIPRE under RD 661/2007 and granted the RD 661/2007 FIT economic rights.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 32.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 33 \u2013 34, 40 \u2013 43; CPHB-II \u00a7\u00a7 9, 11; RPHB-I \u00a7 37; Cuatrecasas, \"Opinion in the interest of DEUTSCHE BANK.

Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n450.\n\nUnder a rational and objective understanding of the Spanish regulatory framework, the only expectation that an investor could have is that of recovering the costs linked to the electricity produced by an efficient and well-managed company, and to obtain a reasonable rate of return.773 The following principles constitute the objective legitimate expectations of a diligent investor:774\n\n*(1) The regulatory system governed by the principle of regulatory hierarchy and the result of legally stipulated regulation creation procedures.*\n\n*(2) The regulatory framework is not limited to RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010 as claimed by the Claimant. It is configured from Act 54/1997 and the regulations which developed it, as interpreted by case-law.*\n\n*(3) The fundamental principle that subsidies to the SR are a cost of the SES, secondary to the principle of economic sustainability of the same.*\n\n*(4) Right to priority of access and dispatch of electricity production.*\n\n*(5) That the remuneration of the SR consists of a subsidy which, once added to the market price, provides RE Plants with a reasonable rate of return, in the context of its entire lifespan, according to capital markets, which has a dynamic and balanced nature within the SES. This return was linked to the cost made in the construction and operation of the plants.*\n\n*(6) That the subsidies were determined according to the evolution of the demand and other basic economic data, expressed in the Renewable Energy Plans on the investment and operation costs of standard facilities, with a view to ensuring that these facilities are able to reach a reasonable rate of return during their useful lives.*\n\n*(7) That the regulatory changes in the remuneration regime of the RE since 2007 have been motivated (i) to correct situations of over-remuneration, or (ii) or by the strong variation in the economic data that served as the basis for the estimation of subsidies*.\n\nR-II \u00a7 1122.\n\nR-I \u00a71060 (internal citations omitted).\n\n451.\n\nThe only reasonable and objective expectation that Claimants could have had at the time of investment would have been the recovery of the CAPEX, OPEX and the obtaining of a reasonable rate of return to the regulatory useful life of the Plants of not more than 25 years.775 This return is still received by Claimants' PV Plants.776 Respondent did not commit to never modifying the subsidies of RD 661/2007, and Respondent continues to guarantee the recovery of the investment and obtaining a reasonable return for its RE plants through public subsidies that allow a facility to achieve a return of 7.4 % before taxes. This rate of return is converted into 8.6 % after taxes for the asset portfolio of the Claimant subject to this arbitration.777\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 41 \u2013 42; Respondent's Closing Statements, Slides 76-85; Brattle Rebuttal Report, Appendix B; Tr.

Romania* case has no identity of reason with this case, since *Micula* does not apply the ECT or take into account the objects or principles thereof.823 Unlike here, in *Micula* there was an offer aimed at investors.824 Further, whereas *Micula* concluded that Romania never warned of the possible elimination of the established aid,825 Respondent has proven that, since 2006 when it intervened through RD-Law 7/2006, it would intervene in cases of over-remuneration or market distortion. Spain successively amended the remuneration mechanisms while respecting the essential elements established in the Act 54/1997,826 which established the objective of the subsidized system: \"*for the purpose of achieving Reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money on the capital market*.\"827 Respondent states that Act 40/1994 and Act 54/1997 both focused on the financial self-sufficiency of the SES.828 Respondent has, thus, given warning *ab initio* of the limits placed on the receipt of subsidies: obtaining a reasonable return. Removal of the subsidies, thus, was not arbitrary or discretionary: the implementation of the limit was pre-determined by law.829 Brattle also recognized that each of the RDs approved since 1998 have applied different payment methods, indexes, installation types. The only elements that have been maintained are (1) the methodology of using standard installations, (2) the principle of reasonable rate of return, and (3) priority of dispatch.830 At the Hearing, Brattle's expert confirmed that he assumed that the expected reasonable rate of return at the time of the investment was 7%.831\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 1089.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 1094 \u2013 1096; *Micula v.

Claimants' investments were made in 2008 \u2013 2009, during a period of economic crisis where all efforts of the regulator were focused on reducing the Tariff Deficit, while increasing revenues of the SES and lowering its costs and respecting commitments assumed by Spain with the EU in terms of the promotion of RE.856 Claimants' argument that Respondent promoted RE in order to alleviate or soften the crisis is without basis: promoting the most expensive technologies during a crisis is counter-intuitive. Regardless, Respondent was forbidden by the EU from applying such type of economic policy of higher government spending.857 The Hearing confirmed that the greenfield investment in Claimants' plants was decided under RD 436/2004, meaning that RD 661/2007 was not crucial for Claimants and their predecessors.858 Claimants are brownfield investors that consciously take the risk of investing in the middle of a crisis, when the disputed measures were foreseeable and assuming that they would obtain a lower return than that expected by a greenfield investor. Claimants' experts asserted that the reasonable expectation at the time of the construction of the PV Plans and their investment varied between 1.5% and 7% IRR.859\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7\u00a7 36 \u2013 37, RPHB-I \u00a7 8.\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7\u00a7 34 \u2013 35; CPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 38 \u2013 39.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 36; 130 (*stating* that *Novenergia* refers to a greenfield investment); Respondent's Closing, slides 52 and 53; Tr.

According to Respondent, the *Charanne* Tribunal agreed that the RD 661/2007 tariffs were designed taking into account the same operations used in RD-Law 14/2010. The elimination of the subsidy above the threshold is merely an elimination of windfall profits, since the tariff was calculated using that hours reference.860\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7 40.\n\n475.\n\nThe *Eiser* Award recognized the State's right to regulate in the absence of specific commitments, it considered that the Kingdom of Spain infringed the FET's \"[\u2026] *obligation to provide fundamental stability in the essential characteristics of the legal regime* [\u2026]\"861*Eiser* rejected Claimants' claim that RD 661/2007 gave them immutable economic rights that could not be altered by changes in the regulatory regime.862*Isolux*, however, considered that \"[\u2026] *the government has the power and the duty to adopt to the economic and technical needs of the moment, within the LSE framework*.\"863 While *Charanne* and *Antin* recognized the essential characteristics of the supportive Scheme,864 the *Eiser* Award inconsistently ignored this, and the *Novenergia* Award failed to specify which were the essential characteristics of the supportive scheme.865\n\nR-II \u00a7 1169; *Eiser v.

For all the reasons, the Respondent encourages this Arbitral Tribunal to completely ignore this flawed award, when resolving the present dispute*.871\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 190.\n\n**c. European Commission**\n--------------------------\n\n479.\n\nShould the Tribunal consider that it is competent to hear the case, the EC invites the Tribunal to interpret the FET standard and the umbrella clause harmoniously with EU law. In that context, the Spanish Supreme Court, as an ordinary judge of EU law, has found that the principles of non-retroactivity and legitimate expectations have not been violated by the Contested Measures and that, in principle, there can be no legitimate expectation regarding unlawful State Aid.872\n\nEC \u00a7 150.\n\n**d. The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n480.\n\nOf the many arguments submitted by the Parties regarding FET and legitimate expectations, including those submitted in the many other similar arbitrations between investors and Spain on which the Parties have commented particularly in reply to the questions raised by the Tribunal in section 2.1.2.b. of PO-6, the present Tribunal will only focus on those issues which it considers determinative for its decision in the present case.\n\n481.\n\nClaimants focus on RD 661/2007 as creating their legitimate expectations coupled with various separate assurances and promises. Legitimate expectations require reasonable reliance of investors on host state acts; the more specific they are directed towards the investors the more likely they can be considered to be reasonable and thus protected. The Tribunal considers that it is crucial to establish whether RD 661/2007 itself contained a stability promise or otherwise whether the assurances were indeed given by appropriate high-level organs of the state.\n\n482.\n\nArticle 44(3) of RD 661/2007 provides:\n\n*The revisions of the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated in this section shall not affect facilities for which the commissioning certificate had been granted prior to January 1 of the second year following the year in which the revision had been performed.*\n\n483.\n\nIn view of this provision, for the present case, the RAIPRE registration is an important additional element in order to assess the legitimate expectations of the investors. In this respect, the Tribunal notes the view of the *Masdar* tribunal, which expressly left open the possibility that Article 44(3)'s stabilization promise could constitute a \"*specific commitment*\" by Spain, which would create \"*legitimate expectations that the benefits granted by RD661/2007 would remain unaltered*.\"873 Such a stabilization promise could be perfected by the registration of the RE plants to receive the preferential FIT under RD 661/2007. However, the *Masdar* tribunal did not need to decide whether the legislative commitment alone could give rise to legitimate expectations, because there were other commitments.\n\n*Masdar*, \u00a7 489 \u2013 503; 521 **[CL-0220]** ; *compare* *Philip Morris Brands S\u00c0RL, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A., Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7 Final Award 8 July 2016 (hereinafter \"*Philip Morris v. Uruguay*\"), \u00a7 426 **[RL-0088]**.\n\n484.\n\nClaimants' investments were made between July 2008 and July 2009, in reliance upon the fact that the PV plants were finally registered in the RAIPRE under RD 661/2007 and granted the RD 661/2007 FIT economic rights. Thus, the formal registration led to the investors' entitlement to receive the benefits under RD 661/2007 (including not being subject to regulatory change).\n\n485.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, has no doubt that the stabilization assurance given in Article 44(3) is applicable for the investments by Claimants. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a more explicit stabilization assurance than the one mentioned in Article 44(3): \"*revisions [\u2026] shall not affect facilities for which the functioning certificate had been granted*.\" As put by the *Novenergia* tribunal, \"*RD 661/2007 was so adamantly clear that its understanding by common readers did not require a particularly sophisticated analysis*.\"874 The Tribunal, thus, agrees that investors could perfect a right to the remuneration set forth by the Spanish legislator, and this is consistent with the Spanish legislator's expressed intention: changes in law were, indeed, contemplated within the express text of RD 661/2007 by its reference to \"*revisions*\", and the contemplated effect of such changes were that these \"*shall not affect facilities for which the functioning certificate has been granted*.\" There is no question as to the State's right to regulate, which has not been challenged. There is no dispute that the laws changed in the past and would change in the future. This was expressly contemplated and accounted for within Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, which laid out the consequences of such changes. Taken in this context, Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 contained an express stability commitment that served its purpose of inducing investment in part by shielding investors in Claimants' position from legislative or regulatory changes (including the ones complained of in this matter). The Tribunal, thus, respects the legislative authority of the Respondent State by giving effect to each of the terms in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, including its assurance that \"*revisions [\u2026] shall not affect facilities for which the functioning certificate had been granted* [\u2026]\" The Claimants must have been able to rely on the measures aimed at encouraging the use of renewable and other new technologies and at inducing and protecting their investment. The Tribunal notes that its interpretation of Article 44(3) RD 661/2007 is also shared by other tribunals. For instance, the *Novenergia* tribunal found that the Spanish legislation and regulation *\"created a very favourable investment. climate for [renewable energy] investors, and the nucleus of such investment climate was the Special Regime*\"875 which included \"*statements or assurances*\"876 which in the view of that tribunal \"*were indeed aimed at incentivising companies to invest heavily in the Spanish electricity sector*\" \u2013 mostly through a guaranteed Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) in Royal Decree (RD) 661/2007 \u2013 and the tribunal found \"*that the Claimant made its investment in reliance of the terms provided in RD 661/2007*.\"877 This led the *Novenergia* tribunal to conclude that the investor's \"*initial expectations were legitimate since there was nothing to contradict the guaranteed FIT in RD 661/2007 [\u2026]. In other words, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant had a legitimate and reasonable expectation that there would not be any radical or fundamental changes to the Special Regime as set out in RD 661/2007*.\"878 Also the tribunal in *Antin* found that the Spanish regulatory regime, as a sufficiently specific one, triggered legitimate expectations of stability. It found that provisions in RD 661/2007 and other parts of the renewable energy regime were \"*contemporary representations that '[f]uture tariff revisions shall not be applied to already functioning facilities' [which] give rise to legitimate expectations of the Claimants*.\"879\n\n*Novenergia*, \u00a7 679 **[CL-0213]**.\n\n*Id.* at \u00a7 665.\n\n*Id*. at 666.\n\n*Id*. at 667.\n\n*Id*. at 681.\n\n*Antin*, \u00a7 552 **[CL-0222]**.\n\n486.\n\nIn view of this applicability of RD 661/2007 for the Claimants' investments, it is not determinative how relevant Claimants' reliance on the Cuatrecasas Due Diligence Report of October 2007 was. However, the Tribunal notes that RD 661/2007 was the only regulation analyzed by that Report, which \u2013 while prepared for the benefit of Deutsche Bank as the developer \u2013 was later shared with Claimants.880 The Tribunal agrees with the decision in *Novenergia*, accepting the requirement of \"*an adequate due diligence prior to making its investment*\", was met when it held that the investor did, in fact, \"*carry out a reasonable analysis of the Spanish regulatory framework prior to its investment*.\"881 It also agrees with the assessment of the tribunal in *Antin* which held that it \"*[\u2026] must consider when the investment was made, what the circumstances were at that time and the information that the investor had or should reasonably have had, had it acted with the requisite degree of diligence (considering its expertise). In carrying out this assessment, tribunals must attempt to place themselves at the time of the investment and consider the information and conditions available at such time, and to refrain from appraising the investor's expectations with the benefit of hindsight*.\"882 It also agrees with the reasoning of the *Antaris* tribunal that the absence of \"*real due diligence*\" on the part of the investors would vitiate a legitimate expectations claim.883\n\nCuatrecasas, \"Opinion in the interest of DEUTSCHE BANK. Applicable structure for PV projects in Spain *\",* of October 2007 **[C-0095]** / **[Document 11 CWS-LB]** / **[Document 09 CWS-PK]**.\n\n*Novenergia*, \u00a7 679 **[CL-0213]**.\n\n*Antin*, \u00a7 537 **[CL-0222]**.\n\n*Antaris Solar GmbH and Dr. Michael G\u00f6de* v. *Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2014-01, 2 May 2018, \u00a7 434.\n\n487.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal does not see a lack of due diligence by the Claimants. Both Claimants did what could be expected under the circumstances and at the time of their investments by a prudent investor. Claimants' reliance on a Legal Opinion by Cuatrecasas was also sufficient at least in confirming their expectations, because the Tribunal cannot see what other better means of information they could have obtained than that provided by what seems to have been the most competent law firm for these matters in Spain. The Tribunal also does not see a conflict of interest in the law firm's acting first for Deutsche Bank or later as Claimants' counsel in these proceedings. Rather, in view of its earlier engagement in this highly complex matter, it seems understandable that its advice was used later as well. In that context for the relevance of the information provided it is irrelevant whether such information was provided to Deutsche Bank or to Claimants directly. The Claimants had no reason to think that the Report for Deutsche Bank was incorrect or was outdated by the time they became aware of it. Further, a direct contact by Claimants, who were not familiar with the details of the relevant parts of Spanish law, to the Spanish authorities would certainly not have been able to provide better information. In particular, it has not been shown and cannot be argued that any further steps to achieve information would have resulted in an expectation that new measures which later were issued in 2014 were to be issued by the State which would fundamentally withdraw the assurances and benefits provided by the State such as in RD 661/2017. This reliance on RD 661/2007 is not changed by the answer given by Claimants and bank-witness during the hearing to the question raised by Arbitrator Sands884 whether they had inquired about possible future changes of the regulations. There was no need for such an enquiry by Claimant, because Article 44(3) expressly excluded such changes by the words \"*shall not affect facilities for which the commissioning certificate had been granted.*\" This conclusion is not altered by Respondent's arguments related to the alleged understanding of other participants in the RE market (many of which have brought claims against Spain), Respondent's views on EU state aid law, and the Claimants' internal documents that Respondent argues show awareness of regulatory risk.\n\nTr. Day 2 at pages 63 \u2013 73 (exchange between Philippe Sands and Peter Kofmel) and pages 73 \u2013 74 (exchange between August Reinisch and Peter Kofmel).\n\n488.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent's contention that the reasonable expectation varied between rates of return of 1.5 and 2% both in the case of Deutsche Bank and in the case of Claimants. Deutsche Bank and the Claimants planned to invest in the plants with the 6.7 \u2013 8.2% return range, by staggering PV plants to legitimately optimize FIT remuneration.885 RD 661/2007, however, put an end to the difference in remuneration, and fundamentally changed and assured the profitability of the investments.886\n\nCuatrecasas, \"Opinion in the interest of Deutsche Bank.

The Majority's Comment on Prof. Sands' Dissent**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nThe majority fully understands that sometimes one member of a tribunal concludes that it should express its disagreement with certain aspects of the reasoning of the other two members. Regarding the Dissent by Co-Arbitrator Prof. Sands, the majority feels it should point out the following: First of all, paragraphs 4 and 480 are recalled which clarify that, throughout this Award, the Tribunal, without repeating all the arguments advanced by the Parties, addresses only what the Tribunal considers to be the determinative factors required to decide on the Requests of the Parties, and that, regarding FET and legitimate expectations, the present Tribunal only focuses on those issues, including those in the many other similar arbitrations between investors and Spain on which the Parties have commented particularly in reply to the questions raised by the Tribunal in section 2.1.2.b. of PO-6, which it considers determinative for its decision in the present case. The Dissent partly contains a different evaluation of the evidence and of the legal reasoning. However, also, in so far as the Dissent refers to reasoning in the Award, a mere re-reading of that reasoning in the Award shows that a number of such references are incorrect, out of context, or misleading. In particular, the Dissent several times alleges that the Award does not take into account the relevant case law. In fact, the Award does refer to and relies on the by now many awards issued in the parallel Spanish renewable energy cases addressing almost the same factual and legal scenarios as in the present case while the Dissent relies on cases dealing with very different factual and legal scenarios without explaining why these should nevertheless be more relevant for and prevail for the present case over the awards in the Spanish cases. Further, contrary to what the Dissent alleges, the Award (in paragraphs 481 to 485) does explain the legal standard for legitimate expectations as part of FET in the ECT and refers to respective jurisprudence on the same Spanish measures in what it considered the closest comparable cases. Further, contrary to what is said in the Dissent, the Award (in paragraphs 486 and 487) does explain why it evaluates the evidence in the file to the effect that sufficient due diligence was applied by the Claimants and why it sees no conflict regarding the involvement of the Cuatrecasas law firm. Finally, while the Dissent claims that the Award does not respect the decisions of the Spanish courts, it fails to explain why these should change the reasoning of the present Tribunal regarding the application and interpretation of the ECT. The Tribunal need not and does not take any view as to the correctness of the decisions of the Spanish Supreme Court, which the Parties agree the Tribunal must accept as fact.889 The majority agrees with Claimants' view that the cited Spanish Supreme Court decisions that were issued before Claimants' investment concerned issues and laws that are not relevant to the interpretation of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007,890 and cannot be applied thereto by analogy.891 The later occurring Supreme Court judgments are not relevant to the question of Claimants' expectations at the time of investment in 2008 and 2009.892 Finding them irrelevant, the Tribunal makes no statement whatsoever as to the correctness of those decisions.\n\nR-II \u00a7 100; C-II \u00a7 59.\n\n*See e.g.* Judgment from the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court, of 15 December 2005 **[R-0117]** (analysis limited to the validity of RD 436/2004); Judgment from the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 25 October 2006, appeal 12/2005, reference El Derecho EDJ 2006/282164 (Spanish) **[R-0118]** (*concerning* an administrative appeal seeking annulment of provisions of RD 2351/2004); Judgment from the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court, 20 March 2007, Appeal 11/2005 EDJ 2007/18059 **[R-0119]** (*concerning* RD 2392/2004); Judgment from the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court, 9 October 2007, Appeal 13/2006 EDJ 2007/175313 **[R-0120]** (*relating* to an administrative appeal of provisions of RD 1454/2005, amending RD 436/2004).\n\nJudgment from the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court, 3 December 2009, Appeal 151/2007 EDJ 2009/307349 **[R-0121]** ; Judgment from the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court, 9 December 2009, rec. 152/2007, reference El Derecho EDJ 2009/307357 **[R-0122]**.\n\nC-I \u00a7 191; *see also* fn 198; Judgment from the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of 25 June 2013 (RJ/2013/5644) appeal 259/2012 **[R-0131]** ; Judgment 63/2016, of 21 January 2016, of the Supreme Court handed down in cassation appeal 627/2012 **[R-0135]**.\n\n**2.

Respondent opted for Option (1) when creating RD 661/2007. There, Respondent put into place a regime defining and fixing feed-in values according to the cost of money on capital markets at that point in time, and provided that those values would be updated annually according to inflation.913 RD 661/2007 set remuneration for the lifetime of the plant.914 Through its regulatory offer, Respondent assumed an obligation of regulatory stability, which resulted in the boosting of renewable investments in Spain and gave rise to legitimate expectations of stability under the ECT.915\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 27.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 28; Tr.

Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n499.\n\nBy reference to Article 2 of the ECT, Article 2 of the European Energy Charter should be considered as an applicable regulation. The ECT establishes protection measures for investments and investors that limit the regulatory power of the signatory States to achieve that objective. Arbitral precedent confirms that the efficiency of the market, the interest of the investors, and the burdens of the consumers in the energy market must be weighed.922 The ECT does not prevent States from exercising macroeconomic control power.923\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1105 \u2013 1107; *Electrabel v. Hungary*, Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 7.165 **[CL-0094] / [RL-0002]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7 983; R-II \u00a7 1059; ECT, Title 1 \"OBJECTIVES\" **[RL-0006]** ; \"The Energy Charter Treaty and Related Documents\", 17 December 1991, Consolidated version, 8 **[RL-0073]**.\n\n500.\n\nPrecedents applying the ECT incorporate the guarantee of granting stable and transparent conditions within the FET standard.924 States may adopt reasonable and proportionate macroeconomic control measures to avoid distortions of the market, even if such affect the returns of investors.925 In the absence of a specific commitment to stability, an Investor cannot have an expectation that a regulatory framework will not be amended. While Article 10(1) alludes to \"*stable conditions*\", States that are party to the ECT are not required to maintain a predictable regulatory Framework during any investment.926 Maintaining stable conditions cannot be understood as the ECT requiring the grandfathering of regulatory frameworks for investors, such that any changes in the regulatory framework are deemed unforeseeable or arbitrary.927 Interpreted in its context and in accordance with its subject matter (i.e. energy, a strategic and highly regulated sector), it is not realistic for the Parties to the ECT to have agreed to provide an \"*Insurance Policy*\" to foreign investors that would protect them against regulatory reforms adopted for reasons of public interest. The ECT's application of National Treatment and FET must consider the established facts and interests of (1) investors, (2) States, and (3) consumers.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1077 \u2013 1081; *Plama v.

The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n508.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with both Parties and the tribunals in *Antin*, *Masdar*, *Novenergia*, and *Eiser* that Article 10(1) of the ECT includes an obligation to provide fundamental stability of the economic and legal regime in place, and that the FET protects against changes in the \"*essential characteristics of the regulatory regime relied upon by investors*.\"952\n\nCPHB-I page 44 (line 3) (*citing* *Antin*, \u00a7\u00a7 531 \u2013 533 **[CL-0222]** ; *Masdar*, \u00a7\u00a7 482 \u2013 484 **[CL-0220]** ; *Novenergia*, \u00a7 654 \u2013 656, 694 \u2013 698 **[CL-0213]**, *Eiser*, \u00a7\u00a7 363, 382 \u2013 387 **[CL-0148]** / **[RL-0077]** / **[RL-0078]**); *see also* R-I \u00a7\u00a7 1087 \u2013 1089 (*citing* *Plama v. Bulgaria*, \u00a7 219 **[CL-0011] / [RL-0034]**).\n\n509.\n\nIt is obvious that States are, in principle, free to change their regulatory framework for various business sectors. The issue is whether and to what extent the degree of the regulatory change was so radical that it amounts to a breach of the FET-inherent stability requirement. The Tribunal shares the approach formulated by the *Antin* tribunal, relying on *Charanne* and *Eiser*, which stated:\n\n*[\u2026] that the obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT to provide FET to protected investments comprises an obligation to afford fundamental stability in the essential characteristics of the legal regime relied upon by the investors in making long-term investments. This does not mean that the legal framework cannot evolve or that a State Party to the ECT is precluded from exercising its regulatory powers to adapt the regime to the changing circumstances in the public interest. It rather means that a regulatory regime specifically created to induce investments in the energy sector cannot be radically altered \u2013 i.e., stripped of its key features \u2013 as applied to existing investments in ways that affect investors who invested in reliance on those regimes*.953\n\n*Antin*, \u00a7 532 **[CL-0222]** (citations omitted).\n\n510.\n\nWhen addressing the extent of such a change, the issue of whether the Spanish measures aimed at tackling the tariff crisis were reasonable becomes particularly relevant. Mere reliance on an existing legislative framework may not be a sufficient element for claiming breach of legitimate expectations While sympathetic to the idea that States retain much leeway in deciding on reasonable measures, such discretion does not necessarily mean that a state is free to change the rules of the game it issued itself by express codification to such an extent as to burden particularly the investors who have already made investments and are unable to exit the regulatory framework. To provide a regulatory framework that aims at attracting investors in certain business sectors by offering various incentives is a common practice in many states. Dismantling such incentives for future investments may also be possible and occurs frequently.\n\n511.\n\nHowever, to do so for already existing investments to which the past incentives were the basis of investing can hardly be considered reasonable, especially when considering the legislator's express statement that the old regime should continue to apply to existing registered investments in spite of possible future changes.\n\n512.\n\nRespondent put into place a regime defining and fixing feed-in values according to the cost of money on capital markets at that point in time, and provided that those values would be updated annually according to inflation. RD 661/2007 set remuneration for the lifetime of the plant. Through its regulatory offer, Respondent assumed an obligation of regulatory stability, which resulted in the boosting of renewable investments in Spain and gave rise to legitimate expectations of stability under the ECT.\n\n513.\n\nThese expectations were clearly and fundamentally changed by the Disputed Measures, for which Claimants have claimed damages and over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction (*i.e*. RD 1565/2010, RD 14/2010; Act 2/2011, RD-Law 2/2013, RD-Law 9/2013; Act 24/2013, RD 413/2014, and MO IET 1045/2014), which breached the stable conditions promised by RD 661/2007. In this regard, the Tribunal concurs with the assessment of the 2013 \u2013 2014 Spanish measures in *Eiser* finding that \"*the ECT did protect Claimants against the total and unreasonable change that they experienced*\"954 and in *Novenergia* finding that the \"*radical changes enacted by the Kingdom of Spain in 2013 and 2014 have definitely abolished the fixed long-term FIT and have done so retroactively.*\"955 The Tribunal also notes that the tribunal in *Greentech*, expressly relying on *Eiser and Novenergia*, concluded that these Spanish regulatory changes were \"*radical and unexpected*\" and \"*constituted a fundamental change to the legal and regulatory framework that crossed the line from a non-compensable regulatory measure to a compensable breach of the FET standard in the ECT*.\"956\n\n*Eiser*, \u00a7\u00a7 363, 387 **[CL-0148]** / **[RL-0077]** / **[RL-0078]** (*finding* breach in the post-2013 Measures).\n\n*Novenergia*, \u00a7\u00a7 688, 697 **[CL-0213]** (*finding* breach in the post-2013 measures, and based on its finding that the claimant in that case could not have expected regulatory stability, finding that the 2010 Measures did not amount to an FET breach).\n\n*Greentech Energy Systems A/S and others* v. *The Kingdom of Spain*, SCC Case No. V2015/150, Final Award, 14 November 2018, \u00a7\u00a7 397 \u2013 398.\n\n**3.

There is a presumption that the Ministry has hidden these reports for purely political reasons.977 Claimants allege that Respondent was not prepared to accept the analysis by BCG and RB on standard parameters that would prevent the adoption of the retroactive cuts. Claimants allege that the experts did not validate the Respondent's methodology and instead criticized it, putting into risk the introduction of new retroactive cuts that Respondent was planning under the new Remuneration Model.978 Claimants were entitled to expect that the Ministry of Energy would provide investors the information that was compiled and used to calculate the standard installations. It is unclear whether Respondent relied on any documents submitted with the BCG-RB Reports to elaborate the Disputed Measures.979 Respondent's decision not to disclose these reports cannot be traced to the legal framework and is therefore arbitrary and contrary to the ECT.980 Respondent's failure to disclose the BCG Report and the RB Report during the consultation procedure of draft MO IET/1045/2014 was both arbitrary and non-transparent.981 Claimants allege that, ultimately, IDAE decided not to use the BCG-RB reports when it determined the values for each installation under MO IET/1045/2014.982 Claimants argue that the reports that post-date are evidence of wrongdoing.983\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 523; Judgment of the Supreme Court (Contentious-Administrative Chamber, Section Three) 570/2017, Appeal 607/2014, of 3 April 2017, 20 \u2013 21 **[C-0293]** ; IDAE, \"*Informe.

Drafts of reforms were available for public comment. The lack of delivery of the Reports by BCG and RB is insignificant, and Claimant acknowledges that the RB report was subsequent to MO IET/1045/2014. The publication of the BCG and RB reports is meaningless and has nothing to do with the transparency or consistency of an administration.990 What is relevant is that the interested entities were able to file pleadings and these pleadings were considered.991 The Council of State's Opinion on the draft of MO IET/1045/2014 was a non-mandatory report is one example of Respondent going above and beyond what was required to ensure that all interested parties have the opportunity to participate.992\n\nR-II \u00a7 966.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 1120 \u2013 1129; Act 24/2013, Art. 14.4 **[C-0116]** / **[R-0047]** ; Index of administrative file for Royal Decree 413/2014 **[R-0053]** ; RD 413/2014, Art. 20(1) **[C-0131]** / **[R-0080]** ; MO IET/1045/2014 **[R-0086]** / **[C-0126]** / **[C-0126bis]** ; Judgment from the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court, of 16 March 2015, appeal 118/2013, reference CENDOJ: 280779130032015100072 **[R-0133]** (*setting* out the processing, with the participation of the whole sector, and the restart of its processing as a result of the proposals admitted); First Witness Statement of Carlos Montoya (9 March 2017) (hereinafter \"First Montoya Statement\"), \u00a7 7.\n\nR-I \u00a7 912; *see e.g.* Council of State, dated 12 June 2014, Opinion on draft Order by which the retributive parameters of the standard facilities applicable to certain installations for the production of electrical energy from renewable energy sources; cogeneration and waste **[C-0277** / **R-0098]**.\n\n523.\n\nRespondent also notes that, following this processing of RD 413/2014 and MO IET 1045/2014, \"*the amounts recognized as Investment Costs and Operating Costs of the RE plants of the Claimant are higher than the actual cost of investment and operation of such RE plants*.\"993\n\nR-I \u00a7 1128.\n\n**c. The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n524.\n\nThe Tribunal doubts that host states should generally be required to inform investors of any change of their regulatory framework. On the other hand, there may indeed be such scenarios as found by the *Micula* tribunal, finding a breach of fair and equitable treatment, by stating that Romania had also acted in a manner amounting to a lack of transparency in so far as it had failed \"*to inform the Claimants in a timely manner that the regime would be terminated prior to its stated date of expiration*.\"994 By analogy, even where there is no stated date expiration (though Claimants claim 25 years) a significant change of the FIT regime may be considered as giving rise to notice requirements. Further, the Tribunal notes that the FET clause of the ECT, Article 10(1) expressly obliges host states to \"*create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for investors.\"*\n\n*Micula* v. *Romania*, \u00a7 872 **[RL-0028]** / **[CL-0099]**.\n\n525.\n\nIn the present case, starting in 2010 when Respondent introduced the first round of harmful measures (RD 1565/2010 and RD-L 14/2010), the Council of State's Opinion on the draft of MO IET/1045/2014 confirmed that the Ministry of Energy never explained how it calculated the economic parameters included in the draft and expressed that Respondent's new regulatory framework represented a sudden switch.995 The Spanish Supreme Court later found that Respondent committed serious mistakes in MO IET/1045/2014.996\n\nCouncil of State, dated 12 June 2014, Opinion on draft Order by which the retributive parameters of the standard facilities applicable to certain installations for the production of electrical energy from renewable energy sources; cogeneration and waste, 13 **[C-0277** / **R-0098]**.\n\nSpanish Supreme Court's Judgment No. 1463/2016, of 20 June 2016 **[C-0205]** ; Spanish Supreme Court's Judgment No. 2059/2016, of 12 May 2016 **[C-0206]**.\n\n526.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal doubts that this regulatory process by itself could be considered as lack of transparency constituting a breach of the FET commitment in Article 10(1) of the ECT. However, there is no need for the Tribunal to take a final decision in this regard, as irrespective thereof, the breaches of Claimants' legitimate expectations and the FET standard found above by the Tribunal remain.\n\n**4. Proportionality**\n----------------------\n\n**a. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n527.\n\nThe FET standard contains an obligation of proportionality, and this applies to both administrative acts and to the promulgation of legislation and regulations.997 The requirement of proportionality is well established in Spanish Law.998 The Tribunal could use the test from *Occidental v. Ecuador*, where the tribunal found that the state's actions were disproportionate and in breach of the FET standard in the US-Ecuador BIT because (1) other, less restrictive measures could have adopted and (2) the harm to the investor was out of proportion to the benefit of the state.999 That tribunal followed a proportionality analysis characterized as \"*one of overall judgment, balancing the interest of the State against those of the individual to assess whether the particular sanction is a proportionate response in the circumstances*\" and used a 4-stage test, considering cumulatively \"[1] *the legitimacy of the state's aim;* [2] *whether the measure that the state adopted was suitable and reasonably connected to the objective it pursued;* [3] *whether the measure that the state adopted was necessary (i.e., it was the least restrictive measure available to achieve the state's aim); and* [4] *whether the effects of the measure were disproportionate or excessive in relation to the interests involved (i.e., whether the benefit of realizing the state's aim exceeded the harm caused to the investors' rights).*\"1000\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 735 \u2013 736; C-III \u00a7 537; *Charanne*, \u00a7\u00a7 514, 517 **[CL-0030] / [RL-0049]** ; *MTD v.

Claimants did not contribute to this Tariff Deficit, but the Disputed Measures caused them damages, which reduced approximately 57% (OperaFund) and 75% (Schwab) the value of their investments.1003\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 406, 538; *compare Occidental v.

Here, Claimants' Majorca Plants and Badajoz Installation duly qualified under RD 661/2007 and had acquired economic rights thereunder. With the first elements met, Respondent has the burden of proving that it was necessary to modify the FIT. Respondent has not demonstrated that the Disputed Measures were necessary. The Disputed Measures were unnecessary because there were reasonable alternatives to them to achieve the same end.1005\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 539 \u2013 542; *Blusun v.

Rather, the Tariff Deficit is explained by Spain's systematic failure, since 2000 and despite repeated warnings, to comply with its own laws and to set electricity tariffs at a level that would be sufficient to cover the SES's actual regulated costs.1008 That Respondent continues to take actions that increase the Tariff Deficit, in contradiction of its stated goal of reducing it, underlines the lack of legitimate purpose in the Disputed Measure.1009*Second*, the fall in demand for electricity in 2008 cannot provide a valid justification for the Measures because (1) the commitment made in RD 661/2007 was for 25 years and (2) Spain bore the risk of future electricity demand.1010 The Disputed Measures were also disproportionate because, as Brattle has demonstrated, the reduction in demand was temporary. Respondent, thus, could have relied on temporary measures.1011*Third*, although the Disputed Measures have been effective in eliminating the Tariff Deficit, that does not mean that that was their aim. If that were their aim, following the elimination of the Tariff Deficit, Respondent could have attenuated the damage caused to the PASO and ECO 3 Projects, but has chosen not to, preferring instead to reduce tariffs for consumers.1012 The measures have no environmental purpose.1013 After the Hearing, Claimants noted that the Disputed Measures protect pollutant sources of energy and have halted new PV installations in Spain.1014\n\nC-I \u00a7 738; C-III \u00a7 550.\n\nC-III \u00a7 549.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 551 \u2013 552; C-I \u00a7 739; Act 54/1997, Art. 15(1), 17 **[C-0055]** ; RD-Law 6/2009 **[C-0268]** / **[R-0057]** ; CNE Report 2/2012, 4 **[R-0105]** / **[C-0214]** / **[C-0294]** ; Brattle, Regulatory Report, \u00a7\u00a7 17 \u2013 19, 112 \u2013 121 **[CER-0001]** ; Brattle, Regulatory Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 166 \u2013 178 **[CER-0003]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 553 \u2013 557; Act 24/2013, Art. 13 **[C-0116]** / **[R-0047]** ; Press report *\"Nadal afirma que la factura de la luz baja hasta un 10% con el recorte a las renovables\",* El Confidencial, 28 June 2017 **[C-0312]** ; Brattle, Regulatory Report, \u00a7 126 **[CER-0001]** ; \"Electricity Will Be Cheaper Next January\", *Cinco D\u00edas* press news, 17 November 2015 **[BRR-90]** ; \"The Final Superavit in 2014 in the Spanish Electricity System Will Amount to \u20ac650 Million\", *Cinco D\u00edas* press news, 17 November 2015 **[BRR-91]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 558 \u2013 561; Brattle, Regulatory Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 115 **[CER-0003]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 569 \u2013 570; Brattle, Regulatory Report, \u00a7\u00a7 137 \u2013 138 **[CER-0001]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 562 \u2013 564.\n\nC-I \u00a7 740; M.

These regulations stipulate all rights and obligations of operators, and any prudent investor should have a sufficient knowledge of that regulatory framework and its limits at the time of making an investment.1040 Although neither the Kyoto Protocol, nor the EU Directives or the ECT establish the means by which each country must reach their goals, such means may be chosen by the states, so long as they respect the limits of State Aid Regulation.1041 Here, the EC determined that Spanish subsidies for renewables constitute State Aid.1042 Subsidies to RE must be provided in relation to the goal to be met (i.e., to make RE able to compete), keeping in mind that there is no right to state aid \u2013 not even under the ECT.1043\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 102; Act 54/1997 **[C-0055bis]** / **[R-0059]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 102; Act 54/1997 **[C-0055bis]** / **[R-0059]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 103 \u2013 104; Directive 2001/77/EC, Recital 14 **[C-0057]** / **[RL-0015]** ; Directive 2009/28/EC **[RL-0017]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 104.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 105.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 106.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 107 \u2013 108; EC State Aid Decision (11 November 2017) **[RL-0080]** ; Response from the European Commission on 29 February 2016 to the request for investigation from the National Association of Renewable Energy Producers and Investors **[R-0160]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 109; Final Commission Decision C(2016) 7827, of 28 November 2016, regarding case number SA.40171 in the State Aid Register (2015/NN)\u2013 Czech Republic, \u00a7 92 **[RL-0070]**.\n\n539.\n\nAlready in 1997, Act 54/1997 limited Respondent's margin of appreciation by linking the provisions of a reasonable return by reference to the cost of money of Article 30(4).1044 Contemporaneous documentation and statements show that the main Spanish investors in the solar thermosolar sector and energy associations like AEE and APPA did not claim the immutability of the regulatory framework, but rather the application of the principle of reasonable return.1045 All measures adopted since Act 54/1997 have sought to adapt the remuneration for RE to the changing economic and technical circumstances, and none of these revisions were made within the four-year reviews of premiums and tariffs set forth in Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004 or RD 661/2007. All revisions were made within the limits of Act 54/1997 to guarantee the economic and technical sustainability of the SES and to avoid over-remuneration.1046 There can be no doubt that Claimants were aware that Respondent holds the discretionary power that requires it to adapt the regulatory framework to changing circumstances.1047\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 114.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 118; Helionoticias, 24 April 2013: \"Abengoa, FCC, Sacyr, Elecnor, Samca and Sener takes the Government to the Supreme Court due to the thermal and solar cutback\" **[R-0288]**.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 120.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 121; Respondent's Opening Statements, slides 160 \u2013 181; Public Deed notarizing the Common Terms of Agreement entered into by Paso-Palma Sol Gesti\u00f3n de Proyectos, S.L., OperaFund Eco-Invest Sicav p.l.c., Parque Fotovoltaico Mediterr\u00e1neo, S.L., Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg, S.A., of 28 January 2009, pp. 29, 40, 50, 75, 79, 82, 88 **[C-0060]** / **[Document 21 CWS-LB]** ; Senior Debt Contracts, p. 30 **[BQR-0076]**.\n\n540.\n\nUnder the ECT, as confirmed in *Electrabel*, the investors' interests must not unconditionally be placed above the rational and legitimate public policy of the host state.1048 Here, there was a rational policy and the Government's action was reasonable.1049 Using the test applied in *AES Summit* to determine whether a measure is rational and proportional in the sense of Article 10(1) of the ECT,1050 this Tribunal must consider (1) whether a rational policy having a public explanation and helping to achieve an objective of general interest exists and (2) whether the challenged measure helps to achieve the public interest that justifies its adoption.1051 Here, the unsustainability of the SES in the context of a severe international crisis and the over-remuneration in the RE sector were alleviated by the Challenged Measures.

The \"*need for regulatory adjustment and proportionality thereof*\" is not an invitation for the Tribunal to re-decide public interest or to second-guess the host state's policies, but rather the proportionality analysis must be carried out as if it were regarding a balance in comparison with the legitimate purpose that is intended through the measures.1062 The evaluation of proportionality in this case shows that Respondent acted rationally and proportionately in the face of public needs, while respecting the reasonable return of renewable energy producers.1063 In 2015, subsidies received by Claimants' plans accounted for 87.65% of their entire income.1064 The proportion of revenue attributable to subsidies throughout the entire regulatory life of Claimants' PV Plants is 88.14%.1065 This was recognized in *Eiser*, where the tribunal acknowledged the public interest policy that justified the challenged measures' adoption.1066\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1234 \u2013 1235.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 1236 \u2013 1241.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 1112; Second Montoya Statement, Figure 17.\n\nR-II \u00a7 1113; Second Montoya Statement, Figure 18.\n\nR-II \u00a7 1242; *Eiser*, \u00a7 371 **[CL-0148]** / **[RL-0077]** / **[RL-0078]** ; *see also Eiser*, Application for Annulment **[RL-0103]**.\n\n544.\n\nClaimants' proportionality analysis is based on a misrepresentation of the economic and social context in which the measures were adopted.1067 Respondent adopted the macroeconomic measures on the following reasonable grounds:\n\n*(1) The legal obligation to adjust the economic regime to the principle of reasonable rate of return for investors, thereby preventing over-remuneration that (i) would distort the free market that the ECT aims to create in an undue manner and (ii) would be contrary to EU Law;*\n\n*(2) The existence of public interest by the sustainability of the SES, in a context of a severe international crisis and with a sharp reduction in energy demand, affecting the RE Sector, which decreased the revenue of the SES and economically destabilised the SES, along with increased RE costs; and*\n\n*(3) The impossibility of passing the whole economic imbalance onto consumers. A consumer that paid EUR 370 on its electricity bill per year in 2003 paid a total of EUR 669 in 2012. The cumulative 81% increase over these years for receiving the same service is disproportionate. The greatest increases, however, took place in 2008 (10%), 2009 (10.1%) and 2011 (17.7%). The aforementioned increase has placed the electricity price in Spain among the most expensive in the European Union*.1068\n\nR-II \u00a7 1264.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 1069, *see also* R-II \u00a7\u00a7 1264 \u2013 1269.\n\n545.\n\nRespondent has never stated that the measures were adopted to address only the Tariff Deficit. It is a fallacy that Respondent contributed to producing the Tariff Deficit by not adopting measures to control it sooner. While it is not for the Tribunal to decide when and what policies Respondent should apply, Respondent adopted the measures required through RD-Law 7/2006 and RD 661/2007 diligently and in order to control the Tariff Deficit.1069 There is a correlation between the increase in the Tariff Deficit and the increase in the subsidies paid to PV generators,1070 and the tariff paid by consumers increased exponentially and beyond that in other EU countries since 2007, despite the severe international crisis affecting all European economies.1071\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 1270 \u2013 1275; *compare Wirtgen v.

The tariffs and premiums under RD 661/2007 were set out in PER 2005 \u2013 2010 and were established based on projected demand. Any prudent investor should have known that a sharp decrease in demand would result in a change of subsidies.1072 In addition to this drop in demand, CNE and the EC reported that RE plants were receiving higher than reasonable returns according to the cost of money on the capital market and as compared to the purpose of the subsidies, respectively.1073 Neither the Spanish economy nor electricity demand have recovered. Even if they had, the Disputed Measures are still necessary to contain the Tariff Deficit and to avoid situations of over- or under-remuneration that jeopardize the sustainability of the SES.1074\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1289 \u2013 1291; Act 54/1997, Art. 15 \u2013 16 **[C-0055bis]** / **[R-0059]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1292 \u2013 1295; Accuracy, First Economic Report, Figure 1 **[RER-0001]** ; Accuracy, Second Economic Report, \u00a7 III **[RER-0002]** ; EC State Aid Decision (11 November 2017) **[RL-0080]** ; CNE Report 2/2012 **[R-0105]** / **[C-0214]** / **[C-0294]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1308 \u2013 1313; IMF Country Report, 13 December 2016: \"Spain: Staff Concluding Statement of the 2016 Article IV Mission\" **[R-0308]**.\n\n547.\n\nThe public interest of the Disputed Measures and their legitimacy are presumed.1075 The alternative measures of Claimants and their experts are not relevant for the proportionality test and, in any event, do not have any proven effectiveness.

In that case, a 7% rate of return, after tax, was considered reasonable and proportionate.1082 Under the current framework, the rate of return obtained by Claimants' plants reaches 7.5% after taxes. This is higher than the costs of Claimants' capital calculated by their own experts.1083 The return is reasonable as compared to other regulated sectors of the SES,1084 and as compared to other returns analyzed by the EC.1085\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 1154 \u2013 1157; APPA-Greenpeace Press Release concerning the Draft Bill for the Promotion of Renewable Energy, dated 20 May 2009 **[R-0197]** ; Submission of the Draft Bill on Renewable Energy by APPA and Greenpeace to the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce (21 May 2009), Art. 23.3 and 23.4 **[R-0218]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7 1158; Press release: \"*The Boom in renewable energy attracts 5 billion in investments\": \"So far this year, the renewable energy sector has accumulated almost EUR 5,000 million in buying and selling operations [...]*\" Article from economic newspaper \"El Economista\", 17 October 2015 **[R-0208]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7 1160; R-II \u00a7 1314.\n\nR-II \u00a7 1319; Accuracy, Second Economic Report, \u00a7 II.1 **[RER-0002]** ; *AES v.

By excluding already registered facilities from the scope of the changes, Respondent reassured its commitment to certainty, predictability, and stability for registered PV installations.1136 Respondent, through its Government and Ministry of Energy issued press releases, presentations, and even international roadshows wherein it confirmed that Regulatory Framework No. 1 would not be changed for renewable energy facilities that would meet certain requirements.1137 Promises of these public officials that were included in official statements are unilateral acts binding on Respondent as a matter of international law.1138*of States Capable of Creating Obligations*\"), Preamble **[CL-0080]**. Respondent's statements and promises were repeated, and Claimants could legitimately trust in them for the purpose of making its investment in the Spanish PV subsector and to keep it over time.1139 Any regulatory change must consider the acquired rights of investors in order to be consistent with the State's international obligations.1140 Rather than consider these rights, Respondent fully bypassed its obligations toward Claimants, disregarding statutory provisions and official statements by state officials.1141 This Tribunal must find that Respondent is now estopped from disregarding its commitment to respect and apply Regulatory Framework No. 1 to the PV Installations for their entire useful lifetime.1142\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 605 \u2013 607.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 608; M.

Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n562.\n\nSince Claimants did not address this claim in its Reply, Respondent requests that the Tribunal understand that Claimants have abandoned their claims regarding the Umbrella Clause. The burden of proof of these violations lies with Claimants, and Claimants have not refuted Respondent's arguments.1144\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 40 \u2013 42; 1084 \u2013 1085.\n\n563.\n\nRespondent has not breached any obligations it incurred in relation with the Claimants' investment.1145 This claim should be dismissed pursuant to the literal interpretation of Article 10(1), last sentence. Neither the Claimants as the investors, nor Claimants' investment, is covered under the Umbrella Clause of the ECT, as the Respondent has not contracted any specific commitments *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Claimant or their investment to petrify the RD 661/2007 regime in their favor.1146\n\nR-II \u00a7 1196.\n\nR-I \u00a7 1214.\n\n564.\n\nClaimants' interpretation of Article 10(1) of the ECT contradicts the literal sense of that provision and its interpretation through doctrine and arbitral precedents.1147 Claimants' conflate a regulation that is applicable *erga omnes*, such as RD 661/2007, with commitments specifically agreed with an investor or their investment. This approach ignores the terms of the ECT, which expressly include \"*entered into*\", which involves the State's assumption of specific obligations regarding an investor or an investment.1148 As stated by the tribunal in *SGS v. The Philippines*, obligations of the State must be specific and assumed by the state with respect to a particular investor, in a *vis-\u00e0-vis* relationship.1149 This is how the clauses in Article 10(1) of the ECT have earned the name \"*a pacta sunt servanda clause*.\"1150\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 1185.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 1186 \u2013 1187, 1195; *Noble Ventures, Inc v.

Bulgaria* ruled that it was not necessary to decide whether Article 10(1) covers commitments arising from laws.1152*Khan Resources v.

The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n568.\n\nWhile the Tribunal maintains the above summaries of the Parties' submissions in this Award in order to provide a complete picture of the reasoning, it considers it does not have to decide on them. Since neither Party, in its relief sought, requests any different consequences or damages based on these claims beyond those claimed on the basis of FET and as it has been concluded above that there is a breach of FET, Tribunal need not decide whether additionally any of these other alleged breaches has occurred as that would not lead to any other conclusion and dispositive.\n\n569.\n\nNevertheless, in this context, the Tribunal notes that recently the tribunal in *Greentech v. Italy* considered \"*the ECT's umbrella clause as sufficiently broad to encompass not only contractual duties but also certain legislative and regulatory instruments that are specific enough to qualify as commitments to identifiable investments or investors*.\"1160 This, in a way, follows the broad reasoning of the *Plama* tribunal saying \"*that the wording of this clause in Article 10(1) of the ECT is wide in scope since it refers to 'any obligation*.' *An analysis of the ordinary meaning of the term suggests that it refers to any obligation regardless of its nature, i.e., whether it be contractual or statutory*.\"1161 The present Tribunal finds the interpretation of most Spanish RE cases more convincing and notes in this context that the tribunal in *Isolux* was of the view that the ECT's umbrella clause, although speaking of \"*any obligations*\" because it referred to \"*entered into\"* was limited to contractual obligations1162 and that the tribunal in *Novenergia* held that \"*Article 10(1) of the ECT does indeed provide for a duty of each Contracting Party to 'observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor', a provision that recalls the 'umbrella clause' contained in several investment treaties. However, the application of the umbrella clauses requires that the host State either concluded with the investor a specific contract or made to the investor a specific personal promise*.\"1163\n\n*Greentech Energy Systems A/S, NovEnergia II Energy & Environment (SCA) SICAR, and NovEnergia II Italian Portfolio SA v.

MOST CONSTANT PROTECTION AND SECURITY (\"MCPS\")**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n570.\n\nBy passing the Regulatory Framework No. 2 in 2010-2013 and Regulatory Framework No. 3 in 2013 \u2013 2014, Respondent violated Claimants' right to enjoy the most constant protection and security (\"MCPS\") under Article 10(1) of the ECT.1164 Pursuant to the MFN clause included in Article 10(7) of the ECT, Claimants invoke the following MCPS clauses from BITs entered into by Respondent with another state for the purposes of obtaining protection for (1) legal security and a secure legal environment, if the Tribunal considers that MCPS does not encompass legal security but only physical security, and (2) the challenge of the TVPEE, if the Tribunal considers it a *bona fide* taxation measure:\n\n(i) Article III(1) of the Spain-Costa Rica BIT: \"*Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party* (\u2026) *shall enjoy full protection and security*.\"1165\n\n(ii) Article 4(1) of the Spain-India BIT: \"*Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall at all times* (\u2026) *enjoy full protection and security*.\"1166\n\n(iii) Article 3(1) of the Spain-Libya BIT: \"*Investments made by investors of each Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party* (\u2026) *shall enjoy full protection and security*.\"1167\n\n(iv) Article 3(1) of the Spain-Morocco BIT: \"*Investments made by investors of each Contracting Party in the territory or the maritime zone of the other Contracting Party* (\u2026) *shall enjoy full and complete protection and security*.\"1168\n\n(v) Article 3(1) of the Spain-Ukraine BIT: \"*Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall at all times* (\u2026) *enjoy full protection and security*.\"1169\n\n(vi) Article 3(1) of the Spain-Uzbekistan BIT: \"Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall (\u2026) enjoy full protection and security.\"1170\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 479(iii), 784.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 790 \u2013 792; Spain-Costa Rica BIT, Art.

During that period, PV Installations performed on a purely interim basis. Regulatory Framework No. 3 is unstable because it is subject to Respondent's discretionary changes every three and six years. Since 2010, remuneration for PV Installations has been cut by more than half.1174\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 793 \u2013 794, 801.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 795 \u2013 797.\n\n573.\n\nThe *CSOB v.

This has been substituted by a regime under which Claimants are remunerated only with pool market prices, which has caused substantial damage to the Investments. These regulatory changes have devalued Claimants' investment and withdrawn the agreed and approved security and protection of the foreign investor's investment.1176\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 789; *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. v.

Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n574.\n\nSince Claimants did not address the MCPS claim in their Reply, Respondent requests that the Tribunal understand that Claimants have abandoned their claims. The burden of proof of these violations lies with Claimants, and Claimants have not refuted Respondent's arguments.1177 In light of the factual record, the concurrence of regulatory power, and the adoption of the measures in accordance with existing economic circumstances, Respondent requests that the Tribunal dismiss this claim.1178\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 40 \u2013 42; 1084 \u2013 1085.\n\nR-I \u00a7 1137.\n\n575.\n\nRespondent has respected the guarantee of MCPS provided for in Article 10(1) of the ECT. This standard does not provide investors protection against a Government's right to legislate or to regulate in such a way that may negatively affect a particular investment, provided that the Government's actions are reasonable in light of the circumstances and are made with the intention of achieving objectively reasonable results of public order.1179 Here, the remuneration method chosen was expressly proposed by APPA with the support of Cuatrecasas in 2009. These measures prompted the stabilization of the Tariff Deficit and the maintenance of a reasonable rate of return for energy producers.1180 The Tribunal should, therefore, dismiss this claim.1181\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 1130 \u2013 1135; R.

The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n576.\n\nAgain, while the Tribunal maintains the above summaries of the Parties' submissions in this Award in order to provide a complete picture of the reasoning, it considers it does not have to address and decide on them. Since neither Party, in its relief sought, requests any different consequences or damages based on these claims beyond those claimed on the basis of FET and as it has been concluded above that there is a breach of FET, the Tribunal need not decide whether additionally any of these other alleged breaches has occurred as that would not lead to any other conclusion and dispositive. Nevertheless, in this context, the Tribunal notes that it considers that the obligation to provide constant protection and security differs from the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment and that thus both claims have to be examined separately. It shares the view of the tribunal in *Mamidoil* v. *Albania* that the ECT's \"*standard of constant protection and security does not imply strict liability but rather obliges States to use due diligence to prevent harassment and injuries to investors*.\"1182 The wording of the ECT's most constant protection and security clause does not suggest that it extends to legal security. Rather, the protection and security is one directed against interferences by third parties. The alleged violations of the most constant protection and security obligation in the form of legal insecurity resulting from the Respondent's changing legal framework have been addressed in the Tribunal's discussion of the FET claims. Since these matters are directly emanating from the Respondent, they do not raise issues of protection against interferences by third parties.\n\n*Mamidoil v. Albania*, \u00a7 821 **[RL-0046]**.\n\n**E. IMPAIRMENT BY UDM / NON-IMPAIRMENT CLAUSE**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n577.\n\nRespondent's repeal of Regulatory Framework No. 1 through the successive passing of Regulatory Framework No. 2 in 2010 \u2013 2013 and Regulatory Framework No. 3 in 2013 \u2013 2014 constitutes a breach of Respondent's obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT to not \"*in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of the Investment*.\"1183 Respondent has breached Article 10(1) of the ECT because (1) the regulatory measures which have given rise to a radically different regulatory framework to the one in place when the Claimants made their Investment are unreasonable, (2) certain regulatory measures adopted by Respondent are discriminatory, and (3) these regulatory measures have impaired the Claimants' Investment.1184\n\nC-I \u00a7 479(iv).\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 810.\n\n578.\n\nThe requirements are non-cumulative and the breach of any factor of this two-fold standard entails the host-State's responsibility under the ECT.1185 Analyzing the term \"*impairment*\" in light of Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the measure must have been to some extent \"*detrimental*\" to the investment. A reduction in the income received meets this definition and may be considered an \"*impairment*.\"1186\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 802 \u2013 804.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 808, 833; *AES v.

Czech Republic*, \u00a7 458 **[CL-0109]** / **[RL-0083]**.\n\n579.\n\nThe non-impairment requirement of Article 10(1) may be breached by measures that are unreasonable from either an objective or subjective viewpoint.1187*BG* found that the unilateral withdrawal of assurances given in good faith to investors to induce them to invest is unreasonable by definition.1188 Respondent's conduct prior to November 2010 created an expectation in Claimants that the regulatory framework for PV Installations would remain stable, certain, and consistent.1189 Since Respondent's measures disregarded Claimants' expectations and the regulatory scenario under which it decided in invest in 2008 and 2009, they are unreasonable.1190 Under the New Remuneration Model, Respondent grants RE producers a Specific Remuneration based on standard parameters calculated by Respondent, which make up the cost profile of the \"*standard installations*.\"1191 These measures are further unreasonable because they are ultimately based on an unreasonable target: a so-called 7,398% \"*reasonable rate of return*\", whereby Respondent unilaterally decided how much investors should earn and then designed a remuneration model to achieve that target, with no regard to Claimants' investment or their specific reliance upon the Feed-In Model assured by Regulatory Framework No. 1.1192 The 7,398% figure is a targeting ceiling. Nothing prevents investors from earning less, as is the case of Claimants in this arbitration.1193 No international precedent can be found of a successful renewable investment regime based exclusively on a \"*reasonable rate of return*.\" CNE (now CNMC) acknowledged that the \"*reasonable rate of return*\" is unjustified and does not reflect the capital cost of the most efficient companies.1194\n\nC-I \u00a7 805; *Black's Law Dictionary,* 7th.

Latvia*, \u00a7 4.2 **[CL-0100]**.\n\n585.\n\nFinally, it cannot be ruled out that the TVPEE continues to have a discriminatory impact on RE producers under Regulatory Framework No. 3, considering, *inter alia*, (1) the fact that the remuneration of the PV Installations has been determined considering *standard* and *hypothetical* (not actual) costs and values, and (2) the Respondent's concealment of basic evidence in setting parameters and variable operating costs.1209\n\nC-I \u00a7 832.\n\n**2. Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n586.\n\nSince Claimants did not address this claim in its Reply, Respondent requests that the Tribunal understand that Claimants have abandoned their claims regarding non-impairment. The burden of proof of these violations lies with Claimants, and Claimants have not refuted Respondent's arguments.1210\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 40 \u2013 42, 1084 \u2013 1085.\n\n587.\n\nThe measures challenged comply with the different tests applied in arbitral case-law to evaluate whether the UDM-standard of Article 10(1) of the ECT has been infringed. The application of these tests demonstrates that the Measures (1) are not discriminatory, (2) respect the FET standard in the ECT, and (3) fulfil the minimum FET standard in international law by respecting the economic equilibrium of the investment.1211\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 37, 1076.\n\n588.\n\nThe test for whether a measure is discriminatory is contained in *EDF v. Romania* :\n\n*a) A measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose;*\n\n*b) A measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference;*\n\n*c) A measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker;*\n\n*d) A measure taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure*.1212\n\nR-I \u00a7 1163; *EDF (Services) v. Romania*, \u00a7 303 **[RL-0035]** / **[CL-0204]**.\n\n589.\n\nNone of the four criteria examined in *EDF* for assessing a discriminatory action against an investor is met.1213 Under (a), it has been established that the purpose of the reform was legitimate: the Measures aim to resolve an unstable situation of imbalance, where domestic and international circumstances led to a decrease in demand that required the system to be rebalanced. This rebalance was implemented without imposing an excessive burden on consumers.1214 Regarding (b), the Measures were implemented in full observance of the laws in place and aimed to guarantee the principle of \"*reasonable rate of return*\" to all investors, foreign and domestic, in RE facilities. It is a reform of general scope. Regarding (c), the need to reform the SES was announced in each Explanatory Statement of RD-Law 6/2009, RD-Law 14/2010, and as the MAIN of RD 1614/2010. Regarding (d), the Respondent followed the legally established procedures to pass the regulations on remuneration in the SES.1215\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 1164 \u2013 1165.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 1164.\n\n*Id*.\n\n590.\n\n*AES Summit* states that two elements must be analyzed to determine whether a policy is reasonable under the FET standard: the existence of a rational policy, and the reasonableness of the State action in relation to the policy.1216 The Contested Measures were adopted in pursuit of what *AES Summit*, and other tribunals including those in *Electrabel*, *Charanne*, and *Isolux* have confirmed to be a valid, rational public policy: \"*the reduction in excessive profits for investors and the burdens on consumers*.\"1217 Here, the policy was implemented to protect consumers from paying investors higher than reasonable compensation.1218 Respondent's action was reasonable, considering the objective of the state public policy and the measure taken to reach this objective.1219 Respondent explains that\n\n[t]*he reform passed by the Government affects all the subjects of the SES. This reform distributed the measures to increase income and reduce the costs of the SES among consumers and all the operators in the system (producers, distributors and transmitters) with the aim of dealing with the tariff deficit. In addition, for the first time since the SES was created in 1994, economic contributions from the General Spanish State Budget were foreseen: Spanish taxpayers also defray the costs of the SES, including remuneration for the Claimant*.1220\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 1166; *AES v.

The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n593.\n\nAgain, while the Tribunal maintains the above summaries of the Parties' submissions in this Award in order to provide a complete picture of the reasoning, it considers it does not have to address and decide on them. Since neither Party, in its relief sought, requests any different consequences or damages based on these claims beyond those claimed on the basis of FET and as it has been concluded above that there is a breach of FET, Tribunal need not decide whether additionally any of these other alleged breaches has occurred as that would not lead to any other conclusion and dispositive.\n\n**F. CLAIMANTS' ALTERNATIVE CLAIM**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n594.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to find that the Respondent only guaranteed a \"*reasonable return*\", Respondent would still be liable for breaching its obligations under Article 10 ECT \"*by* [(1)] *imposing, ex post, a lower allowed 'target rate of return' for existing PV plants such as the Claimants',* [(2)] *appropriating the efficiency gains made by more efficient plants on the system (such as the Claimants'),* [(3)] *clawing back returns earned by Claimants' plants in previous years under the Original Regime, and* [(4)] *undermining the incentive to maximize production through a change from a per MWh (of production) to a per MW (of capacity) system*.\"1225 Rather than respect the alleged guaranteed reasonable return, the Disputed Measures reduced Claimants' investment value by 60% and the investment sustained EUR 42 million in damages,1226 in violation of the Non-Impairment standard.1227 Thus, Respondent violated the FET standard contained in Article 10(1) on three counts: (1) by frustrating Claimants' legitimate expectations, (2) by arbitrarily and non-transparently switching the target rate of return by fixing *ex post* a 7,398% rate of return, and (3) by failing to provide any justification as to why and how it calculated the reasonable return with respect to the 10-year Spanish Bond plus a spread.1228 Through these actions, Respondent also violated its obligation to provide MCPS under Article 10(1) ECT.1229 These breaches entail Respondent's international liability and its obligation to repair damages in the amount quantified by Brattle.1230\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 576; 584(c), (d); Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 229(c), 248 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 577; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, Table 12 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 585(iii).\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 585(i); *Micula v.

This discriminates against more efficient plants as compared to higher-cost ones that Respondent continues to consider efficient. This is a further aspect of the retroactive nature of the New Regulatory Regime in respect of PV installations. Under the guarantee of a \"*target rate of return*\", Respondent would not be allowed to *ex post* impose stricter cost targets on the types of PV plants that turned out to be cheaper to construct and/or to perform better than the marginal plant.1237\n\nC-III \u00a7 584(a); Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 229(a), 236 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 584(b).\n\n*Id*.; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 229, 238, 246 \u2013 247, Figure 9 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n**2. Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n597.\n\nClaimants' purported alternative claim is a legal fiction, designed only to reiterate their initial claim under a different appearance and name.1238 Each premise of this claim is incorrect and misrepresents Respondent's regulatory system and Respondent's defense.1239 Claimants have not suffered a violation of the ECT and this alternative claim must be dismissed, because (1) Claimants' legitimate expectations have not been violated, as Claimants continue to obtain a reasonable return of 7% post-tax, even on their inefficient costs,1240 (2) the Contested Measures were approved in a reasonable and transparent manner to achieve a legitimate aim, (3) the Contested Measures comply with the principle of FPS under the ECT, and (4) Respondent's measures are proportional and reasonable and have not been to the detriment of Claimants' investment.1241\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1323 \u2013 1325.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 1326, 1331 \u2013 1332.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 1344(i).\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 1344 \u2013 1345; Accuracy, Second Economic Report, \u00a7 11.5 **[RER-0002]**.\n\n598.\n\n*First*, Respondent has never guaranteed static returns. Under Article 30.4 of Act 54/1997, Respondent agreed to grant a reasonable return in accordance with the cost of money on the capital market. These returns must be dynamic through the facility's useful life, and this has been recognized by the Spanish Supreme Court and Constitutional Court, by the EC Decision on State Aid, and the *Charanne*, *Isolux*, and *Eiser* Awards.1242 In *Eiser*, the Tribunal expressly found that Article 10(1) of the ECT \"*does not entitle Claimants to a 'reasonable return' at any level, but to fair and equitable treatment*.\"1243\n\nR-II \u00a7 1330(i); Act 54/1997 **[C-0055bis]** / **[R-0059]** ; Judgment from the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court dated 25 October 2006, appeal 12/2005, reference El Derecho EDJ 2006/282164 **[R-0118]** ; *Charanne*, \u00a7\u00a7 503, 505 **[CL-0030] / [RL-0049]** ; Final Commission Decision C(2016) 7827, of 28 November 2016, regarding case number SA.40171 in the State Aid Register (2015/NN)\u2013 Czech Republic **[RL-0070]** ; *Isolux*, \u00a7\u00a7 788 and 807 **[RL-0004]** / **[RL-0076]** ; *Eiser*, \u00a7\u00a7 102, 106, 362, 434 **[CL-0148]** / **[RL-0077]** / **[RL-0078]**.\n\n*Eiser*, \u00a7 434 **[CL-0148]** / **[RL-0077]** / **[RL-0078]**.\n\n599.\n\n*Second*, Respondent's regulations have never been on \"*marginal plants.*\" From 1997 to present, Respondent's regulations have used standard facilities contained in the successive Renewable Energy Plans, *i.e.* PER 2000-2010, PER 2005 \u2013 2010 and, currently, in MO IET/1045/2014. These standard facilities \"*bring together efficient and well-managed facilities characterized by having the same technical parameters relating to their size, equivalent operating hours, unit costs, periods of implementation, useful life, operational and maintenance costs[,] and sale prices per final units of energy.* [\u2026]\"1244 PER 2000-2010 and PER 2005 \u2013 2010 consider 4 standard facilities. Claimants' and Brattle have invented the so-called \"*marginal plant*\", which has no basis in any legal or regulatory documentation in the Spanish system or in any background at the time of or after the investment.1245 The absurdity of Claimants' \"*marginal plant*\" is further demonstrated by the fact that it does not have the same characteristics as Claimants' facilities, which are of different size, power, and technology.1246 Claimants' \"*marginal plant\"* is simply one *\"with the highest costs in a given tariff category*\" and the *Eiser* award further pointed out the unpersuasiveness of using these \"*as the basis for calculating the future revenues that should accrue to Claimants' very different plants*.\"1247 Reasonable return has been set with reference to the standard facilities and not to the individualized facilities of each investor. Claimants, thus, cannot have expected to obtain a specific return on their plants, especially given the cost inefficiencies of Claimants' facilities.1248\n\nR-II \u00a7 1330(ii).\n\n*Id*.; PER 2000 \u2013 2010, pp. 280 \u2013 283 **[C-0050]** / **[R-0090]** ; PER 2005 \u2013 2010, p. 272 **[C-0066]** / **[R-0092]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7 1330(ii); Accuracy, Second Economic Report, \u00a7 VII.2 **[RER-0002]**.\n\n*Eiser*, \u00a7 434 **[CL-0148]** / **[RL-0077]** / **[RL-0078]**.\n\nAccuracy, Second Economic Report, Appendix 4 **[RER-0002]**.\n\n600.\n\nClaimants allege an entitlement to a minimum return of 7 \u2013 8% post tax, without basis.

The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n604.\n\nClaimants submit this claim expressly \"[e]*ven if the Tribunal were to find that the Respondent only guaranteed a 'reasonable return,' Respondent would still be liable for breaching its obligations under Article 10 ECT\".* This alternative is not applicable as, above, the Tribunal has accepted Claimants' primary claims for breach of the FET standard and thereby of Article 10(1) of the ECT and thereby dismissed the alternative that Respondent only guaranteed a reasonable return. There is, thus, no need for the Tribunal to determine this alternative claim.\n\n**IX. DAMAGES**\n---------------\n\n**A.

Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n605.\n\nRespondent has committed an internationally wrongful act that entails international responsibility. This obligation implies putting Claimants in the same position they would have found themselves, had Respondent not breached the ECT.1257 Since the ECT does not specify the consequences of an unlawful expropriation or a breach of the Article 10(1) standards, customary international law applies.1258 The relevant principles of customary international law are derived from the PCIJ Judgment in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory Case (Germany v.

The breaches have also delayed compensation to Claimants, preventing them from obtaining the benefits of Regulatory Framework No. 1.

APPROPRIATENESS OF DCF VALUATION VS. ABV VALUATION**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n610.\n\nAn appropriate way to measure damages suffered by Claimants' Investments is by comparing the actual free cash flows that the SPVs obtained or will obtain because of Respondent's ECT breaches (\"*Actual*\" scenario) with the free cash flows that they would have obtained in the absence of the breach (\"*But-For*\" scenario).1268 The \"*Historical Damages*\" account for the impact on the Claimants' investments arising out of Spain's ECT breaches from 24 November 2010 to 30 June 2014, the Valuation Date.1269 \"*Present damages*\" account for the reduction in FMV of Claimants' financial interests in the PV Plants as of the Valuation Date.1270 The Present Damages are obtained by discounting the expected cash flows as an appropriate rate at the Valuation Date (\"*DCF Methodology*\").1271\n\nC-I \u00a7\u00a7 855 \u2013 857; CPHB-II \u00a7 27.\n\nC-III \u00a7 857(i); RD 1565/2010, Art. 1(1) **[C-0110]** / **[R-0074]** (entry into force: 24 November 2010); RD-Law 14/2010 **[C-0111]** / **[R-0058]** ; Brattle, Regulatory Report, \u00a7\u00a7 II.D and VI.C **[CER-0001]** ; Brattle, Quantum Report, \u00a78 **[CER-0002]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 857 (ii).\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 859; Brattle, Quantum Report, \u00a7 V **[CER-0002]**.\n\n611.\n\nThe DCF methodology is the most appropriate technique to calculate damages arising from breaches of international law affecting investments in going concerns, such as the ones at stake. As Brattle indicated in its Second Report, \"*PV investments carry less risk than the average investment on the stock market, if not as low as suggested by Spain's allowed return. DCF is well suited because the most important parameters are well defined: pool price, production, inflation and FIT.*\"1272 Claimants' Plants had a sufficient operational track record of profitability at the Valuation Date and would have benefitted from stable feed-in remuneration under RD 661/2007, but for Respondent's wrongful measures.1273\n\nBrattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 124 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 607 \u2013 610, 614; *Enron v.

Respondent used the DCF model (a cash-flow forecast) to value PV assets in Spain, to set tariffs, and to design the cash-flow forecast under the Original and the New Regimes.1277\n\nBrattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 VIII.B **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 613.\n\n*Id*.; *Eiser*, \u00a7\u00a7 441, 465 **[CL-0148]** / **[RL-0077]** / **[RL-0078]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 611; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 126 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n613.\n\nIt is inconsistent for Accuracy to, on the one hand, claim that high uncertainty impedes the use of the DCF approach while, on the other hand, defending the reasonableness of the low return offered by Spain.1278\n\nC-III \u00a7 612; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 119, 123 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n614.\n\nAccuracy's primary approach to damages based on \"*asset-based valuation*\" (\"ABV\") is no more than a simplified, opaque DCF.1279 Accuracy's ABV introduces the \"*prescribed target return*\" as an input to the model, while the return should be an output.1280 As Claimants explain:\n\n*Accuracy analogizes the remuneration to Claimants' Plants as a stream of constant annual cash flows over 30 years of the assumed plant lifetime, and then discounts the cash flows with its estimate of discount rate to obtain a valuation as of June 2014. The ABV applies the same regulated asset base (RAB) in the But-For and the Actual scenarios. Accuracy then considers a different target (i.e., allowed) return to compute an annual cash-flow (annuity) in both the But-For and the Actual scenarios, so the only difference between Accuracy's both scenarios is the magnitude of the \"annuity\" or annual cash-flows*.1281\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 600 \u2013 602, 604; \u00a7\u00a7 48 \u2013 49, Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 IV.B, V.B, C **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 604; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 IV.B, V.B, C, \u00a7\u00a7 48 \u2013 49 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 603; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 50 \u2013 54 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n615.\n\nAccuracy's ABV approach cannot measure damages, because it assumes that investors were never entitled to the incentives under the Original Regime, but rather just to a reasonable return.1282 Accuracy's ABV also contains errors which, once corrected, lead to a valuation closer to that under Brattle's DCF.1283\n\nC-III \u00a7 605; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 37 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 606; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 70 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n616.\n\nRespondent's position that the analysis in *Isolux* regarding internal rates of return (IRRs) \u2013 an ABV method \u2013 is the correct approach to assess damages in this case finds no support in arbitral case law.1284*Isolux* is inapplicable, as it did not perform a damages analysis.1285 Further, in all ECT cases where Spain has been found liable, tribunals have explicitly rejected an ABV method and applied a DCF methodology.1286\n\nCPHB-II \u00a7 15; RPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7168 \u2013 170.\n\nCPHB-II \u00a7 16; RPHB-I \u00a7 2; *Isolux*, \u00a7 868 **[RL-0004]** / **[RL-0076]**.\n\nCPHB-II \u00a7 17; CPHB-I \u00a7 84, pp. 44 \u2013 47 line 11 (Discounted Cash Flow); *Antin*, \u00a7\u00a7 677 \u2013 691 **[CL-0222]** ; *Masdar*, \u00a7\u00a7 564 \u2013 587 **[CL-0220]** ; *Novenergia*, \u00a7\u00a7 818 \u2013 821 **[CL-0213]** ; *Eiser*, \u00a7 441 **[CL-0148]** / **[RL-0077]** / **[RL-0078]**.\n\n**2. Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n617.\n\nThe DCF method, as shown in scientific doctrine and arbitral precedents, is excessively speculative and, therefore, inappropriate for this case.1287 Claimants' DCF model tries to predict data \u2013 including pool price and the demand for energy \u2013 and its projection of existing parameters is hypothetical and illusory. Such speculation has been rejected by the Spanish Supreme Court,1288 and by arbitral tribunals.1289 The tribunal in *Tenaris v. Venezuela* rejected DCF in favor of cost-based methods, citing (1) that claimant's short, 42-month history of operations, (2) uncertainties compounded by government interventions in the marketplace, and (3) the fact that general market conditions did not, at the time, give rise to the likelihood that the claimant's free cash flows could be projected with reasonable certainty.1290 Ripinsky warns that the use of DCF could, in many cases, lead to the overvaluation of financial impacts based on future events.1291 For the present matter, the (1) capital-intensity of the business, (2) high dependency of the cash flows on external, volatile and unpredictable elements (such as price pool), (3) long-term nature of the forecasts, and (4) lack of sufficient financial history that maintains a minimally solid, future cash flow projection speak against the admissibility or appropriateness of the DCF methodology.1292\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 41 \u2013 44, 1231 \u2013 1234; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 49 \u2013 52; *Rusoro Mining Limited v.

Summary Remarks**\n----------------------\n\n**a. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n623.\n\nThe Brattle Second Quantum Report concludes that the Disputed Measures reduced cashflows and the FMV of Claimants' PV assets by **EUR 40.1 million (=EUR 36.8 million for OperaFund and EUR 3.3 million for Schwab)**, as principle sum assessed at the Valuation Date (June 2014).1304 This amount includes pre-award interest, but the tax gross-up should be added to ensure full reparation.1305\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 597, 623; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 25 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 599.\n\n624.\n\nAccuracy's Report carries out its own DCF calculation and concludes that the Disputed Measures reduce the financial interests of Claimants by EUR 4.5 million (EUR 4.7 million including interest).1306 Brattles' Second Quantum Report performs six corrections to Accuracy's DCF Model. These have the effect of increasing Accuracy's damage estimate, closer to Brattle's of 40.3 million.1307 After the Hearing, Claimants explained that \"Past Damages\" (January 2011 \u2013 June 2014) amounted to EUR 9.7 million, \"Future Damages\" amounted to 30.4 million. The total impact of the measures, pre-interest is 40.1 million, and with interest amounts to 43.3 million.1308\n\n*Id*.; Accuracy, First Economic Report, Table 9, \u00a7 129 **[RER-0001]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 641 \u2013 642.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 77; C-I \u00a7 281; MO IET/1045/2014 **[R-0086]** / **[C-0126]** / **[C-0126bis]** ; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, Table 1, 16 p. 9, 87 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n625.\n\nRespondent's and Accuracy's suggestion that the Disputed Measures have been positive for Claimants is outrageous. Accuracy only obtains a lower amount of damages in its subsidiary DCF analysis through its (1) consideration that the \"*But-For*\" scenario involves a greater risk than the actual scenario, and (2) lower estimate of PV Plants' lifetime.1309 The divergence in these calculations is based on (1) the useful life of the PV Plants, which Brattle estimates as 35 years and Accuracy as 30 years,1310 (2) the regulatory risk and the illiquidity discount,1311 (3) the application of a \"*risk free rate*\" \u2013 Accuracy assumes a risk free rate of 3.5% without support, while Brattles applies a rate of 2.09% based on objective market data,1312 and (4) the consideration of third party debt \u2013 Accuracy considers the book value, rather than the market value, of debt and thereby obtains a higher figure for damages.1313\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 624 \u2013 625.; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 12 **[CER-0004]** ; Accuracy, First Economic Report, \u00a7 24 **[RER-0001]**.\n\nBrattle, Quantum Report, \u00a7 78 **[CER-0002]** ; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 137 **[CER-0004]** ; PV Lifetime Assessments **[BQR-64]** ; Leasing Agreements **[BQR-75]**.\n\nBrattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 137 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 XI.B, 137, 161 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 137 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n626.\n\nBrattle modelled the future update of the target return based on the forecast of the Spanish yields as of June 2014, while Accuracy maintained the same target return of 7,398% throughout the regulatory life of the Plants in its calculation. This ignores that Respondent recently announced its intention to reduce the alleged return for the New Regulatory Regime from 7,398% to only 4.1 \u2013 4.3% beginning in 2020, due to a further decline in interest rates.1314\n\n*Id*.; C-III \u00a7 617; Accuracy, First Economic Report, \u00a7 103 **[RER-0001]**.\n\n627.\n\nBrattle forecasted the Plants' production based on actual performance. In its second report, Brattle adjusted this data by an assumed annual degradation factor of 0.5%. Brattle strongly objects to Accuracy's refusal to adjust the past performance for the degradation factor,1315 the failure of which lets production forecast to a higher figure. Accuracy derives a lower forecast because it uses inconsistent assumptions.1316\n\nC-III \u00a7 618 \u2013 619; Accuracy, First Economic Report, \u00a7 101 **[RER-0001]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 619; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 188 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n628.\n\nBrattle performed reality checks that prove the soundness of its damages valuation. It amended the But-For DCF model to reflect a June 2009 valuation. This verified that Claimants determined the initial investment on the basis that the PV Plants would continue to receive feed-in incentives under RD 661/2007 (assumed in the But-For model). By using assumptions in line with investors' initial expectations, Brattle's DCF model produced a result that is consistent with the initial investment.1317 Brattle also surveyed available transaction evidence concerning PV assets under the Original and the New Regulatory Regimes. Brattle compiled evidence of seven transactions involving PV assets and obtained a price range of EUR 6.73-10 million per MW installed. This range is consistent with the EUR 8.4-10.2 million per MW implied by Brattle's DCF analysis for the Claimants' Plants.1318 Accuracy does not provide a reality check based on comparable transactions.1319\n\nC-III \u00a7 620; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 204 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 621; Brattle, Quantum Report, \u00a7 V.G. **[CER-0002]** ; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 210 \u2013 211 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 622; Accuracy, First Economic Report, \u00a7\u00a7 134 \u2013 141 **[RER-0001]** ; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 210 \u2013 216 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n629.\n\nThe negative impact of the Disputed Measures is unquestionable, and Accuracy itself even acknowledges EUR 164 million in cash flow reductions.1320 Claimant suffered a 57% (OperaFund) and 75% (Schwab) decline in past cash flows in future earnings.1321 The experts agree that the expected project Internal Rate of Return (IRR), calculated by Applying RD 661/2007 was decreased in the New Regime by 200 basis points, which entails a 76% reduction in the return on equity for an investor.1322\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 73; Tr.

Thus, as remarked by Mr. Caldwell, the only conclusion to be drawn here by the Tribunal is that, after nearly six years of operation, ECO 3 outperformed the 2008/2009 expectations (it was \"doing better\") while El Paso performed slightly below the 2008/2009 expected range. Needless to say, under a feed-in regime (\"But-for\" scenario) based on RD 661/2007, which was 'performance-driven,' different performance rates notably impact the Investments' valuation throughout time*.\"1324 Respondent's comparison between ratios of Past Damages and Future Damages in Exercise 2 is misplaced and lacks any support from a damages methodology perspective.1325 Nonetheless, it confirms that the New Regime, which retrospectively appropriates the Plants' efficiency gains, is more harmful to those PV Plants which were outperforming the initially expected values.1326 In Exercise 3, Respondent suggested that future corrections are warranted in Brattle's analysis, but has not pointed to one.

Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n632.\n\nWhether using the speculative DCF methodology correctly or correcting the parameters employed by Claimants, the result obtained is the same: the impact would have been less than that calculated by Brattle.1331 The defects in Brattle's analysis include (1) using an inflated maximum life of plants, (2) its treatment of regulatory risk in the But-For scenario, and (3) higher illiquidity in the But-For scenario. The calculations must be adapted to the economic reality of what a willing buyer would offer in one scenario or another: the FMV. After correcting Brattle's DCF, Accuracy's calculation shows that, if the Tribunal understood that the TVPEE is outside its jurisdiction, the damages would be reduced by EUR 7.8 million and, accordingly, there would be no damage to compensate.1332 Correcting Brattle's DCF as of June 2014, Claimants' damages would be **EUR 4.5 million**.1333\n\n*Compare* R-I \u00a7 44 (8% less) with R-I \u00a7\u00a7 1249 \u2013 1255 (89% less); Corrected Brattle DCF model as of June 2014 **[ACQ-0001]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 53 \u2013 58, 1387 \u2013 1389; Accuracy, Second Economic Report, Table 1 **[RER-0002]**.\n\nAccuracy, First Economic Report, \u00a7 129 **[RER-0001]**.\n\n633.\n\nThe damages estimated in the Brattle reports are not subject to compensation, as there has been no breach and, regardless, Brattle's speculative calculation has not been minimally provided. Claimants have not met their burden of proof as required to sustain their claims.1334 The Hearing confirmed that (1) Brattle's model is not reliable even to calculate past damages and, thus, is by no means reliable for future projections and (2) the alleged damages are unrelated to the Disputed Measures, since the same measures have a different impact, depending on Claimants' investment decision.1335\n\nR-II \u00a7 47.\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7 42; CPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 84 \u2013 88.\n\n634.\n\nBrattle's DCF method applied and parameters chosen are unreliable and are inconsistent with the investment price paid by the Claimants' and with the results audited in the Annual Accounts of Claimants' PV Plants.1336 If one compares the FMV obtained by Brattles DCF Method for the But-For world in June 2014 with the price Claimants paid for their interests in the PV Plants (which is itself a FMV) in 2009, one sees that the value of the ECO 3 Plants increased by 69%, and the Paso Plants decreased by 23%. These variations in the But-For valuation are unrelated to the Disputed Measures, and there was no impairment by the Measures.1337 Respondent also verified, by means of comparison of Brattle's But-For and Actual values for Claimants' PV Plants, that the alleged damages are not proportional with respect to the disputed measures and are, therefore, neither correlated to nor caused by them.1338 Regarding \"*historic damages*\", Brattle decreased its initial calculation by 25% between their first and second report.1339 Since Brattle's model does not properly calculate \"*historic damages*\", it cannot reliably forecast damages for up to 30 years using the same model.1340 The *Antin* and *Eiser* tribunals' glorification of the work of Brattle experts must be understood in light of the flaws alleged in both awards, and in light of the long relationship between Brattle's experts and one of the co-arbitrators on the *Eiser* tribunal.1341 Mr. Caldwell of Brattle recognized that his calculation of damages was divorced from any reality check.1342 Brattle's model is sensitive to a variety of variables that cannot be reliably projected in the long-term.1343 They assume without justification a longer life of plant, and failed to calculate the impact of each disputed measure, even though the 8 measures were approved in different moments in time.1344\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 62.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 63 \u2013 65, 72 \u2013 73; Respondent's Closing Statements, slides 112 \u2013 118, 122 \u2013 129; Brattle's Loss Demonstratives **[R-0357]** ; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report,, p. 9, Table 1 **[CER-0004]** ; Tr.

This is the same blind application used in the *Eiser* and *Antin* Tribunals and is the source of the inconsistency in those Awards, which declared the conformity of Act 15/2012 and RD-Law 2/2013 with the ECT and their lack of jurisdiction to hear the case of the 7% TVPEE.1345\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 75 \u2013 77; Respondent's Closing, slide 111; Tr.

In its report, Brattle incorrectly applies a lower \"*revenue hair-cut*\" in the But-For than in the Actual, and the same liquidity discount in both scenarios.1346\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 81; Respondent's Closing, slide 135.\n\n637.\n\nFinally, the alleged EUR 164 million reduction is not \"*acknowledged*\" by Accuracy.

The Valuation Date**\n-------------------------\n\n**a. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n639.\n\nUnder settled international law, Claimants are entitled to damages valued as of the date of injury or as of the date of the Tribunal's award, whichever is higher.1353 Although the later valuation date would show that the damages suffered by Claimants are higher, Claimants choose June 2014 because that is the date when Respondent, through MO IET/1045/2014, defined the economic parameters of the New Regulatory Regime. That defined the injury to Claimants and was the final picture of the extent of damage suffered by Claimants could be known.1354\n\nC-III \u00a7 592; *Yukos v.

Life of Plant**\n--------------------\n\n**a. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n643.\n\nClaimants mitigate damages by assuming a 30-year operation in the Actual Scenario.

They considered the historical operating expenses between 2009 and 2015/2016 and concluded that Claimants' Plants could have operated a minimum of 35 years.1367 Replacement of the inverters would occur in the normal course of operation, and Brattle forecasts an annual expense of EUR 35,000 \u2013 80,000 after 2018 at Paso Palma Sol for the replacement of inverters, and EUR 150,000 \u2013 290,000 at ECO 3 for repairs.

Should this theory be accepted, it would have devastating consequences, as it would set a precedent of impunity for states wishing to vary investment conditions that they may consider financially problematic. This would unquestionably endanger security and confidence in international investments*.1388\n\nC-III \u00a7 615(ii); Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 137 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 635 \u2013 636; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 14 \u2013 15 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n654.\n\nThe Tariff Deficit was caused by Respondent's policies, and alternatives that would have permitted the continuation of the Original Regime and the maintenance of system stability were ignored.1389 Respondent's arguments regarding additional regulatory risk in the \"*But-For*\" scenario are groundless and \"*would also entail a deterioration of any investment climate. Respondent's and Accuracy's inversion of risk in the But-For and Actual scenarios produces the shocking, perverse effect of diminishing Accuracy's damages figure to EUR 4.5 million even when the Plants' cash flow reduction as per Accuracy's projections is so significant (EUR 41 million cash flow reduction with Accuracy's DCF analysis)*.\"1390 Regulatory risk was higher in the Actual than in the But-For scenario.1391 The liquidity factor should not be higher in the But-For than in the Actual. The correct approach is to apply the same illiquidity factor to both the Actual and the But-For scenarios.1392\n\nC-III \u00a7 637; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 17 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 638; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 153 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 639; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 16, 69 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 640; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 180, 182 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n655.\n\nBase WACCs (4.84% Brattle, 5.8% Accuracy) cannot be used as a benchmark of reasonable returns.

Neither base WACC includes non-market risks which include regulatory risk, illiquidity risk, and construction risks, all of which are borne by investors in PV plants. Further, Accuracy fails to account for the 1.4% decrease in interest rates between 2007 and 2014, and possible efficiency gains.1393 There is a temporal inconsistency because Accuracy's approach, as explained by Brattle, mixes 2007 and 2014 estimates.1394\n\nCPHB-I 80, 82; Tr.

Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n657.\n\nBrattle does not apply a regulatory risk in its financial models. Instead, it applies a discount to the Actual scenario \u2013 and this serves to inflate hypothetical damages further.1397\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1372 \u2013 1373.\n\n658.\n\nRegulatory risk affects the value of investments \u2013 the higher the risk, the lower their current value. In the But-For scenario, regulatory risk is high because of the unsustainable situation of the SES due to the Tariff Deficit that was generated by the subsidies for RE and the drop in electricity demand, due to the worldwide economic crisis. In the But-For scenario, the SES would have become increasingly unsustainable and this would entail an increasing probability of partial or total default and regulatory adjustment. The measures solved the Tariff Deficit and made the system sustainable. It eliminated the windfall profits, which, create a higher regulatory risk and are inadmissible in a sector with over 80% of its income subsidized.1398\n\nR-I \u00a7 1253; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 1375 \u2013 1376.\n\n659.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint, the increased risk in the But-For scenario needs to be translated into a risk premium added to the discount rate, since the projected cash flows are worthless if there is a larger probability of the system's default. This is consistent with CNE's view in 2012.1399 The market showed gradual recovery due to the Disputed Measures. This continued improvement and lower regulatory risk in the Actual scenario confirmed the premium over the discount rate of 2.2% and 0.5% in the But-For and Actual scenarios, respectively.1400 The economic reality is that any willing buyer performing an assessment of the FMV, would have applied a large discount to the regulatory risk. Thus, when the FMV assessment standard and a DCF approach are applied, it is necessary to consider the actual situation of the market and the actual risks that a willing buyer would have perceived.1401 No economic agent could have reasonably expected that the subsidies would have been frozen in perpetuity, as Brattle's analysis does.1402\n\nR-II \u00a7 1377; Accuracy, Second Economic Report, \u00a7\u00a7 202 \u2013 204 **[RER-0002]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1377 \u2013 1379; Accuracy, Second Economic Report, \u00a7\u00a7 205 \u2013 207 **[RER-0002]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1380 \u2013 1381.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 1382.\n\n660.\n\nThere is a direct link between the regulatory risk and the illiquidity discount. Accuracy maintains its asymmetry for the same reasons as explained for the regulatory risk premium.1403 One defect in the Brattle scenario is that there is higher illiquidity in the But-For scenario.1404 Thanks to the Disputed Measures, the number of transactions of RE plants has increased. Thus, after the Disputed Measures, the investment is a more liquid asset (or, less illiquid).1405 Thus, the discount for illiquidity must be lower in the Actual scenario than in the But-For. Accordingly, for the same cash flows, their current value is higher after the Contested Measures.1406\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 1386; Accuracy, Second Economic Report, \u00a7 210 **[RER-0002]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 56, 1385.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 1383.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 1384 \u2013 1385.\n\n661.\n\nBrattle acknowledged that, if the Tribunal were to decide that the PV Plants contributed to the Tariff Deficit or that the Tribunal does not have to analyze whether alternative measures were available to Respondent to tackle it, then the regulatory risk needs to be applied such that there is a higher regulatory risk in the But-For than in the Actual scenario. In its report, Brattle incorrectly applies a lower \"*revenue hair-cut*\" in the But-For than in the Actual, and the same liquidity discount in both scenarios.1407\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 81; Respondent's Closing, slide 135.\n\n662.\n\nClaimants erroneously compare a projected decline in equity cash flows with a projected decline in revenues, comparing their alleged 57% (OperaFund) and 75% (Schwab) decline in past cash flows and future expected earnings to a decrease in revenues.1408 This is absolutely uninformative: revenues are not the same as cash flows and are further not the same as equity cash-flows, which depend on financial leverage.1409 If a project is mostly financed through debt, any small reduction in future cash flows will impact only equity investors, since debt providers have senior rights over cash flows.1410\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7 44; CPHB-I \u00a7 73.\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7 45; CPHB-I \u00a7 74; Brattle, Regulatory Report, footnote 149 **[CER-0001]**.\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7 46.\n\n663.\n\nClaimants' counsel has misrepresented Accuracy's contention regarding the significance of a spread of 2%. Accuracy was discussing the difference in IRR across Brattle's But-for and Actual scenarios. The 2.3 % reduction in reduction in returns due to the Measures is not from the 7% target IRR in the Economic Memorandum of RD 661/2007, but rather from a \"But-For\" scenario that yields an 8.1% IRR. The reduction in IRR compared to the Economic Memorandum of RD 661/2007 is only 1.2% (from 7% to 5.8%): a limited reduction that was reasonable considering the regulatory duties in the circumstances at the time.1411\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 48 \u2013 49; Tr. Day 4, 190:3-14 (Sands, Saura).\n\n664.\n\nThe long-term return in a regulated market should be the cost of capital, which is the return that appropriately remunerates the risks assumed. As explained by Accuracy, (1) the regulator should review the regulation and ensure that investors are receiving a reasonable return, (2) capital markets are constantly changing, (3) a return may be fair in certain economic conditions and become either insufficient or excessive if interest rates change, and (4) successive elimination of windfall profits does not differ from the observable reality in competitive markets.1412 Some tribunals, including *Isolux*, use the cost of capital as a benchmark to measure the reasonableness of the return after Measures.1413 It is undeniable that the cost of capital provides a solid benchmark to measure the reasonableness of a rate of return.1414\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7\u00a7 50 \u2013 52; CPHB-I \u00a7\u00a780 \u2013 83; Accuracy, First Economic Report, \u00a7\u00a7 40, 11.2 **[RER-0001]** ; Accuracy, Second Economic Report, \u00a7 11.3 **[RER-0002]** ; Tr.

These calculations reflect that Claimants' assertions regarding the paradigm changes imposed by the measures from July 2013 \u2013 June 2014 in comparison to the prior measures is baseless.1441\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 217.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 218 \u2013 222; C-III \u00a7\u00a7 240 \u2013 277; Accuracy Second Economic Report, Table 19 **[RER-0002]**.\n\n674.\n\nClaimants have suffered no harm based on the idea that the equivalent-hours methodology is different in PER 2005-2010 as in RD-Law 14/2010. The RD 661/2007 tariffs were designed to take into account the same operating hours used in RD-Law 14/2010 onwards. Therefore, any production above that threshold is remunerable at the market price, and the elimination of the subsidy to that excess is merely an elimination of windfall profits, since the tariff was calculated using that hours reference.1442\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7\u00a7 38 \u2013 40; CPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 50 \u2013 53; *Charanne*, \u00a7\u00a7 529 \u2013 532 **[CL-0030] / [RL-0049]**.\n\n675.\n\nClaimants have changed their position regarding the nature and economic impact of the measures prior to July 2013, and have not raised new arguments regarding the \"*temporal*\" nature of the Disputed Measures prior to July 2013. This was not raised in previous submissions and is contradictory to prior submissions. Respondents argue that this is inadmissible under Article 31 of the ICSID Rules and PO-1 \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12, 14, and 16 and must be disregarded.1443 This new position is also contradicted by the position adopted by Brattle in this proceeding1444 and in others.1445\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7\u00a7 55 \u2013 57, 76 \u2013 78; CPHB-I \u00a7\u00a7 111, 112, 181; C-III \u00a7\u00a7 227, 248 \u2013 251; RD 1565/2010, Art. 1(1) **[C-0110]** / **[R-0074]** ; RD-Law 14/2010 **[C-0111]** / **[R-0058]**.\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7 58, 60; Tr.

Claimant's conception otherwise defies elementary legal logic: legal rules remain in force as long as they are not expressly superseded by another rule or as long as the rule itself does not set its own time limit. There is no need to renew a law or a royal decree for it to continue to be in force.1447 The only disputed measure that contained a transitory provision was RD-Law 14/2010, which specified two caps: one until 31 December 2013, and one from 2014 onwards.1448\n\nRPHB-II \u00a7 63.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 64.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 65.\n\n677.\n\nFurther, it is inconsistent to consider the Disputed Measures to be temporary, but to consider RD 661/2007 to be permanent and, thus, the basis for the \"*But-For\"* scenario. Following Claimants' logic, if Measures that were *de facto* applied temporarily are to be considered temporary, then that would apply to RD 661/2007 because, *de facto*, it only temporarily applied. It is nonsensical. If the Tribunal finds that the measures prior to July 2013 did not violate the ECT, they must be applied in the \"*But-For\"* scenario to ensure the standard of compensation guaranteed by *Chorzow* and Article 35 of the ILC Articles.1449\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 66 (*referring* to RD 1565/2010, Art. 1(1) **[C-0110]** / **[R-0074]** ; RD-Law 14/2010 **[C-0111]** / **[R-0058]** ; Act 2/2011 **[C-0115]** / **[R-0045]** ; Act 15/2012 **[C-0112]** / **[R-0003]** ; RD-Law 2/2013 **[C-0113]** / **[R-0063]**).\n\n678.\n\nWhile Brattle's calculation of the stand-along impact of the 2010 measures (EUR 5.51 million) is correct, it is conceptually wrong to reflect a but-for scenario should those measures be logical. Adding those measures back to the *\"But-For\"* Scenario reduces Claimants' damages by EUR 22 million to EUR 18 million.1450 The difference between Brattle's impact (EUR 22 million) and Respondent's (EUR 20.6 million) is due to Brattle applying the cap in hours of RD-Law 14/2010 to the whole useful live of the Plants. Brattle, thus, did not update the value of the cap in hours from January 2014 onwards.1451 Brattle did not model the limitation of regulatory lifetime, either. Brattle included Act 2/2011, which extended the FIT collection period to 30 years, which was not directly requested by the Tribunal.1452 Brattle's calculation of the stand-alone impact of the Disputed Measures is the same as in Respondent's first PHB, though Respondent has simulated that the Measures are permanent in the But-For scenario. Regardless of their new tailored approach, Claimants' experts have agreed with Respondent's contention: if Measures prior to July 2013 are not in breach of the ECT, they should be part of the But-For scenario.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 68.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 69.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 70.\n\n679.\n\nRegarding Act 15.2012, Claimants have confused Respondent's contention on the TVPEE. The 7% is included as a standard cost in the financial economic support scheme and as such is reimbursed through the Remuneration to the Operation. This is true in the Actual world. But, in the But For scenario, the Tribunal need simply apply the 7% tax. If the 7% tax was lawful, it would have applied to the But-For world.1453 Brattle did this in its reports, resulting in a EUR 10.8 million stand-along impact of the TVPEE.1454\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 72.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 73.\n\n680.\n\nClaimants' assessment of RD-Law 2/2013 considers only the first semester 2013.1455 To determine what would have been the impact of RD-Law 2/2013 in the but for world, one need only forecast the IPC \"corrected\" to the But-For Scenario until the end of the Plants' useful life and compare it to the \"*Actual\"* Scenario. Prolonging Brattle's IPC \"corrected\" results in a reduction of damages of EUR 9.4 million.1456\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 74.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 75.\n\n681.\n\nRespondent noted that in *Masdar*, the Tribunal only awarded 25% of the damages claimed, dismissing 75% of the claims.

The Tribunal's Considerations and Conclusions regarding the Calculation of Damages**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n682.\n\nAs mentioned above, since the issues addressed in the above sections 1 to 5 are interlinked in their relevance for the calculation of damages, the Tribunal considers them together hereafter.\n\n683.\n\nRegarding the **valuation date**, as settled in international jurisprudence, Claimants are entitled to damages valued as of the date of injury or as of the date of the Tribunal's award, whichever is higher.1458 Claimants choose June 2014 because that is the date when Respondent, through MO IET/1045/2014, defined the economic parameters of the New Regulatory Regime. That defined the injury to Claimants and was the final picture of the extent of damage suffered by Claimants could be known.1459 The valuation date is, therefore, June 2014 as the date on which the breach of the ECT became permanently effective. In this context, to avoid misunderstanding, the Tribunal notes that the New Regime (2013/2014 Measures) was applied by Spain retroactively with effect from July 2013 and that these were only Temporary Measures. While the *Antin*, *Novenergia*, and *Eiser* tribunals awarded damages from June 2014 onward,1460 the *Masdar* tribunal took the retroactive effect of new measures into account to achieve full compensation.1461 As the measures before June 2014 \u2013 although temporary \u2013 caused damage, the present Tribunal considers that the latter approach is more appropriate in this case.\n\n*Yukos v.

From the evidence provided, the Tribunal considers it more appropriate to accept Brattle's assumption that the PV plants could operate for 35 years in the But-For scenario based on (1) a study about PV plants published by the EC,1464 (2) ECO 3's Plant's 25-year land lease agreement, which included two 5-year extensions and supports Claimants' expectation of a 35-year useful life for the plants,1465 and (3) conclusions reached by ATA about Claimants' PV Plants' useful life of 35 years.1466\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 70; RD 661/2007, Art. 36 **[R-0071]** / **[C-0046]** (\"*first 25 years*\" / \"*thereafter*\").\n\nR-I \u00a7 1254; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 54, 1368 \u2013 1370; RPHB-I \u00a7 41; Respondent Closing slide 44; Accuracy, Second Economic Report, \u00a7\u00a7 185 *et seq.* **[RER-0002]**.\n\nEC DG ENV, *Study on Photovoltaic Panels Supplementing the Impact Assessment for a Recast of the [Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment] WEEE Directive \u2013 Final Report*, 14 April 2011, p. 13 **[BRR-47]**.\n\nLeasing Agreements **[BQR-75]** ; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 143 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 626; CPHB-I \u00a7 62 \u2013 63; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 IX.A **[CER-0004]** ; PV Lifetime Assessments **[BQR-64]** ; ATA, \"ESP Addendum PV Lifetime Report Badajoz 10MW,\" 30 November 2017 **[BQR-88]** / **[C-0253]** ; ATA, \"ESP Addendum PV Lifetime Report Paso 8.3MW\", 30 November 2017 **[BQR-89]** / **[C-0254]** ; Accuracy, First Economic Report, \u00a7 27 **[RER-0001]** (*using* 30 years for its calculations).\n\n685.\n\nRegarding the further application of the DCF method for the present case, in the view of the Tribunal, Claimants are correct that Respondent's expert, Accuracy, distorts the impact of the Disputed Measures by alleging that the But-For scenario would have been associated with high risk and large discounts, while the Disputed Measures would have rendered the Actual scenario \"*safe*\"1467 and that the Tariff Deficit was caused by Respondent's policies.1468 Further, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants' criticism that Accuracy's ABV method is unable to isolate the impact of the Disputed Measures.1469 Accuracy has not calculated the stand-alone impact of the measures. Rather, it has calculated the additional or incremental impact of each measure. Further, it has run this alternative calculation under the assumption that the earlier Disputed Measures (1) were not replaced by the New Regime, (2) were lawful, and (3) applied to the end of the PV Plants' lifetime, contrary to the facts.1470 In this context, the Tribunal notes that the experts agree that the expected project IRR, calculated by applying RD 661/2007 was decreased in the New Regime by 200 basis points, which entailed a 76% reduction in the return on equity for an investor.1471\n\nC-III \u00a7 615(ii); Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 137 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 74; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, Table 12, p. 81 **[CER-0004]** ; *Novenergia*, \u00a7 695 **[CL-0213]**.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 108.\n\nCPHB-II \u00a7\u00a7 33 \u2013 34, 38; Accuracy, Stand-Alone Report Regarding the Quantification of Damages in ICSID 15 36, \u00a7 19 **[RER-0005]**.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 75; Tr.

Brattles' Second Quantum Report performs six corrections to Accuracy's DCF Model. These have the effect of increasing Accuracy's damage estimate, closer to Brattle's of 40.3 million. After the Hearing, Claimants explained that \"Past Damages\" (January 2011 \u2013 June 2014) amounted to EUR 9.7 million, \"Future Damages\" amounted to 30.4 million. The total impact of the measures, pre-interest is 40.1 million, and with interest amounts to 43.3 million.\n\n687.\n\nFinding Respondent's calculation unpersuasive, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to start its calculation by Brattle's final table submitted with Claimants' the last post-hearing brief (CER 005 p.6):\n\n***Table 2: Stand-alone Impact of the Disputed Measures****under the Two Different Legal Interpretations (\u20ac****mln, exc. prejudgment interest)***\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Primary Legal Interpretation (\"Applied until Superseded\") [A] | Alternative Legal Interpretation (\"Applied until End of Plants' Lifetime\") |\n| Accuracy [B] | Brattle [C] |\n| Overall claim | [1] | -40.1 | -40.1 | -40.1 |\n| *Stand-alone impact of:* |  |  |  |  |\n| 2010 Disputed Measures | [2] | -4.6 | -20.6 | -12.6 |\n| Law 15/2012 | [3] | -0.5 | -10.8 | -10.8 |\n| RDL 2/2013 | [4] | -0.2 | -9.4 | -3.9 |\n| New Regulatory Regime |  |  |  |  |\n| (Subsequent Measures) | [5] | -33.6 | n.a. | -33.6 |\n\nNotes and Sources:\n\n[1]: Brattle Second Quantum Report, Table 1.\n\n[A][2] to [5]: See Simplified Financial Model.\n\n[B][2] to [5]: Accuracy III Report, Table 1.\n\n[C][2], [4]: See Table 3, Table 4, respectively.\n\n[C][3]: Brattle Second Quantum Report, Table 14.\n\n[C][5]: Claimants' PHB, Section 11.3, paragraph 114.\n\n688.\n\nSince the Tribunal has concluded above that it has no jurisdiction regarding the tax of the TVPEE, the Tribunal deducts in the above table the impact of the Law 15/2012 which both Accuracy and Brattle see as amounting to rather similar figures (10.8 million in the above Table and 10.1 or 10.5 million in Table 5 on page 17 of the Brattle Report). (The much smaller figure mentioned in \u00a7\u00a7 51 \u2013 53 of Claimants' second post-hearing brief seems to address a different scenario.) Thus, subtracting 10.8 million from 40.1 leads to a final damage amount for Claimants of **USD 29.3 million**\n\n**D.

Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n689.\n\nIf the Tribunal concludes that all that was guaranteed to Claimants was a \"*reasonable return*\", Respondent would still be liable for breach of the ECT because it implemented changes that were inconsistent with the reasonable return implicit in the FITs originally offered in RD 661/2007.1472\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 591, 669.\n\n690.\n\nBrattle constructed an alternative \"But-For\" scenario to assess damages where all that was guaranteed was the reasonable return implicit in RD 661/2007's FITs, with the following premises: (1) Claimants' plants fell into 2 categories under RD 661/2007: the Majorca plants fit into the \"*less than 100Kw*\" category and the Badajoz plants fit into the \"*less than 10Kw*\" category, (2) the single FIT for each of the two PV types should provide a return for each \"*marginal plant*\" (defined as the most expensive, efficient type of PV plant in either category, which would have had the same FIT under RD 661/2007 as Claimants' plants) equal to 7.0% after taxes, or 8.8% before, (3) each FIT assumes a 25-year regulatory life for each efficient marginal PV plant, and (4) Brattle's own forecasts of inflation and pool prices. Under these assumptions, each per MWh FIT calculated should provide the alleged \"*reasonable return*\" for the marginal PV plant in each category.1473\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 669 \u2013 671; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 232, 238, Figure 6 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n691.\n\nCalculating by reference to the marginal plant is the only way to appreciate efficiency benefits accomplished by investors that developed more efficient plants than the marginal one.1474 This analysis shows that Claimants suffered substantial damages under the \"*reasonable return*\" theory: EUR 42 million (= EUR 39 million sustained by OperaFund and EUR 3 million by Schwab), before adding pre-award interest and tax gross-up.1475 Claimants suffered a 59% (OperaFund) and 75% (Schwab) decline in past cash-flows and future expected earnings.1476\n\nC-III \u00a7 672; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7\u00a7 228 \u2013 229, 238 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 673 \u2013 674; The Report on Draft Royal Decree 661/2007 regulating the activity of electricity production under the special regime and the production of certain facilities with similar technologies under the ordinary regime, p. 1 **[R-0049]** ; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 3.2.1, 81, 254, Table 12 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nCPHB-I \u00a7 78 (59% figure); Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, Table 14, p. 72 **[CER-0004]**.\n\n**2. Respondent's Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n692.\n\nBrattle's \"*Alternative Claim*\" is nothing more than a crude DCF reverse engineering exercise in which the selected parameters have only the aim of resulting in higher damages than those of the main claim.1477 Brattle uses the inflated cost of its theoretical \"*marginal plant*\" and applies an inflated percentage to it. The conversion from post-tax to pre-tax is inconsistent with the reality of a project. Due to (1) the large capital outlays involved in these investments, (2) book depreciation, and (3) tax benefits, the effective tax rate paid by these projects in their first years of life is very low and, thus, the actual difference between pre-tax and post-tax is insignificant.1478 Brattle acknowledged that this alternative claim is based on an asset base and a tariff that do not correspond to the real costs of Claimants' PV Plants or to the tariff of RD 661/2007. Simply by adjusting the asset base of the alternative plants to the costs of standard plants, the claimed damages are reduced by 25%.1479\n\nR-II \u00a7 1408; *Eiser*, \u00a7\u00a7 433 \u2013 434 **[CL-0148]** / **[RL-0077]** / **[RL-0078]** (*rejecting* this Alternative Claim).\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1409 \u2013 1412.\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 82; Tr. Day 4, 67:13 \u2013 70:25, 71:3-14 (Caldwell).\n\n693.\n\nFurther, Claimants' \"*alternative FIT*\" is calculated to reach a result over 25 years, but it then applied to a 35-year lifetime. This resulted in a target return of not 7%, but rather 10% post-tax. Further, the correct reference is not the 7% post-tax target return used, but rather the cost of capital, as this is a regulated market. Using an appropriate set of parameters, there are no damages caused to Claimants.1480\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1413 \u2013 1415; Accuracy, Second Economic Report, \u00a7\u00a7 28 \u2013 29 **[RER-0002]**.\n\n694.\n\nThe *Eiser* tribunal was not persuaded by the alternative claim's use of projected costs of the most expensive type of solar generation as the basis for calculating the future revenues that should accrue to Claimants' different plants.1481\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 83; *Philip Morris v. Uruguay*, \u00a7 473 **[RL-0088]**.\n\n**3. The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n695.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal's conclusions above accepting the primary claim, there is no need to examine and decide on this alternative claim and valuation.\n\n**E. TAX GROSS UP**\n-------------------\n\n**1. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n696.\n\nA tax gross-up should be added to the damages award to ensure full reparation.1482 Brattle's But-For and Actual valuations represent the after tax value of the claims.1483 In the But-For world, Claimants would have obtained returns on their investments *via* dividends, interest from Claimants' subordinated loans, and capital gains. None of these would have attracted taxes in Malta for OperaFund. Schwab would have been taxed 7.83% on the interest income received from its loan investment.1484 Any taxation of this Award imposed in Switzerland or Malta will result in additional harm to Claimants, as a direct result of Respondent's conduct because those taxes would, *de facto*, diminish the amount that Claimants would otherwise obtain. The tax gross-up is necessary to make Claimants whole.1485\n\nC-III \u00a7 599.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 654; Convention between the Swiss Confederation and Spain for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income and on capital signed at Bern on 26 April 1966, as amended by protocols signed on 29 June 2006 and on 27 July 2011 **[C-0315]** ; Tax residency certificate for Schwab, 24 November 2017 **[C-0316]** ; Convention between the Kingdom of Spain and Malta for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, 7 September 2006 **[C-0317]** ; Tax residency certificate for OperaFund, 12 December 2017 **[C-0318]** ; Brattle, Quantum Report, \u00a7 184 **[CER-0002]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 655; CPHB-I \u00a7 93; Schwab Holding AG \u2013 Taxation of income, PriceWaterHouseCoopers, 12 December 2017, \u00a7 4, p. 9 **[C-0319]** / **[BQR-111]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 654 \u2013 668; CPHB-I \u00a7 94; Claimants' Opening Statement, slides 132 \u2013 133; *Saudi Arabian Texaco v.

The payment of taxes on the award is an unavoidable consequence of Respondent's wrongful measures.1487 This is the same approach adopted by the United Nations Compensation Commission when assessing the quantum of reparation due under international law, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, as well as with awards of compensation to private parties for breaches of international law.1488\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 659 \u2013 660.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 661.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 662 \u2013 663; *Saudi Arabian Texaco v.

Respondent cannot be obliged to compensate for these hypothetical damages, over which it has no control.1498 Further, within the EU, the \"*participation exemption*\" is established by Directive 2011/96 for the elimination of taxation within the Member States and any hypothetical compensation should be exempt thereunder. The compensation would also be tax exempt in Switzerland.1499\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 1447 \u2013 1448; ILC Draft Articles, With Commentary, Art. 31 (Reparation) and 36 (Compensation) **[RL-0032]** / **[CL-0028]**.\n\nR- II \u00a7 1449; RPHB-I \u00a7 211 (v); *Masdar*, \u00a7\u00a7 656 \u2013 660 **[CL-0220]** ; *Rusoro v.

The second sentence of Article 21 ECT emphasizes that Article 21 prevails over any other provision of the ECT, including Articles 10, 13, or 26.1502\n\nR-I \u00a7 1272; R-II \u00a7 1439.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 1272 \u2013 1276; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 1441 \u2013 1443.\n\nR-I \u00a7 1277; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 1444 \u2013 1446.\n\n703.\n\nAlternatively, the claim for a tax gross-up is speculative, contingent, and uncertain.1503 Arbitral case law confirms the speculative and uncertain nature of a tax gross-up claim,1504 as does Claimants' Reply on the Merits, where Claimants have failed to prove with the minimum certainty required that (1) a hypothetical award would be subject to taxation in a country and (2) the amount of taxes that would have to be paid.1505 Claimants' *ad hoc* memo does not prove that taxation in Switzerland would be EUR 0.3 million.1506 Rather, that memo shows that \"*(i) there is no valid fiscal rule or case-law that proves this hypothetical taxation; (ii) the hypothetical taxation would be written off with \"tax carry forward losses\", for example; (iii) the hypothetical taxation would depend on the corporate structure, meaning the group's fiscal planning (lack of causality); (iv) the hypothetical taxation would depend on who paid the compensation*.\"1507 Here, Claimants claim EUR 3.6 million in potential taxes that Swiss authorities may impose on part of the award payable to Schwab, and acknowledge that Schwab owns tax loss carry forwards of more than EUR 4 million, which would absorb any possible tax. Claimants are claiming damages for a tax that they are unlikely to pay.1508 Respondent, therefore, cannot be obliged to compensate for the hypothetical damages resulting from (1) acts of another state or (2) private acts or decisions of the Claimant itself or of the companies of its business group.1509\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1456 \u2013 1460; *Abengoa, S.A. and COFIDES, S.A. v.

There is nothing in Article 21 of the ECT prohibiting a tax gross up or limiting a tax gross up to ensure full reparation.1511 To the Tribunal, it is clear that Spain as the Respondent is to pay the entire amount of damages and cannot charge and deduct Spanish taxes on the amount awarded. As other Tribunals have done in similar cases, in view of Respondent's express objection, there is indeed a need to clarify that. Therefore, as a precaution, the Tribunal concludes and will expressly provide in the dispositive of this Award that the Award is made net of all taxes and/or withholdings by Spain, and Spain is ordered to indemnify Claimants for any tax liability or withholding that may be imposed in Spain.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 1441 \u2013 1443; R-I \u00a7\u00a7 1272 \u2013 1276.\n\nC-III \u00a7\u00a7 659 \u2013 660.\n\n**F. INTEREST**\n---------------\n\n**1. Claimants' Arguments**\n---------------------------\n\n706.\n\nInterest compensates for the fact that, during the period of non-payment, the creditor is deprived of the sum owed.1512 Claimants request that Respondent be ordered to pay pre- and post-award interest.1513 Pre-award interest is consistent with the principle of full compensation. Interest is expressly foreseen in Article 26(8) of the ECT and this principle is enshrined in Article 38 of the ILC Draft Articles.1514 After the Hearing, Claimants noted that, although Article 10(1) of the ECT does not establish an interest rate to apply to breaches, Article 13 of the ECT provides for it.1515\n\nC-I \u00a7 865.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 862.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 863 \u2013 864; I.

The requested pre- and post-award interest is inadmissible.1529\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 59, 1404 \u2013 1405; ILC Draft Articles, With Commentary **[RL-0032]** / **[CL-0028]**.\n\n712.\n\nThe pre-award interest must be risk-free and have a maximum period of 4-5 years, which in this case can be a reasonable estimate between the Valuation Date and the Award date. A shorter-term rate could be taken, given that in principle the final period is not known.1530 A higher rate, such as that of a 10-year bond, would imply overcompensation that is contrary to the principle of full reparation and would compensate for risks not taken.1531\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 1257 \u2013 1258; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 1418, 1420; Accuracy, First Economic Report, \u00a7 VI **[RER-0001]**.\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1419, 1421; \"Valuation for Arbitration: Compensation Standards, Valuation Methods and Expert Evidence\" Mark Kantor. 2008 Kluwer Law International, 49 **[RL-0079]**.\n\n713.\n\nThe punitive post-award interest requested by Claimants is higher than the pre-award interest and is, at a 2% spread, exaggerated. Spreads are usually proportional to the benchmark rate. Considering current interest rates of close to zero or even negative, a 2% spread is inappropriate and disproportionate.1532 The *Eiser* tribunal applied a punitive spread of 0.43% - less than \u00bc of what is Claimants are requesting.1533\n\nR-II \u00a7\u00a7 1422\u2013 1424, 1426.\n\nR-II \u00a7 1425; *Eiser*, \u00a7 478 **[CL-0148]** / **[RL-0077]** / **[RL-0078]**.\n\n714.\n\nClaimants state that the Spanish Civil Procedure Act \u2013 a subsidiary law \u2013 adds a \"*moratorium differential*\", but Claimants are conflating concepts.1534 Claimants have omitted from their arguments reasoning in accordance with the Act on General Budgets \u2013 the law that would apply if Spanish domestic law was resorted to \u2013 which establishes (1) a grace period of 3 months and (2) simple, rather than compound interest.1535\n\nR-I \u00a7 1261; C-I \u00a7 872.\n\nR-I \u00a7 1263; R-II \u00a7 1427; Judgment by the Spanish National Audience of 30 June 2014, dismissing administrative appeal 296/2013 **[R-0011]** ; Act 47/2003, Art. 17, 24 **[R-0024]**.\n\n715.\n\nThe legal basis for the award of interest must be the ECT and customary international law, and not domestic law. It is sufficient to turn to the ILC Draft Articles, pursuant to which the punitive nature of post-award interest is inadmissible.1536 The punitive nature of post-award interest was found unacceptable in *Vestey v. Venezuela*, *National Grid v. Argentina*, and *Micula*.1537\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 1262, 1264 \u2013 1265; ILC Draft Articles, With Commentary **[RL-0032]** / **[CL-0028]**.\n\nR-I \u00a7\u00a7 1260, 1266 \u2013 1268; R-II \u00a7\u00a7 1428 \u2013 1430; *Micula v.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016, \u00a7 445 **[RL-0037]**.\n\n716.\n\nAfter the Hearing, Respondent explained that, in the *Masdar* Award, the pre-award interest granted was the government bond rate (0,906%), proximate to a risk-free rate. For pre-award interest, it tailored the term of the bond to the time period to cover. The post-award interest was 1.60%, equivalent to the Spanish 10-year government bond rate. The spread between pre-and post-award interest is less than 1%.1538\n\nRPHB-I \u00a7 211(v); *Masdar*, \u00a7\u00a7 664 \u2013 665 **[CL-0220]**.\n\n**3. The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n717.\n\nInterest compensates for the fact that, during the period of non-payment, the creditor is deprived of the sum owed.1539 It is common practice and needs no further references that interest is due on the amounts ordered as damages in investment cases. Claimants' request that Respondent be ordered to pay pre- and post-award interest1540 is, therefore, admissible and justified.\n\nC-I \u00a7 865.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 862.\n\n718.\n\nPre-award interest is consistent with the principle of full compensation and also generally accepted in investment arbitration and this principle is enshrined in Article 38 of the ILC Draft Articles.1541 For the present case, this is expressly confirmed in Article 26(8) of the ECT which provides as follows: \"*(8) The awards of arbitration, which may include an award of interest, shall be final and binding upon the parties to the dispute.*\"\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 863 \u2013 864; I. Marboe, *Calculation of compensation and damages in international investment law*, Oxford University Press, New York, 2009, \u00a7\u00a7 6.06, 6.16 **[CL-0135]**.\n\n719.\n\nAlthough neither the above provision nor Article 10(1) of the ECT establish an interest rate to apply to breaches, Article 13 of the ECT provides for one as follows:\n\n*Such fair market value shall at the request of the Investor be expressed in a Freely Convertible Currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that currency on the Valuation Date. Compensation shall also include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of Expropriation until the date of payment.*\n\n720.\n\nThis provision is applicable to compensation in case of a lawful expropriation and thus not directly in case of an unlawful breach of the ECT. But it can be concluded that the interest due for an unlawful breach shall not be lower than that for a lawful measure under the ECT. Therefore, the Tribunal takes guidance from this provision to the effect that \"*interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis*\" is at least due for the amount of damages found in the present case.\n\n721.\n\nRegarding the rate of interest, pre-award interest was calculated by Brattle on the basis of Respondent's borrowing rate,1542 in particular at the relevant Spanish 10-year bond yield.1543 This is the benchmark used by Spain under the New Regime to determine the allowed return.1544 Brattle computes this from 20 June 2014 to 30 January 2019 at 1.59%.1545 The Tribunal considers that as reasonable and notes that this rate is lower than the rate of pre-award interest granted by the *Eiser* tribunal (2.07%).1546 The Tribunal considers, however, that this pre-award interest should not be compounded.\n\nC-III \u00a7 598; C-I \u00a7 867; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, \u00a7 26 **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 643; Brattle, Quantum Report, \u00a7 181 **[CER-0002]** ; Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report **[CER-0004]**.\n\nC-III \u00a7 646.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 644, 648; CPHB-I \u00a7 90; C-I \u00a7 867 (stating 0.88%, Brattle, Quantum Report, fn. 140 **[CER-0002]**); Brattle, Quantum Rebuttal Report, fn. 17, Tables S-S16, N2 **[CER-0004]** ; ILC Draft Articles, Art. 38 **[CL-0001]** ; for compound interest, *see Stati v.

Claimants argued that Respondent is obliged to compensate Claimants for all damages effectively caused.

The first such principle is the idea that \"*costs follow the event*\" (the losing party pays part or all of the expenses of the winning party).1553 Tribunals have linked the decision on costs to the full reparation principle under *Chorzow*.1554 Beyond this, recent ICSID decisions confirm a \"*growing awareness of the principle that the losing party should bear the consequences in terms of costs*.\" Respondent has agreed, and its position here is not based on an \"*equal costs share*\" reading of Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention or Rule 28 of the ICSID Rules, but rather on a \"*costs follow the event*\" basis.1555 Claimants note that they would still be entitled to recover the reasonable costs incurred by it, in the unlikely event that the Tribunal does not award them the entirety of the amount of damages. Investment tribunals have consistently granted costs where claimants have not recovered all of the requested damage or succeeded in all claims.1556\n\nC.Costs-I \u00a7 2; C.Costs-II \u00a7\u00a7 5 \u2013 6; ICSID Convention, Art. 61(2); ICSID Arbitration Rules 28, 47(1)(j).\n\nC.Costs-II \u00a7\u00a7 7 \u2013 8, 10 \u2013 11; *Stati v.

The total number of hours worked by Claimants' legal team is less than the average annual billable hours worked by two law firm associates during two years.1576 The legal rates applied to these hours of work are, likewise, reasonable and below many useful comparative references.1577 Further Counsel has acted in other ECT claims against Spain, and tribunals have awarded Costs.1578 The average rate charged for this work (374 EUR/h) is reasonable in light of the rates charged by other teams in international law firms operating in the same market segment, and the rate reflects a proper balance among work completed by lawyers with varying seniority and rates, ranged from 150 EUR/h to 575 EUR/h, where the first level associate's rate is 315 EUR/h.1579\n\nClaimants' Cost Response (12 March 2019), \u00a7 4.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 6.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 7 (calculated as 1350 hours per year, per associate).\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 9 \u2013 11.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 12.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 13 \u2013 15.\n\n733.\n\nClaimants provided a Certificate from the Chief Operating Officer of Cuatrecasas Emilio Martinez Poyatos that Cuatrecasas attorneys had worked 5,355.75 hours, and that by 18 October 2018, the number of registered hours was 5,277.25.

RESPONDENT'S ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n734.\n\nRespondent requests that the Tribunal accept its Submission on Costs and to fix the costs caused to Respondent in this arbitration in the total amount of **EUR 1,541,677.39**, calculated as follows:1581\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Costs Incurred by the Respondent (EUR)** |\n| Advance on Costs paid to ICSID | 426,222.67 |\n| Expert and Witness Submissions | 510,412.25 |\n| Translations | 32,609.36 |\n| Editing and Printing Services | 54,578.28 |\n| Courier Services | 3,020.61 |\n| Travelling Expenses | 14,834.22 |\n| Legal Fees | 500,000.00 |\n| **TOTAL** | **1,541,677.39** |\n\nR.Costs-I \u00a7\u00a7 10 \u2013 18:\n\n735.\n\nArticle 28 of the ICSID Rules require that costs be (1) reasonable and (2) incurred in the proceedings. Respondents have, therefore, requested (1) the detail and proof of the alleged 5,277 hours that Claimants state have been devoted to the present proceedings, (2) the justification for the attorney's fees of EUR 23,603.75 allegedly corresponding to the hours incurred in relation to the EC intervention requests.1582 The number of hours allegedly worked by Claimants' counsel is excessive, equaling 220 working days of 24 hours each, especially given that the same team of attorneys is engaged in at least 6 additional arbitration proceedings against Respondent.1583\n\nR.Costs-II \u00a7\u00a7 2 \u2013 5.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 6 \u2013 7.\n\n736.\n\nClaimants have provided no documentation of the hourly rates charged in this case. Even if one assumed that the middle rate applied as alleged by Claimants, their counsel fees would be reduced from over EUR 1.9 million to around EUR 1.5 million.1584 The Tribunal should note that this amount is still unjustifiable and is triple the fees submitted by counsel for Respondent. Respondent therefore requests that the Tribunal (1) order Claimants to produce the documents proving counsel fees and (2) in the alternative, to reduce the amount of the counsel fee to a reasonable one, lower than EUR 1.5 million.1585\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 8 \u2013 9.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 10.\n\n737.\n\nRespondent points out that there appears to be duplication of expenses, as Claimants state that they have incurred EUR 115,110.54 in \"*other expenses, including travels [sic], accommodations and translations, photocopies and courier services*\", and EUR 5,798.34 in \"*other expenses*\" including \"*costs for taxis, meals in meetings, flights, etc*\" in addition to the same costs that are included as witness costs and costs of the Hearing in Paris of June 2018.1586 These costs, therefore should be excluded from Claimant's cost claim.1587\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 12.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 13.\n\n738.\n\nAlthough the ECT is silent on the allocation of costs, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal exercise its broad discretion by ordering Claimants to pay all costs and expenses derived from this proceeding.1588 Respondent is entitled to its costs on a full indemnity basis.1589 As demonstrated by the EC's application to intervene as amicus, Respondent's objections to jurisdiction are well-founded.1590 Further, these proceedings have demonstrated that Respondent has acted in conformity with its international law obligations under the ECT in relation to Claimants' investment in Spain. Respondent should never have been charged with the burden of defending itself. On damages, Respondent has proven Claimants' failure to provide expert reports that could quantify the separate effect of each of several disputed measures. The audited financial statements show that there has been no impairment to the investment and that the actual profitability of the plants, with the Disputed Measures in place, is higher than the expected IRR.1591 Regarding Claimants' auxiliary remedies, Claimants' request is contrary their expert's position, albeit when engaged by a respondent State, and the tax gross-up with baseless and speculative.1592\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 14 \u2013 17.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 22.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 18.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7\u00a7 19 \u2013 20.\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 21.\n\n739.\n\nIn the alternative, Respondent should not be ordered to bear Claimants' costs, even if Claimants prevail, because the proceedings involved a number of challenging issues which Respondent addressed with professional and effective advocacy.1593\n\n*Id*. at \u00a7 23.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL**\n-------------------\n\n740.\n\nAccording to Article 59 of the ICSID Convention, ICSID has set the cost of arbitration as follows:\n\nArbitrator's fees and expenses:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Professor Dr. Karl-Heinz B\u00f6ckstiegel | USD 400,438.72 |\n| Prof. MMag. Dr. August Reinisch | USD 99,016.66 |\n| Prof. Philippe Sands | USD 133,895.17 |\n| Assistant's fees and expenses | USD 105,568.92 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | USD 148,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses1594 | USD 156,074.90 |\n| **Total** | **USD 1,042,994.37** |\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts. Each Party has made the following advance payments: the Claimants USD 575,000.00, the Respondent USD 574,732.00.1595\n\nThis amount includes charges relating to court reporting and interpretation, catering and courier, and estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Award (courier, printing and copying).\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that each has advanced to ICSID.\n\n741.\n\nTurning first to the allocation of costs between the Parties, using the discretion given tribunals by Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention or Rule 28 of the ICSID Rules, the Tribunal considers it should apply the mostly accepted practice that \"*costs follow the event.*\"1596\n\nC. Schreurer (w. L. Malintoppi, A. Reinisch and A. Sinclair), *The ICSID Convention: a Commentary*, Cambridge University Press, Second Edition 2009, p. 1233 (\u00a7 34) **[CL-0227]** ; *Charanne*, \u00a7\u00a7 560 \u2013 566 **[CL-0030] / [RL-0049]** ; *Isolux*, \u00a7 857 \u2013 865 **[RL-0004]** / **[RL-0076]** ; *Antin*, \u00a7 739 **[CL-0222]**.\n\n742.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal's conclusions found above that Claimants prevail in the range of 30 million and fail with the claim regarding the TVPEE in the range of 10 million, the Tribunal finds it appropriate and decides that:\n\n\u2022 Claimants have to bear 25% and Respondent 75% of the costs of arbitration as set by ICSID, and\n\n\u2022 Respondent has to reimburse Claimants 75% of the expenses of Claimants as the Tribunal finds them to be reasonable.\n\n743.\n\nTurning to the question which expenses submitted by the Parties are considered to be reasonable, the Tribunal does not have to decide whether those submitted by Respondent are reasonable, because above it has decided that none of Respondent's expenses have to be reimbursed by Claimants.\n\n744.\n\nRegarding the expenses submitted by Claimants, the Tribunal has taken note of the objections raised by Respondent1597 and the reasoning submitted by Claimants before and in reply to these objections. The Tribunal has also taken note of Claimants' reply submission thereto dated 12 March 2019 and finds Claimants' submission on their expenses to be in form and content what one usually sees in similar arbitrations. The costs claimed by Claimants do not seem to the Tribunal to be excessive if one compares them to cost claims in similar cases and taking into account that both Claimants' and particularly Respondent's submissions and numbers of exhibits were very voluminous. It is also obvious that Respondent's costs are lower because it used only their in-house counsel.\n\nR.Costs-II \u00a7\u00a7 2 \u2013 9.\n\n745.\n\nThe total of the expenses claimed by Claimants is therefore accepted to be EUR 2,627,669.57 (=USD 2,914,742.48)1598 plus CHF 26,850.15 (=USD 27,372.93),1599 which as converted totals USD 2,942,115.41. Accordingly, 75% of this total shall be reimbursed by Respondent to Claimants, i.e. USD 2,206,586.56.\n\nConverted using \"Transferwise\" on 28 August 2019 and rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nConverted using \"Transferwise\" on 28 August 2019 and rounded to the nearest cent.\n\n**XIII. DECISIONS**\n-------------------\n\n746.\n\n**For the reasons above, the Tribunal decides as follows:**\n\n**1. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims submitted by Claimants, except****for the claim regarding the tax measures of the TVPEE.**\n\n**2. Respondent has breached its obligations under Article 10(1) ECT to provide fair and equitable treatment and stable conditions to Claimants.**\n\n**3. Respondent shall pay damages to Claimants amounting to USD 29.3 million.**\n\n**4. The Award is made net of all taxes and/or withholdings by Spain, and Spain is ordered to indemnify Claimants for any tax liability or withholding that may be imposed in Spain**.\n\n**5. On the above amount, Respondent shall pay simple interest at the Spanish 10-****year bond yield rate from 20 June 2014 to the date of this Award.**\n\n**6. On the above amount, Respondent shall pay interest at the Spanish 10-year bond yield rate from the date of this Award compounded monthly till the time of payment.**\n\n**7. Claimants shall bear 25% and Respondent 75% of the total costs of arbitration as set by ICSID to be USD 1,042,994.37. The Respondent shall thus pay Claimants USD 260,748.59.**\n\n**8. Respondent shall reimburse Claimants USD 2,206,586.56, representing 75% of the expenses of Claimants.**\n\n**9. All other claims are dismissed.**"}]}
