INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis is an arbitration brought before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States dated 18 March 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\") and the Agreement Between the Government of the Republic of France and the Government of the Republic of Peru for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated 6 October 1993 (\"France-Peru BIT\" or \"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\").1\n\nAgreement Between the Government of the Republic of Peru and the Government of the French Republic for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, 6 October 1993 **(Exh. C-1-A RFA; Exh. R-060).**\n\n**A.** The Parties\n------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants**\n--------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants in this arbitration are Ms. Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy (\"Ms. Levy\"), a French national, and Gremcitel S.A. (\"Gremcitel\"), a company organized under the laws of the Republic of Peru, with its offices in Lima (jointly, \"the Claimants\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants have been represented in this arbitration by:\n\nUntil 6 May 2014:\n\nCarlos Paitan Contreras   \nChristian Carbajal Valenzuela   \nJos\u00e9 Salcedo Machado   \nDanny Quiroga Anticona\n\nESTUDIO PAITAN & ABOGADOS   \nAv.

It purports to put the dispute in its context, rather than to provide an exhaustive description of all the events relevant for the dispute.\n\n**1. The privatization of the land**\n------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe dispute concerns three parcels of land (called \"La Herradura\", \"Punta del Sol\", and \"La Chira\"), located along Peru\u2019s Pacific Coast near Lima, within the Municipality of Chorrillos. The three parcels of land are adjacent to the so-called \"Morro Solar\", an area that is claimed to be the site of one of the most important battles in Peruvian history, the Battle of San Juan and Chorrillos, which occurred in 1881 in the Pacific War between Peru and Chile (\"the Battle\").\n\n8.\n\nOn 19 September 1977, as the centennial anniversary of the Battle was approaching, Peru\u2019s Ministry of Housing and Construction issued Resolution No. 2019-77-VC-1100 (the \"1977 Resolution\") declaring the Morro Solar intangible.2\n\nResolution Declaring the Morro Solar Intangible, Supreme Resolution No. 219-77-VC-1100, 19 September 1977 **(Exh. C-069; Exh. R-002)** (\"RESOLVES: 1. To declare Intangible the land of the Morro Solar of Chorrillos and the bordering land Indicated in map Nos. 5 and 6 of the General Zoning Plan of Metropolitan Lima 1977-1990 [... ]\", Tribunal\u2019s translation).\n\n9.\n\nOn 30 December 1986, Peru\u2019s National Institute of Culture (\"INC\" by its Spanish initials) issued Resolution No. 794-86-ED (the \"1986 Resolution\").3 Through this Resolution the INC declared as \"Monuments\" a number of buildings and areas, including the Morro Solar.\n\nResolution Declaring Morro Solar an Historical Monument, Ministerial Resolution No. 794-86-ED, 30 December 1986 **(Exh. C-058; Exh. R-006).**\n\n10.\n\nThe scope and import of both the 1977 Resolution and the 1986 Resolution are disputed between the Parties.\n\n11.\n\nIn 1995, the Municipality of Chorrillos held a public bidding process (which goes by the name of *Concurso de Proyectos Integrales)4* to sell the three parcels of land to private individuals on the basis of the projects that these individuals proposed for the development of the land.5 As a result of these procedures, the three parcels were transferred to the winning bidder.\n\nC-Memorlal, \u00b6\u00b672-73.\n\nR-CM, \u00b6 53.\n\n12.\n\nOn 21 August 1995, La Herradura was awarded to the company JC Contratistas Generals EIRL (\"JC Contratistas\"). The sales contract for this parcel of the land was concluded on 22 August 1995.6 On 8 September 1995, Gremco, a Peruvian company belonging to the Levy Group,7 acquired the land from JC Contratistas for US$ 3 million.8 This sales contract was approved by the Municipality of Chorrillos on 12 September 1995.\n\nSales Purchase Agreement Between MCH and JC Contratistas for La Herradura, 22 August 1995 (part of Exh. **C-1-P RFA; Exh. R-062).**\n\n*See* C-Memorlal, \u00b6 5; CWS Levy, \u00b6 2.\n\nSales Purchase Agreement Between JC Contratistas and Gremco for La Herradura, 8 September 1995 (part of Exh. **C-1-Q RFA; Exh. R-063),** pp. 9-10.\n\n13.\n\nOn 7 November 1995, the Municipality of Chorrillos awarded the bid concerning Punta del Sol to Gremco, and the relating sales contract of the land was concluded on 15 November 1995. Gremco agreed to pay US$ 1 million for the land, plus US$ 3.3 million of in-kind public construction works.9\n\nPublic Deed of Sales Purchase Agreement Between Municipality of Chorrillos and Gremco for Punta del Sol (complete version), 15 November 1995 **(Exh. R-331),** p. 12.\n\n14.\n\nOn 18 December 1995, Gremco was awarded the third parcel of land, La Chira. The related sales contract was signed on 28 December 1995. Gremco agreed to pay US$ 1 million for the land, plus US$ 2.5 million of in-kind public construction works.10\n\nSales Purchase Agreement Between MCH and Gremco for La Chira, 28 December 1995 (part of Exh. **C-1-S RFA; R-065),** pp. 9-10.\n\n15.\n\nThe sales contract for La Herradura contains the following clause:\n\n\"6.03. If necessary, and at the request of the buyer, the Municipality [of Chorrillos] must lend its official support In the requests that the Buyer must effectuate before the Municipality of Lima [...] as well as before any other competent authority for obtaining the authorizations that may be required for an adequate development of the Project [...].\"11\n\nSales Purchase Agreement Between MCH and JC Contratistas for La Herradura, 22 August 1995 (part of Exh. **C-1-P RFA; Exh. R-062),** pp. 15-16 (Tribunal\u2019s translation).\n\n16.\n\nThe sales contracts for La Chira and Punta del Sol contain similar language.12\n\nSales Public Deed of Sales Purchase Agreement Between Municipality of Chorrillos and Gremco for Punta del Sol (complete version), 15 November 1995 **(Exh. R-331),** p. 14; Sales Purchase Agreement Between MCH and Gremco for La Chira, 28 December 1995 (part of Exh. **C-1-S RFA; R-065),** p. 13.\n\n17.\n\nThe precise legal effects of the three contracts are disputed between the Parties. While according to the Claimants they created the obligation upon Peru to facilitate the execution of the project and to issue the necessary permits to this end,13 the Respondent contends that such contracts did not give Gremco the right to develop the land free from the legal restrictions that were applicable to such areas.14\n\nC-Memorlal, \u00b6 83.\n\nR-CM, \u00b6 58\n\n18.\n\nThe three projects were later consolidated by Gremco into the \"Costazul Project\", a tourism and real estate \"urban megaproject\".15\n\nC-Memorial, p. 11.\n\n19.\n\nCertain differences between Gremco and the Municipality of Chorrillos over the obligations arising under those sales contracts were submitted to a domestic arbitration pursuant to the arbitration clauses contained in such contracts. The arbitration resulted in an arbitral award of 15 January 2001, which declared the sales contracts valid and ordered the Municipality to comply with its obligations regarding certain registrations in the public registry and the release of a specific part of the land.16\n\nArbitral Award, Resolution No. 15, *Municipality of Chorrillos v. Gremco,* 15 January 2001 **(Exh. C-018; Exh. R-092).**\n\n20.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2004 the Peruvian company Gremcitel, one of the two Claimants in this arbitration, acquired the land and the rights relating to the Costazul Project from Gremco. Both Gremcitel and Gremco are, according to the Claimants, part of the Levy Group.17 The price agreed for the sale of La Herradura and La Chira was set at US$ 60 million, to be paid from the future cash flow which would result from the projects on the two parcels of land.18 The contract also provided that Gremco would retain 99% of the future profits from the Costazul Project and Gremcitel would only receive 1% as a project management fee. The payment for these two parcels was later suspended in an agreement between Gremco and Gremcitel.19 In this respect, the Respondent contends that no price was ever paid for such sale.20\n\nC-Memorial, \u00b6 **5.**\n\nPublic Registry of 18 February 2003, Sale Agreement Between Gremco and Gremcitel, With Intervention by Townhouse, For the Land in La Herradura and La Chira, 20 January 2003 **(Exh.

(Peruvian *Nuevos Soles)* 42,144,520.00 (equivalent to around US$ 12 million) to be paid after a 5-year grace period.21 The Parties agreed that Gremcitel would pay the value of the land by entering into an advertising agreement that would promote the Costazul Project. The grace period was subsequently extended until 2020.22\n\nPublic Registry of 21 April 2006, Sales Contract Between Gremco and Gremcitel for Punta del Sol, 15 January 2004 **(Exh. C-028; Exh.

The events up to October 2007**\n------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nAfter Gremco acquired the land from the Municipality of Chorrillos, a number of interactions occurred between Gremco (and later Gremcitel) and various governmental and municipal authorities, in the form of exchanges of correspondence, applications for permits or authorizations, and reports. The aim of many of these exchanges with the Peruvian authorities was for Gremco/Gremcitel to identify potential areas in which development would be restricted. This section summarizes the most important of these exchanges and other occurrences involving the Authority of the Costa Verde Project (a.), the National Institute of Culture (b.) and the Municipality of Chorrillos (c.).\n\n**a. The Authority of the Costa Verde Project**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Authority of the Costa Verde Project (\"APCV\" by its Spanish initials) is a governmental body entrusted with the preservation, protection and sustainable development of Peru\u2019s Pacific Coast ecosystem known as Costa Verde, which includes the three parcels of land owned by the Claimants. In particular, the APCV ensures that any land development along the Costa Verde complies with the Costa Verde Master Plan.23\n\nThe APCV's role and the Costa Verde Master Plan are explained In the Regulation for Law 26,306 Recognizing Various Municipalities' Ownership of the Land In Costa Verde **(Exh. C-043; Exh. R-052).**\n\n24.\n\nOnce La Herradura, La Chira and Punta del Sol had been consolidated to form the Costazul Project, the APCV granted Gremco the Prior Certification of Compatibility with the Costa Verde Master Plan through Resolution 015-2003/MML/IMP, issued by Lima's Metropolitan Institute of Planning (APCV's technical secretariat) on 18 June 2003.24\n\nIMP Directorial Resolution No. 015-2003/MML/IMP, 18 June 2003 (part of Exh. **C-050; Exh. R-068).**\n\n25.\n\nIn August 2006, Gremcitel applied for the Final Certification of Compatibility for part of the land, which has not been issued by the APCV to date. This certification would be granted following an in-depth review of the project and would be the final step in the APCV's evaluation.\n\n**b. The National Institute of Culture25**\n------------------------------------------\n\nIn 2010, the INC was subsumed Into the Ministry of Culture or \"MOC\". See Law Creating the Ministry of Culture, Law No. 29565, 22 July 2010 **(Exh. R-044).**\n\n26.\n\nIn July 2001, Gremco submitted a proposal for the historical delimitation of the Morro Solar to the INC.26 A year later, in May 2002, Gremco and the INC signed an Agreement of Cooperation. The purpose of the Agreement was to \"carry out joint actions to delimit the archeological areas\" located in the Claimants' property.27\n\nProposal to Delimit Historical Morro Solar, 3 July 2001 **(Exh. R-211).**\n\nAgreement of Cooperation Between INC and Gremco, May 2002 *(Convenio de Cooperation Interinstitucional)* **(Exh. R-015),** Article 2 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n27.\n\nFollowing this Agreement and subsequent archeological investigations, the INC's National Technical Commission of Archeology (\"CNTA\" by its Spanish initials), issued Decision No. 330 of 25 June 2003. The CNTA determined that there were \"no new grounds to lift the intangibility of the Morro Solar [...] and therefore ratified] its monumental nature established by [1977 Resolution]\".28 Such decision also established that \"Gremco S.A. should submit and carry out an evaluation project aimed at the delimitation, prospecting and restricted excavation\" of part of its land.29\n\nDecision by the National Technical Commission of Archeology Evaluating Archeological Sites In the Morro Solar, Decision No. 330, 25 June 2003 **(Exh. R-021),** at \"Resolved\", \u00b6 2 (Tribunal\u2019s translation).\n\n*Ibid.,* at \"Resolved\", \u00b6 5 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n28.\n\nThe CNTA also referred the file to the National Technical Commission of Qualifying Architectural Projects (\"CNTCPA\" by its Spanish initials) responsible for the evaluation of historical, as opposed to archeological, cultural heritage in Peru.30 In its Decision No. 1 of 11 August 2003, the CNTCPA stated that it \"concur[red] technically with all of the views taken by the [CNTA] in its Decision N\u00b0 330\" and advised Gremco how to handle the archeological and historical sites found on its land, noting that any urban development plans would have to be submitted to the INC for approval.31\n\nA distinction must be made between archeological and historical cultural heritage. Peru's legal framework distinguishes between (I) cultural heritage from the pre-Hispanic era (archaeological) and (ii) cultural heritage from the colonial and republican eras (historical). See Regulation on Archaeological Investigations, Supreme Resolution No. 004-2000-ED, 24 January 2000 (part of Exh. **C-045; Exh. R-010);** General Law of National Cultural Heritage, Law No. 28296, 21 July 2004 (part of Exh. **C-044; Exh. R-034).**\n\nDecision by the National Technical Commission to Evaluate Architectural Projects, Evaluating the Historical and Archeological Value of the Morro Solar, Decision No. 1.11 August 2003 **(Exh. R-022),** at \"Decided\", \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 9 (Tribunal's translation).\n\n29.\n\nFollowing a re-evaluation request put forward by Gremco, the INC convened a special joint session of the CNTA and the CNTCPA, which issued a Joint Decision on 10 December 2003.32 In this decision, the two Commissions ratified Decision No. 330 and therefore maintained the intangibility of the Morro Solar.\n\nJoint Decision of National Technical Commission of Archeology and National Technical Commission to Evaluate Architectural Projects Regarding Archeological and Historical Sites In the Morro Solar, 10 December 2003 **(Exh. R-024).**\n\n30.\n\nOn that same date, Gremco submitted a report to the INC regarding the implementation of their Agreement of Cooperation, containing a delimitation proposal for the archeological and historical areas.33\n\nGremco\u2019s Report to the INC on the Implementation of the Inter-Institutional Agreement Between the INC and Gremco, 10 December 2003 **(Exh. R-247).**\n\n31.\n\nGremco also sent the INC a letter attaching a legal report on 23 December 2003, claiming that Decision No. 330 was null and void.34 Through March and April 2004, Gremco sent several letters to the INC regarding the delimitation of the historical and archeological sites, once again criticizing Decision No. 330 for adopting different delimitation criteria than those applied with regard to other archeological sites in Lima,35 proposing that each of the archeological sites be delimited individually36 and explaining that the Battle did not take place on Gremco's land.37\n\nLetter from Gremco to INC Attaching Legal Report, 23 December 2003 **(Exh. R-250),** p. 72.\n\nLetter from Gremco to INC Regarding the Delimitation of Archeological Sites, 9 March 2004 **(Exh. R-028).**\n\nLetter from Gremco to INC Regarding the Delimitation of Archeological Sites, 2 April 2004 **(Exh. R-029).**\n\nLetter from Gremco to INC Regarding the Delimitation of Historical Sites, 15 March 2004 **(Exh. R-263).**\n\n32.\n\nFollowing this correspondence, the CNTA issued Decision No. 197 of 25 May 2004,38 in which it delimited the individual archeological areas. It thereby reduced the area that was considered intangible for archeological reasons.\n\nDecision by National Technical Commission of Archeology Evaluating Archeological Sites in the Morro Solar, Decision No. 197, 25 May 2004 **(Exh. R-032).**\n\n33.\n\nOn 12 July 2004, the INC created an Ad Hoc Commission \"to assess and review the status of the land owned by Gremco.\"39 The Ad Hoc Commission issued a report on 14 October 2004 with recommendations regarding the delimitation of both the archeologically and historically relevant areas within Gremco\u2019s land. In particular, the Ad Hoc Commission issued the following \"recommendations\", the scope and import of which are disputed:\n\n\"1. That the National Institute of Culture determine the intangible area, delimiting It to an area corresponding to the historic zone of the Morro Solar declared a Historical Monument, recognizing for the monumental area a zone that surrounds the actual formal commemorations and includes the Monument of the Unknown Soldier, the monument of General Iglesias, the Observatory, the Obus, the Cross of the Morro and the Chapel of the Virgin.\n\n2. As a result of the above, the National Institute of Culture requests that the Ministry of Education, in the exercise of its functions, perfect the Ministerial Resolution No. 794-86-ED and establish the boundaries of the above-mentioned Historical Monument.\"40\n\nResolution Creating the Ad Hoc Commission, National Directorial Resolution No. 508/INC, 12 July 2004 **(Exh.

R-035),** p. 8 (Tribunal\u2019s translation).\n\n34.\n\nOn 26 November 2004, the INC issued Resolution No. 1260/INC,41 which provided a number of Certificates of Inexistence of Archeological Artifacts (\"CIRA\" by its Spanish Initials) for those areas free of any archeological remains. Through the years 2005 to 2007, the INC Issued further CIRAs.42 The Claimants contend that by the time Resolution 1342/INC of 2007 was adopted (described below), five CIRAs had been granted in their favor, attesting that around 80% of the Claimants\u2019 land was free of archeological artifacts impeding the development of the project.43\n\nResolution Approving CIRAs and Recommending the Creation of an Historical Commission, National Directorial Resolution No. 1260/INC, 26 November 2004 **(Exh.

C-057).**\n\nC-Memorial, \u00b6 110.\n\n35.\n\nResolution No. 1260/INC of 26 November 2004, together with Resolution No. 184/INC of 22 February 2005,44 also created a Historical Commission entrusted with \"proposing the delimitation of the intangible historical area of Morro Solar\".45 That Commission issued a Report in July 2005 proposing boundaries of the intangible historical area of the Morro Solar.46 The Report was the basis for the subsequent 2007 Resolution issued by the INC, which largely adopted the delimitation resulting from the study by the Historical Commission.47 The Respondent claims that the Historical Commission conducted a careful review of historical evidence related to the Battle. The Claimants in turn view the findings of the Historical Commission as arbitrary and claim that the 2005 Report was \"a document for the INC's internal use that was not communicated to Gremco or Gremcitel.\"48\n\nResolution Creating the Historical Commission to Evaluate the Delimitation of the Historical Site of the Morro Solar, National Directorial Resolution No. 184/INC, 22 February 2005 **(Exh.

Because the Municipality of Chorrillos did not react (neither approving nor denying the application) within 60 days, Gremcitel considered that the application had been granted by \"positive administrative silence\" *(silencio administrativo positivo)* and registered the Urban Development Permit at Lima's Public Registry.49\n\nC-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6112-115.\n\n**3. Resolution No. 1342/INC of 10 October 2007**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nOn 10 October 2007, the INC issued Resolution 1342/INC (the \"2007 Resolution\"), which provided a precise delimitation of the boundaries of the Morro Solar.50 According to the Claimants, this act imposed on the land an intangibility status which did not exist until then and thus rendered the Costazul Project meaningless.51 For the Claimants, the 2007 Resolution is the measure that gave rise to the dispute.\n\nResolution Delimiting the Intangible Historical Zone of Morro Solar, National Directorial Resolution No. 1342/INC, 10 October 2007 (issued), 18 October 2007 (published) **(Exh.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A.** Initial Phase\n--------------------\n\n38.\n\nOn 5 November 2010, the Claimants set in motion the 6-month negotiation period pursuant to Article 8(2) of the BIT.52 Negotiation efforts were reiterated on 6 December 201053 and 11 March 2011.54\n\nLetter from the Claimants to Peru\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Finance, 5 November 2010 **(Exh. C-1-H RFA).**\n\nLetter from the Claimants to Peru\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Finance, 6 December 2010 **(Exh. C-1-1 RFA).**\n\nLetter from the Claimants to Peru\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Finance, 11 March 2011 **(Exh. C-1-J RFA).**\n\n39.\n\nOn 9 May 2011, the Claimants considered that the negotiation period had expired and manifested their acceptance of the offer to arbitrate contained in the BIT.55\n\nLetter from the Claimants to Peru\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Finance, 9 May 2011 **(Exh. C-1-K RFA).**\n\n40.\n\nOn 17 May 2011, the Claimants filed their Request for arbitration. On 24 June 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request.\n\n41.\n\nOn 29 August 2011, following appointment by the Claimants, Eduardo Zuleta, a Colombian national, accepted his appointment as arbitrator. On 21 September 2011, following appointment by the Respondent, Raul Vinuesa, an Argentinean and Spanish national, accepted his appointment as arbitrator. On 21 November 2011, following appointment by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, accepted her appointment as presiding arbitrator.\n\n42.\n\nOn 22 November 2011, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun. On the same date, the Centre informed the Parties that Ms. Alicia Martin Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel, would serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n43.\n\nOn 19 April 2012, the Tribunal and the Parties held a first session in Washington, D.C.\n\n44.\n\nOn 4 May 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 concerning procedural matters and the procedural calendar.\n\n**B.** Written Phase on Jurisdiction and Merits\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nOn 17 August 2012, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits, with one witness statement and three expert reports.\n\n46.\n\nOn 21 December 2012, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, with six witness statements and three expert reports.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent filed a request for document production on 22 January 2013. The Claimants filed a request for document production on 25 January 2013.\n\n48.\n\nOn 19 February 2013, the Trlbunal Issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning production of documents.\n\n49.\n\nOn 26 March 2013, the Claimants filed their Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, with three witness statements and five expert reports.\n\n50.\n\nOn 28 May 2013, the Tribunal Issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning new requests for production of documents filed on 24 April 2013 by the Respondent and on 2 May 2013 by the Claimants.\n\n51.\n\nBy letter dated 1 July 2013, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on the Merits and Jurisdiction. The Respondent explained that It had Included In its brief a section on jurisdiction because It had received through document production, conducted after It had filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, a number of new documents related to jurisdiction that It had previously not had an opportunity to address.\n\n52.\n\nBy letter of 17 July 2013, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal not bifurcate the proceedings between jurisdiction and merits. On 24 July 2013, the Respondent agreed on a non-bifurcated proceeding. On 30 July 2013, the Tribunal confirmed that the Hearing would thus deal with both jurisdiction and merits Issues.\n\n53.\n\nOn 30 September 2013, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n54.\n\nOn 2 October 2013, the Tribunal Issued Procedural Order No. 4 on the organization of the Hearing.\n\n55.\n\nOn 24 October 2013, the Tribunal, upon request of the Claimants and after having heard the Respondent, granted the Claimants leave to Introduce two new documents Into the record.\n\n**C.** November Hearing and Further Submissions\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nOn 7-14 November 2013, the Hearing on jurisdiction and merits was held in Washington, D.C.

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND RELIEF REQUESTED**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A.** The Claimants\u2019 Position and Request For Relief\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, the Claimants have made the following main submissions.\n\nOn jurisdiction\n---------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute. The Claimants fulfill the nationality requirements set forth in Articles 25 of the ICSID Convention and 1 of the BIT. In particular, Ms. Levy holds French nationality (and does not hold Peruvian nationality), and has owned and controlled Gremcitel, a Peruvian company, indirectly since 2005 (through the company Hart Industries Ltd., hereinafter \"Hart Industries\") and directly since 2007. Ms. Levy\u2019s ownership and control of Gremcitel thus confer French nationality to Gremcitel, pursuant to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8(3) of the BIT.\n\n64.\n\nThere is a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment. Article 1 of the BIT defines investment in broad terms, including movable and immovable property, shares, obligations, rights to performance having economic value, and the Claimants\u2019 investment falls within such broad definition.\n\nOn the merits\n-------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Respondent has breached its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment pursuant to Article 3 of the BIT. In particular, the Claimants advance the following arguments:\n\n\u2022 The Respondent has frustrated the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations that they would be able to develop the Costazul Project. The 2007 Resolution rendered their investment meaningless.\n\n\u2022 The Respondent also failed to act transparently when it did not involve the Claimants in the approval process for the 2007 Resolution. Further, the declaration of intangibility contained in the 2007 Resolution as well as the \"erratic and contradictory behavior\" by the INC were \"unpredictable\",56 and thus constituted a violation of the obligation to maintain a stable legal framework.\n\n\u2022 Moreover, the issuance of the 2007 Resolution constituted an act which was arbitrary, because it lacked any technical and objective foundation, and was in contradiction with existing provisions and regulations. The Claimants were also discriminated against certain local populations, which despite residing on similarly protected areas of the Morro Solar, were not treated in the same way as the Claimants.\n\n\u2022 Finally, the Respondent engaged In acts of bad faith, coercion, or harassment towards the Claimants.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6261.\n\n66.\n\nFor these reasons, In their Reply on the Merits, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal find that \"It has jurisdiction on the Claimants\u2019 claim and that such claim is admissible\". The Claimants also requested the Tribunal to accept their claim on the merits and to declare Peru\u2019s International responsibility because of the breach of its obligations In the BIT and award the Claimants the entirety of the damages sought, which their expert, Mr. Ferro, quantified at US $ 41 billion.57\n\nC-Reply, p. 79\n\n67.\n\nIn their last request for relief, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to:\n\n\"(1) Assume jurisdiction over all the claims filed by the Claimants against the Republic of Peru on the basis of the Peru-France BIT.\n\n(2) Declare that the Peruvian State is liable for the breach of the international obligations assumed under the Peru-France BIT.\n\n(3) Establish the damages incurred and interest applied.\n\n(4) Require the Respondent to pay the costs and fees incurred by the Claimants throughout the arbitral proceedings.\n\n(5) Establish any additional damages and compensation that the Tribunal deems appropriate.\"58\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6 121 (Tribunal\u2019s translation). See *also* C-PHB 2, \u00b6 76\n\n**B.** The Respondent\u2019s Position and Request For Relief\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions, the Respondent put forward the main following arguments:\n\nOn jurisdiction/abuse of process\n--------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over this dispute because the Claimants are not \"Investors\" within the meaning of the BIT. Ms. Levy has not put forward reliable evidence as to her shareholding In Gremcitel, and the hurried transfer of shares which allegedly made Ms. Levy the controlling shareholder of Gremcitel constitutes an \"abuse of process\", having been carried out for the sole purpose of attracting the France-Peru BIT protection at a time the dispute had either already arisen or was at least entirely foreseeable.\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal also lacks jurisdiction because the Claimants have no \"Investment\" under either the ICSID Convention or the BIT. Indeed, they have no \"right to develop\" the so-called Costazul Project and Ms. Levy has not established that she made any financial contribution to acquire the investment. Accordingly she took no risk when she allegedly acquired her shares in Gremcitel.59\n\nInitially, the Respondent also requested that the Tribunal declare the Claimants\u2019 claims Inadmissible because In the Respondent\u2019s view the same dispute that is before this Arbitral Tribunal was being litigated In the Peruvian courts. See R-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 214-223. This objection was later withdrawn by the Respondent. See R-Rejoinder, p. 62, fn. 226 (\"Peruvian courts dismissed all of Gremcltel\u2019s challenges to Resolution No. 1342/INC. [...] Because Gremcltel\u2019s domestic law challenges to Resolution No. 1342/INC are now concluded, Respondent withdraws its objection to the admissibility of Claimants\u2019 claims based on the litigation In Peru\u2019s courts\").\n\nOn the merits\n-------------\n\n71.\n\nFor the event that the Tribunal were to find that it had jurisdiction, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to dismiss the claims. In particular: (i) the Claimants could have no legitimate expectations that they could develop their land free from restrictions; (ii) Peru has acted transparently at all times, and the 2007 Resolution should be seen as a mere confirmation of the legal framework established by the previous 1977 and 1986 Resolutions; (iii) the 2007 Resolution\u2019s delimitation is not arbitrary, as it was based on a careful historical review; and finally (iv) Peru has not discriminated against the Claimants nor committed any acts of coercion, harassment or in bad faith against them.\n\n72.\n\nFor these reasons, in its Rejoinder on the Merits and Jurisdiction, the Respondent requested \"that (i) the Tribunal dismiss Claimants\u2019 claims for lack of jurisdiction; or, in the event that the Tribunal were to find jurisdiction; (ii) dismiss Claimants\u2019 claims for lack of merit\".60\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 490. The Respondent reiterated these requests for relief, on jurisdiction and the merits, In its post-hearing submissions. *See* R-PHB 1, \u00b6 99; R-PHB 2, \u00b6 53.\n\n73.\n\nFinally, the Respondent also requests an award of costs, including counsel fees, incurred in these proceedings. The Respondent notes that \"several events during the hearing - *e.g.,* Claimants\u2019 decision not to question Ms. Harris after they demanded her presence at the hearing and to abandon their transparency claims - have materially added to Respondent\u2019s costs and provide additional reasons to award costs against Claimants\".61\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00b6 100.\n\n**IV. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n---------------------------\n\n74.\n\nPrior to entering the merits of the Parties' positions, the Tribunal will address the relevance of previous decisions or awards (1) and the applicable legal framework (2).\n\n**A.** Relevance of previous decisions and awards\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nIn support of their positions, both Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards, either to conclude that the same solutions should be adopted In the present case or In an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from a solution reached by another tribunal.\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal's view is that It is not bound by previous decisions of ICSID or other arbitration tribunals. At the same time, It is of the opinion that It should pay due regard to earlier decisions of International tribunals. The Tribunal is further of the view that, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, It has a duty to follow solutions established In a series of consistent cases, comparable to the case at hand, but subject of course to the specifics of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case. By doing so, It will meet its duty to contribute to the harmonious development of Investment law and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and Investors towards certainty of the rule of law.62\n\nArbitrator Eduardo Zuleta has a slightly different view only with respect to the text of paragraph 76, which in no way affects his concurrence with, and affirmative vote for, the Award in this case.\n\n**B.** Legal Framework\n----------------------\n\n77.\n\nThis arbitration is brought under the ICSID Convention and the France-Peru BIT. The Interpretation of these two Instruments is governed by customary International law as codified by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"Vienna Convention\" or \"VCLT\").\n\n**V. JURISDICTION / ABUSE OF PROCESS**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**A.** Law Applicable to Jurisdiction\n-------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal's jurisdiction is governed by the ICSID Convention (1. below) and by the BIT (2. below).\n\n**1. ICSID Convention**\n-----------------------\n\n79.\n\nJurisdiction under the ICSID Convention is governed by Article 25, which reads as follows:\n\n\"(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not Include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\"\n\n**2. The BIT**\n--------------\n\n80.\n\nThe France-Peru BIT was concluded in French and Spanish, both language versions being equally authentic.63 The Parties have mainly referred to the Spanish version of the Treaty, and indeed only the Spanish version has been put in the record.64 At the Hearing, the Tribunal asked the Parties about potential differences between the French and Spanish versions of certain Treaty provisions, as a result of which the Respondent referred to the French version of the Treaty in its post-hearing submissions.65\n\n*See* Article 12, last sentence, of the BIT.\n\nAgreement Between the Government of the Republic of Peru and the Government of the French Republic for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, 6 October 1993 **(Exh. C-1-A RFA; Exh. R-060).**\n\nR-PHB 1, fn. 83, referring to the French version of the Treaty.\n\n81.\n\nThe main provisions of the BIT are set out in both language versions below.

Les sentences arbitrales sont d\u00e9finitives et obligatoires.\"*\n\n**B.** Outline\n--------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent has put forward the following objections relating to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal:66\n\n*\u2022 First,* the Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the BIT because the Claimants have not demonstrated that they were \"Investors\" under the BIT at the time the events occurred that gave rise to the dispute. For the Respondent, the documents that the Claimants have submitted purporting to show Ms. Levy\u2019s direct and Indirect ownership of Gremcitel In 2005 and 2007 are rife with Inconsistencies, hand-written corrections, and unverlflable claims. In addition, Gremcitel does not qualify as an Investor under Article 8(3) of the BIT because It was not controlled by a French national before the dispute at Issue In this case emerged.\n\n*\u2022 Second,* the Respondent argues that the Claimants\u2019 Investment is an abuse of process. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Irregularities of the documents purporting to show Ms. Levy\u2019s alleged ownership and the testimony at the Hearing demonstrate that Ms. Levy attempted to acquire Interest In Gremcitel In a hurry, when key actions of the government were taken or were about to be taken. Such conduct is evidence that Ms. Levy acquired her alleged interest in Gremcitel for the sole purpose of internationalizing an existing or foreseeable, and otherwise purely domestic, dispute, which constitutes an abuse of process.\n\n*\u2022 Third,* the Respondent argues that the Claimants have no \"investment\" under either Article 25 of the ICSID Convention or the BIT. First, the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that they ever had a \"right to develop\" the Costazul project, on which they base their claim. Furthermore, they have failed to produce any evidence that they have made any monetary contribution and thus have not undertaken any risk in their alleged investment.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the order and the presentation of the Respondent\u2019s objections has somewhat varied throughout its pleadings. The Tribunal has chosen to discuss the objections in the order which the Respondent has adopted in its first post-hearing submission. See R-PHB 1, \u00b6\u00b6 25-67 (where the Respondent argues firstly that \"Claimants are not investors\", secondly that \"Claimants\u2019 alleged investment is an abuse of process\", and thirdly that \"Claimants have no investment\").\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimants have rebutted the Respondent\u2019s objections with the following arguments:\n\n*\u2022 First,* Ms. Levy, a French national, acquired indirect control over Gremcitel in 2005 (when she acquired 33.3% of the shares in Hart Industries, which was the main shareholder of Gremcitel) and direct control over Gremcitel in 2007 (when she acquired 58.82% of the shares in Gremcitel). Therefore, Gremcitel should also be considered a French company as it was under French control before the dispute arose (in accordance with Article 8(3) of the BIT and Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n*\u2022 Second,* the Claimants submit that an allegation of abuse of process requires a high standard to be met. The Respondent has not established that the Claimants had foreseen the event which gave rise to the dispute (/.e., the issuance of the 2007 Resolution), and that they accordingly manipulated Gremcitel\u2019s nationality to gain access to ICSID.\n\n*\u2022 Third,* the Claimants have made an investment by acquiring the land and the relating right to develop it, by holding rights and interests related to the land, as well as licenses and other types of authorizations. These assets fall within the broad definition of investment contained in Article 1 of the BIT as well as within Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, the Claimants contend that, while the 2005 transfer of shares occurred free of charge, this was due to the intra-family nature of the corporate restructuring. In addition, Ms. Levy\u2019s 2007 acquisition of the Gremcitel shares occurred in exchange of a payment in kind (through the exchange of shares which she held in a company called \"Holding XXI\").\n\n87.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 detailed positions are summarized in the following paragraphs.\n\n**C.** First objection: The Claimants are not investors under the **ICSID** Convention **AND THE BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe positions of the Parties with respect to this objection are presented as follows. First, the Claimants\u2019 main allegations of fact are set out (1. below). Second, the Respondent\u2019s position is presented (2. below). Finally, the Claimants\u2019 rebuttal to the Respondent\u2019s objections is dealt with (3. below).\n\n**1. The Claimants\u2019main allegations**\n-------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they fulfill the requirements *ratione personae* and *temporis* pursuant to the BIT and the ICSID Convention. For the Claimants, the dispute arose on 18 October 2007 when the 2007 Resolution, which was Issued on 10 October 2007, was published In Peru\u2019s Official Journal *(Diario Oficial El Peruano).67* On this date, they contend, the BIT was In force and Ms. Levy was an Indirect and direct shareholder In Gremcitel. More specifically, the Claimants allege that Ms. Levy became an Indirect shareholder In Gremcitel In 2005 when she acquired shares In Hart Industries, one of Gremcltel\u2019s shareholders, and that she became direct shareholder by acquiring an Interest In Gremcitel In October 2007.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 **16.**\n\n90.\n\nFirst, the Claimants argue that Ms. Levy acquired Indirect ownership of Gremcitel In 2005, when she acquired 33.3% of the capital of Hart Industries, a Grenadian company which owned 57,460 out of 64,000 shares In Gremcitel, *i.e.,* 84.5%, until 9 October 2007. The Claimants have produced the following documents to establish Ms. Levy\u2019s ownership of shares In Hart Industries:\n\n(i) *Hart Industries corporate resolution dated 7 February 2005.68* The Claimants submit that through this resolution, Mr. Levy, then sole shareholder and director of Hart Industries, resolved to amend Article 7(2) of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Hart Industries In order to divide the 1000 shares Into three groups, one of which would be a group of 333 \"preferred shares\" that would exercise exclusive control over the company.\n\n(ii) *Hart Industries corporate resolution dated 9 February 200569* It is the Claimants\u2019 contention that this corporate resolution approved the transfer of the preferred shares from Mr. Levy to his sister Ms. Levy.\n\n(iii) *Hart Industries corporate resolution dated 7 March 2005.70* According to the Claimants, through this resolution, the 9 February 2005 transfer of the shares was ratified and all powers and rights in the company were transferred to Ms. Levy \"until all legal proceedings concerning resolutions dated February 7th 2005 and February 9th 2005 are finished\".\n\nCorporate Resolution of Hart Industries Ltd, 7 February 2005 (part of Exh. **C-110; Exh. R-293).**\n\nCorporate Resolution of Hart Industries Ltd, 9 February 2005 (part of Exh. **C-110; Exh. R-294).**\n\nCorporate Resolution of Hart Industries Ltd, 7 March 2005 **(Exh. C-108; Exh. R-292).**\n\n91.\n\nSecond, the Claimants contend that on 9 October 2007 Ms. Levy acquired from Hart Industries 40,000 shares in Gremcitel, *i.e.,* 58.82%. It is the Claimants\u2019 argument that Ms. Levy received the 40,000 Gremcitel shares in exchange for her shareholding in the company Holding XXI (a company registered in Panama).71 The Claimants refer, amongst other documents, to the registration of the sale of the shares in Gremcitel\u2019s Shareholders\u2019 Registry Book of 9 October 2007,72 as well as to the Share Transfer Agreement for Holding XXI, bearing the same date.73\n\nShare Transfer Agreement for Holding XXI, 9 October 2007 **(Exh. C-1-N RFA; Exh. R-070).**\n\nRegistration of Sale of 40,000 Gremcitel Shares Between Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Hart Industries, 9 October 2007 **(Exh. C-014; Exh. R-069).**\n\nShare Transfer Agreement for Holding XXI, 9 October 2007 **(Exh. C-1-N RFA; Exh. R-070).**\n\n**2. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the dispute because the Claimants have not shown that they were protected investors under the France-Peru BIT *at the time of the events allegedly giving rise to the dispute.74* For the Respondent, the Claimants \"must show that they owned or controlled a protected investment at the time when the events about which they complain occurred\".75 More specifically, \"Ms. Levy must prove that any ownership interest she acquired in Gremcitel was acquired before the challenged act occurred\".76\n\nR-CM, \u00b6 163.\n\nR-PHB 2, \u00b6 26 (discussing *Alasdair Ross Anderson et at v. Republic of Costa Rica', Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" S.A. v. Republic of Turkey, Libananco Holdings Co. Ltd. v. Republic of Turkey, Vito G. Gallo v. Government of Canada). See also* R-CM, \u00b6 164; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 246.\n\nR-PHB 2, \u00b6 29.\n\n**a. Ms. Levy has not proven that she owned Gremcitel directly or indirectly at the time of the 2007 Resolution**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nEven if it were correct (which the Respondent disputes) that the 2007 Resolution is the measure which gave rise to the dispute (as the Claimants argue), the Respondent contends that the Claimants have not discharged their burden to prove Ms. Levy\u2019s ownership of Gremcitel, be it direct or indirect, at the time when the 2007 Resolution was issued. According to the Respondent, the documents allegedly supporting the share acquisitions are \"questionable\"77 or \"highly suspicious\".78\n\nR-CM, \u00b6 165.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 280.\n\n**i. Indirect shareholding in Gremcitel**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent takes Issue with the documents on which the Claimants rely to show Ms. Levy\u2019s acquisition of an Indirect Interest In Gremcitel In 2005, specifically with the corporate resolutions of Hart Industries of 7 February 2005,79 9 February 2005,80 and 7 March 2005.81\n\nCorporate Resolution of Hart Industries Ltd, 7 February 2005 (part of Exh. **C-110; Exh. R-293).**\n\nCorporate Resolution of Hart Industries Ltd, 9 February 2005 (part of Exh. **C-110; Exh. R-294).**\n\nCorporate Resolution of Hart Industries Ltd, 7 March 2005 **(Exh. C-108; Exh. R-292).**\n\n95.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that the *Hart Industries corporate resolution of 7 February 2005,* by which Mr. Levy purportedly resolved to amend the Memorandum and Articles of Association of Hart Industries In order to divide the 1000 shares Into three groups, one of which would be a group of 333 \"preferred shares\" that would exercise exclusive control over the company, is Invalid because It has not been registered In the Grenadian public registry.82 The Respondent refers to its expert on Grenadian law, Ms. Sheila Harris, who explained In her expert report and at the Hearing that under Grenadian law any amendment to a company\u2019s Memorandum of Association must be registered to come Into effect.83 The Respondent underscores that at the Hearing, Ms. Harris testified that the amendment was never registered In Grenada,84 and therefore, under Grenadian law, the amendment - and thus also the subsequent share transfer to Ms. Levy made pursuant to that amendment - never came Into effect.85 According to the Respondent, this means that Ms. Levy never became a shareholder In Hart Industries.86 Because the Claimants had no answer to Ms. Harris\u2019 testimony and declined to cross-examine her, the Respondent submits that such testimony remains un re butted.\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00b6 30.\n\nExpert Opinion of Sheila Harris, 30 June 2013 **(Exh. RWS-021),** \u00b6\u00b67-8; Tr. (Harris), at 835:3-20.\n\nTr. (Harris), at 839:9-16.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00b6 30.\n\n96.\n\nSecond, with regard to the *Hart Industries corporate resolution dated 9 February 2005* approving the transfer of the certificate representing the preferred shares from Mr. Levy to his sister Ms. Levy, the Respondent Identifies a discrepancy between the date of the notarization of the document, which is 7 February 2005, and the date on the document transferring the shares, which is 9 February 2005. According to the Respondent, a notary public cannot witness signatures two days before the signatures were made.87 Further, the Respondent notes that the stamp used by the notary public, Ms. Claudette Joseph, for the notarization of the 9 February 2005 resolution indicated that her commission would expire on October 13, 2011. Because in Grenada the duration of a notary\u2019s commission is 5 years, the Respondent submits that the corporate resolution could only have been notarized after 13 October 2006, and not on 9 February 2005.88\n\nR-CM, \u00b6 169.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 258.\n\n97.\n\nIn response to these objections, the Claimants produced an undated \"rectification\" to the notarization of the corporate resolution of Hart Industries of 9 February 2005.89 The rectification reads as follows:\n\n\"I Claudette Joseph Notary Public In and for the state of Grenada, West Indie hereby certify that this document was acknowled [sic] ~~executed~~ before me by Mr. Isy Levy and ~~witnessed before me~~ by Mr. Teddy R. St. Lou on the 9th day of February 2005.\n\nI certify further that the date shown by me being 7th February 2005, was a genuine error on my part.\"\n\nRectification to Corporate Resolution of Hart Industries Ltd of 9 February 2005, undated (part of Exh. **C-110; Exh. R-295).**\n\n98.\n\nFor the Respondent, this rectification does nothing but heighten suspicions about the unreliable nature of the corporate documents invoked by the Claimants. In fact, the Respondent sees a number of issues:\n\n(i) the rectification must have occurred at least seven years after the original notarization. While it is undated, the notary stamp records the expiration date of the notary\u2019s commission, which is 4 April 2017. Because of the 5-year duration of a notary\u2019s commission already mentioned, the rectification must, in the Respondent\u2019s view, have occurred after 2012.90\n\n(ii) the unreliability of the rectification is also evidenced by the struck-through words written by the notary, which evidence her confusion as to what she actually acknowledged;91\n\n(iii) it is unclear how the notary public exactly \"acknowledged\" Mr. Isy Levy\u2019s signature, when, the Respondent argues, Mr. Levy was not in Grenada at that time, as shown by a Report of the Ministry of Interior of Peru;92 and\n\n(iv) the very notary public\u2019s reliability is, in the Respondent\u2019s view, questionable as she issued a legal opinion about the Claimants\u2019 compliance with Grenadian corporate law having herself been involved in the transaction.93\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 255.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 256.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 257.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 259.\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that, at the Hearing, Ms. Joseph was confronted under cross-examination with some of these issues. According to the Respondent, she admitted that she backdated her notarization of the corporate resolution of 9 February 2005. She also conceded that she did not see the document until 2010 *(i.e.,* 5 years after the document was allegedly signed):\n\n\"the Resolution was presented to me sometime In 2010. The specific date I can\u2019t remember. And It was presented by Mr. St Louis and Mr. Levy, both appearing In person before me...\".94\n\nTr. (Joseph), at 749:17-20.\n\n100.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent contends, Ms. Joseph had no way of knowing when the document was created or signed.95 Ms. Joseph also added that \"[n]ow, a specific request was made for the document to be dated as of the date it was prepared and signed, which is 2005\".96 The Respondent underscores that she also stated that she would never have backdated the document had she known that it would be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal.97\n\nR-PHB 1,\u00b632.\n\nTr. (Joseph), at 750: 2-4.\n\nTr. (Joseph), at 758: 3-11.\n\n101.\n\nThus, according to the Respondent, \"evidence on the record and testimony from the hearing suggest that the second resolution, while nominally dated 9 February 2005, was likely created in 2010 (well after the dispute arose) and backdated to 2005 for the purposes of this arbitration\".98\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00b631.\n\n102.\n\nWith regard to the rectification, the Respondent notes, Ms. Joseph explained that sometime between April 2012 and March 2013, Mr. Levy came back to Ms. Joseph and requested that she \"correct\" her initial backdated notarization so that it would be consistent with the date when the document was allegedly executed.99\n\nTr. (Joseph), at 754: 17 to 757: 18.\n\n103.\n\nTherefore, according to the Respondent, \"Ms. Joseph\u2019s testimony made it clear that neither the original February 9, 2005 resolution nor the more recent \u2018rectification\u2019 is at all credible, because there is no way to verify when the actual execution of the document occurred\".100\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00b6 34.\n\n104.\n\nThird, the Respondent submits that It is unclear why the *Hart Industries corporate resolution of 7 March 2005,* which approved the 9 February 2005 transfer of the shares \"until all legal proceedings concerning resolutions dated February 7th 2005 and February 9th 2005 are finished\", also transferred to Ms. Levy all the corporate powers and rights, If she already had them as owner of the preferred shares.101 Furthermore, In the Respondent\u2019s submission the reference to \"legal proceedings\" must be read as a reference to the future BIT proceedings.102\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6261-262.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6263. In addition, the reference to \"legal proceedings\" is, in the Respondent\u2019s view, evidence of the Claimants\u2019 abuse of process, on which see *infra* paragraph 175.\n\n**ii. Direct shareholding in Gremcitel**\n----------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent also disputes the accuracy and probative value of the documents allegedly showing Ms. Levy\u2019s acquisition of direct ownership In Gremcitel In 2007.\n\n106.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that Gremcltel\u2019s Shareholder Registry is Inconsistent with the Minutes of a Gremcitel Shareholders\u2019 Meeting, which fall to record a number of relevant share transfers.103 The Respondent further contends that the transfer of the 40,000 Gremcitel shares from Hart Industries to Ms. Levy did not comply with Peruvian law. The Respondent submits that, among other alleged Irregularities, Gremcltel\u2019s corporate documents record Inconsistent dates of the transfer. The Respondent notes that Hart Industries and Ms. Levy notified Gremcitel of the share transfer by way of a letter dated 10 October 2007,104 whereas Gremcitel had already registered the transfer the day before, on 9 October 2007.105 For the Respondent, this is Illogical and contrary to Gremcltel\u2019s own bylaws.106\n\nR-CM, \u00b6 172.\n\nLetter from Hart Industries and Ren\u00e9e Levy to Gremcitel Regarding Transfer of Shares, 10 October 2007 **(Exh.

Thus, Respondent\u2019s evidence and arguments stand unrebutted, and the Tribunal should not rely on any of the documents put forward by Claimants as evidence of an alleged 2007 investment by Ms. Levy in Gremcitel\".113\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00b6 35.\n\n109.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent submits that based on the documents on record and testimony at the Hearing, the Claimants have failed to prove either that Ms. Levy became an indirect investor in Gremcitel in 2005 or a direct investor in Gremcitel in 2007.\n\n110.\n\nFinally, the Respondent alleges that Ms. Levy has not proven \"foreign control\" over Gremcitel for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention and Article 8(3) BIT. Citing to ICSID cases *Vacuum Salt v. Ghana, LETCO v. Liberia,* and *Caratube v. Kazakhstan,* the Respondent contends that ownership in a company is not *per se* sufficient to meet the foreign control requirement, but that \"actual control\" is required, something that Ms. Levy is not shown to have ever exerted.114\n\nR-CM, \u00b6\u00b6 199-203.\n\n**b. The Claimants were not investors when the alleged breaches occurred**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s submission, the dispute arose much earlier than the 2007 events discussed above. It has proposed several possible dates.\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s general thesis is that the status of the Morro Solar as Intangible and historically valuable was established with the 1977 and 1986 Resolutions, the 2007 Resolution being a mere confirmation of the previous ones. For the Respondent, the dispute over the status of the Morro Solar thus crystallized well before the Claimants made their Investment. In 1977 and 1986, the Claimants held no Interest In the land or the proposed project, Gremcitel having acquired the land from Gremco In 2003-2004 and Ms. Levy\u2019s earliest Involvement going back to 2005 when she allegedly acquired Indirect ownership over Gremcitel.115 At the time of the 1977 and 1986 Resolutions, the Respondent adds, not only were the Claimants not Investors, but the France-Peru BIT was not In force yet. The BIT entered Into force on 30 May 1996 and thus the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over this case. According to the Respondent, the conclusion that disputes which predate the treaty\u2019s entry Into force are outside of a treaty\u2019s temporal scope of application, should also be confirmed In the absence of an express clause In the BIT to this effect. The Respondent refers to ICSID case law and to the non-retroactlvlty principle (as expressed In both the VCLT and the ILC Articles on State Responsibility).116\n\nR-CM, \u00b6 184.\n\nSee R-CM, \u00b6191.\n\n113.\n\nAlternatively, the Respondent argues that the dispute arose no later than 2004, but likely as early as 2001, when Gremco started disputing the land\u2019s archeological and historical delimitation.117 The Respondent relies on the following events to show that there was a dispute \"long before Ms. Levy was allegedly Injected Into the corporate structure of Gremcitel, either In 2005 or 2007\":118\n\n\u2022 The 3 July 2001 \"Proposal of Historical Delimitation - Morro Solar\" submitted by Gremco to the INC,119 which, In the Respondent\u2019s view, shows that Gremco was requesting the INC to redefine the Morro Solar more narrowly (that is, as encompassing only the so-called \"Chorrillos Peak\"), and thus from then on \"began disputing the land\u2019s historical protection\".120\n\n\u2022 The May 2002 \"Agreement of Cooperation Between INC and Gremco\",121 which in the Respondent\u2019s submission represents an attempt by the INC and Gremco to amicably resolve the \"dispute\" between the parties.122\n\n\u2022 A number of subsequent exchanges between Gremco and/or Mr. Levy, on the one side, and the INC, on the other,123 in which Gremco contested the INC\u2019s position that the entire promontory should be protected.124\n\n\u2022 The 2004 creation of the Ad Hoc Commission to obtain an opinion on the Parties\u2019 diverging views on the delimitation. The Respondent contends that, even if the discussions within that framework were harmonious, the parties had opposing views - *i.e.,* they disagreed about the proper delimitation of the historical area of the Morro Solar.125\n\n\u2022 The creation of the Historical Commission by the end of 2004, entrusted with the task of proposing a delimitation of the historical area, which in the Respondent\u2019s submissions shows that, by late 2004, the Levys knew that the INC still had not adopted Gremco\u2019s position on a narrow delimitation of the historical area of the Morro Solar, and were on notice that the INC may issue a conclusive delimitation of the historical area of the Morro Solar including Gremcitel\u2019s land.126\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00b6 46; R-Rejoinder, 290-315.\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00b6 47.\n\nProposal to Delimit Historical Morro Solar, 3 July 2001 **(Exh.

The Claimants have standing to bring this dispute under the ICSID Convention and the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they have standing to bring this dispute under the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Ms. Levy is a French national and does not hold a Peruvian nationality. Gremcitel is a Peruvian corporation which at the time when the dispute arose was controlled by Ms. Levy. It thus qualifies as a French entity pursuant to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8(3) of the BIT.127\n\nC-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; C-PHB 1, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n\n115.\n\nOn the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis,* the Claimants emphasize that the BIT\u2019S dispute settlement clause refers to \"any dispute relating to an Investment\". its text is unambiguous: while It contains limitations *ratione personae* (\"between a party and national or company of the other Contracting Party\") and *ratione materiae* (\"relating to an Investment\"), It contains no restrictions related to time.128 The Claimants argue that, If the Contracting Parties to the BIT had Intended to Introduce a temporal limitation, they could have said so.129\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6 61.\n\nIt is not entirely clear to the Tribunal what time limitations the Claimants had in mind. See C-PHB 1, \u00b6 63 (\"Si Per\u00fa y Francia hubieran querido introducir en el APRRI restricciones temporales tales como la prohibici\u00f3n de que el inversionista plantee controversias que estuvieran apoyadas en hechos o actuaciones sucedidos antes de su ingreso en la inversi\u00f3n protegida, as\u00ed lo hubieran hecho\"); C-PHB 1, \u00b6 66 (\"la ausencia de una cl\u00e1usula de exclusi\u00f3n en el Art\u00edculo 8(1) del BIT confirma que Per\u00fa y Francia no quisieron prohibir expresamente las controversias preexistentes con una cl\u00e1usula de exclusi\u00f3n simple, ni controversias relacionadas con hechos que datan antes de la entrada del inversionista extranjero en la inversi\u00f3n.\"). *But* see C-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 27 (\"En el presente caso, se acredita a continuaci\u00f3n que nacionales franceses ejercieron control de la inversi\u00f3n en el Per\u00fa y que dicho control en Gremcitel fue *antes de los actos estatales denunciados\",* emphasis added), 30 (\"En ambos casos, ya sea como controlante indirecta, por medio de Hart Industries, \u00f3 como controlante directa en Gremcitel; el control franc\u00e9s de la compa\u00f1\u00eda en el Per\u00fa ya se ejerc\u00eda *antes del surgimiento de los actos estatales que afectaron la inversi\u00f3n\u2019\u2019,* emphasis added), and 46 (\"En lo que se refiere al requisito *Ratione Temporis* para acceder a la jurisdicci\u00f3n del CIADI, *espec\u00edficamente en relaci\u00f3n al momento en que surgen los actos denunciados* [...]\", emphasis added). In light of the Tribunal's determination of the time when the dispute arose, the Iimitations addressed in C-PHB 1, \u00b6\u00b6 63, 66 do not come into play whatever they may be and, hence, the exact meaning of the Claimants\u2019 argument can be left undecided.\n\n**b. The dispute arose on the date of publication of the 2007 Resolution**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nIn any event, In the Claimants\u2019 submission the dispute arose on 18 October 2007 when the 2007 Resolution was published In Peru\u2019s Official Journal *(Diario Oficial El Peruano).130* On this date, the BIT was In force and Gremcitel was directly owned and controlled by a French national (Ms. Levy).131\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 16.\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6 5.\n\n117.\n\nFor the Claimant, the previous resolutions and reports Invoked by the Respondent cannot be the true source for the dispute. The 1977 Resolution had an \"urbanlstlc\" character (\"car\u00e1cter urban\u00edstico\")132 and did not purport to have any \"historical\" value, because the Issuing body (the Ministry of Housing and Construction) had no authority In this respect and because It was not based on historical methods. The fact that the 2007 Resolution does not refer to the 1977 Resolution In any way confirms that the latter is not an \"antecedent\" of the former.133\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 46.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 48.\n\n118.\n\nWith regard to the 1986 Resolution, the Claimants underscore the \"declarative character\" of such resolution, which simply purported to include a list of \"historical monuments\" without carrying out any delimitation of the protected areas. Also, the 1986 Resolution does not make any reference to the 1977 Resolution.134 The Claimants also rely on other documents to show that the dispute about the delimitation for *historical* reasons arose only with the 2007 Resolution.135\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 49-53.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6\u00b654-62.\n\n119.\n\nFor the Claimants, it is clear that the dispute arose only with the 2007 Resolution because only at that moment was there (i) a formal position by the INC signaling that specific geographical coordinates constituted the delimitation of the intangible historic area of the Morro Solar (which included Gremcitel\u2019s land); (ii) a formal position by Gremcitel opposing the INC\u2019s determination; and (iii) the communication between the two parties of their antagonistic positions.136\n\nC-PHB 2, \u00b6 61.\n\n120.\n\nAll the exchanges between Gremco and the Peruvian authorities up to the 2007 Resolution should be viewed as evidencing normal relations of coordination, without conflicts or differences of positions.137 This is also the case of the 2002 Agreement on Cooperation, which was based on the collaboration of both Parties (and can thus not be viewed as an act giving rise to a dispute).138 Moreover, the exchanges which occurred thereafter between the parties should be considered as \"proposals\" within the framework of the Cooperation Agreement with a view to arriving at an agreed delimitation.139\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 63.\n\nC-PHB 2, \u00b6 18.\n\n*See* C-PHB 2, \u00b6 62. *See also* C-PHB 2, \u00b6\u00b619-28, discussing the Decision by the National Technical Commission of Archeology Evaluating Archeological Sites In the Morro Solar, Decision No. 330, 25 June 2003 **(Exh. R-021);** Decision by the National Technical Commission to Evaluate Architectural Projects, Evaluating the Historical and Archeological Value of the Morro Solar, Decision No. 1.11 August 2003 **(Exh. R-022);** Joint Decision of National Technical Commission of Archeology and National Technical Commission to Evaluate Architectural Projects Regarding Archeological and Historical Sites In the Morro Solar, 10 December 2003 **(Exh. R-024).**\n\n121.\n\nWith regard to the Ad Hoc Commission\u2019s Report of 2004, the Claimants underscore that its nature was that of a recommendation, which is thus insusceptible of constituting a state\u2019s antagonistic position required for the existence of a dispute.140 Thus, the fact that Ms. Levy became a shareholder of Hart Industries a few months after the institution of the Historical Commission in 2005 is irrelevant, because the creation of such Commission was part of the execution of the Cooperation Agreement and its Report could not bind the INC, which was the exclusive authority competent to proceed with the delimitation.141\n\nC-PHB 2, \u00b6 33.\n\nC-PHB 2, \u00b6 63.\n\n122.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimants underscore that also the Historical Commission\u2019s findings were Issued In the form of a recommendation, and were thus Incapable of creating a definitive position on the part of the State.142 Further, the Historical Commission\u2019s Report of 2005 was a purely Internal document, which was never communicated to either Gremco or Gremcitel. The Claimants contend that they acquired knowledge of this document only through the 2007 Resolution. Finally, the argument that Mr. Cock, one of the Claimants\u2019 consultants and witnesses, had knowledge of the Resolution through its contacts at the INC is, In the Claimants\u2019 view, entirely speculative.143\n\nC-PHB 2, \u00b6 35.\n\nC-PHB 2, \u00b6\u00b636-37.\n\n123.\n\nIn conclusion, according to the Claimants, It is only the formal act taken through the 2007 Resolution that gave rise to the dispute between the Parties.144\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6\u00b667-74.\n\n**c. Ms. Levy has owned Gremcitel indirectly since 2005 and directly since 2007**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Ms. Levy validly acquired Indirect shareholding In Gremcitel In 2005 (through ownership of Hart Industries) (I) and direct shareholding In Gremcitel In 2007 (\u00a1I).\n\n**i. Indirect shareholding in Gremcitel**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nThe Claimants accept that the shares In Hart Industries were transferred to Ms. Levy In 2005 without compensation, but emphasize that the transfer was part of an Intra-family corporate reorganization in accordance with the decisions of Isy\u2019s and Ren\u00e9e\u2019s father, David Levy.145 The Claimants point to the minutes of the Levy Group meeting of 15 July 2005, which record that Ms. Levy would assume the presidency of the Group\u2019s meetings from then on.146 Thereafter, according to the Claimants Ms. Levy was an active participant in the operations of Gremcitel, as can be seen from the minutes of the Levy Group meetings in the years 2005, 2006, 2007.147\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6 48.\n\nSee Levy Family Meeting Minutes, 15 July 2005 **(Exh. C-082; Exh. R-071),** pp. 1-2.\n\nSee Levy Family Meeting Minutes (several dates) **(Exh. C-109).**\n\n126.\n\nWith regard to the three Hart Industries corporate resolutions (of 7 February, 9 February and 7 March 2005 respectively), the Claimants rebut the Respondent\u2019s objections as follows:\n\n127.\n\nFirst, with regard to the *Hart Industries corporate resolution dated 7 February 2005,* the Claimants contend that, unlike what the Respondent and its expert, Ms. Harris, argue, this resolution is valid and the validity is not affected by the fact that it was not registered as required under Grenadian law. According to the Claimants, the object of this resolution was not to modify Hart Industries\u2019 Memorandum of Association or its Articles of Association, but to divide the existing shares in different classes. For that purpose, it was not necessary to proceed to such amendment, because Article 7(3) of the Memorandum of Association provided that the shares are divided in such number and classes as determined by the Directors.148 In the Claimants\u2019 submission, this is what happened through said resolution, which thus complied with the applicable corporate norms and Grenadian law, and did not constitute an amendment or modification of the corporate norms.149\n\nMemorandum and Articles of Association of Hart Industries Ltd., 22 October 1998 **(Exh. R-297** (Full version)).\n\nC-PHB 2, \u00b6\u00b6 43-50.\n\n128.\n\nSecond, with regard to the *Hart Industries corporate resolution dated 9 February 2005,* the Claimants contend that the Respondent\u2019s position that the transfer of shares occurred (or is likely to have occurred) after the date indicated in the document is entirely speculative.150 With regard to Ms. Joseph\u2019s testimony, the Claimants argue that it was sufficient for her to acknowledge that the person appearing before her would attest that the date appearing on the document was the one in which the person executed the document.151\n\nC-PHB 2, \u00b6 51.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n129.\n\nFurthermore, in the Claimants\u2019 view, this resolution should not be viewed in isolation, but in conjunction with other documents which attest that the transfer of the shares effectively occurred in 2005.152\n\n*See* C-Reply, 18, 23 and C-PHB 2, \u00b6\u00b652-54, discussing Hart Industries Share Register **(Exh. C-** **107)** and Certificate of Registered Agent Teddy St. Louis, 25 February 2013 **(Exh. C-112).**\n\n130.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants submit that in accordance with Grenadian law, corporate resolutions need not be notarized in order to be valid.153\n\nC-PHB 2, \u00b6\u00b655-56.\n\n131.\n\nThird, in connection with the *Hart Industries corporate resolution of 7 March 2005,* the Claimants do not accept that the reference to \"legal proceedings\" In such resolution is a reference to the future ICSID proceedings. Referring to the testimony of Ms. Joseph, the Claimants submit that the term \"legal proceedings\" should not be Interpreted strictly. Because the resolution was drafted by Mr. Levy, who is not familiar with the laws of Grenada, the reference to \"legal proceedings\" should be Interpreted widely (as meaning proceedings In general, Including administrative and notary).154\n\nC-PHB 2, \u00b6\u00b658-59.\n\n**ii. Direct shareholding in Gremcitel**\n----------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nWith regard to the 2007 transfer of Gremcitel shares to Ms. Levy, the Claimants contend that such transfer was carried out following all applicable legal requirements.155 The Claimants note that Gremcltel\u2019s other shareholders were notified of the Intended transfer In September 2007, and asked whether they wished to exercise their right of first refusal.156 As can be seen from those letters, the transfer was set In motion (through the request to the shareholders to exercise such right) as of 4 September 2007, which renders the Respondent\u2019s argument on the transfer having occurred \"the day before the Issuance of 2007 Resolution\" untenable.157 Furthermore, as in the case of the 2005 transfer, the Levy Group Meeting Minutes evidence, according to the Claimants, Ms. Levy\u2019s active participation in Gremcitel both before and after the Issuance of the 2007 Resolution.158\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b658.\n\nSee the letters addressed to the shareholders between 4-8 September 2007 **(Exh. C-114; Exh. C-115).**\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b658.\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6 59, referring to Levy Family Meeting Minutes (several dates) **(Exh. C-082; Exh. R-071)** and Levy Family Meeting Minutes (several dates) **(Exh.

Also, the sworn statement filed with the tax authorities in 2007 does not mention the names or the shareholding of the main shareholders.\"160\n\n*See* C-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 30-34. *See supra* paragraph 107.\n\nAudit Report by BDO Pazos, Lopez de Roma\u00f1a, Rodriguez, 5 March 2012, \"Informe de los auditores independientes\" (part of Exh. **C-117; R-307),** p. 1.

R-308).**\n\nSee Gremcitel\u2019s Shareholders\u2019 Meeting Minutes, 15 March 2013 (part of Exh. **C-117; Exh. R-305).**\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 35.\n\n**4. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n**a. Relevant issues**\n----------------------\n\n135.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that Gremcitel is both a claimant in its own name through the mechanism of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8(3) of the BIT, and part of Ms. Levy\u2019s alleged investment under Article 1(1)(b) (which comprises shares in a company constituted in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties). Although, as will be seen, the resolution of the issues relating to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione temporis* over Ms. Levy and Gremcitel requires addressing facts which are closely intertwined with each other, for the sake of clarity the Tribunal deems it appropriate to first set out the requirements which each of the two Claimants must fulfill under the ICSID Convention and the BIT to have the standing to bring this arbitration.\n\n136.\n\nMs. Levy must fulfill the following jurisdictional requirements:\n\na. Under Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, Ms. Levy must be a national of one of the ICSID Contracting States on the dates she consented to submit the dispute to arbitration and when the request for arbitration was registered under Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. She must not be a Peruvian national on either one of these dates.\n\nb. Under Article 1(1) of the BIT, Ms. Levy must fulfill the definition of \"national\", *i.e.,* she must be a French national.\n\n137.\n\nWhile In principle these propositions are uncontroversial, It is a matter of contention whether, In addition, Ms. Levy had to own or control her Investment on a critical date.\n\n138.\n\nIn turn, the following jurisdictional requirements must be met for Gremcitel to bring claims In its own name:\n\na. Under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention:\n\nI. Gremcitel \"had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute\" on the date of consent;\n\nII. \"the parties have agreed [that It] should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of [the ICSID Convention]\";\n\nIII. \"because of foreign control\".\n\nb. Under Article 8(3) of the BIT, Gremcitel was controlled by a national of the other Contracting Party *(i.e.,* a French national) on a critical date (\"antes *delsurgimiento de la controversia\"* In the Spanish version of the Treaty; *\"avant que le diff\u00e9rend ne soit soulev\u00e9\"* \u00a1n the French version).\n\n139.\n\nWith these Issues \u00a1n mind, the Tribunal will now address whether Ms. Levy (b. below) and Gremcitel (c. below) fulfill the requirements *ratione personae* and *temporis* under the ICSID Convention and the BIT. By contrast, the Tribunal will not deal In this context with the requirement of the existence of an \"Investment\" under Articles 25 of the ICSID Convention and 1 of the BIT, as this Issue is the subject of a separate jurisdictional objection.\n\n**b. Whether Ms. Levy fulfills the requirements** ***ratione personae*** **and** ***temporis*** **under the ICSID Convention and the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nIt is undisputed that Ms. Levy is a French national and that she held French nationality on both dates set forth In Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, *i.e.,* the date of consent and the date of registration of the request for arbitration. It is further undisputed that she is not a Peruvian national. It is equally common ground that Ms. Levy fulfills the definition of \"national\" under Article 1(2) of the BIT.165\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the BIT does not refer to an \"investor\", but rather speaks of a \"national\" or a \"company\" (see the BIT provisions quoted *supra* at paragraphs 81-84). Thus, the Tribunal understands the Respondent\u2019s references to the Claimants not being \"investors\" under the BIT to mean nationals/companies who have made an investment or who own/control an investment, depending on the context.\n\n141.\n\nThe Parties disagree, however, on whether Ms. Levy had to own and control her Investment on a certain date under the BIT. The relevant question is on which date a \"national\" or \"company\", as defined in Article 1 of the BIT, must have acquired its investment in order to be entitled to claim under the BIT. As stated above, while the Respondent contends that Ms. Levy must show that she owned or controlled her investment \"when the event about which she complains occurred\", the Claimants argue that the BIT contemplates no such temporal limitation.166\n\nSee *supra* paragraphs 92, 114-115.\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by recalling the principles that govern treaty interpretation. According to Article 31 of the VCLT, a treaty \"shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". The \"ordinary meaning\" of the text must be ascertained in the light of the context and the treaty\u2019s object and purpose, any subsequent agreement or practice of the Contracting Parties related to the interpretation of the treaty, and any other relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the Contracting Parties.167\n\nArticle 31 of the VCLT.\n\n143.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Tribunal derives from Article 8 of the BIT, which provides that \"[a]ny dispute relating to an investment between of the Contracting Parties and a national or a company of the other Contracting Party\" shall be submitted to ICSID arbitration. The dispute settlement clause does not expressly elucidate at what time a national or company must have acquired their investment to have the right to bring an arbitration under the BIT.\n\n144.\n\nIt is true that Article 8(3) and Article 1(1) of the BIT provide certain temporal indications. They are however unhelpful for the purpose of the present question. Article 8(3), which will be analyzed below when dealing with Gremcitel\u2019s standing, is only applicable to locally incorporated companies under foreign control. As concerns Article 1(1), second paragraph, this provision reads as follows:\n\n\"Said assets must be or have been invested, in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party In the territory or maritime area In which the investment is effected, before or after the entry into force of the present Treaty\".168\n\nArticle 1(1), second sentence, of the BIT (Tribunal\u2019s translation).\n\n145.\n\nThis provision clarifies that an investment may have been made either before or after the entry into force of the Treaty. It does not say, however, whether the \u2019\u2019national\" or \"company\" must have acquired its investment before the treaty breach occurred for the Tribunal to have *ratione temporis* jurisdiction.169\n\nSee *also* *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale In respect of DR Energy Holdings Limited and Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad del Este, S. A.v. The Dominican Republic,* UNCITRAL, LCIA Case No. UN 7927, Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 19 September 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 82, 104-105 (interpreting a similar clause in the France-Dominican Republic BIT).\n\n146.\n\nDespite the lack of an explicit answer to this question In the Treaty, It is clear to the Tribunal that, where the claim is founded upon an alleged breach of the Treaty\u2019s substantive standards, a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to a dispute between the host state and a national or company which has acquired its protected Investment before the alleged breach occurred. In other words, the Treaty must be In force and the national or company must have already made its Investment when the alleged breach occurs, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over a breach of that Treaty's substantive standards affecting that Investment.\n\n147.\n\nThis conclusion follows from the principle of non-retroactivlty of treaties,170 which entails that the substantive protections of the BIT apply to the state conduct that occurred after these protections became applicable to the eligible Investment. Because the BIT is at the same time the Instrument that creates the substantive obligation forming the basis of the claim before the Tribunal and the Instrument that confers jurisdiction upon the Tribunal, a claimant bringing a claim based on a Treaty obligation must have owned or controlled the Investment when that obligation was allegedly breached.171\n\nSee Article 28 of the VCLT. See *also* Article 13 of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility.\n\nSee *Cementownia \"Nowa Huta\" S.A. v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 17 September 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 112-114 (\"It is undisputed that an investor seeking access to international jurisdiction pursuant to an investment treaty must prove that it was an investor at the relevant time, i.e., at the moment when the events on which its claim is based occurred\"); *Libananco Holdings Co.

The investment of AES, a company incorporated in the United States, is not protected by the terms of this Treaty. Thus, the investment could not be protected by this Treaty until both this Treaty entered into force and Claimant, as a French company, acquired the investment and it became a French investment. Accordingly, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over acts and events that took place before the Claimant acquired the investment, that is on 12 November 2004, at which time both the Treaty had entered into force and the investor had become a qualifying French national.\"); *GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft v. Ukraine,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/16, Award, 31 March 2011, \u00b6 170\u00a0(\"The Tribunal agrees with Ukraine that in order for the Tribunal to hear the Claimant\u2019s claims, the Claimant must have held an Interest In the alleged Investment before the alleged treaty violations were committed.\"). See *also recently,* confirming the same approach, *ST-AD GmbH v. Bulgaria,* Award on Jurisdiction, 18 July 2013, \u00b6 300 (\"It is an uncontested principle that a tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione temporis* to consider claims arising prlorto the date of the alleged Investment, since a BIT cannot be applied to acts committed by a State before the claimant Invested In the host country. [...] According to the well-known principle of non-retroactivlty of treaties In International law, a BIT cannot apply to the protection of an Investor before the latter Indeed became an Investor under said BIT\"). See *also* Zachary Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims* (Cambridge, 2009), \u00b6 330 (\"The act of making a qualified Investment is also controlling for the scope of the arbitral tribunal\u2019s adjudicative power In several respects. [... ] the timing of the Investor\u2019s acquisition of its Investment determines the commencement of the substantive protection afforded by the Investment treaty and hence the temporal scope for the tribunal\u2019s adjudicative power over claims based upon an Investment treaty obligation.\").\n\n148.\n\nConsequently, the BIT\u2019S substantive protection which Ms. Levy invokes started applying to her when she made an investment and not before. She must therefore prove that she had already acquired her investment at the time of the impugned conduct.\n\n149.\n\nThe determination of the critical date is thus essential for the assessment of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione temporis.172* In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the critical date is the one on which the State adopts the disputed measure, even when the measure represents the culmination of a process or sequence of events which may have started years earlier. It is not uncommon that divergences or disagreements develop over a period of time before they finally \"crystallize\" in an actual measure affecting the investor's treaty rights.\n\nThe Parties have discussed the Issue of the critical date by sometimes referring Interchangeably to \"the moment where the challenged acts occur\" and the moment \"when the dispute arises\", possibly because the latter is the moment expressly contemplated by Article 8(3) of the BIT with respect to the time at which a locally Incorporated company must be under foreign control, an Issue to which the Tribunal will revert later. As noted *infra* at paragraphs 167-168, the moment when an alleged breach of the treaty occurs is not necessarily the same as the moment In which the dispute arises.\n\n150.\n\nHere, the disagreements between the Parties find their origin in earlier events, in particular, in the Historical Commission\u2019s creation and its 2005 Report, which formed the basis for the subsequent 2007 Resolution. However, it was only when the 2007 Resolution was adopted and published that the rights of the Claimants were allegedly affected. Only at this moment were the precise boundaries of the Morro Solar\u2019s intangible area determined through a binding administrative act. Furthermore, prior to the enactment of the 2007 Resolution, there was still a possibility that the INC would decide not to adopt the Resolution. The Claimants would then have had no act to complain about. Thus, the Tribunal concludes that Ms. Levy was to have acquired her investment by the date of the 2007 Resolution, more precisely by the date of the latter's publication in the Official Journal, *i.e.,* 18 October 2007.\n\n151.\n\nHaving determined the critical date, the Tribunal will next address whether Ms. Levy owned or controlled her investment in Gremcitel before 18 October 2007, be it directly or indirectly.\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Ms. Levy acquired an indirect interest in Gremcitel in 2005 through the acquisition of shares in Hart Industries. Upon review of the documentary evidence and testimony at the Hearing, the Tribunal cannot agree with this proposition. The documents proffered by the Claimants to prove this acquisition are so full of inconsistencies that they cannot be relied upon to establish that a transfer actually took place on the alleged date.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by noting that the amendment of the Articles of Association of Hart Industries was not registered in Grenada, which affects the effectiveness under Grenadian law of the subsequent transfer of shares to Ms. Levy made pursuant to such amendment. The Respondent\u2019s expert on Grenadian law, Ms. Sheila Harris, testified that without such registration the resolution would be ineffective according to Grenadian law.173 The Claimants decided not to cross-examine Ms. Harris (despite having called her).174 The Tribunal has no reason to doubt the expertise of Ms. Harris and the veracity of her testimony.\n\n*See* Expert Opinion of Sheila Harris, 30 June 2013 **(Exh. RWS-021),** \u00b6\u00b66-10; Tr. (Harris), at 839: 6- 20.\n\nTr. (Claimants\u2019 counsel), at 842: 14-16.\n\n154.\n\nMore importantly (and even if, contrary to what the Tribunal believes, the amendment of the Articles of Association were effective), the evidence addressed at the Hearing established that the dates shown on the relevant corporate resolutions cannot be relied upon. The Claimants\u2019 expert, Ms. Joseph, who is also the notary public who certified (\"acknowledged\") the signatures appearing on the resolution, admitted that she did not see the 9 February 2005 resolution on 7 February 2005 as she had initially stated in the resolution. She also conceded not having been presented with the resolution on 9 February 2005, as she had certified in her undated, hand written \"rectification\" made on the resolution. In fact, Ms. Joseph admitted that *in 2010, i.e.,* five years after the alleged transfer of the shares and three years after the enactment of the 2007 Resolution, she backdated the notarization of the 9 February 2005 resolution upon request of Mr. Isy Levy.175 She also admitted that \"sometime after April 2012\", *i.e.,* when the ICSID proceedings had already started, she acceded to a further request by Mr. Levy that she \"correct\" her initial backdated notarization to make it consistent with the date when the document was allegedly executed.176 Thus, Ms. Joseph backdated the document a second time, this time however to a different date (9 February Instead of 7 February 2005).\n\nSee Tr. (Joseph), at 749: 17-20 (\"the Resolution was presented to me sometime In 2010. The specific date I can\u2019t remember. And it was presented by Mr. St Louis and Mr. Levy, both appearing In person before me [...]\"), at 750: 2-4 (\"Now, a specific request was made for the document to be dated as of the date it was prepared and signed, which is 2005\").\n\n*See* Tr. (Joseph), at 754: 17 to 757: 18.\n\n155.\n\nIt is clear that the Tribunal cannot attach any probative value to documents of this kind. In light of Ms. Joseph\u2019s own admissions, it is thus Impossible to ascertain when the resolutions documenting the alleged 2005 transfer were created. Pondering all the circumstances, it seems likely to the Tribunal that they were created well after 2005. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal has no hesitation in concluding that the Claimants have not discharged their burden to prove their assertion that Ms. Levy acquired Indirect control over Gremcitel in 2005.177\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal does not deem the so-called \"Levy Group\" minutes to be reliable evidence to prove the Claimants\u2019 standing. Because this entity is a private organization, its book does not require, by the Claimants\u2019 own admission, to be notarized. See Claimants\u2019 Letter to Respondent Regarding Document Production, 19 March 2013 **(Exh. R-252),** Request No. 4, p. 4.\n\n156.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 further submission that Ms. Levy became a direct shareholder in Gremcitel In 2007. For the following reasons, the Tribunal is satisfied that this second transfer effectively occurred before the critical date, *i.e.,* before 18 October 2007.\n\n157.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal notes that the transfer process of the Gremcitel shares from Hart Industries to Ms. Levy was set in motion through a number of letters sent by Gremcitel to its shareholders between 4 September to 8 September 2007, following a letter from Hart Industries to Gremcitel notifying Gremcitel of its intention to sell its shares to Ms. Levy.178 In subsequent letters, Gremcitel asked its shareholders whether they wished to exercise their right of first refusal over the shares. These letters are notarized and the Respondent has not questioned their authenticity or reliability. The Tribunal thus accepts the probative value of these letters.\n\nSee the letters addressed to the shareholders between 4-8 September 2007 **(Exh. C-114; Exh-C-115).**\n\n158.\n\nSecond, the share transfer agreement for the 40,000 Gremcitel shares was concluded between Ms. Levy and Hart Industries on 9 October 2007.179 There are no facts on record casting doubts on the validity of this agreement.\n\nSee Share Transfer Agreement for Holding XXI, 9 October 2007 **(Exh. C-1-N; Exh. R-070).**\n\n159.\n\nThird, the sale of the shares was registered on Gremcitel\u2019s shareholder\u2019s registry on 9 October 2007.180 For the exclusive purpose of its inquiry on its jurisdiction *ratione* *temporis,* the Tribunal does not attach weight to the fact that the registration occurred one day before Gremcitel was formally notified of the transfer.181 Because of the intrafamily nature of the transaction, it is reasonable to assume that Gremcitel learned of the transfer on 9 October 2007 and immediately proceeded with the registration in the shareholder\u2019s registry, whereas the formal notification occurred one day later. While this circumstance has no impact on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione temporis,* it evinces that the Claimants acted as if they were pressed by time, a matter to which the Tribunal will revert in its assessment of the abuse of process.\n\nSee Registration of Sale of 40,000 Gremcitel Shares Between Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Hart Industries, 9 October 2007 **(Exh. C-014; Exh. R-069).**\n\n*Compare* Letter from Hart Industries and Ren\u00e9e Levy to Gremcitel Regarding Transfer of Shares, 10 October 2007 **(Exh. C-116; Exh. R-303)** *with* Registration of Sale of 40,000 Gremcitel Shares Between Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Hart Industries, 9 October 2007 **(Exh. C-014; Exh. R-069).**\n\n160.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal does not consider that the allegations of fiscal irregularities connected with the 2007 transfer and the related evidence are such that they change its conclusion about the validity of the transfer. In particular, the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the report dated 5 March 2012182 and on the Sworn Statements of Corrections to Gremcitel\u2019s Annual Income Tax Return for 2007 and 2008, dated 13 March 2013,183 are, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, inconclusive, as they could be explained in various ways not calling into question the fact that Ms. Levy became a majority shareholder of Gremcitel on 9 October 2007.\n\nAudit Report by BDO Pazos, Lopez de Roma\u00f1a, Rodriguez, 5 March 2012, (part of Exh. **C-117; R-307),** at p. 1.\n\nSworn Statements of Corrections to Gremcltel\u2019s Annual Income Tax Return for 2007 and 2008, 13 March 2013, at p. 27 (part of Exh. **C-117; Exh. R-308).**\n\n161.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that, based on the evidence in the record, Ms. Levy has not established that she acquired her indirect shareholding in Gremcitel in 2005. By contrast, she has discharged her burden to prove that she acquired her direct shareholding in Gremcitel on 9 October 2007, *i.e.,* shortly before the challenged act occurred on 18 October 2007. For these reasons, and without prejudice to the Tribunal\u2019s later findings on abuse of process, the Tribunal concludes that Ms. Levy has satisfied the requirements *ratione personae* and *ratione temporis* under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.\n\n**c. Whether Gremcitel fulfills the requirements** ***ratione personae*** **and** ***temporis*** **under the ICSID Convention and the BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n162.\n\nUnder the ICSID Convention, a locally incorporated company is considered a \"national of another Contracting State\" if it is a juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to arbitration and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.184 Under Article 8(3) of the BIT, a juridical person constituted in the territory of one of the two Contracting Parties and which - in the original treaty languages *- \"antes del surgimiento de la controversia\"* or *\"avant que le diff\u00e9rend ne soit soulev\u00e9\"* is controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, shall be considered, for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, as a company of the other Contracting Party. Accordingly, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *temporis* over Gremcitel, the latter must establish (i) that it is a Peruvian company, (II) which on the critical date (III) was under foreign control, and that (iv) there is an agreement to treat it as foreign. The Tribunal will review these four elements in turn.\n\nArticle 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n163.\n\nIn respect of the first requirement, the Tribunal notes that Gremcitel is a company incorporated in the Contracting State party to the dispute, **i.e.,** Peru. In this respect, the Tribunal also notes that it held such nationality on the date of consent, **i.e.,** when the request for arbitration was filed, as the ICSID Convention requires.185\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the critical date specified In Article 25(2)(b), 2nd sentence, of the ICSID Convention (\"on that date\") relates to \"the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute\". The question as to whether this is also the critical date with respect to \"foreign control\" can be left open, as the answer is not outcome-determinative and the Parties have not specifically dealt with this question.\n\n164.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal must ascertain the critical date as set forth In the BIT. Article 8(3) of the BIT mentions *\"antes surgimiento de la controversia\"* and *\"avant que le diff\u00e9rend ne soit soulev\u00e9\".* At the Hearing, the Tribunal inquired about potential differences in the Spanish and French versions of Article 8(3) of the BIT and invited the Parties to present their views in their post-hearing briefs.186 Only the Respondent addressed this issue in its post-hearing submissions.\n\n*See* Tr. (Pres. Kaufmann-Kohler), at 1742: 10 - 1743: 13.\n\n165.\n\nBoth versions of the BIT are authentic.187 In accordance with Article 33 of the VCLT on the interpretation of multilingual treaties, the terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text.188 Furthermore, when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application of Article 31 and 32 of the VCLT does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts must be adopted, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty.189\n\nSee France-Peru BIT, Article 12 *in fine.*\n\nArticle 33(3) of the VCLT.\n\nArticle 33(4) of the VCLT.\n\n166.\n\nThe Spanish version of the BIT *(\"antes del surgimiento de la controversia\")* has only one possible meaning, which is \"before the emergence of the dispute\". By contrast, the French version of the Treaty (\"avant *que le diff\u00e9rend ne soit soulev\u00e9\")* could have two meanings, that is, either \"before the dispute is brought before an international arbitral tribunal\" or \"before the dispute is raised with the other side\". The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the only harmonious interpretation of the two authentic texts is to say that the locally incorporated company must be under foreign control \"before the dispute is raised with the other side\". Indeed, this understanding coincides with the Spanish wording and with one of the two meanings of the French formula.\n\n167.\n\nThird, it must be asked whether Gremcitel was under French control before the dispute emerged, or, differently put, whether Ms. Levy acquired control over Gremcitel before that date. The issue has largely been dealt with above when addressing the issue of Ms. Levy\u2019s own standing as claimant, when it was inquired whether she acquired her investment at the time the challenged acts occurred. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal wishes to note that, in theory, the moment when the challenged acts occurred is not necessarily the same as the one when the dispute arose - the latter being the moment which Article 8(3) of the BIT expressly contemplates. It has rightly been noted that \"\"[t]he time of the dispute is not identical with the time of the events leading to the dispute. By definition, the incriminated acts must have occurred some time before the dispute\".190 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, a breach or violation does not become a \"dispute\" until the injured party identifies the breach or violation and objects to it.191\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer with Loretta Malintoppi, August Reinisch, and Anthony Sinclair, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2d ed., 2009), p. 96.\n\nThe Tribunal finds confirmation in *Teinver SA and Others v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 December 2012, \u00b6 110. *See also* *Mobil Corporation et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010, \u00b6 203 (\"the dispute over such nationalisation measures can only be deemed to have arisen after the measures were taken\").\n\n168.\n\nIn this case, the Claimants have accepted 18 October 2007 as the date on which the dispute arose, which shows that they themselves considered that they were in dispute with the Respondent from that time on. Starting then there was \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between parties\",192 and the Claimants considered their claim to be \"positively opposed\"193 by Peru. The Tribunal will therefore regard 18 October 2007 as the date when the dispute arose for the purposes of Article 8(3) of the BIT.\n\nSee *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions,* Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2, p. 11.\n\nSee *Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination* (Georgia v. Russia), I.C.J., Judgment on Preliminary Objections, 1 April 2011, \u00b6 30 (citing to other ICJ cases).\n\n169.\n\nThe facts surrounding Ms. Levy\u2019s control over Gremcitel on the relevant date have already been discussed in the context of Ms. Levy\u2019s standing and need not be repeated here.194 The Tribunal has concluded that, while the Claimants did not prove that Gremcitel was under Ms. Levy\u2019s control In 2005, they have established that the company was under her control in 2007.\n\nSee *supra* paragraphs 151-160.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that the requirement of \"foreign control\" under both Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID and Article 8(3) of the BIT is satisfied in this case.\n\n171.\n\nThe Respondent raised the additional issue whether \"foreign control\" under Article 25(2)(b) and Article 8(3) of the BIT requires actual control. The Tribunal notes that neither Article 25(2)(b), 2nd sentence, nor Article 8(3) of the BIT specify that actual or effective control is required. The Tribunal considers that Ms. Levy acquired the majority of the shares in Gremcitel on 9 October 2007. In the present circumstances, and without excluding whether in other Instances an Inquiry as to the \"effectiveness\" of the control may be warranted, the Tribunal considers Ms. Levy\u2019s ownership of the shares sufficient to establish \"foreign control\" under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8(3) of the BIT.195\n\nSee *also* *Aguas del Tunari SA v. Republic of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 October 2005, \u00b6 264 (Interpreting a provision on \"control\" In the Netherlands-Bolivia BIT); *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, CA. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2001, \u00b6 110 (\"Article 25(2)(b) [of the ICSID Convention] does not specify the nature, direct, Indirect, ultimate or effective, of the foreign control.\").\n\n172.\n\nFourth and last, Article 25(2) (b) of the ICSID Convention requires an agreement to \"treat[][the locally Incorporated company] as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention\". It is undisputed that such agreement is found In Article 8(3) of the BIT.\n\n173.\n\nIn conclusion, Gremcitel fulfills the requirements *ratione personae* and *temporis* pursuant to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8(3) of the BIT.\n\n**D.** Second Objection: the investment is an abuse of process\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nAs a second jurisdictional objection, Peru invokes an abuse of process. Even if the Claimants\u2019 documents concerning Ms. Levy\u2019s investment were reliable, It submits that Ms. Levy was Inserted into Gremcitel\u2019s ownership structure for no purpose other than to obtain BIT protection due to her French nationality, at a time when the dispute had already arisen or was at least foreseeable. Because Ms. Levy acquired her alleged interest In Gremcitel for the sole purpose of Internationalizing an otherwise purely domestic dispute, her investment is abusive. Citing ICSID cases *Phoenix v. Czech* *Republic, Pac Rim v. El Salvador,* and *Tidewater v. Venezuela,* the Respondent posits that an abuse of process occurs where a domestic company restructures its ownership to internationalize an existing or *foreseeable* dispute.196\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6285-289.\n\n175.\n\nAs already explained, the Respondent\u2019s position is that the dispute arose no later than 2004 and likely before.197 However, it agrees that even if the dispute arose later, the Claimants restructured the corporate ownership at a time - from 2005 onwards - when the dispute was \"within the[ir] reasonable contemplation\".198 Indeed, the INC had set up the Historical Commission a few months before and the outcome of the process was expected. The Respondent finds further evidence of an abuse of process in Hart Industries\u2019 corporate resolution of 7 March 2005, which states that Isy Levy Calvo and Jacques Levy Calvo decide to transfer all political powers and rights to direct the Company to Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy de Levi *\"until all legal proceedings concerning resolutions dated February 7th 2005 and February 9th 2005 are finished'.''199* The Respondent takes the reference to \"legal proceedings\" to mean the future BIT proceedings.\n\nSee *supra* paragraphs 111-113.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 312, 314, quoting *Tidewater et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2013, \u00b6 148.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 263; R-PHB 1, \u00b6 50.\n\n176.\n\nHence, according to the Respondent, the only reason why the Claimants injected Ms. Levy into the ownership structure of Gremcitel was her French nationality. The Respondent insists that Mr. Levy was unable to provide any business rationale for the alleged 2005 transfer of Hart Industries shares to his sister. Mr. Levy\u2019s only explanation for the transfer was that it was his father\u2019s decision.200 There was no business rationale either, so says the Respondent, behind the 2007 transfer of Gremcitel shares to Ms. Levy.201 Finally, the Respondent argues that it is more than likely that Mr. Cock, one of the Claimants\u2019 consultants and witnesses, learned of the INC\u2019s impending resolution through his \"connections at the INC\" and that Gremcitel responded by introducing Ms. Levy directly into the ownership structure to benefit from the BIT protection.202\n\nR-PHB 1, \u00b6 49.\n\nR-PHB 1,\u00b6 51.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n**2. The Claimants\u2019 position**\n------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nThe Claimants deny any allegations of abuse of process. They submit that an allegation of abuse of process must meet a high standard involving proof of bad faith,203 which the Respondent does not meet. Furthermore, before the 2007 Resolution was issued, it could not be foreseen that a delimitation of the protected area of the Morro Solar would be ordered that would include Gremcitel\u2019s land.204 The Claimants point to an internal INC document dated 10 October 2007,205 which mentions that the boundaries proposed by the Historical Commission had not been adopted. They note that this internal document was Issued on 10 October 2007, but was \"presented/submitted only on 15 October 2007\" *(\"fue emitido el 10 de Octubre de 2007, pero presentado reci\u00e9n el 15 de Octubre\").* Thus, they note that \"only the civil servant who drafted this memo could foresee the promulgation of RD 1342\".206\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6 77.\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 78.\n\nInforme No. 249-2007-DPHCR-DREPH/INC, 10 October 2007 **(Exh. C-142).**\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6 80 (Tribunal\u2019s translation).\n\n178.\n\nFor the Claimants, the Respondent has not established that the Claimants had foreseen the event which gave rise to the dispute, *i.e.,* the Issuance of the 2007 Resolution. Hence, it has not shown that the Claimants manipulated Gremcitel\u2019s nationality to gain access to ICSID.207 In this respect, the Claimants point to the tribunal\u2019s statement In *Pac Rim* that \"the dividing line occurs when the relevant party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a specific future dispute as a very high probability and not merely as a possible controversy\", which in their view is not the case here.208\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6 82.\n\n*Ibid,* (citing to *Pac Rim Cayman LLC* v. *Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012, \u00b6 2.99).\n\n179.\n\nRather, the 2007 transfer of the shares was set In motion already on 4 September 2007 with the notification of the Intended transfer to the other shareholders.209 it was due to good faith family reasons at a time where the occurrence of the critical fact negatively affecting the investment was unforeseeable.210 Therefore, In the Claimants\u2019 submission, the Respondent has failed to establish that an abuse of process has occurred.\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6 80.\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6 83.\n\n**3. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n180.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Parties have not expressly discussed the characterization of this objection. is it a matter of jurisdiction, admissibility, or something else? The Respondent has grouped all of its objections, including this one, under one single heading being either \"Jurisdictional Objections\"211 or \"Jurisdiction/Abuse of Process\"212. The Claimants, in turn, have discussed abuse of process, in at least one of their memorials, under a heading entitled \"Admissibility\".213 As noted, neither Party has engaged in a detailed discussion of the nature of the abuse of process objection. Both have rather focused on the legal test required to find an abuse, and above all, on the facts of the dispute.\n\nR-Rejoinder, Section III.\n\nR-PHB 1, Section IV; R-PHB 2, Section III.\n\nC-PHB 1, Section IV (\"Sobre la admisibilidad\").\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the characterization of the abuse of process objection as a jurisdictional or as an admissibility issue can be left open in the present case. Under the circumstances of this dispute, such differentiation is, to use the words of the *Pac Rim* tribunal, \"a distinction without a difference\",214 in the sense that it would have no impact on the outcome of the case.\n\n*See* *Pac Rim Cayman LLC* v. *Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012, \u00b6 2.10. (\"the Tribunal has noted that the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection based on Abuse of Process by the Claimant does not, in legal theory, operate as a bar to the existence of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction; but, rather, as a bar to the exercise of that jurisdiction, necessarily assuming jurisdiction to exist. For present purposes, the Tribunal considers this to be a distinction without a difference\").\n\n182.\n\nAs a further threshold matter, the Tribunal considers that an abuse of process objection must be distinguished from a ***ratione temporis*** objection.215 If a claimant acquires an investment after the date on which the challenged act occurred, the tribunal will normally lack jurisdiction ***ratione temporis*** and there will be no room for an abuse of process. Here, the Tribunal has established that Ms. Levy acquired her investment prior to the challenged measure, even if it was just slightly before. In such a situation, a tribunal has jurisdiction ***ratione temporis*** but may be precluded from exercising its jurisdiction if the acquisition is abusive.\n\n*See* *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012, \u00b6\u00b6 2,101, 2,107 (distinguishing between *a ratione temporis* objection and an abuse of process objection). See *also recently,* confirming this approach, *Lao Holdings NV. v. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 February 2014, \u00b6 76 (\"if a company changes its nationality in order to gain ICSID jurisdiction at a moment when things have started to deteriorate so that a dispute is highly probable, it can be considered an abuse of process, but for an objection based on *ratione temporis* to be upheld, the dispute has to have actually arisen before the critical date to conform to the general principle of nonretroactivity in the interpretation and application of international treaties\", bold omitted).\n\n183.\n\nIn the context of investor-state arbitration, arbitral tribunals have indeed applied the doctrine of abuse of process (or abuse of rights) in cases involving disputed corporate restructurings. In particular, in *Phoenix Action v. The Czech Republic,* the ICSID tribunal put emphasis on the objectives of investment protection:\n\n\"[...] the Claimant's Initiation and pursuit of this arbitration is an abuse of the system of international ICSID investment arbitration. If it were accepted that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide Phoenix\u2019s claim, then any pre-existing national dispute could be brought to an ICSID tribunal by a transfer of the national economic interests to a foreign company in an attempt to seek protections under a BIT. Such transfer from the domestic arena to the International scene would *ipso facto* constitute a \"protected Investment\" -and the jurisdiction of BIT and ICSID tribunals would be virtually unlimited. It is the duty of the Tribunal not to protect such an abusive manipulation of the system of International Investment protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs. It is Indeed the Tribunal\u2019s view that to accept jurisdiction In this case would go against the basic objectives underlying the ICSID Convention as well as those of bilateral Investment treaties. The Tribunal has to ensure that the ICSID mechanism does not protect Investments that It was not designed for to protect, because they are In essence domestic Investments disguised as International Investments for the sole purpose of access to this mechanism.\"216\n\n*Phoenix Action Ltd.* v. *The Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, \u00b6 144.\n\n184.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is now well-established, and rightly so, that an organization or reorganization of a corporate structure designed to obtain Investment treaty benefits is not illegitimate *perse,* Including where this is done with a view to shielding the Investment from possible future disputes with the host state. Or, in the words of the *Tidewater* tribunal,\n\n\"It is a perfectly legitimate goal, and no abuse of an Investment protection treaty regime, for an Investor to seek to protect Itself from the general risk of future disputes with a host state In this way\".217\n\n*Tidewater et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB/10/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2013, \u00b6 184. See *also* *Aguas del Tunari SA v. Republic of Bolivia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 October 2005, \u00b6 330 (\"[...] It is not uncommon In practice and - absent a particular limitation - not Illegal to locate one\u2019s operation In a jurisdiction perceived to provide a beneficial regulatory and legal environment In terms, for example, of taxation or the substantive law of the jurisdiction, Including the availability of a BIT.\"); *Mobil Corporation et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010, \u00b6 204 (\"As stated by the Claimants, the aim of the restructuring of their Investments In Venezuela through a Dutch holding was to protect those Investments against breaches of their rights by the Venezuelan authorities by gaining access to ICSID arbitration through the BIT. The tribunal considers that this was a perfectly legitimate goal as far as It concerned future disputes\"); *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012, \u00b6 2.47 (\"The Tribunal does not dispute [...] that If a corporate restructuring affecting a claimant\u2019s nationality was made In good faith before the occurrence of any event or measure giving rise to a later dispute, that restructuring should not be considered as an abuse of process.\").\n\n185.\n\nHowever, a restructuring carried out with the Intention to invoke the treaty\u2019s protections at a time when the dispute is foreseeable may constitute an abuse of process depending on the circumstances.218 In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the test suggested In *Pac Rim* whereby \"a specific future dispute\" must be \"foreseeable] [...] as a very high probability and not merely as a possible controversy\".219 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this test strikes a fair balance between the need to safeguard an investor\u2019s right to invoke a BIT\u2019S protection In the context of a legitimate corporate restructuring and the need to deny protection to abusive conduct.\n\nAs clarified **supra** at paragraph 182, If a claimant acquires an Investment after the date on which the challenged act occurred (or, *a fortiori,* when the dispute arose, see **supra** paragraph 167), the tribunal will normally lack jurisdiction *ratione temporis* and there will be no room for an abuse of process.\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012, \u00b6 2.99. The Tribunal notes that the tribunals In *Tidewater* and *Lao Holdings* have articulated analogous tests. See *Tidewater et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB/10/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2013, \u00b6 194, 197 (where the tribunal asked whether there was \"a *reasonable prospect,* either [In December 2008, when the claimants commenced their restructuring] or In March 2008 when the restructuring was consummated, that such a nationalization was *imminent\",* and found that \"the acts of expropriation that give rise to the present dispute were not *reasonably foreseeable* by the Claimants either In December 2008 when they began restructuring, or In March 2009 when the restructuring took effect\", emphasis added); *Lao Holdings NV. v. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 February 2014, \u00b6 76 (where the tribunal articulated the standard for abuse of process by referring to \"a moment when things have started to deteriorate so that *a dispute is highly probable\",* bold omitted, emphasis added).\n\n186.\n\nAs for any abuse of right, the threshold for a finding of abuse of process is high, as a court or tribunal will obviously not presume an abuse,220 and will affirm the evidence of an abuse only \"in very exceptional circumstances\".221 Furthermore, as the Tribunal In *Mobil v. Venezuela* stated, \"[u]nder general international law as well as under ICSID case law, abuse of right is to be determined in each case, *taking into account all the circumstances of the case\".222*\n\nSee *Case Concerning Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia* (Germany v. Poland), 1926 P.C.I.J. (Ser. A) No. 7 (25 May), at 30 (noting that \"misuse [of right] cannot be presumed\"); Case of the Free Zones of Upper Savoy and the *District of Gex,* 1932 P.C.I.J. (Ser. A/B) No. 46 (7 June), at 167 (noting that \"an abuse cannot be presumed by the Court\").\n\n*Chevron Corporation (USA) and Texaco Petroleum Company (USA) v. The Republic of Ecuador,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 34877, Interim Award, 1 December 2008, \u00b6 143.\n\n*Mobil Corporation et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010, \u00b6 177 (emphasis added).\n\n187.\n\nHaving thus set out the principles which will guide its decision, the Tribunal starts by assessing whether the present dispute was foreseeable as a very high probability, and not as a mere possibility, at the time when Ms. Levy acquired Gremcitel. It is clear that the closer the acquisition of the investment is to the act giving rise to the dispute, the higher the degree of foreseeability will normally be.\n\n188.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal has found that the events giving rise to the dispute occurred on 18 October 2007.223 The acts that set in motion Ms. Levy's Investment In Gremcitel occurred just about over a month before, when the letters notifying the other shareholders of their right of first refusal were sent. The actual transfer of the shares occurred on 9 October 2007, only one day before the 2007 Resolution was issued and 9 days before it was published. A review of the record shows that such striking proximity of events is not a coincidence.\n\nSee *supra* paragraph 150.\n\n189.\n\nTo the contrary, if one reviews the unfolding of events which led to the 2007 Resolution, it is clear that the Claimants could foresee that the 2007 Resolution was forthcoming. In 2005, the Historical Commission issued the report, on which the delimitation implemented through the 2007 Resolution was largely based. Although the 2005 Report was never officially communicated to the Claimants, and the Claimants assert that they only became aware of it when the 2007 Resolution was issued, *i.e.,* two and a half years later,224 Mr. Isy Levy admitted at the Hearing that he knew that the Historical Commission had been created \"at the end of 2004\".225 More importantly, Mr. Guillermo Cock, one of the Claimants\u2019 witnesses, confirmed at the Hearing that he had seen the Historical Commission\u2019s Report shortly after it was issued.226 It should be recalled here that Mr. Cock had been managing the administrative procedures with the INC on behalf of Gremco and Gremcitel throughout the years. He had, for example, appeared before the Ad Hoc Commission in 2004 to present arguments on behalf of Gremco and before the Peruvian Congress in 2008 on behalf of Gremcitel.227 Although Mr. Cock testified that he did not recall discussing the document with Mr. Levy himself,228 in response to the Tribunal\u2019s question of whether he had discussed the Report \"with someone else within Gremcitel in 2005\", he answered: \"I don\u2019t recall. *It is likely, it is probable,* but I don\u2019t recall\".229 To the Tribunal, it is clear that Gremcitel and Mr. Levy learned about the 2005 Report and its content around the time of its issuance in 2005.\n\nC-PHB 2, \u00b6 36. Seea/soTr. (Mr. Levy), at 274:15 to 278:12.\n\nTr. (Mr. Levy), at 273:16-21.\n\nTr. (Cock), at 419:6-19.\n\nTr. (Cock), at 358:11-19\n\nTr. (Cock), at 419:20-421:6.\n\nTr. (Cock), at 430:11-15 (emphasis added).\n\n190.\n\nIt is equally clear that foreseeability increased as time passed. The Tribunal is satisfied that, due to his connections at the INC,230 sometime In 2007 Mr. Cock learned that the INC was about to formalize the land delimitation and, in the ordinary course of events, must have Informed the Levys accordingly. The transfer of the shares was then set in motion In a great hurry, as is evidenced by the fact that Gremcitel registered the transfer before it had been formally notified of it.231 The fact that the transfer was perfected only one day before the INC enacted the decision leaves no doubt about the correlation between the change in Gremcitel\u2019s ownership and the 2007 Resolution of which the Claimants would then complain.\n\nSee, *e.g.,* Tr. (Cock), at 418:10-14;430:16-19.\n\n*Compare* Letter from Hart Industries and Ren\u00e9e Levy to Gremcitel Regarding Transfer of Shares, 10 October 2007 **(Exh. C-116; Exh. R-303)** *with* Registration of Sale of 40,000 Gremcitel Shares Between Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Hart Industries, 9 October 2007 **(Exh. C-014; Exh. R-069).**\n\n191.\n\nIn the T ribunal\u2019s view, the only reason for the sudden transfer of the majority of the shares in Gremcitel to Ms. Levy was her nationality. The Claimants were unable to furnish any reasonable explanation why Ms. Levy became a shareholder and why that happened by then. At the Hearing, Mr. Levy explained that this had been a family decision232 and that the transfer was motivated by the intention to Internationalize the project.233 The Tribunal does not see how transferring shares to a family member with a foreign nationality would internationalize *the project.* What was sought to be internationalized was the soon-to-be-crystalllzed *domestic dispute,* in other words, the only purpose of the transfer was to obtain access to ICSID/BIT arbitration, which was otherwise precluded. To substantiate their argument that the dispute was not foreseeable, the Claimants also rely on the internal INC memorandum of 10 October 2007,234 which is referenced in the preamble of the 2007 Resolution. According to the Claimants, the internal memorandum is dated 10 October 2007, but was submitted only on 15 October 2007. The Claimants\u2019 argument on the second date is not entirely clear. In any event, the Tribunal notes that the 2007 Resolution is dated 10 October 2007, thus rendering the 15 October 2007 date in the memorandum Irrelevant. Beyond that, the record contains no indication that contradicts the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion. The Claimants also note that \"only the civil servant who drafted this memorandum could foresee the promulgation of RD 1342\".235 Whatever the civil servant who drafted that memorandum did or did not know about the 2007 Resolution, the Tribunal is convinced that *the Levys* could foresee the 2007 Resolution as a very high probability when Ms. Levy was inserted Into Gremcltel\u2019s ownership, which is what matters for the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry as to the foreseeability of the dispute.\n\nSee Tr. (Mr. Levy), at 299:11-15 (with regard to the alleged 2005 transfer, referring to his father\u2019s will), and 302:10-11 (with regard to the 2007 transfer, stating that \"this was a familial decision\").\n\nTr. (Mr. Levy), at 302:3-11.\n\nInforme No. 249-2007-DPHCR-DREPH/INC, 10 October 2007 **(Exh. C-142).**\n\nC-PHB 1, \u00b6 80 (Tribunal\u2019s translation).\n\n192.\n\nThe fact that the only motivation to add Ms. Levy into the Gremcitel ownership structure was her French nationality is confirmed by the language contained in the corporate resolution of Hart Industries dated 7 March 2005. While the Tribunal has clarified that it cannot attach any probative value to the corporate resolutions allegedly showing a 2005 transfer, it notes that the resolution of 7 March 2005 provides that the transfer of the powers and rights to Ms. Levy would last \"until all legal proceedings concerning resolutions dated February 7th 2005 and February 9th 2005 are finished\".236 Because there were no legal proceedings in Grenada concerning these resolutions at the timewhen these documents were allegedly created,237 the Tribunal is convinced that the reference to \"legal proceedings\" refers to these ICSID proceedings.\n\nCorporate Resolution of Hart Industries Ltd, 7 March 2005 **(Exh. C-108; Exh. R-292).**\n\n*See* Expert Opinion of Sheila Harris, 30 June 2013 **(Exh. RWS-021),** \u00b6\u00b617-18; Results of Search of Grenada Supreme Court Registry, 28 June 2013 **(Exh. R-291).**\n\n193.\n\nIn addition to these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that a global evaluation of the facts of this case patently confirms that the Claimants\u2019 restructuring constitutes an abuse. The Tribunal wishes in particular to revert to the 2005 transfer, which it has already extensively addressed in the context of the *ratione temporis* objection.238\n\nSee *supra* paragraphs 152-155.\n\n194.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it extremely serious that the Claimants have attempted to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction by way of documents which have turned out to be untrustworthy, if not utterly misleading. The Tribunal recalls that the Claimants asked notary Joseph, who accepted, to backdate corporate resolutions by 5 years. This fact was conclusively established at the Hearing, as it was plainly admitted by notary Joseph herself.239 Mr. Levy then returned to see Ms. Joseph sometime after April 2012, when this arbitration was already underway, requesting the \"rectification\" of the backdated notarization to ensure that the date of the alleged 2005 transfer was well documented. Thus, Mr. Levy attempted to correct false information with further false information, on which the Claimants then relied to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Furthermore, the Tribunal has noted that the Claimants\u2019 own position in respect of the corporate resolutions is that a notarization was not required for a share transfer to be valid under Grenadian law.240 If this is so, It is obvious that the only reason the Claimants sought to backdate the documents was to manufacture the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. A global evaluation of the facts relating to the Claimants\u2019 attempts to establish jurisdiction thus evinces a pattern of manipulative conduct that casts a bad light on their actions.241\n\nMs. Joseph also admitted that she would not have backdated the documents had she known that the documents would be used in an international proceeding. See Tr. (Joseph), at 758:3-11\n\nSee C-PHB 2, \u00b6 55.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that In the case of *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy de Levi v. Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/17), the Tribunal denied an abuse of process objection. See Award, 26 February 2014, \u00b6\u00b6153-154. The award was handed down just two days before the second and final round of the Parties\u2019 post-hearing submissions, and It was referred to by the Claimants In a footnote of their last brief. See C-PHB 2, \u00b6 4, fn. 1. The Tribunal notes that the factual circumstances of that case (as the Tribunal can appreciate them from reading the Award, as the Parties have not elaborated upon them) are distinct from those of the present proceedings. The reference to that case is thus unhelpful for the present purposes.\n\n195.\n\nIn light of the foregoing facts, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the corporate restructuring by which Ms. Levy became the main shareholder of Gremcitel on 9 October 2007 constitutes an abuse of process. Therefore, the Tribunal is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute.\n\n**E.** Third objection: the Claimants have no investment\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nThe Respondent presented a third objection, according to which the Claimants do not possess a protected Investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT because (i) they have not acquired the \"right to develop\" the Costazul Project and (\u00a1I) they have not made a contribution, nor assumed a risk.\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the Claimants\u2019 abuse of process precludes the Tribunal from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute. Considerations of judicial economy suggest that the Tribunal may dispense with dealing with arguments which have no impact on the award.242 In this case, given the Tribunal\u2019s holding on abuse of process, the outcome of the case would not be affected by the Respondent\u2019s third objection, whatever the answer to such objection might be. Under these circumstances, It is thus unnecessary to address the Respondent\u2019s third objection.\n\nSee *M.C.I. Power Group, L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Decision on the Application for Annulment, 19 October 2009, \u00b6 67 (\"The obligation In Article 48(3) of the Washington Convention to deal with every question applies to every argument which is relevant and In particular to *arguments which might affect the outcome of the case.* On the other hand, It would be unreasonable to require a tribunal to answer each and every argument which was made In connection with the Issues that the tribunal has to decide [...]. [T]he tribunal must address all the parties\u2019 \"questions\" [... ] *but is not required to comment on all arguments when they are of no relevance to the award\",* emphasis added).\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n198.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 total costs incurred In connection with these proceedings amount to USD 2,146,858.72, comprising legal fees and expenses of USD 1,571,858.72 and payments to ICSID of USD 575,000. The Respondent's costs In connection with this arbitration were USD 5,874,978.96, comprising legal fees and expenses of USD 5,299,978.96 and payments to ICSID of 575,000.\n\n199.\n\nEach Party has requested that its costs be borne by the other Party. Under Article 61 (2) of the ICSID Convention, \"the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses Incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.\" This provision establishes the Tribunal\u2019s discretion in allocating ICSID arbitration costs and the Parties' costs, Including legal fees.\n\n200.\n\nTwo approaches may be discerned in ICSID costs awards. Some tribunals apportion ICSID costs in equal shares and rule that each party should bear its own costs. Others apply the principle pursuant to which \"costs follow the event\", with the result that the party that does not prevail bears all or part of the costs of the proceedings, including those of the other party.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that a finding of abuse of process justifies an award of costs against the unsuccessful party. Thus, the Claimants shall pay for the entirety of the costs of the proceedings, *i.e.,* for the costs of the Arbitral Tribunal and for the costs of the proceeding. The Claimants shall thus reimburse the advances that the Respondent has made to ICSID. In this latter respect, it is noted that the ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a statement of the case account in due course.\n\n202.\n\nWith regard to the legal fees and expenses borne by the Parties in connection with the arbitration, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants sought to minimize the costs of the proceedings, which is not the case of their opponent, as the disparity of the costs figures shows, in these circumstances, the Tribunal finds it fair that the Claimants pay to the Respondent the amount of USD 1,571,858.72, *i.e.,* the sum which they themselves considered necessary to present their case, as a contribution to the Respondent\u2019s fees and expenses.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n203.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:\n\na. The Tribunal is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute;\n\nb. The Claimants shall reimburse to the Respondent the amounts which the Respondent has deposited with ICSID for the costs of the arbitration;\n\nc. The Claimants shall pay USD 1,571,858.72 to the Respondent, as a contribution to the legal fees and other expenses which the Respondent incurred in connection with the arbitration;\n\nd. All other requests for relief are dismissed."}]}
