The Parties\n--------------\n\n1.\n\nClaimant :\n\nGEA Group Aktiengesellschaft  \nDorstener Strasse 484   \n44809 Bochum   \nGermany\n\nhereinafter referred to as **\"GEA\"** or the **\"Claimant.\"**\n\n2.\n\nGEA is a company incorporated under the laws of Germany, and is represented in this arbitration by Mr Barton Legum, Ms Brenda Horrigan, Ms Anne-Sophie Duf\u00eatre, Mr Gauthier Vannieuwenhuyse, and Mr George Bum, of the law firm Salans.\n\n3.\n\nRespondent :\n\nUkraine  \nc/o Ministry of Justice of Ukraine   \n13, Horodetskogo Street   \nKyiv 01001   \nUkraine\n\nhereinafter referred to as **\"Ukraine\"** or the **\"Respondent.\"**\n\n4.\n\nUkraine is represented in this arbitration by Mr Sebastian Seelmann-Eggebert, Mr Charles Claypoole, Mr Jan Erik Spangenberg, Mr Robert Volterra (until 28 February 2011), Mr Hussein Haeri and Ms Michelle Bradfield, of the law firm Latham & Watkins; and Mr Serhii Sviriba and Mr Dmytro Marchukov of the law firm Magisters.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the **\"Parties.\"**\n\nII. Procedure\n-------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 24 October 2008, GEA filed a Request for Arbitration (the **\"Request\"** or **\"RfA\")** against Ukraine with the Acting Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\").** The Request was filed pursuant to Article 13(2) of the Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and Ukraine on the Promotion and Mutual Protection of Investments, dated 15 February 1993 (the **\"BIT\")** and pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated 14 October 1966 (the **\"ICSID Convention\").**\n\n7.\n\nAccording to the Request, the dispute arose from the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment in Ukraine in the form of capital loans to a former state-owned entity, or *kombinat,* known as OJSC Oriana **(\"Oriana\").** The Claimant alleges that Ukraine violated its rights under the BIT in connection with that investment.\n\n8.\n\nOn 21 November 2008, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter of 11 December 2008, the Claimant invoked Article 11(2) of the BIT. That Article provides that the appointment mechanism for members of arbitral tribunals applicable in State-to-State disputes, set forth in Article 10(3) -10(5) of the BIT, shall be applied by analogy to investor-State disputes. Article 10(3) provides that each Party \"shall appoint one member [of the tribunal] and these two members shall agree on a national of a third state to serve as the tribunal\u2019s chairman, who shall then be appointed [by the Parties].\"\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of 5 January 2009, the Claimant informed the Centre that it was appointing Mr Toby Landau, QC, a national of the United Kingdom, as arbitrator in this case. On 21 January 2009, the Centre sought Mr Landau\u2019s acceptance of his appointment after clarifying its understanding of the Parties\u2019 agreement on the method of constituting the Tribunal. On 17 February 2009, the Respondent advised ICSID that it was appointing Professor Brigitte Stem, a national of France, as arbitrator. On 19 March 2009, the Parties notified ICSID that they had agreed to appoint Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, a national of The Netherlands, as President of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nOn 20 March 2009, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Parties that the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted, and the proceedings to have commenced, on that day. Further, the Tribunal and the Parties were informed that Ms Aissatou Diop would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nOn 12 May 2009, the Tribunal held its first session at the World Bank\u2019s offices in Paris. A procedural calendar was established for the conduct of the remainder of the proceedings. The Parties were unable to agree whether, in the event of the Respondent\u2019s raising preliminary objections, the proceedings should be bifurcated. The Respondent sought bifurcation in those circumstances. The Tribunal set two timetables, one to apply in the event that preliminary objections were raised, and the other to apply in the event that no such objections were raised. In the case of the former timetable, the Tribunal indicated that it would make the decision whether to bifurcate when such preliminary objections were received.\n\n13.\n\nOn 1 July 2009, the Claimant filed its Memorial, along with exhibits, legal authorities and the witness statements of Dr Manfred D\u00f4ss, Dr Detlef B. Kr\u00fcger, Dr Harald Rieger and Dr Klaus-Peter Kissler.\n\n14.\n\nOn 12 October 2009, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had reached an agreement on the timetable to be followed in the remainder of the proceedings, and that the Parties had agreed that if the Respondent were to raise preliminary objections, such objections would be joined to the merits of the case. The content of the letter was confirmed on the same date by the Claimant.\n\n15.\n\nOn 15 October 2009, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Tribunal accepted the Parties\u2019 revised timetable.\n\n16.\n\nOn 11 January 2010, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial, along with exhibits and legal authorities.\n\n17.\n\nThereafter, the Parties made their respective requests for production of documents, and filed objections and replies thereto. On 19 February 2010, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 containing its rulings on each Party\u2019s document production requests.\n\n18.\n\nOn 22 February 2010, the Respondent sent to the ICSID Secretariat copies of supplementary materials relating to certain of the exhibits to the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial.\n\n19.\n\nOn 23 February 2010, the Claimant sought from the Tribunal clarification of Procedural Order No. 1. The Claimant queried the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on certain of the Respondent\u2019s document requests. In its objections to those requests, the Claimant had stated that it would produce the requested documents if the Respondent produced corresponding documents. The Claimant asked whether the Tribunal\u2019s granting of the Respondent\u2019s requests should be read as requiring the Respondent to produce the corresponding documents referred to by the Claimant.\n\n20.\n\nOn 24 February 2010, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal stating its understanding that Procedural Order No. 1 was not ambiguous, and that the Tribunal\u2019s granting of certain of the Respondent\u2019s requests did not require production of \"corresponding documents\" referred to by the Claimant.\n\n21.\n\nAlso on 24 February 2010, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, confirming that in granting certain of the Respondent\u2019s document requests, the Tribunal did not intend to grant the Claimant\u2019s requests for \"corresponding documents.\"\n\n22.\n\nThe same day, the Claimant sent to the ICSID Secretariat supplementary materials relating to certain of the exhibits to the Claimant\u2019s Memorial.\n\n23.\n\nOn 15 April 2010, the Claimant filed its Reply, along with exhibits.\n\n24.\n\nOn 15 June 2010, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder, along with legal authorities and exhibits, as well as the witness statement of Mr Oleksiy Golubov.\n\n25.\n\nOn 22 June 2010, the Parties provided notification of the witnesses to be examined at the hearing.\n\n26.\n\nAlso on 22 June 2010, a pre-hearing telephone conference was held to discuss certain final procedural and logistical issues in advance of the hearing.\n\n27.\n\nThe hearing was held from 5 to 9 July 2010 at the World Bank\u2019s offices in Paris.\n\n28.\n\nOn 29 October 2010, the Parties exchanged their respective Submissions on Costs.\n\n29.\n\nOn 15 November 2010, the Respondent provided its Comments on the Claimant\u2019s Submission on Costs.\n\n30.\n\nOn 25 November 2010, the Claimant provided its response to the Respondent\u2019s Comments on the Claimant\u2019s Submission on Costs.\n\n31.\n\n*References.* In this Award, the Tribunal adopts the following method of citation:\n\n**\u2022 \"Request\"** or **\"RfA\"** refer to GEA\u2019s 24 October 2008 Request for Arbitration;\n\n**\u2022 \"Memorial\"** refers to GEA\u2019s 1 July 2009 Memorial;\n\n**\u2022 \"Counter-Memorial\"** refers to Ukraine\u2019s 11 January 2010 Counter-Memorial;\n\n**\u2022 \"Reply\"** refers to GEA\u2019s 15 April 2010 Reply;\n\n**\u2022 \"Rejoinder\"** refers to Ukraine\u2019s 15 June 2010 Rejoinder;\n\n**\u2022 \"Tr\"** refers to the Transcript made of the 5 - 9 July 2010 hearing (e.g.: \"Tr. 1/p. 1\" means Day 1 at page 1);\n\nIII. **Factual Background**\n---------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe factual background to this dispute is divided into five parts, which the Tribunal will set out in the following order: (i) the companies involved; (ii) the initial business with Oriana; (iii) the later agreements made with Oriana; (iv) the ICC arbitration against Oriana; and (v) the attempts to collect on the ICC award against Oriana.\n\n33.\n\n(i) *The Companies Involved.* GEA was founded in 1881 as Metallgesellschaft AG **(\"Metallgesellschaft\").** In 2000, it changed its name to \"MG Technologies AG\"1 and in 2005 it adopted its present name, GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft **(\"GEA\").2**\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the name of \"MG Technologies AG\" is officially all in lower case letters. However, for ease of reading, the Tribunal has decided to capitalise this name in this Award, as well as all other companies whose names are officially expressed in lower case letters.\n\nC-0036.\n\n34.\n\nOn 2 November 1995, Kl\u00f4ckner & Co Aktiengesellschaft **(\"Old Kl\u00f4ckner\")** spun off its chemical business to Kl\u00f4ckner Chemiehandel GmbH **(\"KCH\").3**\n\nC-0038; C-0155; R-0003; R-0004.\n\n35.\n\nOn 17 November 1995, a company called Kl\u00f4ckner & Co Handel - another member of the Kl\u00f4ckner Group - was transformed from a GmbH to an Aktiengesellschaft, or AG.4\n\nC-0152.\n\n36.\n\nOn 24 November 1995, Old Kl\u00f4ckner was merged into another company and thereby ceased to exist as a separate entity.5 Old Kl\u00f4ckner was deleted from the commercial register in Germany as of that date.6\n\nR-0003.\n\nR-0003.\n\n37.\n\nOn 6 December 1995, Kl\u00f4ckner & Co Handel Aktiengesellschaft changed its name to Kl\u00f4ckner & Co Aktiengesellschaft **(\"New Kl\u00f4ckner\").7**\n\nC-0152.\n\n38.\n\nBy agreement dated 5 December 1997, GEA\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, \"MG Trade Services,\" acquired all the shares of KCH from SF Beteiligungs-GmbH. SF Beteiligungs-GmbH was, in turn, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New Kl\u00f4ckner.8\n\nC-0152; C-0153.\n\n39.\n\nOn 15 August 2000, \"MG Trade Services AG\" changed its name to \"Solvadis AG.\"9 KCH, in turn, was renamed \"Solvadis International GmbH\" **(\"Solvadis International\")** on 27 October 2000.10 On 22 October 2003, Solvadis International merged into \"Solvadis Chemag AG\" and thereby ceased to exist as a separate legal entity.11\n\nR-0002.\n\nC-0038; R-0004.\n\nC-0035 R-0004.\n\n40.\n\nBy agreement dated 28 June 2004, Solvadis Chemag AG (formerly KCH) assigned all of its rights deriving from its business with Oriana (more on Oriana below) as well as all rights in the underlying transactions to MG Technologies AG which, as mentioned in \u00b6 33 above, became GEA in 2005.12\n\nC-0002.\n\n41.\n\nAt around the same time, the merged entity, Solvadis Chemag AG, was sold to Chemdis Limited.13\n\nC-0042; R-0025.\n\n42.\n\nBy way of summary, for the period 1995 - 1997, the corporate structures described above were as follows:\n\n43.\n\nFor the period 2000 \u2013 2004, this diagram evolved as follows:\n\n44.\n\n(ii) *The Initial Business with Oriana.* On 13 December 1995, New Kl\u00f4ckner and the Ukrainian *kombinat* Oriana entered into an agreement under which New Kl\u00f4ckner would provide Oriana each year with 200,000 tons of naphtha fuel for conversion (the **\"Conversion Contract\").14**\n\nC-0006.\n\n45.\n\nOver the course of 1996 - 1998, Oriana and KCH, as a subsidiary of New Kl\u00f4ckner, entered into 147 (out of a total of 154) amendments to the Conversion Contract.15\n\nC-0156.\n\n46.\n\nIn December 1997, an individual responsible for periodically inspecting work at the Oriana plant, Dr Vsevolod Chperoun, was shot in the kneecap.16\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 49; Rejoinder, \u00b6 53.\n\n47.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in the months following the shooting, discrepancies were discovered between the quantity of raw materials shipped to Oriana and the quantity of finished products. An audit report in July 1998 identified that more than 125,000 metric tons of finished products were missing (the **\"Products\").17**\n\nR-0041.\n\n48.\n\nIn the meantime, Oriana contracted with a German company, Linde AG, to build a polyethylene plant for approximately DM 250,000,000. The purchase price was largely financed by Bayerische Vereinsbank AG **(\"BV\"),** a German bank.\n\n49.\n\nDuring July and August 1998, correspondence was exchanged, and discussions took place, between representatives of KCH/Kl\u00f4ckner, Oriana and the Ukrainian and German Governments concerning, among other things, the alleged misappropriation.18\n\n*See, e.g.,* C-0011; C-0012; C-0013; C-0065; C-0078.\n\n50.\n\nAt around the same time, bankruptcy proceedings were initiated against Oriana by a Canadian-owned company, Shelton.19 From October 1998 to July 1999, Shelton assumed management of Oriana.20\n\nC-0077.\n\nR-0019; C-0096.\n\n51.\n\n(iii) *The Later Agreements with Oriana.* Ultimately, on 7 August 1998, Oriana and KCH signed a settlement agreement, pursuant to which Oriana acknowledged, among other things, that it was indebted to KCH for the difference in value between the products that should have been delivered under the Conversion Contract, and the products actually delivered, or currently available to be delivered (the **\"Settlement Agreement\").** The Settlement Agreement provided that KCH and Oriana would agree the value of the shortfall and that any disputes arising out of the Settlement Agreement would be referred to arbitration under the ICC Rules in Vienna, Austria.21\n\nC-0015.\n\n52.\n\nOn 29 September 1998, Oriana and KCH negotiated and signed an agreement pursuant to which Oriana agreed to pay \"at least USD 27.6 million\" to KCH (the **\"Repayment Agreement\").22** The Repayment Agreement provided that the final amount to be paid by Oriana to KCH would be assessed by 30 September 1998. Of the approximately USD 27.6 million referred to as the minimum amount to be paid, USD 21 million related to \"Undelivered Products.\"23 The amounts owing were in principle to be paid as finished products, rather than cash, although payments in cash were \"not excluded.\"24\n\nC-0018.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n53.\n\nLike the Settlement Agreement, the Repayment Agreement provided for dispute resolution by ICC arbitration in Vienna.25\n\n*Id.*\n\n54.\n\nThe Repayment Agreement was signed by Drs Kr\u00fcger and Sch\u00f4ber for KCH, and by Messrs Sljuzar, Gabel and Haber for Oriana. The authority of Messrs Sljuzar, Gabel and Haber to enter into the Repayment Agreement on behalf of Oriana is disputed by the Respondent, and whether the Repayment Agreement was validly executed by those persons is a matter of dispute between the Parties (discussed in \u00b6\u00b6 58 - 61 below).26\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 79 - 84. In this Section, Respondent also disputes the validity of the execution of the Settlement Agreement, for the same reasons.\n\n55.\n\nThe Repayment Agreement provided for four pledge agreements over Oriana\u2019s assets to secure Oriana\u2019s indebtedness. According to the Claimant, three of those pledge agreements were concluded.27 However, the fourth pledge agreement, relating to fixed assets, was never entered into. Its execution required the approval of the State Property Fund of Ukraine, which approval was not given.28\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 73.\n\nC-0018.\n\n56.\n\n(iv) *The ICC Arbitration against Oriana.* Between late 1998 and mid-2001, further attempts were made to resolve the dispute between KCH and Oriana. Oriana was restructured and certain of its assets spun off into a joint venture with Lukoil Petroleum. There were also further developments in bankruptcy proceedings brought against Oriana by a certain Pryvatbank.\n\n57.\n\nOn 27 June 2001, KCH (by then renamed as Solvadis International) commenced an ICC arbitration against Oriana pursuant to the arbitration clause in the Repayment Agreement.\n\n58.\n\nAlthough it did not participate fully in the arbitration, Oriana challenged the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, alleging that the Repayment Agreement had not been validly executed. Oriana also disputed Solvadis International\u2019s case on the merits. The tribunal observed in its award of 25 November 2002 as follows:29\n\nThe parties to this arbitration have submitted pleadings and numerous documents and an expert opinion in support of their respective arguments. Although Respondent did not participate in the proceedings as foreseen by the Rules, Respondent\u2019s arguments were brought forward in their undated letter to the Chairman (received on January 25, 2002), in a submission addressed to the ICC, dated April 30, 2002 and a letter to the Chairman dated September 25, 2002 and were duly considered in this arbitration. Respondent was granted all possibilities to present its case.\n\nC-0028.\n\n59.\n\nOriana\u2019s challenge to jurisdiction was unsuccessful, and the tribunal declared that it had jurisdiction to hear the dispute.\n\n60.\n\nThe tribunal found as a fact that Mr Sljuzar was the President of Oriana as at the date of signing the Repayment Agreement based on the evidence of witnesses concerning the manner in which Mr Sljuzar was introduced to them, the fact that Oriana subsequently sealed documents signed by Mr Sljuzar without correcting the designation \"President,\" and the fact that contracts signed by Mr Sljuzar as President were also signed by Messrs Gabel and Haber without objection being raised by the latter two.30\n\n*Id.*\n\n61.\n\nIn light of this, the tribunal determined that \"pursuant to Art. 8.4.5 of Respondent\u2019s statutes (Exhibits C 48, 48a) [Mr Sljuzar] therefore was empowered to represent the company, without needing special authorisation by the supervisory board, the shareholders assembly or any other body.\"31 Further, the tribunal stated that \"[t]he president also has the power to authorise a vice president (Mr Haber, Mr Gabel) to represent the company in negotiations or to conclude contracts.\"32\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n62.\n\nThe tribunal\u2019s award of 25 November 2002 was largely in favour of Solvadis International. The tribunal awarded Solvadis International USD 30,381,661.44 as primary compensation, plus 3% interest per annum from 28 December 2000, USD 273,000 in arbitration costs and EUR 141,689.38 in legal fees and expenses.\n\n63.\n\n(v) *The Attempts to Collect on the Award against Oriana.* On 11 March 2003, Solvadis International (formerly KCH) requested recognition and enforcement of the ICC Award before the Appellate Court of the Ivano-Frankivsk Region.33\n\nC-0115.\n\n64.\n\nOn 23 April 2003, Oriana submitted objections to Solvadis International\u2019s request for recognition and enforcement34, to which Solvadis International replied.35\n\nC-0118.\n\nC-0119.\n\n65.\n\nOn 28 May 2003, the Appellate Court rejected Solvadis International\u2019s request for recognition and enforcement.36 The Appellate Court found the Repayment Agreement was invalid as it had been concluded by unauthorised persons. The Appellate Court stated in its reasoning as follows:\n\nConsidering the case, the court ascertained that the [Repayment Agreement] was concluded and signed in contradiction to the Ukrainian effective legislation by the representatives of OJSC \"Oriana\" without duly authorized powers. The court came to such conclusion basing on the following grounds.\n\nArticle 6 of the Law of Ukraine \"On Foreign Economic Activity\" provides for: on behalf of legal entities - subjects of foreign economic activities, a foreign economic agreement (contract) shall be signed by two persons: a person who has this right according to his position under the statutory documents and a person having a power of attorney, signed by a head of foreign economic entity.\n\nThe Charter of the OJSC \"Oriana\" establishes that only [the] Chairman of the Board (president) has the right without the power of attorney to carry out actions on behalf of Company. The Charter does not provide the other members of the Board with the right to represent the company.\n\nIt is found out that the Agreement for Repayment of Debts dated 29.09.1998 was signed on behalf of OJSC \"Oriana\" by three representatives: Mr Sljusar, Mr Haber and Mr Gabel. It is also set out that Mr Sljusar held the post of Chairman of Board of OJSC \"Oriana.\"\n\nAccording to the Order of State Property Fund of Ukraine No.2073 dated November 3, 1998 this post was held by Mr Chernik and not by Mr Sljusar.\n\nBesides, the two other person[s] - Mr Haber and Mr Gabel were not duly authorized for the conclusion of the mentioned agreement.\n\nTaking into account the above-mentioned circumstances the Court of Appeal considers the Agreement for Repayment of Debts dated 29.09.1998 to be invalid pursuant to the article 48 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, since it was concluded by unauthorized persons in contradiction to the procedure, established by the Law of Ukraine \"On Foreign Economic Activity\" and by the foundation documents of the OJSC \"Oriana.\"\n\nThus the case had to be the subject to final regulation at the International Commercial Arbitration Court at Ukrainian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Kiev, Ukraine, but not at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Vienna, as it was provided by the original Conversion Agreement dated 13.12.1995.37\n\nC-0120.\n\n*Id.*\n\n66.\n\nOn 25 June 2003, Solvadis International filed a cassation complaint with the Supreme Court of Ukraine.38\n\nC-0121.\n\n67.\n\nOn 15 April 2004, the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected the cassation complaint.39\n\nC-0125.\n\n68.\n\nWhile the enforcement proceedings were underway, Solvadis International also attempted to claim under the ICC award in bankruptcy proceedings brought by Pryvatbank against Oriana in 2002. On 4 February 2003, Solvadis International filed a claim in the bankruptcy based on the ICC Award. That claim provided, in part, as follows:40\n\nCreditor\u2019s claims of the company \"Solvadis International GmbH\" are confirmed (attested) by the Arbitral Award of the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, rendered in Vienna, Austria in case No 11645/DK on November 25, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Arbitral Award\") in accordance with arbitration clause, agreed by the parties (duly legalized copy of the Arbitral Award with notary certified translation into Ukrainian is contained in Annex No 3 thereto). According to the Arbitral Award the Debtor - open joint stock company \"Oraina\" [sic] shall pay to \"Solvadis International GmbH\":\n\n\u2026\n\nAccording to the Arbitral Award the creditor's claims against open joint stock company \"Oriana\" are based on the Conversion Contract No 804-276-05473160/79-299 as of December 13, 1995, numerous annexes thereto, Settlement Agreement as of August 7, 1998, Agreement for Repayment of Debts as of September 29, 1998, as well as other documents submitted upon the International Court of Arbitration.\n\nThe above-mentioned Arbitral Award clearly confirms the indebtedness of open joint stock company \"Oriana\" before the company \"Solvadis International GmbH.\" The facts, established therein do not require further examining and proving under Article 35 of the Commercial Procedural Code of Ukraine. Pursuant to Article 35 of the said Code: \"The facts, established by judgement of commercial court (other authority competent to resolve disputes) in one litigation, are not subject to proving in another litigation involving the same parties.\"\n\nC-0126.\n\n69.\n\nOn 25 November 2003, the Commercial Court of the Ivano-Frankivsk Region dismissed Solvadis International\u2019s claim on the basis that the Ivano-Frankivsk Appellate Court had refused enforcement of the ICC Award on 28 May 2003.41\n\nC-0130.\n\n70.\n\nOn 6 February 2004, Solvadis International appealed the decision of the Commercial Court of Ivano-Frankivsk to the Appellate Commercial Court of Lviv, arguing, among other things, that the judgment of the Appellate Court dated 28 May 2003 refusing recognition and enforcement of the ICC Award was not final, and that the Commercial Court\u2019s finding to the contrary was itself contrary to law.42\n\nC-0131.\n\n71.\n\nOn 15 March 2004, the Appellate Commercial Court of Lviv affirmed the judgment of the Commercial Court of Ivano-Frankivsk.43\n\nC-0132.\n\n72.\n\nOn 14 April 2004, Solvadis International filed a cassation complaint with the Highest Commercial Court of Ukraine.44\n\nC-0133.\n\n73.\n\nOn 25 August 2004, the Highest Commercial Court of Ukraine allowed the cassation complaint, cancelling the judgments of the Appellate Commercial Court of Lviv and the Commercial Court of Ivano-Frankivsk.45\n\nC-0134.\n\n74.\n\nOn 30 September 2004, Oriana filed a cassation complaint against the judgment of the Highest Commercial Court of Ukraine with the Supreme Court of Ukraine.46 It appears that, on 11 November 2004, the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected this complaint.47\n\nC-0135.\n\nC-0136.\n\n75.\n\nOn 17 March 2005, Solvadis Chemag AG (by then named Solvadis GmbH), as claimed successor to Solvadis International, filed a \"Creditor\u2019s Explanation of monetary claims in the bankruptcy case No. B-l 1/283\" (the Oriana bankruptcy) with the Commercial Court of Ivano-Frankivsk.48\n\nC-0137.\n\n76.\n\nOriana filed objections to what it described as Solvadis International\u2019s claims.49\n\nC-0138.\n\n77.\n\nOn 15 April 2005, the Commercial Court of Ivano-Frankivsk issued its judgment on Solvadis Chemag AG\u2019s claim, having accepted the application to allow Solvadis Chemag AG to substitute for Solvadis International as creditor. The Commercial Court noted that it had heard Solvadis Chemag AG\u2019s claim as a result of the 25 August 2004 judgment of the Highest Commercial Court of Ukraine remanding the matter to it.50\n\nC-0140.\n\n78.\n\nThe Commercial Court of Ivano-Frankivsk rejected Solvadis\u2019 repayment claim on the basis that it had been filed outside the statutory limitation period, and the ICC Award did not toll that period \"since that decision was not properly legalized in Ukraine, and it therefore has no entitling legal force.\"51\n\n*Id.*\n\n79.\n\nOn 25 April 2005, Solvadis Chemag AG appealed the decision of the Commercial Court of Ivano-Frankivsk to the Lviv Appellate Commercial Court. In its appeal, Solvadis Chemag AG stated that the running of the limitation period against it had been suspended by the filing of arbitration proceedings on 27 June 2001, and that the court had wrongly held that this was not the case.52\n\nC-0141.\n\n80.\n\nSolvadis Chemag AG also suggested that the ruling of the Commercial Court of Ivano-Frankivsk had been based in part on that court\u2019s view that it had not filed its claim in time *vis-\u00e0-vis* the publication date of the bankruptcy announcement - that is, within 30 days. Solvadis Chemag AG\u2019s position was that as its original claim had been filed on 4 February 2003, it was filed in time.53\n\n*Id.*\n\n81.\n\nOn 22 June 2005, the Lviv Appellate Commercial Court agreed with the reasoning of the Commercial Court of Ivano-Frankivsk, and rejected Solvadis Chemag AG\u2019s appeal.54\n\nC-0143.\n\n82.\n\nThe Lviv Appellate Commercial Court further noted that Solvadis Chemag AG had not filed in support of its original claim \"primary documents that would prove the existence of the debt... except the base refining agreement and addenda thereto.\"55\n\n*Id.*\n\n83.\n\nOn 15 July 2005, Solvadis Chemag AG applied for cassation of the Lviv Appellate Commercial Court judgment and the Commercial Court of Ivano-Frankivsk judgment to the Superior Commercial Court of Ukraine. Solvadis Chemag AG challenged as contrary to law the findings that the limitation period had expired prior to the filing of its claim against Oriana and that it had not filed primary documents proving the existence of the debt owed.56\n\nC-0144.\n\n84.\n\nOn 30 November 2005, the Superior Commercial Court of Ukraine dismissed Solvadis Chemag AG\u2019s cassation complaint, and Solvadis International\u2019s final appeal in the bankruptcy proceedings was rejected by the Superior Commercial Court of Ukraine on 30 November 2005.57\n\nC-0145.\n\n85.\n\nThe foregoing has led GEA to file the present arbitration. An overview of GEA\u2019s position, and Ukraine\u2019s response thereto, is set out in the following section.\n\nIV. **Summary of the Parties\u2019 Positions and Relief Sought**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. GEA\u2019s Position\n-----------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position is that the Respondent failed to honour its \"repeated promises\" to ensure that GEA would be paid for its Products, and has taken \"multiple steps\" in intervening years to ensure that no compensation would be paid.58\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 6.\n\n87.\n\nIn \u00b6 361 of its Reply, GEA asks the Tribunal to make the following award in its favour:\n\n(i) Declaring that Ukraine has breached its obligations under the Treaty owed to GEA and its investments;\n\n(ii) Ordering Ukraine to pay damages to GEA in the principal amounts of USD 30,654,661.44 and EUR 141,689.38;\n\n(iii) Ordering Ukraine to pay interest on that amount at the LIBOR three-month US Dollar rate plus 5 percent (or at such other rate as the Tribunal deems to be appropriate) from January 1, 1999, compounded monthly until the date of the award;\n\n(iv) Ordering Ukraine to pay the costs of this arbitration, including all fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the legal costs incurred by GEA in this arbitration;\n\n(v) Ordering Ukraine to pay interest at that same interest rate, compounded monthly, on all amounts awarded until the full payment thereof; and\n\n(vi) Ordering such other and further relief as this Tribunal deems just and proper.\n\nB. Ukraine\u2019s Position\n---------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe Respondent denies the Claimant\u2019s claims in their entirety.\n\n89.\n\nIn \u00b6 447 of its Rejoinder, the Respondent asks the Tribunal to:\n\n(i) dismiss all of the Claimant\u2019s claims as inadmissible for lack of jurisdiction;\n\nin the alternative,\n\ndismiss all of the Claimant\u2019s claims as unfounded;\n\nin the alternative,\n\nreject the Claimant\u2019s claim for damages.\n\n(ii) order the Claimant to bear the costs of this arbitration, including all fees and expenses of the Tribunal as well as the Respondent\u2019s reasonable costs (including but not limited too [sic] its reasonable legal fees and expenses), payable forthwith.\n\nV. **Introduction to the Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed the pleadings, evidence and legal authorities submitted by the Parties and has relied exclusively on those in the analysis below. This applies in particular to legal authorities, as the Tribunal adheres to the principle that it should remain within the confines of the debate between the Parties. Thus, this Award is a decision in the dispute as pleaded between the Parties, and the Tribunal will not address arguments that have not been raised by them.\n\nVI. **Jurisdiction**\n--------------------\n\nA. The Parties\u2019 Positions\n-------------------------\n\n91.\n\nUkraine argues that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the case brought by the Claimant because (i) the alleged investment vested not in KCH but in Kl\u00f4ckner,59 which the Claimant never acquired, (ii) the Claimant did not make an \"investment\" in Ukraine under the BIT or the ICSID Convention and, in any event, (iii) any alleged BIT violations occurred before the alleged investment was made, and (iv) any claims against Ukraine for breach of the BIT now belong to Chemdis and not the Claimant.60\n\nThe Tribunal notes that for much of the proceedings, it was not clear that there were two Kl\u00f4ckner entities with the same name. It was ultimately clarified that, despite their identical names, there was a difference between Old Kl\u00f4ckner and New Kl\u00f4ckner *(see* \u00b6\u00b6 33 - 37 *supra).* However, as this difference was only clarified at the hearing, the Parties\u2019 submissions just refer to \"Kl\u00f4ckner,\" without differentiating between \"Old\" and \"New.\" Accordingly, when setting forth the Parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal maintains the reference to \"Kl\u00f4ckner.\" The Tribunal will differentiate between \"Old\" and \"New\" in its discussion, as necessary.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 113.\n\n92.\n\nGEA disagrees and submits that it did indeed acquire rights to the investment under the Conversion Contract (i) by virtue of its indirect control of KCH at the time of the BIT violations and (ii) as successor-in-interest to KCH.61 GEA also submits that it made an investment in Ukraine \"under any applicable test,\" whether under the ICSID Convention or the BIT62, and that the dispute \"meets the temporal requirements of the ICSID Convention and the Treaty.\"63\n\nReply, \u00b6 31.\n\nReply, \u00b6 42.\n\nReply, \u00b6 83.\n\nB. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis\n--------------------------\n\n93.\n\nIn light of the Parties\u2019 positions set forth above, the Tribunal must determine (1) whether GEA has standing to bring claims in this arbitration, (2) whether GEA made an \"investment\" in Ukraine, and (3) whether the alleged BIT violations occurred before GEA made any investment in Ukraine, which issues the Tribunal will now address in that order.\n\n*(1) Does GEA Have Standing?*\n-----------------------------\n\n94.\n\nUkraine objects to GEA\u2019s standing in this arbitration on two grounds, namely that (i) the Conversion Contract, as the core of the alleged investment, vested not in KCH but in Kl\u00f4ckner, and (ii) any claims against Ukraine now belong to Chemdis Limited and not the Claimant.\n\n95.\n\n(i) *Vesting of the Conversion Contract.* The Tribunal first addresses whether the Conversion Contract, as the core of the alleged investment, vested not in KCH but in Kl\u00f4ckner.\n\n96.\n\nUkraine alleges that extracts from the commercial register reveal that the spin-off of Kl\u00f4ckner\u2019s chemical business to KCH occurred on 29 May 1995, prior to Kl\u00f4ckner\u2019s entry into the Conversion Contract, and thus that the spin-off cannot have included any rights pertaining to the Conversion Contract.64 Further, Ukraine states that there is no evidence that KCH replaced Kl\u00f4ckner as a party to the Conversion Contract at any time such as to validly acquire rights thereunder.65\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 27 - 28; Rejoinder, \u00b6 121.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 125.\n\n97.\n\nGEA rejects the allegation that KCH acquired no such rights at the time Kl\u00f4ckner spun off its chemical assets to KCH in 1995.66 GEA argues that Ukraine\u2019s argument is \"contrary to the conduct and understanding of all of the actors involved at the time, as reflected in contemporaneous documents.\"67 Specifically, GEA points to almost 150 amendments to the Conversion Contract executed between KCH and Oriana, and contends that \"KCH *itself* was a party to these additional agreements and amendments, which were all valid and binding on the parties\" (emphasis in the original).68\n\nReply, \u00b6 30.\n\nReply, \u00b6 30.\n\nReply, \u00b6 32.\n\n98.\n\nIn addition, GEA argues that KCH was identified as Kl\u00f4ckner\u2019s successor to the Conversion Contract in the Settlement Agreement and in the protocol signed after a meeting on 13 August 199869, and that Ukrainian officials at various times acknowledged KCH\u2019s rights deriving from the Conversion Contract.70\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 33 - 34.\n\nReply, \u00b6 36.\n\n99.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the alleged investment - the Conversion Contract - vested in KCH.\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it was clarified over the course of the hearing that it was Old Kl\u00f4ckner that spun off its chemical business to KCH before merging into another company (Bayernwerk Aktiengesellschaft), whereas it was New Kl\u00f4ckner that entered into the Conversion Contract with Oriana.71\n\nChronology and Companies Involved (part 1), distributed at the hearing.\n\n101.\n\nWhile it is true that there is no one particular document in the record that states outright that KCH acquired rights from New Kl\u00f4ckner under the Conversion Contract, the evidence adduced over the course of the proceedings, taken together, leads to the conclusion that it did indeed acquire such rights.\n\n102.\n\nFirst, in Article 3.3 of the Settlement Agreement, Oriana expressly acknowledged that KCH was a party to the Conversion Contract, and that Oriana was indebted to KCH thereunder:\n\nOriana hereby reconfirms and agrees that KCH is a party to the Conversion Contract as successor to Kloeckner & Co. Aktiengesellschaft... with which Oriana initially concluded the Conversion Contract. Oriana hereby agrees that KCH acquired all of the rights and benefits, and assumed all of the obligations and liabilities, which were initially provided in the Conversion Contract for [Kloeckner & Co. Aktiengesellschaft].72\n\nC-0015.\n\n103.\n\nSecond, on 13 August 1998, representatives of, among others, Ukraine, Oriana and KCH\u2019s parent company met to discuss the \"state of cooperation\" between Oriana and KCH in light of Oriana\u2019s \"indebtedness to KCH.\" The results of that meeting were recorded in a protocol of the same date, in which it was recorded that Oriana\u2019s indebtedness to KCH arose \"under the above specified Contract for the Conversion of Raw Materials,\" *i.e.,* the Conversion Contract.73\n\nC-0016\n\n104.\n\nThird, on 27 August 1998, representatives of, among others, Ukraine, Germany, Oriana and KCH\u2019s parent company met to discuss the relationship between Oriana and KCH *(see generally* \u00b6 49 above). This meeting was recorded in a protocol of the same date, in which KCH\u2019s rights under the Conversion Contract were acknowledged. For example, Dr Rieger noted \"the problem of missing raw materials and products and the insoluble connection between the KCH/Oriana agreement and the ability of Oriana to repay the BV loan,\" and Vice Minister President Tyhypko noted that \"although KCH could break away from Oriana, it would have to write off the DM 40 million from the missing raw materials and products.\"74\n\nC-0065.\n\n105.\n\nFinally, it is undisputed that KCH entered into 147 out of a total of 154 amendments to the Conversion Contract.75 Article 11.4 of the Conversion Contract provides that \"[a]ny amendments or additions\" to the Conversion Contract \"become valid and binding if they are in writing and signed by authorised persons.\" The Tribunal has not been made aware of any particular objections to the validity or binding nature of these subsequent agreements, and the Tribunal considers it reasonable to conclude from KCH\u2019s consistent involvement in executing those agreements, without objection, that it had an interest in the underlying contract.\n\nC-0156; Chronology and Companies Involved (part 1).\n\n106.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the rights in the Conversion Contract did indeed vest in KCH. Accordingly, Ukraine\u2019s contentions to the contrary are rejected.\n\n107.\n\n(ii) *Vesting of the Claims.* With respect to Ukraine\u2019s second objection, *i.e.,* that any claims against Ukraine now belong to Chemdis Limited and not the Claimant, Ukraine alleges that any rights the Claimant may have had in relation to an investment were transferred in 2004, when the Claimant sold KCH and its parent company to Chemdis Limited, a private equity fund. Ukraine argues that, due to this sale, any claims that KCH may have had either \"continued to vest in KCH or tagged along with it to Chemdis.\"76\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 159 - 164.\n\n108.\n\nGEA disagrees and argues that it retained the KCH rights that are in dispute in this arbitration. In support of this contention, GEA relies on Article 2.2 of the \"Sale and Purchase Agreement\" between Solvadis Chemag AG (formerly KCH) and MG Technologies AG (later renamed GEA) of 28 June 2004 under which, GEA argues, KCH assigned its rights to GEA against Oriana and other entities, including Ukraine, deriving from the Conversion Contract and all related transactions.77\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 84 - 94.\n\n109.\n\nUkraine asserts that GEA\u2019s argument that it retained KCH\u2019s claims against Oriana is inconsistent with the fact that KCH continued to prosecute those claims before the courts of Ukraine after the apparent date of sale.78 While GEA argues that it was not possible to change the identity of the creditor in bankruptcy to reflect that situation79, Ukraine states that \"KCH did in fact successfully apply for a change of creditors in the third Oriana bankruptcy proceedings, after Chemdis had acquired its shares.\"80\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 161.\n\nReply, \u00b6 91.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 134.\n\n110.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 2.2 of the Sale and Purchase Agreement provides as follows:\n\n[KCH] assigns and transfers to [GEA] and [GEA] accepts the assignment and transfer of all rights, title and interest held by [KCH] in and to all claims of [KCH] against Oriana deriving from [KCH\u2019s] business relations to Oriana as described in more detail in Section 1 as well as all rights, title and interest in and to the belonging underlying transactions, including all rights thereunder.81\n\nC-0002.\n\n111.\n\nIt would seem from the language of the Sale and Purchase Agreement that Solvadis Chemag AG *(i.e.,* KCH) may have assigned, among other things, its claims against Oriana to MG Technologies AG *(i.e.,* GEA). At around the same time, it would seem that Solvadis Chemag AG *(i.e.,* KCH) was sold to Chemdis Limited *(see* \u00b6 41 above).82\n\n*See* Chronology and Companies Involved (part 2).\n\n112.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s most recent position with respect to the timing of these transactions is that while the Sale and Purchase Agreement between KCH and GEA was concluded on 28 June 2004, the actual assignment took place after 30 June 2004, the date on which the agreement was signed for the sale of KCH shares to Chemdis. However, the Claimant submits that the assignment took place before the closing date of the KCH/Chemdis sale, as the \"Effective Date\" under German law.83\n\nClaimant\u2019s Closing, Tr.4/p. 30:  \n \"Ms DUF\u00caTRE: So the assignment of rights between KCH and GEA was an intra-group transfer and it was dated June 28th 2004, and it took place after the signature of the share purchase agreement for the sale of KCH shares, but before the closing date. As I was told by my German clients, the closing date is the effective date under German law.\"\n\n113.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the fact that the shares in KCH were disposed of after the assignment to GEA on the basis that the Claimant has not provided a copy of the share purchase agreement between Solvadis Chemag AG and Chemdis Limited, or any other documents, to support this assertion.84\n\n*See, e.g.,* Respondent\u2019s Closing, Tr. 5/pp. 61-64.\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Respondent\u2019s objection regarding the missing copy of the share purchase agreement between Solvadis Chemag AG and Chemdis Limited is misplaced. In the early stages of these proceedings, the Tribunal had rejected a request from the Respondent for the production of this document on the basis that no such document was available.85\n\n*See* Procedural Order No. 1, Annex B, request 17.\n\n115.\n\nThis being said, the Tribunal is of the view that the other documents in the record do not support the Claimant\u2019s position regarding the timing of the sale versus the assignment.\n\n116.\n\nIndeed, the only other document submitted by the Claimant in support of the timing of the sale versus the assignment is a print-out from the website of the Solvadis Group, which does not indicate the date of any purported sale or closing of the Solvadis Chemag AG/Chemdis Limited deal. It simply states that, at some point in 2004, \"[t]he [S]olvadis group is taken over by Chemdis Limited\" at which time its form was changed to Solvadis GmbH.86\n\nC-0042.\n\n117.\n\nIn light of this, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant has not met its burden of proving that it retained KCH\u2019s claims arising under the Conversion Contract, or any other interest in the alleged investment underlying this dispute, after 30 June 2004. For the Tribunal to determine otherwise would be to take a decision based on assertions unsupported by evidence.\n\n118.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant does not have standing to bring any claims arising from the Conversion Contract after 30 June 2004.\n\n119.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal\u2019s decision that the Sale and Purchase Agreement cannot be taken into account as a basis for the Claimant\u2019s claims after this date, the Tribunal need not address the questions raised by the Respondent regarding the assignment\u2019s validity.87\n\nThe Respondent had disputed the validity of the assignment under German law (by which it is governed) on the basis that the \u20ac1 paid by GEA for the assignment of KCH\u2019s claims was below value, in violation of Sections 76(1) and 93(1) of the German Stock Corporations Act and Section 266(1) of the German Criminal Code, thereby rendering the entire agreement void under Section 134 of the German Civil Code. Rejoinder, \u00b6 133.\n\n120.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal need not address the Respondent\u2019s argument that, as a matter of principle, KCH could not have assigned its treaty rights under the Sale and Purchase Agreement to GEA.88 While at the hearing there was an extensive discussion as to whether, as a matter of general theory, treaty rights can ever be assigned, the Tribunal notes that this broader question is ultimately irrelevant in this case, as Article 1 of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (\"Description of Sold Claims\") only provided for an assignment of contractual claims, as opposed to an assignment of treaty rights. Having carefully considered the various arguments of construction and interpretation advanced by the Claimant, the Tribunal concludes that this provision does not extend to rights or obligations under international law, and nor was this intended at the time.\n\nThe Respondent had disputed the Claimant\u2019s ability to be assigned KCH\u2019s treaty rights under the Sale and Purchase Agreement. *See, e.g.,* Respondent\u2019s Closing, Tr.5/pp. 25 - 58.\n\n121.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal does need to address the Respondent\u2019s argument that GEA did not have the right to bring this arbitration because it no longer had control of KCH when the Request was registered.\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the case of *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, a.s. v. Slovak Republic (\"CSOB\")* in support of its position, citing the following passage of the tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction:89\n\n[I]t is generally recognised that the determination whether a party has standing in an international judicial forum for purposes of jurisdiction to institute proceedings is made by reference to the date on which such proceedings are deemed to have been instituted.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on the Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999. Respondent\u2019s Opening, Tr.l/pp. 64 - 65, citing *CSOB* at \u00b6 31.\n\n123.\n\nIn response, the Claimant contends that the Respondent \"misses the point,\" taking into account that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention does not require that an investment \"exists or is controlled by the national of another contracting state at the time of registration.\"90\n\nClaimant\u2019s Closing, Tr.4/pp. 40 - 41.\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimant. The Respondent, in effect has attempted to create a standing requirement *(i.e.,* a requirement of ownership or control of the investment at the time of registration of the Request) that does not otherwise exist under the BIT, ICSID Convention or ICSID Rules. Indeed, such a requirement, if it existed, would exclude a significant range of cases where claims are made in respect of the divestment or expropriation of an investment. What is more, the Respondent quotes the *CSOB* tribunal out of context, as the next paragraph of the award in fact supports the Claimant\u2019s position in these proceedings:91\n\n[A]bsence of beneficial ownership by a claimant in a claim or the transfer of the economic risk in the outcome of a dispute should not and has not been deemed to affect the standing of a claimant in an ICSID proceeding.\n\nCSOB at \u00b6 32.\n\n125.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that even though GEA does not have standing with respect to claims arising after 30 June 2004, GEA did have the right to file the Request when it did.\n\n*(2) Did GEA Make an Investment?*\n---------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nHaving determined that GEA has standing to pursue claims accruing up to 30 June 2004, the Tribunal must next determine whether GEA actually \"invested\" in Ukraine at all, within the meaning and scope of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n127.\n\n*The Parties\u2019 Positions.* According to the Claimant, \"[t]he current dispute concerns an \"investment\" both within the meaning of the [BIT] and the ICSID Convention,\"92 but the Tribunal need only look to the language of the BIT to determine this issue, and need not consider any different definition in the context of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The Claimant submits that this is because where a BIT providing only for ICSID arbitration gives a definition of \"investment,\" \"there is no occasion for an arbitral tribunal to apply a different definition of the term.\"93\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 131.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 144.\n\n128.\n\nIn support of this, the Claimant notes that since ICSID arbitration is the only form of investor-State dispute resolution provided for in the BIT, \"if jurisdiction were found absent under the ICSID Convention while the relationship at issue would otherwise qualify as an investment under the [BIT], the [BIT]\u2019s dispute resolution clause would be deprived of any effectiveness, which is contrary to basic principles of treaty interpretation.\"94\n\nReply, \u00b6 56.\n\n129.\n\nThe Claimant adds, in any event however, that \"the evidence establishes the existence of an \u2018investment\u2019 within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\"95 It notes that \"[t]he jurisprudence to date reveals a wide variety of approaches to what constitutes an investment under the ICSID Convention,\"96 but asserts that whatever test is applied, it qualifies on the facts of this case:\n\nTaking the six-part test in *Phoenix Action97* as the most comprehensive: *first,* GEA contributed assets of economic value to the territory of Ukraine. These took the form of over one million metric tons of diesel and naphtha delivered to Ukraine over a three-year period, as well as catalysts and other materials, and its know-how on logistics and marketing and its ability to mobilize repair and other services. *Second,* GEA was exposed to market risk due to the duration of time between when it purchased diesel for delivery to Oriana and the time when it was able to realize a return by selling finished products converted by Oriana. The arrangement amounted to some DM 100 million of working capital financing for Oriana precisely because of this commitment of resources over time.. A certain duration is evident. *Third,* multiple elements of risk were present in the form of market risk, credit risk and political risk - as demonstrated by the fact that no other companies were willing to supply Oriana with diesel without advance payment. *Fourth,* GEA\u2019s relationship with Oriana kept Oriana\u2019s factories running at a time when they would otherwise have closed and thereby supported the only substantial economic activity in the Ivano-Frankivsk region at the time. The sustained attention at the highest levels of the Ukrainian and German Governments to the GEA-Oriana relationship is compelling evidence of its importance to the development of economic activity in Ukraine. *Fifth,* there is no question that GEA\u2019s assets were invested in accordance with Ukrainian law. *Sixth,* there is no question as to the *bona fides* of GEA\u2019s investment.98\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 138.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 139.\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd v.

Common to the jurisdictional requirements of both Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(1) of the Treaty is the meaning of the term \u2018investment.\u2019\"99\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 122 and \u00b6 124.\n\n131.\n\nAs far as Article 1(1) of the BIT is concerned, the Respondent maintains that the Conversion Contract was no more than a sales agreement, which did not confer on GEA any \"rights to the exercise of an economic activity.\"\n\n132.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent also argues that the definition of \"investment\" in the BIT does not control the issue in any event, since this can only operate within the confines of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention: \"[t]he definition of the term \u2018investment\u2019 contained in the Treaty cannot extend beyond the requirements of the ICSID Convention if the Tribunal is to retain jurisdiction. The definition of \u2018investment\u2019 in the Treaty does not provide parties and the Tribunal a *carte blanche* to re-write the ICSID Convention.\"100 The Respondent relies in this regard on the decision in *Phoenix:*\n\nThere is nothing like a total discretion, even if the definition developed by ICSID case law is quite broad and encompassing. There are indeed some basic criteria and parties are not free to decide in BITs that anything - like a sale of goods or a dowry for example - is an investment.101\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 131.\n\nN. 97 *supra,* \u00b6 82.\n\n133.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the term \"investment\" has \"an identifiable inherent core meaning\" in ICSID matters, and the Tribunal is required to ensure that any definition of the term \"investment\" provided by the BIT accords with this objective meaning.102 It cites several decisions in which this concept of an objective definition has been articulated.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 134.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent also prays in aid Zachary Douglas\u2019 textbook, in which the author states that \"the use of the term \u2018investment\u2019 in both instruments [investment treaties and the ICSID Convention] imports the same basic economic attributes of an investment derived from the ordinary meaning of that term.\"103\n\nZachary Douglas, The International Law of Investment Claims (Cambridge University Press, 2009), p. 165.\n\n135.\n\nWhereas the Claimant argues that the imposition of an objective definition of \"investment\" in circumstances where a BIT only provides for ICSID arbitration risks frustrating the BIT\u2019s dispute resolution clause, the Respondent counters that if a BIT provides a choice between several forms of dispute resolution (e.g., ICSID and UNCITRAL arbitration), it would be a curious result if, by virtue of a \"subjective\" definition agreed in the BIT itself, an \"investment\" could be established under the UNCITRAL Rules, but not under the ICSID Convention.\n\n136.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent argues that \"the Claimant has not made an investment since (a) no contribution of economic value has been made to Ukraine, (b) no profits or returns have resulted from such a contribution and (c) the Claimant assumed no investment risk. These principles underpin the definition of the term \"investment\" under both Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(1) of the [BIT].\"104\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 146.\n\n137.\n\n*The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis.* It is well known that the ICSID Convention contains no definition of the term \"investment\" used in its Article 25.\n\n138.\n\nArticle 1 of the BIT defines \"investment\" as follows:\n\nFor purposes of this agreement\n\n1) the term \"investments\" means assets of any kind, in particular\n\na) movable and immovable property and other rights in rem such as mortgages and security interests;\n\nb) equity interests and other stakes in companies;\n\nc) claims to funds used to create material or immaterial values and claims to performances having such value;\n\nd) intellectual property rights such as, in particular, copyrights, patents, utility models, industrial designs and models, trademarks, trade names, company and business secrets, technological processes, knowhow and goodwill;\n\ne) rights to the exercise of an economic activity including rights to the search for and the exploration, extraction and utilisation of natural resources on the basis of statutory provisions or granted under an agreement concluded in accordance with such statutory provisions.\n\nAny change to the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their nature as investments.\n\n139.\n\nIn a number of well-known cases, tribunals have articulated objective criteria for the definition of the term \"investment\" that are said to flow from the ICSID Convention, and have concluded that such criteria cannot be set aside by a consent that may have been given in another legal instrument, such as a BIT. A good example of such an approach is the one taken by the *ad hoc* Committee in the *Patrick Mitchell v. Congo* annulment proceeding, which expressed the limits of the notion of investment in clear terms:\n\nThe parties to an agreement and the States which conclude an investment treaty cannot open the jurisdiction of the Centre to any operation they might arbitrarily qualify as an investment. It is thus repeated that, before ICSID arbitral tribunals, the Washington Convention has supremacy over an agreement between the parties or a BIT.105\n\n*Patrick* Mitchell *v. Democratic Republic of Congo,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/7, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Award, 1 November 2006, \u00b6 31.\n\n140.\n\nThe same position has been followed in *Phoenix:*\n\nAt the outset, it should be noted that BITs, which are bilateral arrangements between two States parties, cannot contradict the definition of the ICSID Convention. In other words, they can confirm the ICSID notion or restrict it, but they cannot expand it in order to have access to ICSID. A definition included in a BIT being based on a test agreed between two States cannot set aside the definition of the ICSID Convention, which is a multilateral agreement. As long as it fits within the ICSID notion, the BIT definition is acceptable, it is not if it falls outside of such definition. For example, if a BIT would provide that ICSID arbitration is available for sales contracts which do not imply any investment, such a provision could not be enforced by an ICSID tribunal.106\n\nN. 97 *supra,* \u00b6 96. Citation omitted. See also \u00b6 82.\n\n141.\n\nHowever, it is not so much the term \"investment\" in the ICSID Convention than the term \"investment\" *per se* that is often considered as having an objective meaning in itself, whether it is mentioned in the ICSID Convention or in a BIT. For example, the tribunal in *Romak S.A. v. Uzbekistan,* conducting its proceedings on the basis of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, observed as follows:\n\nThe term \"investment\" has a meaning in itself that cannot be ignored when considering the list contained in Article 1(2) of the BIT.\n\n.... The Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that the term \"investments\" under the BIT has an inherent meaning (irrespective of whether the investor resorts to ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings) entailing a contribution that extends over a certain period of time and that involves some risk.... By their nature, asset types enumerated in the BIT\u2019s non-exhaustive list may exhibit these hallmarks. But if an asset does not correspond to the inherent definition of \"investment,\" the fact that it falls within one of the categories listed in Article 1 does not transform it into an \"investment.\" In the general formulation of the tribunal in *Azinian, \"labelling... is no substitute for analysis.\"107*\n\n*Romak SA. v. The Republic of Uzbekistan* (PCA Case No. AA280), Award, 26 November 2009, \u00b6 180 and \u00b6 207. Emphasis in the original.\n\n142.\n\nOn the other hand, insofar as BIT arbitration under the ICSID Convention is concerned, it has also been held in a number of (again well-known) cases that, because the ICSID Convention provides no definition of the term \"investment,\" the limits of this concept are susceptible to agreement, or a subjective definition by the State Parties in legal instruments such as BITs or national laws, which embody their consent to ICSID jurisdiction. As the Tribunal in *Biwater v. Tanzania108* noted, for example:\n\n312.... it is clear from the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Convention that several attempts to incorporate a definition of \"investment\" were made, but ultimately did not succeed. In the end, the term was left intentionally undefined, with the expectation (inter alia) that a definition could be the subject of agreement as between Contracting States.109 Hence the following oft-quoted passage in the Report of the Executive Directors:\n\n\"No attempt was made to define the term \u2018investment\u2019 given the essential requirement of consent by the parties, and the mechanism through which Contracting States can make known in advance, if they so desire, the classes of disputes which they would or would not consider submitting to the Centre (Article 25(4)).\"110\n\n313. Given that the Convention was not drafted with a strict, objective, definition of \"investment,\" it is doubtful that arbitral tribunals sitting in individual cases should impose one such definition which would be applicable in all cases and for all purposes....\n\n314. Further, the *Salini Test* itself is problematic if, as some tribunals have found, the \"typical characteristics\" of an investment as identified in that decision are elevated into a fixed and inflexible test, and if transactions are to be presumed excluded from the ICSID Convention unless each of the five criteria111 are satisfied. This risks the arbitrary exclusion of certain types of transaction from the scope of the Convention. It also leads to a definition that may contradict individual agreements (as here), as well as a developing consensus in parts of the world as to the meaning of \"investment\" (as expressed, e.g., in bilateral investment treaties). If very substantial numbers of BITs across the world express the definition of \"investment\" more broadly than the *Salini Test,* and if this constitutes any type of international consensus, it is difficult to see why the ICSID Convention ought to be read more narrowly.\n\n315. Equally, the suggestion that the \"special and privileged arrangements established by the Washington Convention can be applied only to the type of investment which the Contracting States to that Convention envisaged\" [footnote omitted] does not, in this Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view, lead to a fixed or autonomous definition of \"investment\" which must prevail in all cases, for the \"type of investment\" which the Contracting States to the Convention in fact envisaged was an intentionally undefined one, which was susceptible of agreement.\n\n316. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore considers that a more flexible and pragmatic approach to the meaning of \"investment\" is appropriate, which takes into account the features identified in *Salini,* but along with all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the instrument containing the relevant consent to ICSID.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd v. Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 312-316.\n\nFootnote reference to Ch. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2001), pp. 121-125, \u00b6\u00b6 80-88.\n\nFootnote reference to International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (18 March 1965), in 1 ICSID Reports 28 (1993), \u00b6 27.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the *Salini Test* refers only to four criteria, the earlier Fedax decision referring to five criteria *(Fedax N.V. v. The Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No ARB/96/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997).\n\n143.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, this is a controversy that need not be resolved. Out of an abundance of caution, the Tribunal has considered all potentially applicable criteria and, as set out below, each leads to the same conclusion with respect to each of the alleged \"investments\" in question.\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimant has identified its investment in Ukraine as its contractual and property rights under the Conversion Contract, \"formalised in the settlement agreement and the repayment agreement with respect to the amounts that are at dispute, and ultimately [...] crystallised in the ICC award.\"112\n\nReply, \u00b6 41; Claimant\u2019s Closing, Tr.4/p. 9.\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, after considerable discussion at the hearing, the Claimant elaborated its case on this issue, asserting (as its final position) that (i) the Conversion Contract, together with the property rights in the products delivered under the Conversion Contract, may constitute an investment; (ii) the Settlement Agreement, together with the Repayment Agreement, may constitute an investment; and (iii) the ICC Award, on its own, may constitute an investment.113 In light of this, the Tribunal will analyse these elements individually.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Closing, Tr.4/pp. 16 - 19.\n\n146.\n\n(i) *The Conversion Contract and the Products.* The Tribunal accordingly starts with an examination whether the Conversion Contract may constitute an investment, together with the property rights in the products delivered under the Conversion Contract, under the BIT and/or the ICSID Convention.\n\n147.\n\nIn terms of the BIT, it is the Claimant\u2019s case, among other things, that the Conversion Contract falls within the definition of investment in Article 1(1)(e), as it confers \"rights to the exercise of an economic activity\" and involves \"movable property\" in the form of Products within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a).114\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 137, 135.\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees, and argues that the Conversion Contract \"does not confer any rights upon the Claimant to exercise economic activities in Ukraine;\" instead, the Respondent argues that the Conversion Contract was a service contract, under which \"Kl\u00f4ckner/KCH simply undertook to deliver a certain amount of goods to Oriana for conversion against payment of a tolling fee.\"115 Further, the Respondent disputes that the Products can be considered an investment, in and of themselves, under Article 1(1)(a), and argues that \"movable property\" must be considered \"in the light of its context (the reference to investment).\"116\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 143; Rejoinder, \u00b6 156.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 125; Rejoinder, \u00b6 155.\n\n149.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in the present case, according to the BIT itself, its terms have to be interpreted in the broader context of an investment operation, as is clear from the last sentence of Article 1(1) stating that \"(a)ny change to the form in which *assets are invested* shall not affect *their nature as investments.\"* (emphasis added) The question therefore is whether the Conversion Contact fits within the nature of an \"investment,\" as understood in the BIT. In this context, the Tribunal considers that, on its face, the Conversion Contract conveyed the right for GEA, through KCH, to exercise an economic activity in Ukraine at the relevant time. In addition, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s contentions, the Conversion Contract was more than just goods against a tolling fee - it established a relationship of \"common interest\" whereby KCH (and, ultimately GEA) would, among other things, assist with delivery of logistics and pay for Ukrainian domestic freight, resolve customs issues, and supply the Oriana plant with necessary materials.117\n\nWS D\u00f4ss, \u00b6 6.\n\n150.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Conversion Contract constitutes an investment within the meaning of Article 1(1)(e) of the BIT, in that it confers \"rights to the exercise of an economic activity.\" Further, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Products constitute an investment under Article 1(1)(a), as they form an integral part of the investment under the Conversion Contract.\n\n151.\n\nTurning then to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (in deference to the view of some, outlined above, that Article 25 places a limit on the State Parties\u2019 ability to define \"investment\" in their BIT for the purposes of ICSID jurisdiction), the Tribunal has no doubt that the Conversion Contract also meets this test. In particular, it satisfies all the elements of the \"objective definition\" that are commonly applied under Article 25: the Claimant has provided some contribution to Ukraine, during a certain period of time, while assuming the risks of the economic operation it was performing.\n\n152.\n\nThe Conversion Contract entailed a contribution in kind, in the form of over one million metric tons of diesel and naphtha, catalysts and other materials, delivered to Ukraine as part of a broad economic operation, as well as the contribution of the Claimant\u2019s know-how on logistics, marketing, and the mobilisation of repairs and other services. This was clearly a complex relationship going far beyond a simple sale of raw materials. The relationship extended over a certain duration (a three year period if one considers only the time period when the Claimant was involved). Further, it is unquestionable that the foreign investor, as it has itself emphasised in its own Memorial,118 undertook multiple risks, in the form of market risk, credit risk and political risk, in particular since Oriana was supplied with diesel without advance payment.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 145.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that, with respect to the Conversion Contract and the Products, the Claimant made an \"investment\" in Ukraine, both within the meaning of Articles 1(1)(e) and 1(1)(a) of the BIT and (if needed) Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n154.\n\n(ii) *The Settlement Agreement and the Repayment Agreement.* The Tribunal next turns to the Settlement Agreement, together with the Repayment Agreement, being the second category of alleged \"investment\" on which the Claimant relies.\n\n155.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, following the taking of its property, the form of its investment changed into \"claims to performance having [material or immaterial] value\" within the meaning of Article 1(1)(e) of the BIT. Specifically, the Claimant argues that the Settlement Agreement \"recognised the validity of the claims to performance,\" while the Repayment Agreement \"quantified the minimum value of the claims and set out a mechanism for the value of the claims to be materialised.\"119\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 136.\n\n156.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees, and argues that neither agreement created rights under Ukrainian law, which governs them. The Respondent contends that the Settlement agreement \"merely established an inventory of undelivered goods and recorded the difference as a debt owed by Oriana to KCH,\" while the Repayment Agreement \"established a means for the repayment by Oriana to KCH of Oriana\u2019s debts.\"120\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 158.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that neither the Settlement Agreement nor the Repayment Agreement - *in and of themselves -* constitute \"investments\" under Article 1 of the BIT or (if needed) Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. As legal acts they are not the same as the investment in Ukraine itself. In particular, (a) the Settlement Agreement merely established an inventory of undelivered goods and recorded the difference as a debt owed by Oriana to KCH; and (b) the Repayment Agreement merely established a means for the repayment by Oriana to KCH of Oriana\u2019s debts.\n\n158.\n\n(iii) *The ICC Award.* Finally, the Tribunal turns to the ICC Award, being the third category of alleged \"investment\" on which the Claimant relies.\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the ICC Award, in and of itself, falls under Article 1(1)(e) of the BIT because it liquidated the amount due under the Settlement Agreement and Repayment Agreement as of 2002.121\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 136.\n\n160.\n\nThe Respondent disputes this, asserting that the ICC Award cannot be an investment because it \"is not an asset that was contributed to Ukraine, it was not made in Ukraine, and therefore it does not fall within the definition of an investment.\"122\n\nTr.5/p. 84.\n\n161.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees again with the Respondent. Whether tested against the criteria of Article 1 of the BIT or Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the ICC Award - *in and of itself -* cannot constitute an \"investment.\" Properly analysed, it is a legal instrument, which provides for the disposition of rights and obligations arising out of the Settlement Agreement and Repayment Agreement (neither of which was itself an \"investment\" - see \u00b6\u00b6 154 - 157 above).\n\n162.\n\nEven if - *arguendo -* the Settlement Agreement and Repayment Agreement could somehow be characterised as \"investments,\" or the ICC Award could be characterised as directly arising out of the Conversion Contract or the Products, the Tribunal considers that the fact that the Award rules upon rights and obligations arising out of an investment does not equate the Award with the investment itself. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the two remain analytically distinct, and the Award itself involves no contribution to, or relevant economic activity within, Ukraine such as to fall - *itself-* within the scope of Article 1(1) of the BIT or (if needed) Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. For the same reason, the Settlement Agreement and Repayment Agreement, as well as the Award, cannot be considered as falling within the terminal proviso of Article 1 of the BIT (\"Any change to the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their nature as investments\").\n\n163.\n\nIt may be noted that in the Decision on Jurisdiction in *Saipem S.p.A, v. The People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh* (a case heavily relied upon by the Claimant), the Tribunal made statements that are difficult to reconcile, *i.e.,* that the ICC arbitration is part of the investment (under the heading: \"Has Saipem made an investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention?\"); that the ICC award is not part of the investment (under the heading \"Does the dispute arise directly out of the Investment?\"); and that it is unnecessary to decide whether the ICC award is part of the investment (under the heading \"Jurisdictional objections under the BIT\").123\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 March 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 110; 113; 127.\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that with respect to the Settlement Agreement and the Repayment Agreement as well as the ICC Award, the Claimant has not made an \"investment\" in Ukraine, both within the meaning of the BIT and (if needed) the ICSID Convention.\n\n*(3) Did the Alleged Violations Occur Before the Alleged Investment?*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nHaving determined that the Claimant made at least some \"investment\" in Ukraine within the meaning of the BIT and the ICSID Convention (namely the Conversion Contract and the Products), the Tribunal must next determine whether the violations alleged by the Claimant occurred before the relevant investment was made.\n\n166.\n\nIt is Ukraine\u2019s position that, to the extent any alleged breaches of the BIT took place prior to the claimed acquisition by GEA\u2019s subsidiary of shares in KCH, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.124\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 149.\n\n167.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees, contending that the dispute meets the temporal requirement of the BIT and the ICSID Convention because both \"were applicable to both Ukraine and GEA during the whole period relevant to the current dispute.\" The Claimant further specifies that the BIT applies to investments made both before and after the BIT\u2019s entry into force.125\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 147.\n\n168.\n\nFurthermore, GEA claims that in any event \"as a legal matter, an international claim can hardly accrue before the claimant learns of the acts that give rise to it.\"126\n\nReply, \u00b6 102.\n\n169.\n\nUkraine rejects this argument on the basis that it is a \"novel\" theory for which the Claimant has provided no legal authority.127\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 185, referring to Reply, \u00b6 102.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Ukraine that in order for the Tribunal to hear the Claimant\u2019s claims, the Claimant must have held an interest in the alleged investment before the alleged treaty violations were committed. Contrary to the Claimant\u2019s assertions, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis cannot hinge on whether the Claimant knew of Ukraine\u2019s purported treaty violations. The principle put forth by Ukraine has been consistently applied in investment arbitrations128, and has been articulated by Zachary Douglas in his treatise as follows:129\n\nRule 32. The claimant must have had control over the investment in the host contracting state party at the time of the alleged breach of the obligation forming the basis of its claim.\n\nSee, e.g., *Limited Liability Company Amto v. Ukraine,* SCC Arbitration No. 080/2005, Final Award, 26 March 2008, \u00b6 48(c); *Saluka Investments BV* (The Netherlands) *v. The Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL), Partial Award, 17 March 2006, \u00b6 244; *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 15 April 2009, \u00b6 67.\n\nZachary Douglas, The International Law of Investment Claims (Cambridge University Press, 2009), p. 165, cited in Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 150.\n\n171.\n\nWith this in mind, the Tribunal must determine as of what date the Claimant had an interest in the alleged investment.\n\n172.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties that GEA indirectly owned and controlled KCH when one of GEA\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiaries purchased KCH from SF Beteiligungs GmbH under the agreement dated 5 December 1997 *(see* \u00b6 38 above). However, the Parties do not agree as of what date GEA effectively gained ownership of KCH.\n\n173.\n\nUkraine alleges that the Claimant\u2019s acquisition of KCH took effect on 9 February 1998, and in any event no earlier than 29 January 1998, the date on which the European Commission granted merger control approval to GEA\u2019s acquisition of KCH (a condition precedent to the share assignment taking effect).130\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 41-44.\n\n174.\n\nGEA disagrees, arguing that it acquired the share capital of KCH through the agreement dated 5 December 1997, which took effect on 31 December 1997.131\n\nReply, \u00b6 95.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 2.2 of the agreement dated 5 December 1997 provides for GEA to acquire KCH\u2019s shares subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions, as follows:132\n\n[SF Beteiligungs-GmbH] hereby already assigns to [GEA], subject to the condition precedent of the occurrence of the condition described in \u00a7 21.1 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Cartel Condition\") as well as the payment of the purchase price pursuant to \u00a7 3.1, all of the KCH Shares with effect as of midnight December 31, 1997 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Effective Date\"). [GEA] hereby accepts the assignment. The time at which the Buyer shall have acquired the KCH Shares unconditionally and free of encumbrances is hereinafter referred to as the \"Closing Date.\"\n\nC-0153.\n\n176.\n\nArticle 21.1 of the 5 December 1997 agreement, referred to in Article 2.2, sets forth the details of the so-called \"Cartel Condition,\" which involves, among other things, approval from the European Commission of the transaction foreseen by the Parties.\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, at the end of the agreement dated 5 December 1997, the Parties\u2019 notary advised that the agreement would not become \"effective\" until \"all consents required by law and the articles of association have been given and are legally effective.\"133\n\n*Id.*\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that there are two concepts contained in Article 2.2 of the 5 December 1997 agreement, namely, that of an \"Effective Date\" and that of a \"Closing Date.\"\n\n179.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s reading, once the European Commission granted approval of GEA\u2019s purchase of KCH - which it did - and the requisite purchase price was paid, the conditions were fulfilled for the effective transfer of KCH shares on the Effective Date of 31 December 1997.\n\n180.\n\nAs to whether the Tribunal should look to the Effective Date or the Closing Date as the operative moment for determining ownership, the Tribunal observes that the Claimant seems to take contradictory positions, requesting the Tribunal to look to the Effective Date with respect to the 5 December 1997 agreement *(see* \u00b6 174 above) and the Closing Date with respect to the Sale and Purchase Agreement *(see* \u00b6 112 above).\n\n181.\n\nThis being said, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent, like the Claimant, argues with reference to the Effective Date regarding the 5 December 1997 agreement. As both Parties make this argument with reference to the Effective Date, the Tribunal will accordingly take the Effective Date into account for purposes of determining when GEA acquired KCH. The Tribunal thus concludes that GEA owned KCH as of 31 December 1997.\n\n182.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal determines that GEA had an interest in the Conversion Contract as of 31 December 1997, when it gained an interest in KCH, and up to 30 June 2004, when it lost its interest in KCH and any claims KCH had against Oriana *(see* discussion in \u00b6\u00b6 94 - 118 above).\n\n183.\n\nHaving determined that GEA acquired its interest in the Conversion Contract as of 31 December 1997, the Tribunal must now determine whether the alleged treaty violations occurred before or after that date.\n\n184.\n\nThe alleged violations consist of (i) the alleged misappropriation of 125,000 metric tons of the Claimant\u2019s Products; (ii) Ukraine\u2019s alleged failure to investigate and prosecute the shooting of Dr Chperoun; (iii) Ukraine\u2019s alleged failure to recognise and enforce the ICC Award; and (iv) Ukraine\u2019s alleged failure to recognise GEA\u2019s claims in bankruptcy proceedings.134 The Tribunal will examine these points in turn.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 95-101.\n\n185.\n\n(i) *Alleged Misappropriation of Products.* With respect to the alleged misappropriation of 125,000 metric tons of the Products, Ukraine submits that the alleged misappropriation took place in 1997, prior to the purported acquisition of KCH shares.135\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 153 - 157.\n\n186.\n\nIn response, GEA submits that \"there is no support in the record\" for Ukraine\u2019s assertion that the alleged misappropriation occurred in 1997. The Claimant contends that Ukraine\u2019s assertion is based on the notes of a conversation with Mr Chernyk, where he initially indicated that the taking took place in October/November 1997, but that those notes record that \"Chemyk quickly crossed out the months,\" suggesting that the misappropriation extended after November 1997.136\n\nReply, \u00b6 98.\n\n187.\n\nInstead, GEA argues that \"major deliveries of products\" from GEA to Oriana were scheduled between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 1998, such that \"[l]ogically, these products could not have been taken from Oriana\u2019s premises before they were delivered to Oriana.\" In any event, GEA is of the view that Ukraine bears the burden of proving its allegation that the taking took place in 1997, which it has failed to do.137\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 99-101.\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant has not submitted any documents that speak directly to the timing of any alleged taking. Instead, it relies principally on Supplementary Agreement no. 57 to the Conversion Contract, dated 18 December 1997, which provides for the supply of large amounts of raw materials to Oriana over the course of 1998.138 The Claimant also relies on an interview dated 12 July 1998 of the economic director of Oriana, who confirmed the 1998 deliveries.139\n\nC-0006.\n\nC-0053.\n\n189.\n\nBy contrast, Ukraine has adduced evidence that speaks directly to the timing of the purported taking.\n\n190.\n\nFor example, Ukraine has submitted the minutes of a meeting between Oriana and the management board of GEA (at the time named Metallgesellschaft AG), dated 10 August 1998, which indicate that the purported taking happened in large part before GEA had obtained an interest in the investment:140\n\n[A]ll documents are now to be made available for inspection. Arthur Andersen will resume the examination on 11 August 1998 and continuously provide information. According to the analysis of the documents available so far, product shortages of at least DM 26 million went missing prior to 31 January 1998 (= transfer of KCH to [GEA]).(sic)141\n\nR-0041.\n\nIt should be noted that the sic is in the original document, presumably because the date referred to should be 31 December 1997.\n\n191.\n\nIn addition, Ukraine has submitted the notes of a meeting held on 21 October 1998 between Mr Chernyk, president of Oriana, and Dr Kr\u00fcger of KCH, among others. The notes of that meeting indicate that the president of Oriana himself indicated that inventories were removed from Oriana during 1997 and in particular during the months of October/November. Contrary to the Claimant\u2019s assertion, the Tribunal finds no indication that the fact that \"Chernyk quickly crossed out the months\" suggests that the purported misappropriation extended after November 1997. It rather seems to the Tribunal that Mr Chernyk scratched out October/November either because he did not want the months he had written to be seen, or because he was ultimately unsure of which months in 1997 to specify.\n\n192.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the balance of the evidence adduced by the Parties militates against the Claimant\u2019s contention that \"[t]he record indicates that the bulk of the taking took place in 1998, that is, after GEA had acquired control of KCH.\"142 To the contrary, the Tribunal considers that the evidence adduced proves that the \"bulk of the taking\" in fact took place in 1997, before GEA had acquired control of KCH. This being said, the Tribunal is willing to give GEA the benefit of the doubt that, though not the bulk, at least some of the taking took place after GEA had gained control of KCH.\n\nReply, \u00b6 99.\n\n193.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the Claimant did have an interest in the alleged investment when the purported treaty violation occurred under this heading, and the Tribunal accordingly has jurisdiction to hear claims arising in connection therewith.\n\n194.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal emphasises that the sole question in this context is whether it can entertain a claim based on Ukraine\u2019s alleged behaviour in connection with the taking of the Products; the Tribunal reaches no conclusion regarding whether such behaviour, if it occurred, actually amounted to a treaty violation.\n\n195.\n\n(ii) *Alleged Failure to Investigate Shooting.* With respect to Ukraine\u2019s alleged failure to investigate and prosecute the shooting of Dr Chperoun, Ukraine argues that this incident was not Ukraine\u2019s fault and, in any event, it took place in December 1997, prior to the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment in Ukraine.143\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 155.\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimant does not contest Ukraine\u2019s position that the shooting of Dr Chperoun took place in December 1997. However, the Claimant specifies that it does not assert \"that Ukraine\u2019s agents shot Dr Chperoun,\" but rather that Ukraine failed to investigate and prosecute the shooting beyond December 1997.144\n\nReply, \u00b6 97\n\n197.\n\nThe Respondent answers that this incident appears to have been carried out by \"criminal elements\" and is, therefore, not attributable to Ukraine. In any event, the Respondent generally contends that the Claimant\u2019s claims cannot be heard because they \"all relate directly or indirectly to its allegation that the Respondent expropriated products allegedly belonging to the Claimant.\"145\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 245; Rejoinder, \u00b6 177.\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant\u2019s assertion focuses not on the shooting of Dr Chperoun in December 1997, but rather on the behaviour of Ukraine thereafter. The Claimant therefore makes an allegation of a treaty violation that, on its face, would have occurred after it had gained an interest in the Conversion Contract. While the Tribunal agrees with Ukraine that this allegation relates to the alleged taking of the bulk of the Claimant\u2019s products in 1997, it is nonetheless a separate contention. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that it may hear claims related to this alleged violation in these proceedings.\n\n199.\n\nIn this connection, once again, the Tribunal emphasises that the sole question in this context is whether it can entertain a claim based on Ukraine\u2019s alleged behaviour following the shooting of Dr Chperoun; the Tribunal reaches no conclusion regarding whether the alleged behaviour actually occurred, and if it occurred, whether it amounted to a treaty violation.\n\n200.\n\n(iii & iv) *Alleged Failure to Recognise ICC Award/GEA\u2019s Claim in Bankruptcy.* With respect to Ukraine\u2019s alleged failure to recognise and enforce the ICC Award and Ukraine\u2019s alleged failure to recognise GEA\u2019s claims in bankruptcy proceedings, the Claimant alleges that the former occurred over the course of 2003 - 2004, while the courts\u2019 refusal to accept GEA\u2019s claims in bankruptcy occurred over the period 2003 -2005.146\n\nReply, \u00b6 96.\n\n201.\n\nHere, Ukraine generally contends that the Claimant\u2019s claims cannot be heard because they \"all relate directly or indirectly to its allegation that the Respondent expropriated products allegedly belonging to the Claimant.\"147\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 177.\n\n202.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, these purported violations, on their face, would have taken place after the Claimant had gained an interest in the Conversion Contract *(i.e.,* after 31 December 1997). Taking this into account, and to the extent that these purported violations also occurred before the Claimant lost its interest in the Conversion Contract on 30 June 2004, the Tribunal considers that it may hear claims related to these alleged violations in these proceedings.\n\n203.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal emphasises that the sole question in this context is whether it can entertain a claim based on Ukraine\u2019s alleged behaviour during the enforcement of the ICC Award and the bankruptcy proceedings; the Tribunal reaches no conclusion regarding whether such behaviour, if it occurred, actually amounted to a treaty violation.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, on the issue of timing alone (and without reference to the separate question as to the existence of, or nexus to, an \"investment\") the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction to entertain claims based on the alleged violations regarding the taking of the Claimant\u2019s Products; Ukraine\u2019s behaviour following Dr Chperoun\u2019s shooting and its behaviour in the enforcement of the ICC Award and in the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nVII. **Liability**\n------------------\n\n204.\n\nGEA claims that Ukraine has violated its obligations under the provisions of the BIT relating to expropriation; full protection and security; fair and equitable treatment; arbitrary and discriminatory measures; national treatment and most-favoured nation treatment; and adherence to obligations. The claims relating to each of these various provisions are discussed, in turn, in this section.\n\n205.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, in accordance with its decision in \u00b6 125 above, the Claimant does not have standing to bring claims arising out of the Conversion Contract that accrued after 30 June 2004. It is not clear to the Tribunal, which, if any, of the Claimant\u2019s claims arise after this date. Indeed, such has not been specified by either side over the course of these proceedings. Accordingly, out of an abundance of caution, the Tribunal will address the merits of all of the Claimant\u2019s claims in this section.\n\n206.\n\nSimilarly, for the sake of completeness only, the Tribunal also considers claims relating to the Settlement Agreement, the Repayment Agreement and the ICC Award, which the Tribunal has determined in \u00b6\u00b6 154 - 161 above did not constitute an \"investment\" in any event under the BIT or the ICSID Convention.\n\nA. Expropriation\n----------------\n\n207.\n\nArticle 4(2) of the BIT protects against expropriation, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\nInvestments by nationals or companies of either Contracting State may not, within the territory of the other Contracting State, be expropriated, nationalized or subjected to such other measures the effect of which would be tantamount to expropriation or nationalization except for the public interest and against compensation....\n\n*(1) The Parties\u2019 Positions*\n----------------------------\n\n208.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that (i) the misappropriation of Products and (ii) the failure of the Ukrainian courts to recognise and enforce the ICC Award constitute expropriations under Article 4(2) of the BIT for which Ukraine is responsible.\n\n209.\n\nThe Respondent denies having violated Article 4(2) of the BIT, stating that neither the alleged loss of Products nor the refusal of Ukrainian courts to recognise and enforce the ICC award constitute an expropriation by Ukraine of the Claimant\u2019s investment.148\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 179 - 180.\n\n*(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis*\n-----------------------------\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal will address the Parties\u2019 arguments regarding the two alleged expropriations in turn, before setting forth its conclusion.\n\n(i) The Misappropriation of the Products\n----------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the misappropriation of the 125,000 metric tons of its Products from the Oriana plant constituted an expropriation by Ukraine, rather than a private theft, because the taking could not have been effected without State support.149 In this regard, it has argued that various points evidence an expropriation on the part of Ukraine.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 157 - 158.\n\n212.\n\nBy contrast, the Respondent considers that the Claimant has failed to \"particularise the alleged misappropriation or the Respondent\u2019s alleged responsibility.\"150\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 205.\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully analysed each of the facts relied upon by the Claimant.\n\n214.\n\nFirst, the Claimant contends that GEA\u2019s managers, having spent considerable time with the managers of Oriana both before and after the revelation of the taking, were persuaded that these men were not thieves but were acting on orders from the Government.151 In this connection, the Claimant contends that the managers of Oriana, in contemporaneously memorialised conversations with GEA, indicated that they were acting on orders \"from Kiev\" in appropriating GEA\u2019s property.152\n\nReply, \u00b6 115.\n\nReply, \u00b6 115.\n\n215.\n\nThe Respondent rejects as flawed the Claimant\u2019s argument that because the Claimant\u2019s managers considered Oriana\u2019s managers to be honest, the misappropriation of the Products must have been undertaken on Government orders.153 The Respondent submits that even if Oriana\u2019s managers were honest, this does not exclude the possibility that criminal elements unconnected with the State, such as Oriana employees, were responsible for the losses.154\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 215.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 229 - 230.\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant has not met its burden of proof on this point. In truth, the Claimant has provided nothing more than a character assessment in support of its contention. In any event, even if the Tribunal were to accept the Claimant\u2019s contention, the Tribunal does not consider it sufficient to ground a holding that Ukraine was responsible for the conduct in question.\n\n217.\n\nSecond, the Claimant argues that the sheer quantity of property taken and its materiality \"tends to confirm\" the statements by Oriana managers that they were acting on orders from the State. In support of this, the Claimant contends that it is not possible to transport, market and recover the proceeds of the sale of material that would fill a train 50 kilometres long, without Government approval and the involvement of its officials.155\n\nReply, \u00b6 115.\n\n218.\n\nThe Respondent rejects as \"mere supposition\" the Claimant\u2019s allegation that the quantity of the Products taken was so great as to make it \"inconceivable\" that those responsible for the theft were acting without State approval.156 Further, the Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s contentions on this point are inconsistent with the Claimant\u2019s contemporaneous view that the losses may have occurred over a long period.157\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 211 ; Rejoinder, \u00b6 223.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 228.\n\n219.\n\nOnce again, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant has not met its burden of proof here. The Claimant has provided nothing more than speculation in support of this contention. In any event, even if the Tribunal were to accept the Claimant\u2019s contention, as before, the Tribunal does not consider that such contention is sufficient to allow a finding that Ukraine was itself responsible.\n\n220.\n\nThird, the Claimant submits that the conduct of Ukrainian Government officials was consistent with the taking, and inconsistent with a private theft. The Claimant contends that, had it been a private theft, the Government would have initiated an investigation and distanced itself from Oriana\u2019s managers. Instead, the Claimant observes that following the revelation of the taking, the Government and Oriana immediately acted as a single unit.158\n\nReply, \u00b6 115.\n\n221.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s contentions, noting that the Claimant itself never filed a criminal complaint in respect of the alleged misappropriation.159\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 212 - 214; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 225 - 227.\n\n222.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant has not met its burden of proof, and has again provided nothing more than speculation in support of this contention. In any event, even if the Tribunal were to accept the Claimant\u2019s contention, the Tribunal - again - does not consider that such contention could ground a holding as to Ukraine\u2019s responsibility.\n\n223.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that the German Government came to the same conclusion as GEA, *i.e.,* that the taking of GEA\u2019s property was attributable to Ukraine.160\n\nReply, \u00b6 115.\n\n224.\n\nIn response, the Respondent critically analyses the various statements of the German Government upon which the Claimant relies, and submits that the \"statements, allegedly made by junior or unnamed officials, are hearsay and the Respondent has absolutely no way of determining on what basis they were formulated.\"161\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 231.\n\n225.\n\nAs with each of the previous points, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant has not met its burden of proof. The fact that certain German Government officials may have come to the same conclusion as the Claimant is not evidence that can, on its own, support a finding by this Tribunal as to Ukraine\u2019s responsibility.\n\n226.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant has not met its burden of proving that Ukraine expropriated the Claimant\u2019s property through the alleged taking of GEA\u2019s Products. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant\u2019s contentions under this heading.\n\n(ii) The Non-Enforcement of the ICC Award\n-----------------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Ukrainian courts rendered \"a travesty of justice in applying a discriminatory law to avoid enforcement of GEA\u2019s Award under the New York Convention,\" such that \"their refusal to recognize GEA\u2019s ICC Award is tantamount to an expropriation.\"162\n\nReply, \u00b6 161.\n\n228.\n\nIn particular, the Claimant invokes the award of the ICSID tribunal in *Saipem S.p.A, v. The People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh,* in support of its position that \"[n]on-recognition decisions rendered on grossly illegitimate grounds are tantamount to expropriation.\"163\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Award, 30 June 2009; Reply, \u00b6 148.\n\n229.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Ukrainian courts\u2019 refusal to recognise and enforce the ICC Award does not constitute an expropriation, but was rather done \"in accordance with Ukrainian law and the New York Convention.\"164\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 218.\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent argues that a finding that \"a domestic court\u2019s refusal to recognise and enforce an arbitral award under the New York Convention\" constitutes an expropriation under international law would create an appellate jurisdiction for the recognition and enforcement of awards, which \"would undermine the present international legal system for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards.\"165\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 219.\n\n231.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the ICC Award did not itself constitute an \"investment,\" this claim must fail. However, even if the Tribunal had concluded differently on the \"investment\" issue, the overall result would have been the same.\n\n232.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to the *Saipem* award, which forms the basis of the Claimant\u2019s claim under this heading.\n\n233.\n\nIn *Saipem,* the Bangladeshi courts annulled an ICC Award in Saipem\u2019s favour. In \u00b6 133 of its award, the tribunal stated that setting aside an arbitral award cannot, in and of itself, amount to an expropriation:\n\n[T]he Tribunal agrees with the parties that the substantial deprivation of Saipem\u2019s ability to enjoy the benefits of the ICC Award is not sufficient to conclude that the Bangladeshi courts\u2019 intervention is tantamount to an expropriation. If this were true, any setting aside of an award could then found a claim for expropriation, even if the setting aside was ordered by the competent state court upon legitimate grounds.\n\n234.\n\nThe tribunal then concluded that, based on the circumstances of that case, the nonenforcement of the ICC Award amounted to an expropriation due to the particularly egregious nature of the acts of the Bangladeshi courts.\n\n235.\n\nThe Claimant attempts in this case to deploy this standard, contending that Ukraine committed \"a travesty of justice in applying a discriminatory law to avoid enforcement of GEA\u2019s Award.\"\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with this characterisation. Even assuming (contrary to its earlier finding) that the ICC Award could somehow qualify as an \"investment,\" the Claimant has provided the Tribunal with no reason to believe that the courts of Ukraine were \"applying a discriminatory law,\" only that the Ukrainian courts came to a conclusion different to that which GEA had hoped. Moreover, contrary to *Saipem,* the Tribunal has been presented with no evidence that the actions taken by the Ukrainian courts were \"egregious\" in any way; that they amounted to anything other than the application of Ukrainian law; or that they were somehow deliberately taken to thwart GEA\u2019s ability to recover on the ICC Award.\n\n237.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal does not consider that the non-enforcement of the ICC Award amounts to an expropriation, and rejects the Claimant\u2019s contentions under this heading.\n\n(iii) Conclusion\n----------------\n\n238.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that Ukraine has not committed any expropriation in connection with the misappropriation of the Products, or its courts\u2019 treatment of the ICC Award. Therefore, the Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim fails.\n\nB. Full Protection and Security\n-------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the BIT guarantees full protection and security to investments:\n\nInvestments by nationals or companies of either Contracting State shall enjoy full protection and security within the territory of the other Contracting State.\n\n*(1) The Parties\u2019 Positions*\n----------------------------\n\n240.\n\nGEA claims that Ukraine\u2019s failure to punish certain criminal acts constitutes a failure to provide full protection and security to GEA\u2019s investment. Specifically, GEA alleges that (i) the unpunished theft of GEA\u2019s Products; (ii) Ukraine\u2019s failure to respond to the shooting of Dr Chperoun; and (iii) the unpunished misrepresentations by Mr Sljuzar as to his status as President of Oriana constitute violations under Article 4(1) of the BIT for which Ukraine is responsible.166\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 167.\n\n241.\n\nUkraine alleges that the Claimant has failed to tie its full protection and security allegations to the wording of Article 4(1) of the BIT, which provides for protection of \"[i]nvestments by nationals or companies of either Contracting State.\"167 It is Ukraine\u2019s position that the Claimant has not established that any of the alleged violations relate to the protection or security of an investment.168\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 268.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 268.\n\n*(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis*\n-----------------------------\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal will address the Parties\u2019 arguments regarding the three alleged violations of the full protection and security standard in turn, before setting forth its conclusion.\n\n(i) The unpunished theft of GEA\u2019s Products\n------------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimant claims that GEA\u2019s Products were \"the subject of a taking by the State,\" and that even if private individuals stole for their personal benefit, \"the State\u2019s inaction in the face of these events itself constitutes a violation of the Treaty.\" In the Claimant\u2019s view, the fact that \"a whole range of Ukrainian State officials were aware of the theft and acknowledged that compensation was due to GEA, yet did absolutely nothing to punish or take disciplinary actions against the persons involved constitutes a blatant breach by Ukraine of the full protection and security standard.\"169\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 176 - 177.\n\n244.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s allegations, arguing that there is no evidence here that the authorities in Ukraine were aware of the alleged taking prior to being informed of it.170 In addition, Ukraine states that the Claimant \"cannot now object to the fact that there was no ensuing criminal investigation,\" given that KCH itself made no criminal complaint at the relevant time.171\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 236 - 238.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 239 - 240.\n\n245.\n\nIn response, the Claimant contends that its own decision not to initiate any criminal complaints is irrelevant to the question whether Ukraine breached its obligation to accord full protection and security.172 The Claimant further alleges that \"it was the Ukrainian Government itself that dissuaded GEA from filing such a complaint,\" and that Ukraine\u2019s promises that GEA would be compensated for the loss of Products induced GEA to believe that it was unnecessary to file a criminal complaint.173\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 181 - 183.\n\nReply, \u00b6 183.\n\n246.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, no matter under what legal standard the question is examined, the Claimant\u2019s contentions under this heading must fail.\n\n247.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s case on this issue entails a fundamental double standard. Over the course of its contractual relationship with Oriana, GEA never considered it necessary to file a criminal complaint for the taking of its Products. Yet within the context of this arbitration, GEA now insists that Ukraine has breached its violations under the BIT for doing the very same.\n\n248.\n\nWhat is more, GEA argues as it does in the face of evidence that directly contradicts its allegations, namely that it did not file a criminal complaint because Ukraine dissuaded it from doing so. To the contrary, Ukraine made clear that the issues between KCH and Oriana did not involve the State at all, and that any criminal complaints should be filed by KCH or Oriana. Indeed, in the protocol of a meeting held between the Ukrainian Government, the German ambassador and representatives of GEA on 27 August 1998, Ukraine\u2019s Vice Minister President indicated, with respect to KCH\u2019s problems, that:174\n\n[T]his is an issue solely between KCH and Oriana. He recommends to initiate criminal proceedings against the guilty parties.\n\nC-0065.\n\n249.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, overall, that Ukraine\u2019s conduct in response to the taking of GEA\u2019s Products does not amount to a violation of its obligations under Article 4(1) of the BIT regarding full protection and security to investments.\n\n(ii) Ukraine\u2019s alleged failure to respond to the shooting of Dr Chperoun\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Ukraine was aware of the shooting of Dr Chperoun, but did not initiate any investigation or undertake any other action \"with respect to this criminal offence.\" The Claimant submits that this amounts to a breach of Ukraine\u2019s obligation under Article 4(1) of the BIT.175\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 185 - 187.\n\n251.\n\nThe Respondent contends that \"the shooting of Dr Chperoun did not concern an investment by the Claimant,\" as required by Article 4(1) of the BIT.176\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 270.\n\n252.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent contends that the \"Claimant has not provided and is unable to provide any evidence that the police authorities of the Respondent could in any way have prevented the shooting of Dr Chperoun.\"177 Further, the Respondent refers to a letter from the Lviv prosecutor\u2019s office that indicates that the shooting was investigated but that the crime remained unsolved.178\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 246.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 285.\n\n253.\n\nEven if (which is doubtful) Dr Chperoun\u2019s shooting could be construed as an event that concerned an \"investment\" *(i.e.,* the Conversion Contract), and no matter under what legal standard this question is examined, the Claimant\u2019s contentions under this heading must fail. The record disproves the Claimant\u2019s contention that Ukraine did not initiate any investigation or undertake any other action with respect to this criminal offence.\n\n254.\n\nSpecifically, the Tribunal refers to the letter from the Lviv prosecutor\u2019s office dated 11 June 2010 addressed to the Deputy Minister of Justice regarding, among other things, the shooting of Dr Chperoun. That letter clearly indicates that the shooting of Dr Chperoun was investigated, but remains unsolved:179\n\nAt the same time it was found out that on December 10, 1997, the Investigation Unit of the Frankivskyi District Department of the Lviv Municipal Office of the Main Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine in Lviv Oblast initiated the criminal case with regard to the infliction of grave bodily injuries to V.M. [Chperoun], Vice-President of Sirka association, who was also the representative of Kl\u00f4ckner & Co. Aktiengesellschaft, according to the elements of crime envisaged by part 1 of Article 101 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (1960 version). During the pre-trial investigation in the case it was established that on December 9, 1997 an unknown person gave a gunshot wound in the left hip by three shots through the window of the first floor of building No. 98 located at Konovalets street in Lviv.\n\nOn December 15, 1997 the prosecutor of Frankivsk district of Lviv city re-interpreted the crime in the abovementioned criminal case according to Art. 17, Art. 93 clause \"e\" of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (in the wording of 1960) and it was accepted for proceedings by the investigator of the abovementioned prosecutor's office. V.M. [Chperoun], the injured person, was questioned during a pre-trial investigation and stated that to his mind the criminal could kill him, however, he did not shoot in vital organs deliberately. V.M. [Chperoun] does not suspect anybody in commitment of the crime.\n\nOn July 24, 2007 the abovementioned criminal case was forwarded to the Investigation Unit of the Frankivskyi District Department of the Lviv Municipal Office of the Main Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine in Lviv Oblast for further investigation. In spite of measures taken during pre-trial investigation at present the crime remains unsolved.\n\nR-0060.\n\n255.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that, even if the shooting could be considered as related to an investment, Ukraine\u2019s treatment of the shooting of Dr Chperoun does not amount to a violation of its obligations under Article 4(1) of the BIT regarding full protection and security to investments.\n\n(iii) The unpunished misrepresentations by Mr Sljuzar\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Ukraine violated its obligations of full protection and security with respect to Mr Sljuzar\u2019s execution of the Repayment Agreement *(see \u00b6\u00b6* 54 - 67 above).\n\n257.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Mr Sljuzar had the authority - and was represented as having the authority - to sign the Repayment Agreement. The Claimant contends that Oriana\u2019s indications to the contrary in enforcement proceedings concerning the ICC Award were falsehoods that Ukraine, as Oriana\u2019s parent, never tried to correct.180\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 189 - 190.\n\n258.\n\nFurther, the Claimant submits that if Mr Sljuzar in fact had no authority but nonetheless signed the Repayment Agreement on behalf of Oriana, then Oriana made a misrepresentation to GEA to sign the Repayment Agreement, and that Ukraine - as sole shareholder and party responsible for electing and empowering a duly authorised president of Oriana - \"was complicit in such misrepresentation through its silence and acquiescence.\"181\n\nReply, \u00b6 191.\n\n259.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that in either scenario, Ukraine should have initiated investigations and prosecuted wrongdoings \"with respect to these criminal offences.\"182\n\nReply, \u00b6 193.\n\n260.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s allegation regarding the failure to prosecute Mr Sljuzar \"clearly does not concern the protection or security of an investment\" and, therefore, falls outside the scope of Article 4(1) of the BIT.183\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 272.\n\n261.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent states that if any misrepresentation was made by Mr Sljuzar regarding his status, such misrepresentation was not a criminal matter, and the Respondent could not have prevented the making of the misrepresentation if such was made.184\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 248.\n\n262.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, regardless of whether the actions of Mr Sljuzar could be said to concern the protection or security of an \"investment\" (as to which, see \u00b6\u00b6 154 \u2014 157), the Claimant\u2019s claim under this heading fails. The Claimant\u2019s attempts to make Ukraine liable for the actions of Oriana cannot stand in light of the record, which makes clear that Oriana was a separate legal entity, acting entirely in a commercial capacity, for which Ukraine was not responsible.\n\n263.\n\nIn a meeting on 27 August 1998 between representatives of the Governments of Ukraine and Germany and representatives of Metallgesellschaft, Vice Minister President Tyhypko made clear that Claimant\u2019s problems were \"an issue solely between KCH and Oriana.\"185\n\nC-0065.\n\n264.\n\nClaimant understood this. Indeed, in his notes of 9 December 1998 on the status of negotiations between KCH, Oriana and Ukraine, Dr D\u00f4ss wrote that:186\n\nIn this context, the Ukrainian side emphasised repeatedly that Oriana was an independent legal entity for the transgressions of which Ukraine was not responsible. This position was also articulated on August 27, 1998 by [Vice] Minister President Tyhypko during a meeting with the German ambassador and members of the board of management of Metallgesellschaft AG.\n\nC-0063.\n\n265.\n\nTaking into account that the Repayment Agreement was signed on 29 September 1998 and that the Vice Minister President of Ukraine informed GEA of Oriana\u2019s independence from Ukraine as early as a month before, the Tribunal considers that there are no grounds to accept the Claimant\u2019s argument that Ukraine was responsible for Mr Sjulzar\u2019s \"unauthorised\" signing of the Repayment Agreement.187\n\nThe Respondent has referred to other documents that also provide evidence that Ukraine was not responsible for Oriana. See, e.g., C-0016 (minutes of a meeting dated 13 August 1998, confirming that any debt under the Conversion Contract was Oriana\u2019s alone); C-0023 (minutes of a meeting dated 23 February 1999, confirming the same); R-0011 (letter dated 4 September 2000 from the Ministry of Finance to the State Property Fund, confirming that Ukraine was only liable for loans guaranteed by the Government and that all other issues of private debts were to be settled between Claimant and Oriana before the courts).\n\n266.\n\nAccordingly, even if the Repayment Agreement could be considered as an investment, the Tribunal concludes that Ukraine\u2019s treatment of Mr Sljuzar does not amount to a violation of its obligations under Article 4(1) of the BIT regarding full protection and security to investments.\n\n(iv) Conclusion\n---------------\n\n267.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that there are no grounds to hold Ukraine liable for violating its obligations under Article 4(1) of the BIT to accord the Claimant\u2019s investment full protection and security, whether it be with respect to the unpunished theft of GEA\u2019s Products; Ukraine\u2019s alleged failure to respond to the shooting of Dr Chperoun; or the unpunished alleged misrepresentations of Mr Sljuzar.\n\nC. Fair and Equitable Treatment\n-------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nArticle 2(1) of the BIT provides the following guarantee of fair and equitable treatment:\n\nEither Contracting State shall, if possible, promote within its territory investments by nationals or companies of the other Contracting State and shall permit such investments in accordance with its legislation. It shall in any case grant investments fair and equitable treatment.\n\n*(1) The Parties\u2019 Positions*\n----------------------------\n\n269.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent has violated its obligations to provide fair and equitable treatment to GEA\u2019s investment in Ukraine by (i) failing to keep its promise to repay GEA for property wrongfully taken; (ii) thwarting GEA\u2019s expectation to recover the amount Oriana owed to it during the bankruptcy proceedings; and (iii) not supporting the enforcement of the ICC Award before the Ukrainian courts, leading to a denial of justice.\n\n270.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that the Claimant had a legitimate expectation that Ukraine would pay for its property or that it would recover in bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has not been denied justice by the Ukrainian courts.\n\n271.\n\nBoth Parties have pleaded their respective claims and defences relating to fair and equitable treatment under Article 2(1) of the BIT in terms of whether GEA\u2019s \"legitimate expectations\" have been protected.188\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 171; Reply \u00b6\u00b6 197 et seq.; see generally, Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 249, et seq.\n\n*(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis*\n-----------------------------\n\n(i) Ukraine\u2019s alleged promise to repay GEA for property wrongfully taken\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nFirst, GEA contends that Ukraine violated GEA\u2019s legitimate expectations that Ukraine would keep its promise that GEA would be repaid within a reasonable time for the property taken.189\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 172.\n\n273.\n\nUkraine disagrees, arguing that this is simply a reiteration of the expropriation claim and should accordingly be rejected.190\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 288.\n\n274.\n\nUkraine further argues with respect to \"alleged promises made by or on behalf of the Respondent\" that (i) the documentary record shows that the Respondent considered that any obligation to pay KCH for missing products lay with Oriana191; (ii) \"the Claimant purchased the KCH shares long before any of the statements relied on by the Claimant were made\"192; and (iii) \"the losses which the Claimant claims do not relate to any shipments that the Claimant/KCH may have made subsequent to the July-August meetings.\"193\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 273 - 274; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 294 - 308.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 275.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 321.\n\n275.\n\nGEA rebuts the Respondent\u2019s contentions, arguing that the key question is not when Ukraine made its representations, but whether GEA \"change[d] [its] position based on the undertakings at issue.\"194\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 231 -233.\n\n276.\n\nIn response, Ukraine argues that the \"Claimant assumed... a substantial risk when it made its alleged investment in Ukraine\" with respect to Oriana\u2019s financial situation, and that this assumption of risk evidences the \"lack of basis in the Claimant\u2019s claim that its investment suffered unfair and inequitable treatment.\"195\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 277 - 283.\n\n277.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed all the documents upon which the Claimant relies for the proposition that Ukraine made a promise to repay the Claimant for the lost Products. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is entirely unclear from the documents that Ukraine in fact made any such promises to the Claimant, or failed to keep any promises made.\n\n278.\n\nFor example, the Claimant refers to the record of a meeting held on July 10, 1998 in Frankfurt. According to the Claimant, this record evidences that the Ukrainian Government promised that specialists would promptly \"work out\" the amount of misappropriated property and \"[t]he form in which repayment is made and the corresponding timetable will also be worked out by the end of July. The Ukrainian side and [GEA] will make the final decision on this problem on 1 August.\"196 However, the Tribunal struggles to see how Ukraine\u2019s promise to \"work out\" the amount of misappropriated property and a payment timetable could amount to a promise to pay, particularly in light of the Parties\u2019 indication that they would \"make a final decision on this problem\" at a later date.\n\nReply, \u00b6 221, quoting from Protocol of a meeting between representatives of the Ukrainian Government, Oriana, BV and KCH signed only by the Ukrainian side on 10 July 1998 (C-0012).\n\n279.\n\nThe Claimant further relies on a letter dated 31 July 1998 from Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Economy, which reads: \"[r]egarding the missing quantities identified after the inventory at WAT \u2018ORIANA\u2019, we recommend the preparation of an inventory record..., which must then be signed by both contract partners. Immediately upon submission of this record at the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry will take control of the missing quantities noted during the inventory.\"197 Here, too, the Tribunal fails to understand how a recommendation to prepare an inventory and a promise to \"take control of the missing quantities\" could add up to a promise on the part of Ukraine to make any sort of payment to GEA. This is all the more so, taking into account that in that same letter, the Ministry of Economy specified that \"[a]ccording to the Ukrainian Law \u2018On entrepreneurial activities\u2019 *the government is not permitted to interfere with the business activities of single companies.\"* (emphasis added)\n\nReply, \u00b6 222, quoting from Fax from the Ukrainian Ministry for Economy to GEA dated 31 July 1998 (C-0010).\n\n280.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant relies on the fact that the 10 July 1998 meeting and the 31 July 1998 letter were followed by the conclusion of the Settlement Agreement on 7 August 1998. In this respect, the Claimant contends that it \"legitimately understood.\n\n... that the Settlement Agreement was the direct consequence of Ukraine\u2019s earlier promises.\"198 The Tribunal considers the signing of the Settlement Agreement to be of no help to the Claimant\u2019s position. Not only were there no \"earlier promises\" from Ukraine, but the Settlement Agreement itself does not include Ukraine as a party - it is only between KCH and Oriana, which Ukraine had always made clear was a separate legal entity *(see* \u00b6 263 above).199\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 223 -225.\n\nC-0015.\n\n281.\n\nThe Claimant also refers to the record of a meeting held on 13 August 1998 between representatives of the Ukrainian Government, Oriana and GEA, which, according to GEA, \"records specific obligations of the State, including an express undertaking that \u2018the Ministry of Industrial Policy would ensure that the provisions of the protocol would be fulfilled by the Ukrainian party.\u2019\"200 While it does indeed seem that the Ministry of Industrial Policy made such an undertaking, the Tribunal notes that the undertaking in question only related to the protocol of that particular meeting which, as the Claimant admits, concerned GEA\u2019s \"future dealings with Oriana, including the execution of pledge agreements and the termination of the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings against Oriana.\"201 In other words, no promises were made, in the terms now asserted by the Claimant, that Ukraine would pay GEA for the lost Products.\n\nReply, \u00b6 226, quoting from Protocol of a meeting between representatives of the Ukrainian and German Governments dated 13 August 1998 (C-0016).\n\nReply, \u00b6 226.\n\n282.\n\nFinally, the Claimant refers to the record of a 27 August 1998 meeting between representatives of GEA and Ukraine and the ambassador of Germany, where Vice Prime Minister Tyhypko stated that \"he understands that Oriana\u2019s high debt level deters investors. Ukraine will do its part to resolve the problem.\"202 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Vice Prime Minister\u2019s words cannot be read as a promise that Ukraine would pay for GEA\u2019s lost Products, particularly taking into account that he is recorded in the same document as saying that \"[a]s for KCH\u2019s problem... this is an issue solely between KCH and Oriana.\"\n\nReply, \u00b6 228, quoting Protocol of a meeting between representatives of the Ukrainian and German Governments, Oriana and MG dated 27 August 1998 (C-0065).\n\n283.\n\nOverall, the Tribunal finds that, even on the assumption that there existed a relevant \"investment\" for the purposes of this claim, there is no basis on the record before it to find that Ukraine breached its obligation to give GEA\u2019s investment fair and equitable treatment, by failing to fulfil a promise to pay for the lost Products, as no such promise was ever made.\n\n(ii) Ukraine\u2019s alleged thwarting of GEA\u2019s expectation to recover the amount Oriana owed to it during bankruptcy proceedings\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nGEA argues that Ukraine violated GEA\u2019s reasonable expectations that GEA would be able to recover the monies Oriana owed to it in bankruptcy proceedings. In response, Ukraine submits that GEA cannot have had a legitimate expectation that the debt would be recovered in the bankruptcy, given the Claimant\u2019s knowledge of Oriana\u2019s financial situation.203\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 288; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 323 - 325.\n\n285.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, the Respondent made repayment impossible, in violation of Article 2(1) of the BIT, because (i) the Respondent never terminated the bankruptcy proceedings initiated by Shelton, as promised; (ii) the Respondent allowed the transfer of Oriana shares to Shelton; and (iii) once Shelton\u2019s custody of Oriana ended, Oriana\u2019s assets were stripped *(see* \u00b6 50 above). The Tribunal will deal with each of these points in turn, before setting forth (iv) its conclusion.\n\n286.\n\n(i) *Alleged Promises by Ukraine to Terminate the Bankruptcy Proceedings.* With respect to the bankruptcy proceedings brought by Shelton, the Claimant contends that shortly after Shelton commenced bankruptcy proceedings against Oriana in July 1998, \"Ukraine made specific representations and undertakings to GEA that the bankruptcy proceedings against Oriana would be terminated and that GEA would be repaid\" the amount owed by Oriana.204 The Respondent denies that Ukraine made any \"unqualified undertaking\" of this nature and denies the Claimant\u2019s claim in its entirety.205\n\nReply, \u00b6 238.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 332.\n\n287.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed all the documents upon which the Claimant relies for the proposition that Ukraine made a promise to terminate the bankruptcy proceedings. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is entirely unclear from the documents that Ukraine in fact made any promises to the Claimant, or reneged upon any promises made.\n\n288.\n\nFor example, the Claimant relies on a letter dated 31 July 1998 from the Ukrainian Ministry of Industrial Policy, which states that \"the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine will pass a document which, under current Ukrainian law, will cancel these bankruptcy proceedings.\"206 Similarly, the Claimant relies on the protocol of a meeting between representatives of the Ukrainian Government, Oriana and Metallgesellschaft dated 13 August 1998, in which Ukrainian officials are recorded as stating that \"[t]he Ukrainian party shall carry out all acts permitted by applicable legislation of Ukraine in order to terminate the bankruptcy proceedings pending against JSC \u2018Oriana.\u2019\"207\n\nReply, \u00b6 240, quoting Letter from the Ukrainian Ministry for Industrial Policy to Metallgesellschaft dated 31 July 1998 (C-0014).\n\nReply, \u00b6 241, quoting Protocol of a meeting between representatives of the Ukrainian Government, Oriana and Metallgesellschaft dated 13 August 1998 (C-0016).\n\n289.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant refers to the protocol of a meeting between representatives of the Ukrainian and the German Governments, Oriana and Metallgesellschaft dated 27 August 1998, in which the Vice Minister President Tyhypko was recorded as stating that \"[t]he bankruptcy proceeding will be terminated in any event. In case of doubt, Ukraine would be prepared to satisfy Shelton\u2019s claims against Oriana through state funds.\"208\n\nReply, \u00b6 242, quoting Protocol of a meeting between representatives of the Ukrainian and the German Governments, Oriana and MG dated 27 August 1998 (C-0065).\n\n290.\n\nIn response, the Respondent submits that these statements do not amount to unconditional promises, but rather demonstrate that \"the Ukrainian Government officials had emphasised to the Claimant and KCH that Ukrainian law governed the question of the termination of the bankruptcy proceedings and that any termination could only be carried out to the extent permitted by Ukrainian law.\"209\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 327.\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the statements made by the Respondent cannot be read as unconditional promises for payment. At most, these statements, taken together, may be read as Ukraine engaging to use its best efforts to assist in bringing the bankruptcy proceedings to an end within the scope of Ukrainian law.\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s understanding is supported by documents that indicate that the Claimant understood the Respondent\u2019s statements the same way. For example, it is recorded in the minutes of a presentation to the Claimant\u2019s board on 10 August 1998 that \"[t]he government allegedly has no influence on the suspension of the bankruptcy proceeding. This would have to be stopped directly by Oriana.\"210 Moreover, the Claimant itself lodged a bankruptcy petition in the Shelton bankruptcy proceedings on 20 August 1998, which is evidence that the Claimant did not expect Ukraine to stop them.211\n\nR-0041.\n\nC-0168.\n\n293.\n\nAccordingly, assessing all the evidence, and again on the assumption that there existed a relevant \"investment\" for the purposes of this claim, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent did not make any promises to the Claimant that it would terminate the Shelton bankruptcy proceedings and, therefore, did not violate Article 2(1) of the BIT on this basis.\n\n294.\n\n(ii) *Shelton\u2019s Control over Oriana\u2019s Assets.* The Claimant objects to the fact that, on 19 October 1998, the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers issued a decree, allowing the transfer of the majority of Oriana\u2019s share capital to Shelton. The Claimant argues that this transfer was in violation of the Respondent\u2019s obligation to give fair and equitable treatment to the Claimant\u2019s investment, as Shelton was given preference over other creditors in the face of the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectation that \"one creditor would not be granted a majority interest in Oriana and control over all its assets without notice, a hearing or any other manifestation of due process.\"212\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 244 - 248.\n\n295.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the appointment of Shelton as custodian of Oriana did not amount to a breach of the BIT, as it was done in accordance with Ukrainian law. In any event, the Respondent notes that Shelton\u2019s custodianship ended in July 1999, and denies that Shelton\u2019s control over Oriana caused any prejudice to the Claimant:\n\n\"[a] creditor of Oriana which had commenced bankruptcy proceedings was simply appointed the temporary custodian of Oriana for a limited period of time.\"213\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 303; Rejoinder, \u00b6 335.\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal has been presented with no evidence that Ukraine somehow \"gave preference\" to Shelton by granting it temporary custodianship of Oriana between October 1998 and July 1999. What is more, the Claimant has not denied the Respondent\u2019s contentions that Shelton\u2019s appointment as custodian was carried out in accordance with Ukrainian law, and has not demonstrated that any damage resulted from this short-term custodianship.\n\n297.\n\nIn light of this, assuming there existed a relevant \"investment,\" the Tribunal concludes that whatever control the Respondent gave to Shelton over Oriana\u2019s assets did not violate the Respondent\u2019s obligations to give the Claimant\u2019s investment fair and equitable treatment under Article 2(1) of the BIT.\n\n298.\n\n(iii) *The Alleged Stripping of Oriana\u2019s Assets.* The Claimant contends that Ukraine violated GEA\u2019s reasonable expectations that Oriana\u2019s assets would not be granted to a new legal entity without making provision for payment of Oriana\u2019s debts to GEA.214\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 173.\n\n299.\n\nIn this respect, GEA refers to representations made by Ukrainian Government officials during a meeting on 24 August 1999, in which GEA and others were told that a new entity - namely, a new petrochemical joint venture - would repay debts owing to GEA on a priority basis.215 According to the Claimant, however, the resolution subsequently issued by the Cabinet of Ministers on 10 August 2000 \"did not provide for repayment of debts to GEA, and instead only provided for the repayment of debts of Oriana that the State had specifically guaranteed.\"216\n\nReply, \u00b6 252.\n\nReply, \u00b6 253.\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, thereafter, a tender was organised to find an investor for the joint venture, pursuant to which Lux oil Petrochemical was selected instead of GEA. The Claimant explains that following this, a subsidiary of Oriana - Lukor -was created, to which Oriana transferred its petrochemical complex as its contribution to the joint entity. The Claimant submits that, as a result of this transfer, the Claimant was left to attempt to enforce its debt against an entity with few assets but substantial liabilities.217\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 250-261.\n\n301.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that on 10 August 2009, the Cabinet of Ministers issued a resolution that provided that the BV loan to Oriana should be repaid by the new petrochemical venture *(see* \u00b6 48 above). However, the Respondent disputes that the purported meeting on 24 August 1999 could have given rise to a legitimate expectation on the Claimant\u2019s part that any new petrochemical company would assume all of Oriana\u2019s debts, including the KCH debt.218\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 338 - 339.\n\n302.\n\nFurther, the Respondent submits that the creation of Lukor \"did not have the effect of somehow defrauding Oriana\u2019s creditors, which could and did continue to maintain their claims against Oriana after Lukoil\u2019s participation.\" The Respondent maintains that the shares held by Oriana in Lukor \"represented a valuable asset\" and that \"if KCH had been able to enforce its debt against Oriana, it could still have done so.\" Thus, \"the facts complained of had no material effect on the Claimant\u2019s position.\"219\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 316-318.\n\n303.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is a mischaracterisation to describe Oriana\u2019s part-privatisation as \"asset stripping.\" To the contrary, Oriana retained a 50% interest in the new company, Lukor, valued at approximately US$ 300,000,000.220 What is more, Oriana\u2019s creditors could and did continue to maintain their claims against Oriana after the part-privatisation221, and the Tribunal has been presented with no basis to conclude that the Claimant could not have done the same.\n\nC-0029.\n\n*Id.*\n\n304.\n\nAccordingly, on the basis of all the evidence, and again assuming there existed a relevant \"investment\" for the purposes of this claim, the Tribunal concludes that Ukraine did not violate GEA\u2019s reasonable or legitimate expectations regarding the placement of Oriana\u2019s assets and the repayment of its debts to GEA.\n\n305.\n\n(iv) *Conclusion.* In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that there is no basis in the record to find that Ukraine breached its obligation to give GEA\u2019s investment fair and equitable treatment, in relation to GEA\u2019s expectation to recover the amount Oriana owed to it during bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n(iii) Ukraine\u2019s alleged failure to support the enforcement of the ICC Award before the Ukrainian courts, leading to a denial of justice\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Ukraine\u2019s actions or omissions led to a denial of justice on two fronts, namely (i) the non-recognition of the ICC Award; and (ii) the legal proceedings relating to the bankruptcy proceedings initiated by Pryvatbank.\n\n307.\n\n(i) *The Non-Recognition of the ICC Award.* As regards the ICC Award, GEA\u2019s claim can be summed up as follows:222\n\nGEA could and did reasonably expect that the Ukrainian courts would respect fundamental principles of due process and international law applicable to the enforcement and recognition of arbitration awards, and that the Ukrainian State would support, as it had promised, and not oppose the recognition of an award for a debt that it had repeatedly promised would be paid in the past. GEA could and did reasonably expect that the Ukrainian courts, if they were to take the extraordinary step of refusing enforcement of an award under the New York Convention, would at least address the arbitral tribunal\u2019s grounds for finding an agreement to arbitrate to exist - grounds reiterated by GEA in its application. The Ukrainian judgments offend any sense of judicial propriety.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 174.\n\n308.\n\nThe Respondent replies that to the extent that the Claimant\u2019s denial of justice claim is based upon the refusal of Ukrainian courts to recognise and enforce the ICC Award, it is a claim based on \"substantive denial of justice.\" The Respondent denies that the Ukrainian courts misapplied Ukrainian law, and in any event states that the \"Claimant has been unable to cite any modem jurisprudence in which the misapplication of national substantive law by a domestic court has been deemed to constitute a denial of justice in public international law\" because \"no such jurisprudence exists.\" Further, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to establish that the Tribunal has jurisdiction that would allow \"the re-examination of issues of Ukrainian substantive law.\"223\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 336.\n\n309.\n\nTo the extent that the Claimant\u2019s allegations regarding the ICC Award are procedural in nature, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the Ukrainian courts did not address all of GEA\u2019s arguments. The Respondent submits that there is no obligation under international law requiring courts to address in their decisions every argument made by the Parties. The obligation is to provide reasons for decision, and the Respondent states that this obligation was met. In any event, the Ukrainian courts did address the question of the existence of the arbitration clause, contrary to the Claimant\u2019s assertions.224\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 337.\n\n310.\n\nIn response, the Claimant argues that the decisions of national courts are not \"insulated from international consideration,\" particularly where, as here, \"the decisions of the Ukrainian courts were so manifestly wrong.\" In the Claimant\u2019s view, the Tribunal should examine the \"grossly improper decisions in the application of the law\" taken by the courts of Ukraine, in light of the fact that they refused enforcement without ever addressing \"the arbitral tribunal\u2019s grounds for finding an agreement to arbitrate to exist - grounds reiterated by GEA in its application.\" In the Claimant\u2019s view, this gives rise to \"justified concerns as to the judicial propriety\" of the outcome of the enforcement proceedings.225\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 174; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 215, 262 - 265.\n\n311.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the ICC Award did not itself constitute an \"investment,\" this claim must fail. However, even if the Tribunal had concluded differently on the \"investment\" issue, the overall result would have been the same.\n\n312.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that the Parties agree that the standard by which a denial of justice should be judged is that articulated in *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America (\"Mondev\"):226*\n\nThe test is not whether a particular result is surprising, but whether the shock or surprise occasioned to an impartial tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome, bearing in mind on the one hand that international tribunals are not courts of appeal, and on the other hand that Chapter 11 of NAFTA (like other treaties for the protection of investments) is intended to provide a real measure of protection. In the end the question is whether, at an international level and having regard to generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a tribunal can conclude in the light of all the available facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper and discreditable, with the result that the investment has been subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment. This is admittedly a somewhat open-ended standard, but it may be that in practice no more precise formula can be offered to cover the range of possibilities.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, at \u00b6 127. Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 327; Reply, \u00b6 207; Rejoinder, \u00b6 348.\n\n313.\n\nWith this agreed standard in mind, the Tribunal turns to its analysis.\n\n314.\n\nAs the Tribunal understands it, the Claimant\u2019s principal complaint is that the courts of Ukraine purportedly refused enforcement of the ICC Award without ever \"address[ing] the arbitral tribunal\u2019s grounds for finding an agreement to arbitrate to exist - grounds reiterated by GEA in its application\" *(see* \u00b6 310 above).\n\n315.\n\nHowever, on the Tribunal\u2019s review of the record, it is not that the courts of Ukraine never addressed the Claimant\u2019s argument, it is simply that the courts heard those arguments and rejected them.\n\n316.\n\nIndeed, in its decision of 28 May 2003 refusing enforcement of the ICC Award, the Appellate Court of the Ivano-Frankivsk Region directly dealt with the issue, holding that:227\n\n... this original agreement on jurisdiction *[i.e.,* in the Conversion Contract] was replaced by an arbitration agreement in the Agreement for Repayment of Debts dated 29.09.1998, which provides for arbitration under the [ICC Rules],\n\nConsidering the case, the court ascertained that the above-mentioned agreement was concluded and signed in contradiction to the Ukrainian effective legislation by the representatives of OJSC \"Oriana\" without duly authorised powers.\n\nC-0120.\n\n317.\n\nThe same goes for the decision of the Supreme Court of Ukraine dated 15 April 2004, in which it rejected the Claimant\u2019s cassation complaint on the grounds that the complaint was not one that, under the Civil Procedural Code of Ukraine, was \"linked\" to allowing a change in an appellate court decision.228\n\nC-0125.\n\n318.\n\nIn light of this, and regardless whether this denial of justice claim is characterised as procedural or substantive, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that the Ukrainian courts took their decisions without taking the Claimant\u2019s arguments into account. Instead, it appears from the record that the courts took the Claimant\u2019s arguments into account and simply rejected them.\n\n319.\n\nTaking into account the terms of the *Mondev* test, the Tribunal does not have any \"justified concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome\" of the decisions of the Ukrainian courts in view of \"generally accepted standards of the administration of justice.\" Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that there is nothing \"clearly improper and discreditable\" with respect to those decisions, with the result that the Claimant\u2019s claim that, if the ICC Award would have been considered as an investment, its investment has not been subject to fair and equitable treatment is rejected.\n\n320.\n\n(ii) *The Legal Proceedings relating to the Bankruptcy Proceedings Initiated by Pryvatbank.* Finally, GEA contends that Ukraine violated GEA\u2019s reasonable expectations that the Ukrainian courts would recognise the debt claim pursued by KCH in the Oriana bankruptcy proceedings, in particular those that were initiated by Pryvatbank in September 2002.229 More specifically, the Claimant submits that, in connection with these proceedings, the Ukrainian courts \"failed to administer due process and GEA was deprived of a fair procedure\" in violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.230\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 175.\n\nReply, \u00b6 280.\n\n321.\n\nThe Respondent explains that KCH initially attempted to register its claim by virtue of the ICC Award which had not been recognised by the Ukrainian courts. Consequently, the claim was dismissed as time-barred. According to the Respondent, no denial of justice was committed, but rather KCH challenged the non-registration of its claim through the appropriate legal channels in Ukraine and was ultimately unsuccessful because of its own strategic decisions and issues of Ukrainian bankruptcy law that were extensively litigated in Ukraine.231\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6351-381.\n\n322.\n\nThe Tribunal has not been presented with any evidence that the Ukrainian courts \"failed to administer due process\" or \"deprived\" the Claimant of a \"fair procedure.\" To the contrary, the record before it demonstrates that the Claimant was accorded a full hearing by the Ukrainian courts, but that the courts disagreed with the Claimant\u2019s point of view.232 Accordingly, even assuming that there existed a relevant \"investment\" for the purposes of this claim, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant\u2019s contentions under this heading. The Claimant has not met its burden of proving that it was subject to a denial of justice in the context of the bankruptcy proceedings initiated by Pryvatbank.\n\nSee, e.g., C-0120; C-0129; C-0132; C-0134; C-0143.\n\n323.\n\nIn conclusion, on the basis of its findings under points (i) and (ii) under this heading, the Tribunal has determined that the Claimant was not subject to a denial of justice in the Ukrainian courts and, therefore, was not subject to unfair or inequitable treatment.\n\n(iv) Conclusion\n---------------\n\n324.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that there are no grounds to hold Ukraine liable for violating its obligation to give the Claimant\u2019s investment fair and equitable treatment in accordance with Article 2(1) of the BIT, whether it be with respect to payment for the Products; GEA\u2019s expectation to recover amounts owed by Oriana during the bankruptcy proceedings; or the enforcement of the ICC Award.\n\nD. Arbitrary and Discriminatory Measures\n----------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nArticle 2(3) of the BIT provides for protection against arbitrary and discriminatory measures, as follows:\n\nNeither Contracting State shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use or enjoyment of investments made by nations or companies of the other Contracting State within its territory.\n\n*(1) The Parties\u2019 Positions*\n----------------------------\n\n326.\n\nThe Claimant contends that its enjoyment of its investment has been impaired because the Respondent has violated its obligations under Article 2(3) of the BIT.\n\n327.\n\nSpecifically, GEA claims that \"[t]he record establishes that 125,000 metric tons of GEA\u2019s property was impaired by lawless acts trampling on any sense of due process.\" In addition, GEA claims that, subsequent to the misappropriation of its property, \"Ukraine time and again impaired GEA\u2019s residual interest - its claims for compensation - by stripping Oriana of its assets, by baseless assertions as to the authority of the Oriana officer who signed the Repayment Agreement, and by arbitrary court decisions.\"233\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 184.\n\n328.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s allegations of breach of the obligation not to engage in arbitrary and discriminatory measures relate to the same events in respect of which the Claimant\u2019s allegations of expropriation and breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard are made, and that these allegations must be rejected for the same reasons as invoked by the Respondent to refute those other claims.234\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 362 - 363.\n\n*(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis*\n-----------------------------\n\n329.\n\nThe Parties agree that the standard of protection against arbitrariness or discrimination is related to that of fair and equitable treatment.235\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 179; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 360.\n\n330.\n\nIn light of this, it is not surprising that the Claimant raises the same grounds for breach under Article 2(3) of the BIT as it did in connection with its claims under Article 2(1) relating to fair and equitable treatment.\n\n331.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the Claimant\u2019s claims under this heading for the same reasons as the Claimant\u2019s claims in respect of the fair and equitable treatment standard were rejected *(see* \u00b6 324 above).\n\nE. National Treatment and Most-Favoured Nation Treatment\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nArticle 3 of the BIT provides for national treatment and most-favoured nation treatment for the investments and investors protected by the BIT, as follows:\n\n(1) Neither Contracting State shall subject investments in its territory that are owned or controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting State and that have been authorised and made pursuant to Article 2(2) in accordance with the legislation in force in the territory of the given Contracting State to treatment less favourable than it accords to investments by its own nationals or companies of third states.\n\n(2) Neither Contracting State shall subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting State to treatment less favourable than it accords to investments by its own nationals or companies or investments by nationals or companies of third states.\n\n*(1) The Parties\u2019 Positions*\n----------------------------\n\n333.\n\nGEA states in its Memorial that \"there is strong reason to believe that GEA has been the victim of discrimination\" in several respects.236\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 191.\n\n334.\n\nFirst, GEA submits that while its claim in Oriana\u2019s bankruptcy was rejected as time-barred, a claim brought by a Seychelles company in the case *Regent Company v. Ukraine,* Application No. 773/03, Eur. Ct. H.R. (2008), dating from the same time period, was allowed.237\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 192.\n\n335.\n\nSecond, in relation to the refusal of the Ukrainian courts to recognise and enforce the ICC Award on the grounds that the Repayment Agreement had not been signed by the president of Oriana, GEA alleges that Oriana had no president between August and November 1998. GEA further alleges that contracts other than the Repayment Agreement must have been signed on Oriana\u2019s behalf within that period, and that it was aware of \"no other contracts that the Ukrainian courts held to be invalid from this time period.\" On the assumption that such contracts must exist, GEA claims that it was treated less favourably than others of Oriana\u2019s contractual counterparts.238\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 193.\n\n336.\n\nFinally, GEA submits that Article 6 of the Law on Foreign Economic Activity *(see* the quote of the Appellate Court in \u00b6 65 above, setting forth this provision) \"was discriminatory on its face since it imposed more burdensome requirements on foreign than national investors.\"239 Specifically, the Claimant submits that there was no requirement for a contract to be signed with two signatures *(i.e.,* of \"a person who has such right in accordance with his position under the statutory documents and a person authorized by a power of attorney\") when an Ukrainian company entered into a contract with an Ukrainian investor.240\n\nReply, \u00b6 292.\n\nReply, \u00b6 293.\n\n337.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to establish the existence of nationals or foreigners in a situation similar to that of the Claimant, such that Ukraine\u2019s treatment of them can be compared.241\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 367 - 368.\n\n338.\n\nMore specifically, the Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s suggestion that the Seychelles company referred to in its submissions was in a similar situation as GEA because the Claimant\u2019s original claim, based on the ICC Award, was not rejected because it was time-barred, but because the ICC Award had not been recognised in Ukraine.242\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 370 - 371.\n\n339.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s proposition that the Ukrainian courts discriminated against GEA by refusing to recognise the Repayment Agreement on the basis of other contracts that \"must have been signed\" by Mr Sljuzar and purportedly upheld by the Ukrainian courts. The Respondent considers this argument to be unsustainable, as the Claimant does not, among other things, point to any other contracts signed by Mr Sljuzar and upheld by the Ukrainian courts.243\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 373.\n\n340.\n\nFinally, with respect to the double-signature requirement of Article 6 of the Law on Foreign Economic Activity, the Respondent submits that this provision applies to Ukrainian individuals and legal entities, not to foreign companies, and thus \"cannot be considered as a measure that discriminated against [foreign companies].\"244\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 398 - 400.\n\n*(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis*\n-----------------------------\n\n341.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that, even assuming there existed relevant \"investments\" for these purposes, and whatever standard were to apply to analyse the Claimant\u2019s contentions under this claim, the claim would fail for the reasons that follow.\n\n342.\n\nWith respect to the purported unequal treatment between the Claimant and the Seychelles company, the Tribunal is not convinced that the situation of the Seychelles company is comparable to that of GEA. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the simple fact that the claim of the Seychelles company was not time-barred does not, in and of itself, mean anything, in particular taking into account the differences in the procedural posture between that case and the one at hand.\n\n343.\n\nWith respect to other contracts that Mr Sljuzar purportedly entered into and that were approved by the Ukrainian courts, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant\u2019s contention is based on its \"assumption\" that such contracts exist. However, the Tribunal has been provided with no evidence of such contracts. Clearly, the Tribunal cannot make a finding against the Respondent on the basis of mere assumptions, unsupported by the record.\n\n344.\n\nWith respect to Article 6 of the Law on Foreign Economic Activities, the Tribunal notes, as pointed out by the Respondent, that this provision applies only to Ukrainian physical and legal persons. What is more, while this legislation may create additional formal requirements for foreigners to invest in Ukraine, it does not concern the treatment of investments once made. In light of this, the Tribunal does not consider Article 6 of the Law on Foreign Economic Activities to be discriminatory.\n\n345.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant\u2019s claim that it was discriminated against in violation of Article 3 of the BIT.\n\nF. Adherence to Obligations\n---------------------------\n\n346.\n\nArticle 8(2) of the BIT provides that:\n\nEither Contracting State shall adhere to any other obligation it has assumed with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting State in its territory.\n\n*(1) The Parties\u2019 Positions*\n----------------------------\n\n347.\n\nGEA contends that Ukraine has not adhered to its obligation to pay GEA for the property that was appropriated. According to GEA, this obligation arises from the fact that, \"on multiple occasions, Ukraine promised GEA that it would be compensated for the taking.\"245\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 199.\n\n348.\n\nIn response, Ukraine submits that \"as in the context of its allegation of breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the Claimant fails to cite any evidence where any such promise is actually made.\"246\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 375.\n\n349.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has not presented \"pertinent legal authority to support its argument that an umbrella clause can be used to elevate a unilateral statement into a binding treaty obligation,\"247 in particular when the Claimant \"is unable to point to a unilateral statement of a legal obligation stated in sufficiently clear and specific terms to meet the customary standard under international law.\"248\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 377; Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 414 - 415.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 377.\n\n350.\n\nGEA responds that, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s assertions, the record is clear that Ukraine made promises \"in sufficiently clear and specific terms to meet the standard of customary international law.\"249\n\nReply, \u00b6 315.\n\n*(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis*\n-----------------------------\n\n351.\n\nIn support of its claim that Ukraine made promises of payment to GEA, the Claimant refers to a letter from the Ministry of Industrial Policy to Metallgesellschaft dated 31 July 199 8250, as well as the protocol of a meeting between representatives of the Ukrainian Government, Oriana and GEA dated 13 August 1998.251 For the same reasons as set forth in \u00b6\u00b6 288 - 293 above, the Tribunal does not consider that these documents evidence any promises made by Ukraine towards GEA.\n\nReply, \u00b6 317, referring to Minutes of a meeting between the Ukrainian Government, Green Party, Shelton, Oriana, MG and KCH (C-0023).\n\nReply, \u00b6 319, referring to Protocol of a meeting between representatives of the Ukrainian Government, Oriana and MG dated 13 August 1998 (C-0016).\n\n352.\n\nThe Claimant also refers to a statement of Vice Prime Minister Tyhypko, who purportedly said during a meeting between the Ukrainian Government, the Green Party, Shelton, Oriana, MG and KCH on 23 February 1999 \"that the government of Ukraine is willing to meet its obligations.\"252 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it has been presented with no evidence that such a statement refers to any obligation on the part of the Respondent to pay compensation to the Claimant for the product that KCH had allegedly lost. Within the context of the minutes of that meeting, this statement could just as easily - if not more likely - mean that Ukraine was willing to meet its obligations with respect to the working group that was being formed to \"clarif[y] all of the open issues concerning the liabilities of the Oriana Group to KCH.253\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 199, referring to Minutes of a meeting between the Ukrainian Government, Green Party, Shelton, Oriana, MG and KCH (C-0023).\n\nC-0023.\n\n353.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant refers to a \"clear and unambiguous promise\" made by Ukrainian officials that the debts owed to BV and GEA would be transferred to Lukor and treated with priority.254 However, the Tribunal observes that the paragraph containing this alleged promise does not even refer to the State of Ukraine, aside from its maintaining certain guarantees to parties other than GEA:\n\n[Lukor] is to become assignee in respect of the receivables and debts from the activities of the old petrochemical division of the concern Oriana. This applies to the foreign debts in relation to Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank/Udeko and Kl\u00f4ckner Chemiehandel and for the remaining, primarily national, debts; the latter are under all circumstances to be considered less important than the Hypo- und Vereinsbank/Udeko and Kl\u00f4ckner debts.\n\nThe existence of the Ukrainian state guarantee granted to Hypo- und Vereinsbank/Udeko remains unaffected.\n\nReply, \u00b6 323, referring to Protocol of a meeting between representatives of the Ukrainian Government, representatives of the German Government, Hermes, Linde, BV, MG and KCH on 24 August 1999 (C-0027).\n\n354.\n\nIn light of this, there is no basis for the Tribunal to conclude that Ukrainian officials made any \"clear and unambiguous promise\" to GEA in this context.\n\n355.\n\nFinally, the Claimant refers to the record of a 9 April 2003 meeting for the proposition that Ukraine promised to support GEA in obtaining recognition and enforcement of the ICC Award against Oriana.255 However, the Tribunal notes that the minutes of that meeting in fact state that Ukraine \"agreed - insofar as possible -to support Solvadis AG in obtaining the declaration of enforcement and the subsequent enforcement of the international ICC arbitration award against OAO Oriana\" (emphasis added).256 The Tribunal considers it clear that this does not amount to a \"promise\" of anything on the part of Ukraine, but rather an indication that it would use its best efforts to do what it could.\n\nReply, \u00b6 325, referring to Protocol of a meeting between representatives of the Ukrainian Government, a representative of the German Government, BV, Linde and Solvadis AG dated 9 April 2003 (C-0025).\n\n*Id.*\n\n356.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent did not violate any of its \"other obligations\" pursuant to Article 8(2) of the BIT.\n\nVIII. **Damages**\n-----------------\n\n357.\n\nAs the Claimant has failed on each of its claims, such that the Tribunal has not found the Respondent liable in any respect, the Tribunal need not address the Claimant\u2019s damages claims.\n\nIX. **Costs**\n-------------\n\n358.\n\nIn its Submission on Costs dated 29 October 2010, the Claimant seeks to recover EUR 1,309,084.74 and USD 315,016.44, plus interest from the date of this Award. The Claimant considers that these amounts are reasonable, and that it should recover these amounts in light of the Respondent\u2019s behaviour before and during these proceedings.\n\n359.\n\nIn its Submission on Costs dated 29 October 2010, the Respondent seeks to recover USD 1,595,337.47 and UAH 4,300. The Respondent contends that, in the event the Tribunal declines jurisdiction, or accepts jurisdiction but rejects the Claimant\u2019s claims, the Claimant should reimburse the Respondent for the entirety of its costs.\n\n360.\n\nThere were two further rounds of submissions on costs.\n\n361.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the Award.\n\n362.\n\nArticle 61(2) does not prescribe a particular test for tribunals to assess costs, nor does it place any restrictions on a tribunal\u2019s ability to do so. In light of this, the Tribunal understands the power granted under this Article to be broad, allowing the Tribunal discretion in making its determination.\n\n363.\n\nThe Respondent has articulated its Submission on Costs in terms of \"costs follow the event,\" in that the Respondent asks the Tribunal to award the entirety of its costs should the Claimant lose on jurisdiction and/or liability.\n\n364.\n\nIt has long been debated whether the \"costs follow the event\" rule should apply in international investment arbitration. Without entering upon this debate here, the Tribunal considers that this particular case is an appropriate one for the exercise of its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention in the Respondent\u2019s favour.\n\n365.\n\nHere, the Claimant\u2019s case has failed partially on jurisdiction *(see* \u00b6 125 above) and entirely on liability. In circumstances where no part of the Claimant\u2019s endeavour in commencing these proceedings has been successful, it may fairly be concluded that the Respondent ought to recover its reasonable costs.\n\n366.\n\nHaving taken into account all the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant should bear the entirety of the costs in this matter. The Tribunal finds the amounts claimed by the Respondent (USD 1,595,337.47 and UAH 4,300) to be reasonable under the circumstances.257 Accordingly, the Tribunal shall order the Claimant to reimburse the Respondent all of its costs.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent has not claimed for interest on costs.\n\nX. Decisions\n------------\n\n367.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal renders the following decisions:\n\n(1) Determines that GEA has standing to bring claims arising from the Conversion Contract until 30 June 2004, but not thereafter;\n\n(2) Determines that the dispute is within its competence and ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction insofar as the Conversion Contract and the Products are concerned;\n\n(3) Rejects all of the Claimant\u2019s claims within its competence and ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction; and\n\n(4) Orders the Claimant to reimburse the Respondent all of its costs, being USD 1,595,337.47 and UAH 4,300."}]}
