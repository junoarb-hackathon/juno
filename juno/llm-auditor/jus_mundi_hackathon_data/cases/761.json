(\"SGS\" or the \"Claimant\"), by a sub-mission dated 7 May 2002, seeking the issuance of \"Urgent Provisional Measures\" (the \"Request\").\n\n[2].\n\nThe Claimant's Request sought the granting of the following recom-mendations:\n\n(1) that the Respondent immediately withdraw from and cause to be discontinued all proceedings in the courts of Pakistan relating in any way to this arbitration, including Pakistan's application for a stay of this arbitration and its application to have SGS held in contempt of court, and that the Respondent refrain from com-mencing or participating in any other such proceeding in the future;\n\n(2) that the Islamabad-based arbitration pending between SGS and Pakistan be stayed until such time, if any, as this Tribunal has issued an award declining jurisdiction over the present dispute, and that award is no longer capable of being interpreted, revised or annulled pursuant to the ICSID Convention;\n\n(3) that the Respondent take no action of any kind that might aggra-vate or further extend the dispute submitted to the Tribunal.\n\n[3].\n\nOn 16 September 2002, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (\"Pakistan\" or the \"Respondent\") filed written \"Objections to the Claimant's Request for Urgent Provisional Measures\" (the \"Objections\").\n\n[4].\n\nThe hearing on the Request and the Objections was held at The Hague, the Netherlands, on 23 September 2002.\n\n[5].\n\nThe request for provisional measures set out under paragraph (1) above was supplemented at the hearing in order to reflect developments in cer-tain court proceedings in Pakistan relating to this arbitration proceeding that occurred after the filing of the Request. The Claimant requested the Tribunal to recommend that the Respondent \"remove\" or \"undo\" a judgment made on 3 July 2002 by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.1\n\nSee page 5, paragraph 2 and page 9, paragraph 2 of the transcript from the oral hearing on pro-visional measures held in The Hague on September 23, 2002 (\"the Transcript\").\n\n[6].\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides that: \"Except as the par-ties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to pre-serve the respective rights of either party.\"\n\n**Summary of the Facts**\n------------------------\n\n[7].\n\nThe Tribunal's understanding of the facts that immediately bear upon the Request and the Objections, as those facts can be derived from those sub-missions and the Transcript of the oral hearing, can be summarized as follows.\n\n[8].\n\nThe Judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan dated 3 July 2002 granted a motion by the Respondent that the Claimant be permanently enjoined from taking any steps to participate in this international proceeding. We understand that Pakistan's action was based upon the fact that the contract between the Claimant and the Respondent, the Agreement for Pre-shipment Inspections (the \"PSI Agreement\"), signed 29 September 1994, contained an arbitration clause providing for the resolution of \"[a]ny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, or relating to\" the PSI Agreement by means of an arbitration, the place of which was designated to be Islamabad, Pakistan.2 The PSI Agreement has given rise to mutual claims of breach thereof as well as to claims that the Respondent has breached the Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Reciprocal Protection of Investments3 (the \"Bilateral Investment Treaty\" or \"BIT\").\n\nArticle 11.1 of the Agreement between the President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, acting by and through its Ministry of Finance, Revenue Division, and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A., dated 29 September 1994.\n\nSigned on 11 July 1995 and entered into effect on 6 May 1996.\n\n[9].\n\nAfter notice of termination of the PSI Agreement with effect from 11 March 1997 was given by the Respondent on 12 December 1996 and various consultations between the parties failed to resolve the dispute, on 12 January 1998, the Claimant initiated a claim against the Respondent in the Court of First Instance of Geneva, Switzerland, alleging wrongful termination of the PSI Agreement.4 The Respondent opposed this claim on various grounds but principally on the basis that the parties had agreed to the private arbitration of any disputes arising out of the PSI Agreement rather than to submit to the courts of any country and on grounds of sovereign immunity from the legal process of the Swiss courts.\n\nThe following facts are taken from the Respondent's Chronology of Material Events, Exhibit P1 to the Respondent's Objections to the Claimant's Request for Urgent Provisional Measures, dated 16 September 2002, and from the parties' respective submissions. The Tribunal understands these facts to be common ground between the parties.\n\n[10].\n\nOn 24 June 1999, the Geneva Court of First Instance rejected SGS's claim, principally on the first ground asserted by the Respondent. SGS then appealed to the Geneva Court of Appeal and subsequently appealed further to the Swiss Federal Tribunal. Both courts upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance, but on grounds of sovereign immunity. These legal proceedings (the \"Swiss legal proceedings\") unfolded over a period of some twenty-two months.\n\n[11].\n\nOn 11 September 2000, after the judgments of the first two Swiss courts were rendered, but before the judgment of the Swiss Federal Tribunal was issued on 23 November 2000, the Respondent invoked Article 11.1 of the PSI Agreement in order to commence arbitration proceedings in Pakistan pur-suant to the applicable governing statute. (The Tribunal will refer to this pro-ceeding as the \"local arbitration\" or the \"PSI Agreement arbitration.\") On this date, Pakistan applied to the Court of the Senior Civil Judge, Islamabad, pur-suant to s. 20 of the Pakistan Arbitration Act, 1940, for an order that the dis-pute between the parties be referred for decision by an arbitrator to be appointed by the Court.\n\n[12].\n\nThe Swiss legal proceedings having concluded with the denial of the Claimant's appeal on 23 November 2000, the Claimant then appeared before the Senior Civil Judge in Islamabad by filing, on 7 April 2001, a set of pre-liminary objections to the PSI Agreement arbitration and, without prejudice to those objections, a counter-claim against Pakistan for alleged breaches of the PSI Agreement.\n\n[13].\n\nOn 10 October 2001, SGS sent a letter to the Government of Pakistan consenting to ICSID arbitration pursuant to Article 9(1) of the BIT.\n\n[14].\n\nOn 4 January 2002, SGS filed an application with the Senior Civil Judge, Islamabad, for an injunction against the local arbitration on the ground principally that it was entitled to have the dispute settled through ICSID arbi-tration and that the local arbitration should be stayed until the ICSID Tribunal determined Pakistan's objection to its jurisdiction. On 7 January 2002, the application was rejected by the Senior Civil Judge who also direct-ed both parties to submit the names of arbitrators, one of whom could be appointed to arbitrate the PSI Agreement dispute. SGS then appealed to the Lahore High Court and when that appeal was dismissed on 14 February 2002, appealed further to the Supreme Court of Pakistan on 5 March 2002. Pakistan, for its part, filed its own appeal to the same Court against one para-graph of the Lahore High Court's judgment as well as an application for an injunction to enjoin SGS from pursuing the ICSID arbitration.\n\n[15].\n\nFollowing the parties' respective petitions filed in the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Court, on 15 March 2002, allowed both petitions and grant-ed leave to appeal. At the same time, the Supreme Court enjoined both par-ties from pursuing their respective arbitration proceedings pending a decision on their appeals. While the two appeals were before the Supreme Court, on 17 April 2002, an application was made by the Government of Pakistan to the Court to hold SGS in contempt of court.\n\n[16].\n\nOn 3 July 2002, the Supreme Court of Pakistan rendered its final deci-sion on both appeals, dismissing the Claimant's appeal and granting the Respondent's request to proceed with the PSI Agreement arbitration and restraining the Claimant from pursuing or participating in the ICSID arbitra-tion.5 In its Reasons for Judgment, the Supreme Court considered *inter alia* whether the Claimant had the requisite standing to commence this ICSID claim and concluded that it did not. The Court's Reasons for Judgment were followed on 7 July 2002 with the appointment of Mr. Justice (Retd) Nasir Aslam Zahid as the sole arbitrator to hear the PSI Agreement arbitration.\n\nSee \"Chronology of Material Events,\" Exhibit P1, page 3, to the Respondent's Objections.\n\n[17].\n\nAlthough the Government of Pakistan had earlier applied for an order of contempt of court, the judgment of the Supreme Court did not issue a notice of contempt.6 Counsel for the Claimant noted during the hearing, however, that the \"petition [for contempt] still seems to us [to be extant] or at any rate has not been withdrawn\" and that it \"has not been explicitly disposed of.\"7 The Respondent pointed out that the Court did not respond to the Government's earlier application and that the Government has not made any fresh application to the Supreme Court to have SGS held in contempt of court.8 The Claimant agrees that no such steps have been taken but neverthe-less expresses its concern that steps could be taken by an indefinite number of persons, including the Supreme Court *sua sponte,* and that, although SGS itself does not have assets or personnel in Pakistan that could be the subject of con-tempt proceedings, it has sister companies that do.9 It therefore has expressed concern at the existence of the injunction and the possibility of steps being taken against it or any of its sister companies for contempt of court.\n\nRespondent's Objections at paragraph 46. We understand this notice amounts to a notice to show cause why the Claimant should not be held in contempt.\n\nSee page 6, paragraph 5, lines 34-35 of the Transcript.\n\nRespondent's Objections at paragraph 46. See also page 33, paragraph 2, lines 5-11 and para-graph 5, lines 34-39 of the Transcript.\n\nSee pages 9-10 of the Transcript, especially page 10, lines 3-34.\n\n[18].\n\nThe Attorney General of Pakistan, the Hon. Makhdoom Ali Khan, appeared before the Tribunal and discussed the history of the Court proceed-ings and the operation of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan's legal protections in the event that an application for a contempt order is made. The Tribunal has taken note of the Attorney General's comments, particularly with respect to the scope of the Judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, namely, that in his opinion it applies to SGS alone and not to its sister companies, adding that the Courts of Pakistan apply the principles of the corporate veil developed in English law.10 In response to a question from the Tribunal, counsel for Pakistan stated that in view of the steps taken by the Claimant in relation to this international arbitration since 3 July 2002, the Claimant would be held to be in contempt of court.11\n\nSee pages 34-35 of the Transcript, particularly at page 35, lines 1-6.\n\nSee page 33, paragraph 2, lines 5-6 of the Transcript.\n\n[19].\n\nCounsel for the Respondent emphasized that no party has applied for a finding of contempt since 17 April 2002 and observed that, always subject to its objections to this Tribunal's competence and jurisdiction to hear SGS's claim, Pakistan has duly participated in this arbitration. Such steps include replacing an arbitrator who found it necessary to resign, participating in the Tribunal's First Session held with the parties by teleconference on 21 August 2002, agreeing to pay its share of the fees of the proceeding, as well as filing its Objections and participating in the oral hearing of 23 September 2002.\n\n**Discussion**\n--------------\n\n[20].\n\nWe wish to record the fact that this Request has been considered com-pletely on a without prejudice basis insofar as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan's objection to the Tribunal's competence and jurisdiction to hear the claim is concerned. Both parties made submissions that expressly stated or implicitly assumed that the Tribunal either has or does not have the requisite jurisdiction to hear the claim. Submissions were also made on the breadth of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, assuming that it had jurisdiction to hear the claims, to hear also a counter-claim, were the Government of Pakistan minded to advance one, if the Tribunal were to find that this claim could proceed to the merits. The Tribunal recognizes that, while it was not the purpose of the hear-ing to address the objections to competence and jurisdiction, nevertheless these express statements and implicit assumptions as to jurisdiction or the lack thereof are linked to the three requests as formulated by the Claimant.\n\n[21].\n\nWe are thus compelled to make certain statements about jurisdiction in this Procedural Order. Such statements, it is repeated, are wholly without prejudice to the Tribunal's consideration of Pakistan's objections to compe-tence and jurisdiction, a briefing schedule for which has already been set on an expedited basis by the Tribunal with the parties' agreement. The legal issues raised are substantive and complex and we look forward to receiving the par-ties' submissions thereon in due course.\n\n[22].\n\nWe also note that Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention establishes a legal rule of fundamental importance to the proper operation of the ICSID arbitral system: \"The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.\" It is undisputed that the Tribunal has this competence and that it has a duty to exercise it so as to determine whether or not the claim can be considered on the merits.\n\n[23].\n\nThe Tribunal considers that certain other rights flow from this impor-tant rule.\n\n**Request for Relief No. 1**\n----------------------------\n\n[24].\n\nIt will be recalled that the Claimant requests firstly:\n\n\"that the Respondent immediately withdraw from and cause to be discontinued all proceedings in the courts of Pakistan relat-ing in any way to this arbitration, including Pakistan's applica-tion for a stay of this arbitration and its application to have SGS held in contempt of court, and that the Respondent refrain from commencing or participating in any other such proceeding in the future;\"\n\n[25].\n\nIt is convenient to break this request down into four sub-items as fol-lows: (1) that the Respondent immediately withdraw from and cause to be dis-continued all proceedings in the courts of Pakistan relating in any way to this arbitration, (2) including Pakistan's application for a stay of this arbitration and (3) its application to have SGS held in contempt of court, and (4) that the Respondent refrain from commencing or participating in any other such pro-ceeding in the future.\n\n[26].\n\nWith respect to Sub-item (1) of Request No. 1, it has not been dis-puted that under the law of Pakistan, there is no further step to be taken in the Supreme Court proceeding. (To the extent that Sub-item (1) refers to any other proceedings in the courts of Pakistan relating in any way to this pro-ceeding, the Tribunal's comments in relation to Sub-item (4) below also apply here.)\n\n[27].\n\nThere appears no basis for the Respondent or any other party to apply to the Court to re-visit the judgment. The Tribunal accepts that this proceed-ing in the Supreme Court of Pakistan is one from which Pakistan cannot with-draw or discontinue. Nor can Pakistan \"remove\" or set it aside. It is a final and completed judgment of that Court.\n\n[28].\n\nHowever, although the Supreme Court Judgment of July 3, 2002 is final as a matter of the law of Pakistan, as a matter of international law, it does not in any way bind this Tribunal. We have already adverted to the require-ment of Article 41 of the ICSID Convention that this Tribunal determine whether it has the jurisdiction to consider the claims that have been advanced and that we cannot decline to do so.\n\n[29].\n\nIt is clear that SGS has a *prima facie* right to seek access to interna-tional adjudication under the ICSID Convention. It has consented to submit its claim to arbitration under Article 9(2) of the Bilateral Investment Treaty. It has alleged both breach of contract and breach of substantive obligations con-tained in the BIT. The Islamic Republic of Pakistan is a signatory to the ICSID Convention and has duly ratified it.\n\n[30].\n\nIt is essential for the proper operation of both the BIT and the ICSID Convention that the right of access to international adjudication be main-tained. In the Tribunal's view, it has a duty to protect this right of access and should exercise such powers as are vested in it under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention in furtherance of that duty.\n\n[31].\n\nSub-item (2) of Request No. 1 is that Pakistan's application for a stay of this ICSID proceeding be withdrawn or discontinued. It appears to us that Sub-item (2) is subsumed in Sub-item (1) and the comments just made apply equally to it.\n\n[32].\n\nSub-item (3) of Request No. 1 concerns Pakistan's application to have SGS held in contempt of court.\n\n[33].\n\nThe Tribunal understands that while the application to have SGS declared in contempt of court was made in April 2002, the Court did not act on the application and no subsequent petition to hold SGS in contempt has been filed. It is advised further however that it is possible that there could be a complaint by the Government, the Court *sua sponte,* or even by a private party who formed the view that SGS had failed to comply with the Court's order. The Attorney General has advised that there is a detailed process for the conduct of contempt proceedings under the law of Pakistan in which the per-son who is the subject of the complaint is given a full opportunity to respond to the allegations of contempt.\n\n[34].\n\nWe note these statements and take from them that there are protec-tions put in place by the law of Pakistan to ensure that contempt proceedings are handled with great care. However, it is important that the possibility of contempt proceedings in relation to the Supreme Court's 3 July 2002 Judgment not in any way impair the rights discussed above. The right to seek access to international adjudication must be respected and cannot be con-strained by an order of a national court. Nor can a State plead its internal law in defence of an act that is inconsistent with its international obligations.12 Otherwise, a Contracting State could impede access to ICSID arbitration by operation of its own law.\n\nSee Article 3 of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility and the commentary thereon as well as Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n[35].\n\nTherefore, while the Tribunal accepts that the Judgment of the Supreme Court is final, it requests the Respondent not to act on its earlier complaint of an alleged breach of the Court's stay or to file a new complaint. We recommend further that, in the event that any other party, including the Supreme Court of Pakistan *sua sponte,* were to initiate a complaint, Pakistan take all necessary steps to inform the relevant court of the current standing of this proceeding and of the fact that this Tribunal must discharge its duty to determine whether it has the jurisdiction to consider the international claim on the merits. A corollary of this duty is that both parties to the arbitration must be free to take all necessary steps in furtherance of their participation in it. It follows that the Government of Pakistan should ensure that no action be taken in respect of its 17 April 2002 application for contempt and that, if any other contempt proceedings are initiated by any party, such proceedings not be acted upon.\n\n[36].\n\nSub-item (4) of Request No.1 seeks a recommendation that the Respondent refrain from commencing or participating in \"all proceedings in the courts of Pakistan *relating in any way* to this arbitration\" *in the future.* This is too broad a request. The Tribunal is aware of Pakistan's concerns about the circumstances in which the PSI Agreement was allegedly procured. We have taken careful note of the fact that there have been legal proceedings in Pakistan relating to the PSI Agreement.13 The Supreme Court's Reasons for Judgment record the fact of the investigation into the origins of the PSI Agreement and its granting by a former government of Pakistan.14 There may be further pro-ceedings in that connection in the future. We cannot enjoin a State from con-ducting the normal processes of criminal, administrative and civil justice with-in its own territory. We cannot, therefore, purport to restrain the ordinary exercise of these processes.\n\nThese proceedings are referred to in the attachments to the Government of Pakistan's applica-tion for the appointment of an arbitrator filed with the Senior Civil Judge, Islamabad, which were pro-vided to the Tribunal at its request at the end of the hearing.\n\nReasons for Judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in C.A. No. 459 of 2002 and C.A. No. 460 of 2002 at paragraph 15.\n\n[37].\n\nThe Tribunal has also taken note of the fact that in the course of upholding the enforceability of the PSI Agreement's arbitration process, the Supreme Court of Pakistan recorded the Attorney General's statement that the Government of Pakistan would not file a claim based upon the allegations of kickbacks and bribery in its arbitration claim under the PSI Agreement.15 We consider, however, that logically, and in principle, they could be relevant to any proceeding regarding the PSI Agreement with SGS.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 16.\n\n**Request for Relief No. 2**\n----------------------------\n\n[38].\n\nIt will be recalled that Request No. 2 seeks a recommendation:\n\n\"that the Islamabad-based arbitration pending between SGS and Pakistan be stayed until such time, if any, as this Tribunal has issued an award declining jurisdiction over the present dis-pute, and that award is no longer capable of being interpreted, revised or annulled pursuant to the ICSID Convention;\"\n\n[39].\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this request raises a number of substantive issues that go to the question of whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction. We have men-tioned the express statements and implicit assumptions that pervaded the sub-missions made at the oral hearing. By way of clarifying the bases of its decision in respect of Request No. 2, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to identify some of these issues without, however, deciding any of them.\n\n[40].\n\nFirst, it was submitted by counsel for the Claimant that, should the Tribunal ultimately rule that it has the requisite jurisdiction to hear the claim on its merits, the Respondent is fully entitled to file a counterclaim. To this submission of the Claimant, counsel for the Respondent responded by expressing the view that \"there are no rights\" for Pakistan under the BIT and that \"[Pakistan's] rights solely exist under the contract with SGS.\"16\n\nSee page 40, last paragraph, lines 34-36 of the Transcript.\n\n[41].\n\nThe source of jurisdiction to consider such a counter-claim and the governing law applicable to such a claim is of capital importance. It would be inequitable if, by reason of the invocation of ICSID jurisdiction, the Claimant could on the one hand elevate its side of the dispute to international adjudi-cation and, on the other, preclude the Respondent from pursuing its own claim for damages by obtaining a stay of those proceedings for the pendency of the international proceedings, if such international proceedings could not encompass the Respondent's claim.\n\n[42].\n\nThe assumption underlying the Claimant's request to stay the Islamabad arbitration is that this Tribunal can hear both parties' claims.17 Notwithstanding the alacrity with which the Claimant's submission was made, we are not able at this time to consider the validity and implications of that submission.18 Thus we cannot base our decision on the request for the stay of the PSI Agreement arbitration on that submission which is yet to be ade-quately litigated.\n\nSee page 46, paragraph 3, lines 17-23 of the Transcript.\n\nSee Article 46 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n[43].\n\nOther questions that occur to the Tribunal concern the subject matter of the Islamabad-based arbitration. It was for this reason that the Tribunal inquired as to whether a Statement of Claim had already been filed either as part of the application to the Civil Court to appoint the arbitrator or before the Supreme Court or since the time that the Supreme Court appointed the arbitrator. The Attorney General advised that it was not necessary fully to for-mulate the claim to be arbitrated in order to seek a court-appointed arbitrator and that the Respondent's claim had yet to be fully articulated.19 However, as noted above, the Attorney General informed the Supreme Court that the Government's claims would be based on the terms and conditions embodied in the PSI Agreement.20 The Tribunal infers from statements of counsel that the PSI Agreement arbitration would involve commercial claims related to the contract. It appears to us on the basis of the evidence available at this time that Pakistan's claims relating to the PSI Agreement may be substantially linked to the claims of breach of contract that SGS alleges.\n\nSee page 26, paragraph 3, lines 18-26 of the Transcript.\n\nReasons for Judgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, *supra* note 14, at paragraph 16. that this contractual commitment was freely given by SGS because it was of fundamental importance to the Government of Pakistan. The Respondent submits further that a specific agreement must prevail over the otherwise exclusive remedy created by a claimant's invocation of ICSID arbitration. We do not decide this issue in this application, choosing instead to leave it to be considered in light of all of the parties' submissions on competence and juris-diction, after the hearing set for February 2003.\n\n[44].\n\nA third question that has arisen concerns the effect of SGS's consent to ICSID arbitration. In filing such a consent, has it waived its right to pursue its counter-claim in the Islamabad arbitration, at least until such time as this Tribunal determines whether it has the jurisdiction to consider its claims? This might follow from Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, which states that con-sent to arbitration under the Convention shall be deemed to be consent \"to the exclusion of any other remedy.\" If so, the PSI Agreement arbitrator might be deprived of a full joining of the legal issues relating to the performance of the contract under applicable municipal law.\n\n[45].\n\nA fourth issue concerns the interpretation of the opening clause of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, an issue raised by the Respondent. The Respondent has asserted that the parties \"otherwise stated\" that they would submit any disputes arising under the PSI Agreement to local arbitration and\n\n[46].\n\nWere the Tribunal to base its decision on the balance of equities, it would not be inclined to grant Request No. 2. It was noted earlier that SGS resorted to the Swiss courts, indeed to the highest Swiss court, in order to pur-sue its claim of breach of contract against the Respondent. Having litigated this in the Claimant's own national *fora* and then seeking to stay the arbitra-tion sought by Pakistan under the PSI Agreement, the Claimant's actions do not create equities that favour it. The Claimant has also appeared in the PSI Agreement arbitration to the extent of making jurisdictional objections and filing a counter-claim.\n\n[47].\n\nThe Tribunal, however, also believes that normally it would be waste-ful of resources for two proceedings relating to the same or substantially the same matter to unfold separately while the jurisdiction of one tribunal awaits determination. No doubt the parties have been put to considerable expense already. At the same time, the Tribunal is concerned that Pakistan not be effec-tively deprived of a forum for the hearing of its own claims relating to the PSI Agreement.\n\n[48].\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal has concluded that it would be appropriate in all the circumstances of this case to recommend a stay of the PSI Agreement arbitration until such time as the Tribunal decides the objections to compe-tence and jurisdiction. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent's best estimate for the conduct of the arbitration is not the statutory directive of four months, but more likely a \"year to 18 months at the very least\".21 There is little likeli-hood therefore that the PSI Agreement arbitration would conclude before this Tribunal hears the Respondent's objections and issues its decision. With the cooperation of the parties, the expeditious resolution of the jurisdictional issue should be possible.\n\nSee page 41, paragraph 4, line 34, and page 42, first paragraph, line 3 of the Transcript. party, should circumstances change materially during the pendency of the jurisdictional phase of this proceeding.\n\n[49].\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal recommends the stay requested. It is scarce-ly necessary to add that this like any procedural order on provisional measures may be re-visited on the application of either party and after hearing the other\n\n**Request for Relief No. 3**\n----------------------------\n\n[50].\n\nThe third request made by the Claimant is:\n\n\"that the Respondent take no action of any kind that might aggravate or further extend the dispute submitted to the Tribunal.\"\n\n[51].\n\nWe have already addressed the issues relating to legal proceedings in the courts of Pakistan, and in particular the issue of the contempt proceedings. Apart from the considerations that flow from the state of those proceedings, we note that neither party has taken any measure to aggravate the dispute. We observe the current cooperation between the parties and see no evidence that would justify the making of an order.\n\n**Order:**\n----------\n\n[52].\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal issues the following recom-mendations:\n\n[53].\n\nFirst, the Tribunal recommends that the Government of Pakistan not take any step to initiate a complaint for contempt. It recommends further that, in the event that any other party, including the Supreme Court of Pakistan *sua sponte,* were to initiate a complaint, the Government of Pakistan take all nec-essary steps to inform the Court of the current standing of this proceeding and of the fact that this Tribunal must discharge its duty to determine whether it has the jurisdiction to consider the international claim on the merits. The Government of Pakistan should ensure that if contempt proceedings are initi-ated by any party, such proceedings not be acted upon.\n\n[54].\n\nSecond, the Tribunal recommends that the Islamabad-based arbitra-tion pending between the Government of Pakistan and SGS be stayed until such time, if any, as this Tribunal has issued an award declining jurisdiction over the present dispute, and that award is no longer capable of being inter-preted, revised or annulled pursuant to the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal requests that a copy of this procedural order be transmitted to the designated arbitrator so that he is made fully aware of the status of this international pro-ceeding.\n\n[55].\n\nBoth parties requested an order for costs of this application. The Tribunal declines to make such an order at this time."}, {"Title": "Decision on Claimant's Proposal to Disqualify J.

Mr Thomas wrote in his separate statement that he noted that one of the claims advanced by the Claimant related to a topic that he had addressed in an article that he had just completed on the fair and equitable treatment standard in the North American Free Trade Agreement to be published by ICSID in *ICSID Review\u2014Foreign Investment Law Journal.* Mr Thomas wished to bring this to the attention of the parties in case they had any concerns in this respect. Copies of Mr Thomas' article were distributed to the parties by the Secretary on 14 August 2002.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of 19 August 2002, the Claimant stated that it had reviewed Mr Thomas' curriculum vitae and noted a reference in it to \"his retainer with Mexico\". SGS also noted that Mr Thomas' ICSID experience appears to be exclusively as counsel to Mexico in a number of Additional Facility arbitrations and sought in this respect a \"clarification by Mr Thomas of the terms of his retainer with Mexico, and for his confirmation that his retainer does not impair his ability to exercise independent judgment as an arbitrator in a dispute between a State and a foreign investor\".\n\n7.\n\nComplying with the Claimant's request, Mr Thomas informed the parties, by letter of 19 August 2002 via the Secretary, that \"he has a continuing retainer with the Government of Mexico for advice to, and the representation of Mexico in relation to matters arising under the NAFTA and WTO Agreement, including disputes under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules\" and that \"he [has] advised on NAFTA investment obligations from both the complainants' and respondents' perspective\". He further stated that \"his retainer with the Government of Mexico does not preclude him from exercising independent judgment as arbitrator, as required under the ICSID Convention, in this or any other case to which he would accept appointment\".\n\n8.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held on 21 August 2002, at which the parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted.\n\n9.\n\nOn 12 November 2002, Mr Thomas stated in a letter to the President that he wished to bring a recent development to the attention of the Tribunal and the parties. Mr Thomas stated that his law firm is working on a NAFTA claim brought by a US investor, GAMI Investments Inc. (GAMI) against the United Mexican States. In that case, Mexico is represented by Lic. Hugo Perezcano D\u00edaz, although Mr Thomas expects \"that [his] firm's name would be listed on Mexico's pleadings and that [his] colleagues would appear at the oral hearings\". He explained that counsel for the claimant GAMI in that case, Messrs Charles Roh, Jr of Weil Gotschal & Manges LLP and Lic. Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez of SAI Law and Economics in Mexico City, had proposed the appointment of Mr Jan Paulsson as President of the three member tribunal and that Mr Perezcano had agreed with the claimant's proposal. Mr Paulsson, who is representing the Respondent in the present case, subsequently accepted the appointment. Mr Thomas further stated in this respect that \"[i]n view of the fact that Mr Paulsson's firm is appearing in this proceeding, I have consulted with Mexico and if the Tribunal is of the view that it would prefer me not to appear personally before the *GAMI Investments* Tribunal, I would agree not to do so. I wish to assure the Tribunal and the parties that Mexico's appearing before Mr Paulsson and his two colleagues will in no way affect my view of my responsibilities and duties in the *SGS* case.\" Mr Thomas' letter was transmitted to the parties, which were invited by the Tribunal to submit any observations they may have thereon by 22 November 2002.\n\n10.\n\nOn 22 November 2002, the Claimant proposed the disqualification of Mr Thomas under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. In its proposal, SGS noted that Mr Thomas had previously disclosed a retainer with Mexico and, in view of his disclosure made on 12 November 2002, stated that it \"believes that Mr Thomas' role (and/or that of his firm) as counsel representing what appears to be a very large client of his firm, if not the largest, before a tribunal presided by counsel for Pakistan in this case indicates that, in his role as arbitrator in this case, he may manifestly not be relied upon to exercise independent judgement\".\n\n11.\n\nBy letter of 22 November 2002, Pakistan observed that \"Mr Thomas has himself proposed in the letter a process for management of the *GAMI* Tribunal situation, to which Pakistan has nothing to add.\" In addition, the Respondent transmitted a message from Mr Paulsson on 25 November 2002 providing the following information on the *GAMI* case:\n\nThe ad hoc arbitration in question was commenced in April 2002. Both parties agreed to appoint me as chairman in the late summer of 2002, and I accepted in early September. The Government of Mexico is a party to that case, and it is represented by the Consultor Juridico of the Office of the Deputy Secretary for International Business Negotiations and his team, who I know to be perfectly bilingual and experienced in international arbitration. The first procedural conference in the case was held on 20 November 2002. In anticipation of that conference, the Consultor Juridico informed the arbitral tribunal that his team would be assisted by outside co-counsel from a US law firm and a Canadian law firm, the latter being Thomas & Partners. This was my first intimation that Mexico would have recourse to outside counsel. The individual identified as participating from Thomas & Partners was Mr Mowatt. Ultimately, however, no one from Thomas & Partners participated, and the sole advocate speaking on behalf of Mexico in the course of the procedural conference was the Consultor Juridico.\n\n12.\n\nNoting the offer \"to provide further support for or clarification of [its] proposal\" in the Claimant's letter of 22 November 2002, the Tribunal asked the Claimant to provide such additional information by 27 November 2002. On 27 November 2002, the Claimant made additional submissions in respect of its proposal to disqualify Mr Thomas. SGS presented allegations of fact and standards in ICSID case law in respect of proposals of disqualification made on the ground that an arbitrator manifestly could not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment, as required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. SGS noted that Mr Thomas had also disclosed in his curriculum vitae that one of the NAFTA cases in which he represented Mexico was *Robert Azinian and Others* v. *United Mexican States.1* In the *Azinian* case, SGS observed, the presiding arbitrator was Mr Paulsson, as in the *GAMI* case. The Claimant further commented that the *Azinian* tribunal had dismissed all claims brought against Mexico, but that neither Mr Thomas nor his firm are described as counsel to Mexico in the award. SGS stated that, \"although Mr Thomas' representation of Mexico in the *Azinian* case does appear on his CV, Mr Thomas had not specifically drawn the attention of the parties or his fellow arbitrators to that representation, or to the fact that Mr Paulsson presided over the tribunal in *Azinian* and issued an award, with his co-arbitrators, which was entirely in favour of Mr Thomas' client\".\n\nICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2; award dispatched to the parties on 1 November 1999; text in 39 ILM 537 (2000) [5 *ICSID Reports* 269].\n\n13.\n\nSGS further stated that:\n\nSGS's very real and serious concern is that Mr Thomas may feel indebted to Mr Paulsson\u2014 whether consciously or not\u2014following the issuance by Mr Paulsson's tribunal in the *Azinian* case of an award that was very favourable to Mexico, represented in that case by Mr Thomas. SGS reasonably apprehends, as a result, that there is a real risk of partiality on the part of Mr Thomas, that the appearance of impartiality of Mr Thomas is placed in clear doubt, and that there is some reasonable doubt as to Mr Thomas' impartiality. SGS's entirely reasonable concerns are compounded when the relationship between Messrs Thomas and Paulsson arising out of the *Azinian* dispute is considered together with the relationship between the two gentlemen in the *GAMI* matter.\n\n14.\n\nSGS indicated in its proposal that it does not suggest that, \"generally speaking\", Mr Thomas lacks any of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention other than independence and impartiality with respect to the dispute in the present case.\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal invited Pakistan to comment on the Claimant's submissions by 6 December 2002.\n\nFollowing an extension requested by Pakistan and granted by the President, the Respondent filed a \"Response to Claimant's Challenge to Mr Thomas\" on 11 December 2002.\n\n16.\n\nIn its response, the Respondent states that there is no reasonable basis for SGS's alleged apprehension that Mr Thomas manifestly lacks the independence and impartiality necessary under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. That apprehension, in the view of the Respondent, is not based on facts, but is purely speculative. Pakistan emphasizes that Mr Thomas did not appoint Mr Paulsson in the *Azinian* dispute, that the award in that case was unanimous with two highly reputable co-arbitrators and was not subsequently challenged. It added that Mr Thomas' role in the *Azinian* arbitration had been disclosed in his curriculum vitae and in his above-mentioned article on fair and equitable treatment. Pakistan goes on to say that:\n\n[w]hen Mr Thomas was appointed by Pakistan, Mr Paulsson was not involved as an arbitrator in any matters in which Mr Thomas was counsel. At the time Mr Paulsson was appointed President in the *GAMI* Arbitration, neither Mr Thomas nor his partners were to Mr Paulsson's knowledge acting as counsel for Mexico. Furthermore, as noted by Mr Thomas and confirmed by Mr Paulsson, the proposal to nominate Mr Paulsson as President of the tribunal in the *GAMI* Arbitration came from counsel for the investor. Clearly, the investor would not propose Mr Paulsson as the President of the tribunal if there was so much as a hint of a possibility that Mr Paulsson was predisposed toward Mexico's position. Finally, Mr Thomas has already advised the Government of Mexico that he is prepared not to appear in the *GAMI* Arbitration if the Tribunal is of the view that it would prefer him not to appear.\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that SGS's proposal for disqualification of Mr Thomas should be dismissed.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of 13 December 2002, Mr Thomas provided further statements to the Tribunal concerning the Claimant's proposal for disqualification. Mr Thomas firmly rejects the suggestion that he may feel indebted to Mr Paulsson or any member of the tribunal or to the tribunal as a whole, following rendition of the *Azinian* award in favour of Mexico and stresses his conviction that that award was rendered on its merits and the matter handled \"in a professional manner on all sides\". He expresses the same belief in respect of the *GAMI* proceeding that counsel on both sides will do their job in marshalling the facts and the governing law and that the tribunal will discharge its duties to the parties in accordance with applicable law. Mr Thomas closes by emphasizing vigorously that he is disinterested in the outcome of the present proceeding in the sense that he is content accepting the judgment, \"either way\", of the other members of the Tribunal, as the ICSID Rules require.\n\n*Discussion: Appraisal of the Challenge to Arbitrator*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nWe begin by noting that the applicable standard for appraising a challenge or proposal to disqualify an arbitrator in an ICSID case is set out with clarity and economy in the ICSID Convention. Article 57 of the Convention provides that a party may propose an arbitrator's disqualification \"on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14\" of the Convention. Article 14(1) requires, among other things, that an arbitrator must be a person \"who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment\". This is the quality demanded of arbitrators that is under contention in this challenge proceeding. SGS does not dispute that Mr Thomas possesses the other prescribed qualifications. Neither does SGS allege that Mr Thomas cannot *generally* be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. What SGS claims in this proceeding is that it \"reasonably apprehend[s] a real risk of partiality on the part of Mr Thomas\" *in respect of the instant case.*\n\n20.\n\nThe standard of appraisal of a challenge set forth in Article 57 of the Convention may be seen to have two constituent elements: (a) there must be a fact or facts (b) which are of such a nature or character as to \"indicat[e] a manifest lack of the qualities required by\" Article 14(1). The party challenging an arbitrator must establish facts, of a kind or character as reasonably to give rise to the inference that the person challenged clearly may not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment in the particular case where the challenge is made. The first requisite that facts must be established by the party proposing disqualification, is in effect a prescription that mere speculation or inference cannot be a substitute for such facts. The second requisite of course essentially consists of an inference, but that inference must rest upon, or be anchored to, the facts established. An arbitrator cannot, under Article 57 of the Convention, be successfully challenged as a result of inferences which themselves rest merely on other inferences.\n\n21.\n\nIt is important to stress that the inference which constitutes the second constituent element must itself be reasonable. There must, in other words, if the challenge is to succeed, be a clear and reasonable relationship between the constituent facts and the constituent inference they generate. The facts established or undisputed must, in the circumstances of the particular case, be plainly capable of giving rise to the inference claimed to be derived from such facts. The inference resulting from the facts must be that, manifestly, that is, clearly, the person challenged is not to be relied upon for independent judgment, or that a readily apparent and reasonable doubt as to that person's reliability for independent judgment has arisen from the facts established or not disputed. More succinctly, the critical inference must be reasonable in view of the facts from which it springs and should accord with the common experience of the pertinent community of arbitrators and lawyers.\n\n22.\n\nThe above view is in line with the careful substantive statement made in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija & Vivendi Universal* v. *Argentine Republic;* Decision on the Challenge to the President of the Committee:\n\n[I]t is clear that that term [\"manifest\"] cannot preclude consideration of facts previously undisclosed or unknown, *provided that these are duly established at the time the decision is made... [T]he term must exclude reliance on speculative assumptions or arguments\u2014* for example, assumptions based on prior and in themselves innocuous social contacts between the challenged arbitrator and a party. But in cases *where* (as here) *the facts are established* and no further inference of impropriety is sought to be derived from them, *the question seems to us to be whether a real risk of lack of impartiality based upon those facts (and not on any mere speculation or inference) could reasonably be apprehended by either party.* If (and only if) the answer is yes can it be said that the arbitrator may not be relied on to exercise independent judgment. That is to say, *the circumstances actually established (and not merely supposed or inferred) must negate or place in clear doubt the appearance of impartiality. If the facts would lead to the raising of some reasonable doubt as to the impartiality of the arbitrator or member,* the appearance of security for the parties would disappear and a challenge by either party would have to be upheld. Once the other arbitrators or Committee members had become convinced of this conclusion, there would no longer be room for the view that the deficiency was not \"manifest\". (Emphasis added)2\n\nText in 17 *ICSID Review\u2014Foreign Investment Law Journal,* 168, 179-80 (2002) [6 *ICSID Reports 330].* The above view is also consistent with the Decision made by Professor Berthold Goldman and Professor Isi Foighel on the Proposal to Disqualify an Arbitrator (24 June 1982), in *Amco Asia Corporation and Others* v. *The Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), pp. 12, 14, unpublished. The Decision on Respondent's Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator, by Arbitrators Davis R. Robinson and Seymour J. Rubin, dated 19 January 2001, in *Zhinvali Development Limited* v. *Republic of Georgia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/1), p. 7, unpublished, is similarly instructive. The decision of the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris of 28 October 1988 in *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Drexel Burnham Lambert Limited et autres* c. *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Philipp Brothers et autres,* Rev. arb., 497, 503 (1990), is quite helpful: \"Attendu que si la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Philipp Brothers all\u00e9gue l'existence de 'liens privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s' et de relations de subordination, entre les arbitres et les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s en litiges, ou meme d'lnimiti\u00e9 notoire a son \u00e9gard, il n'est pas \u00e9tabli, autrement que de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et trop souvent indistincte, la realit\u00e9 de faits, comportements ou attitudes pr\u00e9cis de nature a pouvoir consid\u00e9rer que l'ind\u00e9pendance et l'impartialit\u00e9 de chacun d'eux font d\u00e9faut.\" See also D. Hascher, ICC Practice in Relation to the Appointment, Confirmation, Challenge and Replacement of Arbitrators; in The ICC International Court of Arbitration Bulletin, Vol. 6, No. 2, 4, at 16 (1995): \"For challenges before the ICC Court to be successful, *it is necessary that the information collected from the challenged arbitrator, the other members of the arbitral tribunal and the parties corroborate the pleas set out in the challenge. In every case, substantiated objective grounds* \u2014in other words, *precise full and relevant proof of the facts that adversely affect the arbitrator's independence or judgment must be submitted...* After the tribunal is constituted, if the party submitting the challenge can merely proffer *vague assertions, unsupported by evidence that can be checked objectively,* the Court will reject the challenge.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n23.\n\nIn the instant challenge proceeding, the principal facts which appear to us relevant and which have been established, or are not disputed, may be summarized in the following manner:\n\n(a) In another ICSID case, *GAMI* v. *United Mexican States,* bearing no relationship to the instant case, Mr Jan Paulsson, member of the firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (Freshfields), was nominated as President of the tribunal by the claimant GAMI. Respondent Mexico, represented by its agent and lead counsel, Lic. Hugo Perezcano D\u00edaz, agreed to the proposal. Mr Paulsson accepted the appointment.\n\n(b) Mr Thomas, co-arbitrator in the instant case, played no role in the identification and nomination of Mr Paulsson as President of the *GAMI* tribunal. Those events took place after Mr Thomas had been appointed as arbitrator, and commenced acting as such, in the instant case, by the Respondent. By his letter to the Tribunal of 12 November 2002, which per his request was provided to the parties, Mr Thomas, of his own accord, invited attention to the nomination and appointment of Mr Paulsson as President of the *GAMI* tribunal. In the same letter, Mr Thomas re-affirmed his independence and impartiality in the instant case.\n\n(c) Freshfields is co-counsel, with the Attorney General of Pakistan and Mr Salman Talibuddin of the law firm M/s Kabraji & Talibuddin, for the Respondent in the instant case.\n\n(d) Mr Thomas' firm, Thomas and Partners, has a continuing retainer relationship with Mexico and has assisted Lic. Hugo Perezcano D\u00edaz, Consultor Juridico, Subsecretaria de Negociaciones Comerciales Internacionales, Direccion General de Consultoria Juridica de Negociaciones, Secretaria de Comercio y Fomento Industrial, Government of Mexico, in NAFTA and ICSID cases. In the *GAMI* case, Mr C. Mowatt of Mr Thomas' firm will be assisting Mr Perezcano D\u00edaz, who customarily is agent and lead counsel for Mexico in such cases. Mr Perezcano D\u00edaz is also customarily assisted by a firm of US lawyers. Mr Thomas volunteered not to appear before the *GAMI* tribunal, *ex abundante cautela.*\n\n(e) In *Robert Azinian and others* v. *The United Mexican States*, the tribunal, with Mr Paulsson as President, rendered on 1 November 1999 a unanimous award that dismissed all the claims and contentions of the Claimants and ruled in favour of the Respondent. The award mentions that Mexico was represented by Mr Perezcano D\u00edaz; no reference was made either to the US or Canadian lawyers who, in other cases, have assisted Mr Perezcano D\u00edaz. However, in his curriculum vitae submitted to ICSID and the parties to the instant case, Mr Thomas stated that he, in fact, had assisted the Mexican lead counsel in the *Azinian* case. This fact is also noted in an article Mr Thomas wrote on the fair and equitable treatment clause in Article 1105(1) of NAFTA, a copy of which was furnished to the parties in the present case at the time of his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n24.\n\nOn the basis of the above facts, established or undisputed, the Claimant asserts that it \"reasonably apprehends\" that there is \"a real risk that Mr Thomas will improperly favour\u2014unconsciously at least\u2014Mr Paulsson's client over SGS\".\n\n25.\n\nWe are not persuaded that the established or undisputed facts in this challenge proceeding are of such a nature as reasonably to give rise to the inference that SGS claims to derive from them. Such an inference is, so far as we can see, bereft of any basis in the facts of this proceeding; what we have here is simply a supposition, a speculation merely. It is commonplace knowledge that in the universe of international commercial arbitration, the community of active arbitrators and the community of active litigators are both small and that, not infrequently, the two communities may overlap, sequentially if not simultaneously. It is widely accepted that such an overlap is not, by itself, sufficient ground for disqualifying an arbitrator. Something more must be shown if a challenge is to succeed. In the instant case, that \"something more\" has not been shown by the Claimant.\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimant states that if this Tribunal eventually makes an award in favour of the Respondent, that will serve the [professional] interests of Mr Paulsson. If such eventuality materializes, the professional interests of Mr Paulsson might well be served; but if so, that will simply follow from the fact that Mr Paulsson's firm represents the Respondent here. Similarly, it may well be that, as a professional matter, Mr Thomas' interests would be served if the *GAMI* tribunal were, after the pleadings are all in and the oral hearing completed, to make an award favourable to Mexico. What the circumstances of professional representation of Pakistan in one case, and of Mexico in the other case, do *not* show is what the Claimant asserts: that is, that \"there is a clear relationship of dependency between Mr Thomas and Mr Paulsson\", if the Claimant means to imply by \"dependency\" that there is an understanding, express or implicit, between Mr Thomas and Mr Paulsson that each would vote in favour of the other's client. Such a \"reciprocal partisanship\"3 is precisely what the Claimant needs to show if its challenge is to prosper. It appears to us that the Claimant merely supposes the existence of what it must prove. The facts of record certainly do not reveal such an understanding. The facts of record are not, by themselves, sufficient reasonably to lead to the conclusion that such an understanding exists or ever existed between Mr Paulsson and Mr Thomas. As stressed earlier, supposition is no substitute for proof of facts. A supposition (that there is a \"real risk\" that Mr Thomas may not be relied upon to act with independence and impartiality in this case) standing on the shoulders of another assumption (that Mr Thomas and Mr Paulsson are \"dependent\" on each other) which itself rests on still another speculation (that Mr Paulsson and Mr Thomas have mutually agreed to favour each other's client) will not sustain the challenge in the instant case.\n\nThe phrase is borrowed by the Claimant from an article of Mr Paulsson, quoted by the Claimant in its 27 November 2002 Submission.\n\n27.\n\nWe note that the Claimant's reference to the tribunal's award in *Azinian* as \"very favorable\" to Mexico is followed promptly by the assertion that there is a \"real risk of partiality\" on the part of Mr Thomas. We are bound to observe that, after a careful reading of that award, we find no basis whatsoever for the inference of partiality on the part of the tribunal that the Claimant obliquely invites us to make. Having regard to the facts proved in *Azinian* and the law there applicable, we find it difficult to suppose that any conclusion other than rejection and dismissal of the claims of Azinian et al. could reasonably have been reached by a conscientious and impartial tribunal.\n\n28.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we believe and so hold that the Claimant's proposal for disqualification must be dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2003-08-06T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\nPART I: BACKGROUND TO THE RESPONDENT\u2019S OBJECTIONS\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nA. Introduction\n---------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Pakistan (\"Pakistan\" or the \"Respondent\") objects to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal on a number of grounds. Its principal ground is that the parties to this arbitration had previously agreed in a contract between them (the \"Pre-Shipment Inspection Agreement\" or the \"PSI Agreement\") to refer \"[a]ny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, or relating to\" the Agreement, \"or breach, termination or invalidity thereof,\" to arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act of the Territory (of Pakistan) as presently in force.\n\n2.\n\nPakistan observes that at its request such an arbitral process was initiated and that it predates the Claimant\u2019s Request for ICSID Arbitration by some eleven months. It requests this Tribunal to recognize the primacy of the jurisdiction of the parties\u2019 freely negotiated dispute settlement mechanism over the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. This Tribunal was subsequently created by virtue of the 12 October 2001 Request of the Claimant, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. (\"SGS\" or the \"Claimant\"), for ICSID arbitration pursuant to Article 9(2) of the *Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments* (the \"Treaty\" or the \"BIT\"). Pakistan asks the Tribunal to dismiss the present claims on the ground that a more specialized tribunal has already been established by agreement of the parties and that tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction can encompass all of the claims presently before this Tribunal. In sum, according to Pakistan, that tribunal, not this one, should hear the parties\u2019 claims.\n\n3.\n\nPakistan therefore requests that the Tribunal order the dismissal of SGS\u2019s claims as set forth in its Request for Arbitration dated 12 October 2001, and the Claimant to pay the full costs arising from its Request, including the fees and expenses of Pakistan\u2019s legal counsel.1\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction (\"Objections\") at paragraph 151.\n\n4.\n\nSGS opposes the objection. It asserts that once the Treaty entered into force and an investment dispute arose between the parties, it was free at any time to invoke the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. SGS argues that the PSI Agreement arbitration must give way to this arbitration which has been initiated pursuant to a treaty in which Pakistan made a general offer to arbitrate investment disputes. SGS accepted Pakistan\u2019s offer to arbitrate by issuing its own consent and ICSID jurisdiction has thus been constituted by the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate.\n\n5.\n\nSGS submits further that this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is broader than that of the PSI Agreement arbitrator and includes jurisdiction not only over alleged breaches of the Treaty, an inter-State agreement, but also both parties\u2019 claims of alleged breaches of the PSI Agreement, a State-private investor agreement.\n\n6.\n\nSGS therefore requests that the Tribunal reject Pakistan\u2019s Objections, and retain jurisdiction over the claims raised by SGS in this arbitration; order Pakistan to pay the full costs incurred by SGS in resisting Pakistan\u2019s Objections, including the fees and expenses of SGS\u2019s legal counsel and expert and proceed to hear the merits of SGS\u2019s claims.2\n\nSGS\u2019s Reply at paragraph 228\n\n7.\n\nThe foregoing summaries of the parties\u2019 submissions and requests for relief identify, by way of introduction, the basic issues that divide them. The Tribunal will review the parties\u2019 specific arguments in greater detail below.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal set a schedule for the filing of written pleadings as follows:\n\n\u2022 Pakistan\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction, to be filed on 22 October 2002;\n\n\u2022 SGS\u2019s Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction, to be filed on 10 December 2002;\n\n\u2022 Pakistan\u2019s Reply, to be filed on 10 January 2003; and\n\n\u2022 SGS\u2019s Rejoinder, to be filed on 10 February 2003.\n\n9.\n\nThe parties\u2019 pleadings were duly filed and an oral hearing was held on 13-14 February 2003 at the World Bank\u2019s offices in Paris.\n\nB. The contractual relationship between the parties\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nIt is necessary to recount the origins of the relationship between the parties. While the parties diverge as to the PSI Agreement\u2019s legal significance for the purposes of the Objections, there is no doubt that the disputes which have arisen between them emerged from a relationship defined initially by contract. In setting out the factual background of this case, the Tribunal is not making findings of fact and is either relying upon the facts as alleged by the Claimant (which are taken to be true solely for the purposes of the Objections to Jurisdiction) or on what appear to the Tribunal to be undisputed facts.\n\n11.\n\nFollowing a series of discussions, written communications, and negotiations, on 29 September 1994, the Government of Pakistan entered into a contract with SGS whereby SGS agreed to provide \"pre-shipment inspection\" services with respect to goods to be exported from certain countries to Pakistan.3 SGS undertook to inspect such goods (i) abroad through its offices and affiliates; and (ii) at Pakistani ports of entry jointly with Pakistani Customs.4 The objective of such inspection was to ensure that goods were classified properly for duty purposes and to enable Pakistan to increase the efficiency of its customs revenues collection and thereby contribute to the national treasury. SGS was to (i) physically identify goods; (ii) verify their dutiable value prior to shipment; and (iii) recommend appropriate customs classifications to the Pakistani authorities for goods to be imported into Pakistan.5 Once goods were pre-inspected, SGS was required to prepare a Clean Report of Findings (CRF) containing the information gathered by the local SGS office or affiliate in the different countries of supply, together with a recommendation for a tariff rate for each particular item, and verification of the relevant goods within Pakistani territory.6 Pakistan was to rely upon the CRFs issued by SGS for the purpose of collecting the correct duties and taxes leviable on inspected imports.\n\nSGS\u2019s Request for Arbitration (the \"Request\"), dated 12 October 2001, at paragraphs 5-10.\n\n*Id.* at paragraph 11.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n12.\n\nArticle 4 of the PSI Agreement required SGS to prepare and submit to Pakistan monthly reports. These reports were to set forth:\n\n(a) The value of orders received and goods inspected by country of supply;\n\n(b) The estimated amount of customs revenue generated by country of supply;\n\n(c) The incremental amount of duties and taxes realized by Pakistan as a result of the PSI Agreement; and\n\n(d) A description of SGS\u2019s findings in the pre-inspection process.7\n\nPSI Agreement, Article 4. Exhibit S3 to the Request for Arbitration.\n\n13.\n\nPursuant to Article 5.7 and 5.8 of the PSI Agreement, SGS was given permission to open one or more liaison offices in Pakistan and the Government undertook to ensure that SGS obtained the necessary immigration and working permits and authorizations.8 These offices were to convey information to Pakistan\u2019s customs authorities. The offices were to be \"restricted to carrying out liaison activities and [could] not indulge in any commercial or trading activities whatsoever.\"9 SGS established two such offices in Karachi and Lahore as duly authorized by Pakistan\u2019s Board of Investment.10\n\n*Id.,* Article 5.7.\n\nLetter from Pakistan\u2019s Investment Promotion Board to SGS, dated 22 December 1994, at paragraph i. Exhibit S4 to the Request for Arbitration.\n\nSGS\u2019s Request at paragraph 13.\n\n14.\n\nThe PSI Agreement had a term of five years that was renewable automatically provided neither party objected to such renewal in writing. In addition, pursuant to Article 10.6, Pakistan had the right to terminate the PSI Agreement after the first appraisal of SGS\u2019s work, by giving three months notice. \"After the expiry of the first full financial year and the appraisal as aforesaid, any of the two parties [had] the right to terminate the agreement at any subsequent time after giving a three months notice of such termination to the other party.\"11\n\nPSI Agreement, Article 10.6.\n\n15.\n\nThe PSI Agreement contained a dispute settlement provision in its Article 11, entitled \"Arbitration and Governing Law,\" the relevant part of which stated:\n\n*Arbitration.* Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, or relating to this Agreement, or breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall as far as it is possible, be settled amicably. Failing such amicable settlement, any such dispute shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act of the Territory as presently in force. The place of arbitration shall be Islamabad, Pakistan and the language to be used in the arbitration proceedings shall be the English language.12\n\n*Id.,* Article 11.\n\n16.\n\nThe PSI Agreement entered into force on 1 January 1995. It was subsequently performed by both parties in the sense that services were rendered by SGS and invoices issued by it were paid by Pakistan. Both parties dispute the adequacy of the other\u2019s performance, but for the purposes of resolving these Objections it is unnecessary to inquire into these matters of contractual performance. On 12 December 1996, the Government of Pakistan notified SGS that the PSI Agreement was terminated with effect from 11 March 1997.\n\n17.\n\nIn various *fora,* SGS has described Pakistan\u2019s act as follows: the Agreement was not \"validly terminated\" by the Respondent;13 there was a \"wrongful repudiation of contract\";14 there was an \"unlawful and ineffective\" termination of the PSI Agreement;15 and there were \"breaches of the PSI Agreement as well as violations of the BIT\" that \"therefore give rise to Pakistan\u2019s liability to SGS for breach of contract, as well as its liability to SGS for infringement of the BIT.\"16\n\nPetition filed by SGS with the Court of First Instance of Geneva, at page 12.

Exhibit Pl 5 to the Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\nC. Chronology of post-PSI Agreement termination events\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nAfter notice of termination was given by Pakistan, communications were exchanged between the two parties as well as between the Government of the Swiss Confederation and the Government of Pakistan. These communications did not lead to a resolution of the dispute and on 12 January 1998, SGS initiated a commercial claim in the courts of Switzerland seeking relief against what it alleged was Pakistan\u2019s unlawful termination of the PSI Agreement.\n\n1. The Swiss legal proceedings\n------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nSGS\u2019s Petition in the Court of First Instance of Geneva, Switzerland, alleged wrongful termination of the PSI Agreement. That Agreement, according to SGS, was perfectly performed by SGS from 1 January 1995 to 11 March 1997. Pakistan had never, before 29 December 1997, pretended that the contract was null *ab initio;* to the contrary, Pakistan on 12 December 1996 purported to terminate the contract *ex nunc.* Moreover, during the period from 1 January 1995 to 11 March 1997, the Government of Pakistan had, without reservations, partially paid the invoices issued by SGS Geneva. The Government of Pakistan hence, still owed the following amount for services rendered by SGS before 12 March 1997, which amounts were due in accordance with Article 6.5 of the PSI Agreement:\n\nIn capital: U.S.$8,368,430.49\n\nIn interests: U.S.$1,065,371.7518\n\nEnglish translation of the Petition to the Court of First Instance, dated 12 January 1998. Exhibit 3 to Respondents Objections to the Claimant\u2019s Request for Urgent Provisional Measures.\n\n21.\n\nSGS\u2019S prayer for relief asked the Geneva Court of First Instance:\n\n(a) to declare its jurisdiction to decide the Petition;\n\n(b) to determine that the PSI Agreement had not been validly terminated *ab initio* by Pakistan;\n\n(c) to require Pakistan to pay to SGS the amounts of\n\nIn capital: U.S.$8,386,430.49\n\nIn interests until December 31, 1997: U.S.$1,065,371.75\n\n(d) To order Pakistan to pay SGS interest at the rate of 7.5% in accordance with Article 6.6 of the PSI Agreement (LIBOR for three (3) months plus 2%) on the mentioned capital amount from January 1, 1998 without prejudice to any other claims of SGS in particular for damages \"for abusive termination of contract;\" and;\n\n(e) Finally, to dismiss the contrary submissions of Pakistan and to require Pakistan to pay all legal costs.19\n\n*id.*\n\n22.\n\nPakistan opposed this claim on various grounds but principally on the ground that the parties had agreed to the arbitration of any disputes arising out of the PSI Agreement rather than to submit to the courts of any country and on the ground that as a sovereign State it was immune to the legal process of the Swiss courts.\n\n23.\n\nOn 24 June 1999, the Court of First Instance rejected SGS\u2019s claim, principally on the first ground asserted by the Respondent.20 SGS then appealed to the Court of Appeal of Geneva. On 23 June 2000, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal but on grounds (basically, that of sovereign immunity) different from those specified by the Court of First Instance.21 SGS then appealed to the Swiss Federal Tribunal.\n\nJudgment on Exception of the Court of First Instance. Exhibit 4 to the Respondent\u2019s Objections to the Claimant\u2019s Request for Urgent Provisional Measures.\n\nCourt of Appeal of Geneva\u2019s decision in the Civil Case, June 23, 2000. Exhibit 2C to the Respondent\u2019s Index of Swiss Court Proceedings.\n\n24.\n\nThe Swiss legal proceedings concluded with the denial of the Claimant\u2019s final appeal on 23 November 2000. Both appellate courts, the Court of Appeal of Geneva and the Swiss Federal Tribunal upheld the judgment of the Geneva Court of First Instance, but on the ground of sovereign immunity. These legal proceedings (the \"Swiss legal proceedings\") unfolded over a period of some twenty-two months.\n\n25.\n\nNo further appeal was available in the Swiss court hierarchy once the Federal Tribunal dismissed SGS\u2019s appeal.\n\n2. Pakistan\u2019s initiation of the PSI Agreement arbitration\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nOn 11 September 2000, after the judgments of the first two Swiss courts were rendered, but before the judgment of the Swiss Federal Tribunal was issued, Pakistan formally invoked Article 11.1 of the PSI Agreement to commence arbitration proceedings in Pakistan. (The Tribunal will refer to this proceeding as the \"PSI Agreement arbitration.\") Pakistan applied to the Court of the Senior Civil Judge, Islamabad, pursuant to s. 20 of the Pakistan Arbitration Act, 1940, for an order that the dispute between the parties be referred for decision by an arbitrator to be appointed by the Court.22 (Pakistan did not file a Statement of Claim at this time.)\n\nExhibit S25 to the Claimant\u2019s Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n27.\n\nSGS then appeared before the Senior Civil Judge by filing, on 7 April 2001, a set of preliminary objections to the PSI Agreement arbitration and, without prejudice to such objections, a counter-claim against Pakistan for alleged breaches of the PSI Agreement.23\n\n*Id.*\n\n28.\n\nWith respect to the merits, SGS alleged that there had been a wrongful repudiation of the PSI Agreement and that:\n\n...the wrongful repudiation of contract by the Government of Pakistan and its subsequent, false, malicious and politically motivated accusations have caused colossal loss and damages to the Respondent...24\n\nReply on behalf of the Respondent in the matter of *Islamic Republic of Pakistan* v. *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A.,* at counter-claim, paragraph 2. Exhibit 6 to the Respondent\u2019s Objections to the Claimant\u2019s Request for Urgent Provisional Measures.\n\n29.\n\nSGS thus claimed the following relief:\n\n(a) Payment of outstanding invoices for services rendered, U.S.$8,368,430.48;\n\n(b) Interest on unpaid invoices in the amount of U.S.$2,299,953.38;\n\n(c) Damages for premature termination of the PSI Agreement, U.S.$31,500,000;\n\n(d) Demobilisation costs, U.S.$2,400,000;\n\n(e) Reputation damage due to Pakistan\u2019s allegedly defamatory statements, U.S.$213,000,000;\n\n(f) Damages for loss of opportunity, U.S.$70,000,000;\n\n(g) Legal fees and expenses, U.S.$1,500,000; and\n\n(h) Interest at the rate specified in the PSI Agreement from the date of termination to the date of payment on all amounts claimed.25\n\n*Id.*\n\n3. SGS\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration under the Treaty\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nApproximately eleven months after Pakistan initiated the PSI Agreement arbitration and some six months after the filing of its objections to jurisdiction and its counter-claim in the PSI Agreement arbitration, by letter dated 10 October 2001, SGS wrote to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan (copied to the President and the Minister of Finance of Pakistan and the Ambassador of Pakistan to the Swiss Confederation), referring to the Treaty and observing that disputes had arisen between the two parties \"in connection with investments by SGS, and notably with the Pre-Shipment Program established by SGS.\"26\n\nLetter from SGS to Pakistan dated 10 October 2001. Exhibit SI8 to the Request for Arbitration.\n\n31.\n\nThe letter went on to state:\n\nThese disputes concern, in particular, non-payment by Pakistan of invoices submitted to SGS (sic), and Pakistan\u2019s attempts to terminate the SGS-Pakistan Agreement. Pakistan\u2019s acts and omissions in this connection constitute violations of a number of obligations owed to SGS pursuant to the Swiss-Pakistan Agreement, as well as breaches of the SGS-Pakistan Agreement.27\n\n*Id.*\n\n32.\n\nSGS therefore informed Pakistan that it was now seeking resolution of these disputes under the Treaty and that pursuant to its Article 9(2), SGS consented to the submission of the said disputes to arbitration by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).28\n\n*Id.*\n\n33.\n\nBy letter dated 12 October 2001, SGS dispatched a Request for Arbitration to the Secretary-General of the ICSID.29\n\nRequest for Arbitration, dated 12 October 2001.\n\n34.\n\nAt paragraphs 33-38 of the Request, SGS set out its claims and request for relief as follows:\n\n33. As introduced above, SGS performed its obligations under the PSI Agreement in full and carried out the pre-shipment inspections of goods to be imported into Pakistan from January 1, 1995 until March 11, 1997.\n\n34. In contrast, Pakistan unlawfully purported to terminate the PSI Agreement, depriving SGS of the profits and opportunities that it would have enjoyed had the contract continued to be performed in accordance with its terms. Pakistan has also failed to pay invoices in a total principal amount of US$8,368,430.49. SGS has also suffered serious and unjustified damage to its reputation as a result of Pakistan\u2019s conduct.\n\n35. These acts and omissions by Pakistan constitute blatant violations of its obligations to SGS under the BIT. In particular, Pakistan has:\n\n- failed to promote SGS\u2019s investment in violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT;\n\n- failed to protect SGS\u2019s investment, in violation of Article 4(1) of the BIT. Pakistan has, notably, impaired by its unreasonable conduct the enjoyment by SGS of its investment;\n\n- failed to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of SGS\u2019s investment, in violation of Article 4(2) of the BIT; and\n\n- taken measures of expropriation, or measures having the same nature or the same effect, against SGS\u2019s investment, in violation of Article 6(1) of the BIT. This violation exists, in particular, because Pakistan has not provided SGS with effective and adequate compensation; and failed to constantly guarantee the observance of the commitments it has entered into with respect to SGS\u2019s investments, in violation of Article 11 of the BIT. In particular, Pakistan has failed to guarantee the observance of its contractual commitments under the PSI Agreement.\n\n36. In addition, most or all of Pakistan\u2019s acts and omissions described above qualify as breaches of the PSI Agreement as well as violations of the BIT. They therefore give rise to\n\nPakistan\u2019s liability to SGS in breach of contract, as well as its liability to SGS for infringement of the BIT.\n\n37. In this proceeding, SGS will seek relief including the following items:\n\n(i) payment of outstanding invoices (US$8,368,430.49);\n\n(ii) compensation for profits lost as a result of Pakistan\u2019s unlawful acts and omissions, provisionally quantified at US$31,500,000;\n\n(iii) compensation for demobilization costs of the SGS Pre-Shipment infrastructure, including its liaison offices in Pakistan, amounting to US$ 2,400,000;\n\n(iv) compensation for opportunities lost as a result of Pakistan\u2019s unlawful acts and omissions, provisionally quantified at US$70,000,000;\n\n(v) compensation for damage to SGS\u2019s reputation resulting from Pakistan\u2019s unlawful acts and omissions, to be quantified later in this proceeding;\n\n(vi) the reimbursement of all costs incurred by SGS in pursuing the resolution of the claims brought in this arbitration, including but not limited to the fees and/or expenses of the arbitrators, ICSID, legal counsel, experts and SGS\u2019s own staff;\n\n(vii) compounded interest on all amounts awarded at an appropriate rate or rates, and over an appropriate period or periods; and\n\n(viii) any other relief, that the Arbitral Tribunal shall deem appropriate.\n\n38. This request for relief, together with all statements of fact and law contained in this Request for Arbitration, will be amplified during the course of this arbitration.30\n\n*Id.*\n\n4. The ensuing court proceedings in Pakistan\n--------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nHaving initiated the present ICSID arbitration, SGS then took steps to oppose the PSI Agreement arbitration. On 4 January 2002, SGS filed an application with the Senior Civil Judge, Islamabad, for an injunction against the PSI Agreement arbitration on the ground principally that SGS was entitled to have the dispute settled through ICSID arbitration and that the PSI Agreement arbitration should be stayed until the ICSID Tribunal determined Pakistan\u2019s objection to its jurisdiction.31\n\nExhibit Pl to Respondents Objections to the Claimant\u2019s Request for Urgent Provisional Measures.\n\n36.\n\nOn 7 January 2002, the application was rejected by the Senior Civil Judge who also directed both parties to submit the names of arbitrators, one of whom could be appointed to arbitrate the PSI Agreement dispute. SGS then appealed to the Lahore High Court. The Lahore High Court dismissed that appeal on 14 February 2002.32\n\n*Id.*\n\n37.\n\nSGS appealed further to the Supreme Court of Pakistan on 5 March 2002. Pakistan, for its part, filed its own appeal against one paragraph of the Lahore High Court\u2019s judgment and filed as well an application for an injunction to restrain SGS from pursuing the ICSID arbitration.33\n\n*Id.*\n\n38.\n\nFollowing the parties\u2019 respective petitions filed in the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Court, on 15 March 2002, allowed both petitions and granted leave to appeal. At the same time, the Supreme Court restrained both parties from pursuing their respective arbitration proceedings pending a decision on their appeals. While the two appeals were before the Supreme Court, on 17 April 2002, an application was made by the Government of Pakistan to the Court to hold SGS in contempt of court because it had taken steps in furtherance of this ICSID arbitration. The contempt application has been addressed in the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2, and it is unnecessary to discuss that further in the context of these Objections.\n\n39.\n\nOn 3 July 2002, the Supreme Court of Pakistan rendered its final decision on both appeals, dismissing the Claimant\u2019s appeal and granting the Respondent\u2019s request to proceed with the PSI Agreement arbitration and restraining the Claimant from pursuing or participating in the ICSID arbitration.34\n\n*id.*\n\n40.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s Reasons for Judgment were followed on 7 July 2002 with the appointment of Mr. Justice (Retd.) Nasir Aslam Zahid as sole arbitrator to hear the PSI Agreement arbitration.35\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan (Appellate Jurisdiction) on Civil Appeal Nos. 459 *(Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A.* v. *Pakistan, through Secretary Ministry of Finance, Revenue Division, Islamabad)* 460 *(Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Finance, Revenue Division, Islamabad v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A.),* June 2002, at paragraph 78. Exhibit P21 to Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n41.\n\nThe newly appointed PSI Agreement arbitrator accepted his appointment and scheduled a meeting with the parties for 18 October 2002. After SGS\u2019s application for interim measures of protection was heard by this Tribunal at The Hague, The Netherlands, and this Tribunal recommended a stay of that arbitration until this Tribunal determined whether it had jurisdiction to consider the claims brought before it, the PSI Agreement arbitrator agreed to stay that arbitration for the time being.36\n\nLetter from counsel for Pakistan to the Tribunal dated 22 November, 2002, attaching the Stay Order issued by the sole Arbitrator, Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, on 12 November 2002.\n\n42.\n\nOn 18 October 2002, Pakistan filed its Statement of Claim with the PSI Agreement arbitrator. Pakistan alleged that SGS failed to perform its obligations in accordance with the PSI Agreement and that Pakistan did not receive the benefit therefrom that it had bargained for.37 Accordingly, Pakistan\u2019s request for relief sought the following:\n\na) Restitution of the sum of US$43,211,553.00 paid to the Defendant in respect of the aforementioned 85,945 CRFs;\n\nb) Interest/compensation for moneys wrongfully received and held at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of receipt till the date of the decree on the award; and\n\nc) Any other relief that the Arbitral tribunal may deem fit and appropriate in the circumstances.38\n\nStatement of Claim, Exhibit P17 to the Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 63.\n\nPART II: PAKISTAN\u2019S OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION\n----------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nPakistan asserts that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over any of the claims set forth in SGS\u2019s Request for ICSID Arbitration. It observes that SGS has acknowledged that the present dispute *\"arises out* of Pakistan\u2019s actions and omissions with respect to the Pre-Shipment Inspection Program and the PSI Agreement\" [emphasis in original].39 The claims, \"irrespective of how SGS labels them, are entirely contractual in nature.\"40\n\nObjections, at paragraph 60, quoting the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration at paragraph 61.\n\n*Id.*\n\n44.\n\nPakistan relies upon a recent ICSID *ad hoc* Annulment Committee decision, in the *Vivendi* case,41 where the Committee stated:\n\nIn a case where the essential basis of a claim brought before an international tribunal is a breach of contract, the tribunal will give effect to any valid choice of forum clause in the contract.42\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aquas del Aconquija, S.A. and Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eauxv. Argentine Republic (\"Vivendi\"* or *\"Vivendi Annulment\"),* Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment of 3 July 2002.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 98.\n\n45.\n\nPakistan says that the essential basis of the present claims is breach of contract and that even if the labels in the Request for Arbitration were accepted at face value and SGS\u2019s claims were analyzed in terms of the three categories of \"Contract, Defamation and BIT\" claims, the broad PSI Agreement arbitration clause requires the parties to bring any dispute to the PSI Agreement arbitrator, regardless of whether such claims sound in contract, tort, or treaty.43\n\nObjections at paragraph 61.\n\n46.\n\nPakistan makes a number of other objections to this proceeding based on the doctrines of *lis pendens,* waiver, and estoppel.44 It also goes on to raise a separate and independent basis for dismissal of SGS\u2019s claims, namely, that the investment in question was not made \"in the territory\" of Pakistan as required by the BIT. Even if it was, the claims fail because SGS ignored a condition precedent to the bringing of a BIT claim. Rather than observe the 12-month consultation period imposed by the Treaty, SGS filed the Request for Arbitration with the ICSID Secretariat only two days after it notified Pakistan that it had a BIT claim.45\n\n*Id.,* at paragraphs 97-100, and 129-33.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 62.\n\n47.\n\nDuring the hearing, counsel for Pakistan set out four propositions, each of which was said to be sufficient to command the dismissal of the claim:\n\n(a) No ICSID arbitration because of the existence of another prior agreement;\n\n(b) Alternatively, no ICSID arbitration because of waiver;\n\n(c) Alternatively, no ICSID arbitration because of contractual claims; and\n\n(d) In the final alternative, ICSID arbitration would at any rate be premature.46\n\nTranscript of the Hearing (\"Transcript\"), Volume 1, p. 7, lines 15-23.\n\n48.\n\nIn its principal argument, Pakistan submits that under the ICSID Convention and under the principle of *pacta, sunt servanda,* this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction where the parties have agreed to submit disputes elsewhere. The jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals is limited to the adjudication of disputes that the parties have actually agreed to submit to the Centre and not to an alternative forum.47 Conversely, if the parties agree to submit their disputes to a forum other than ICSID, Article 26 of the ICSID Convention requires the ICSID tribunal to respect their agreement.48\n\nObjections at paragraphs 63-64. Pakistan refers in this regard to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention which states that the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction shall only extend to legal disputes \"which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"\n\nArticle 26 states: \"Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this convention.\" Pakistan refers in this respect to works such as Professor Christoph Schreuer\u2019s *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,* awards of other ICSID tribunals, and decisions of national courts. Objections, at paragraphs 65-69.\n\n49.\n\nIn Pakistan\u2019s submission,\n\n... no ICSID tribunal has ever held that it has jurisdiction over claims for breach of a particular contract containing a non-ICSID arbitration clause, regardless of whether or not the tribunal concluded it had jurisdiction over any related claims arising under a bilateral investment treaty or some other source of rights for foreign investors against the state.49\n\nObjections, at paragraph 70.\n\n50.\n\nA series of ICSID cases, beginning with the *Klockner* case, are said to support this proposition.50 Pakistan places particular reliance on the *Vivendi* Annulment Committee decision as affirming the principle of party autonomy; that Committee held that the parties\u2019 agreement to refer disputes arising under a concession contract to the courts of the province of Tucuman, Argentina, did not prevent the ICSID tribunal from dealing with BIT claims relating to the same facts. However, the Annulment Committee expressly stated that it was not holding that the ICSID tribunal had jurisdiction over claims for breach of the concession agreement. Rather, it made the statement earlier quoted, namely, that in a case where the \"essential basis of a claim brought before an international tribunal is a breach of contract, the tribunal will give effect to any valid choice of forum in that contract.\"51\n\n*Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH, et al. v. United Republic of Cameroon (\"Klockner\"),* Case No. ARB/81/2, Decision on Annulment, 3 May 1985, *Tradex Hellas S.A.* v. *Republic of Albania (\"Tradex Hellas\"),* Case No. ARB/94/2, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 December 1996, 14 ICSID Review\u2014F.I.L.J. 161 (1999), *Salini Costrutorri SpA and Italstrade SpA* v. *Kingdom of Morocco (\"Salini\"),* Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, 1 J.D.I. 196 (2002), L *anco International Inc.* v. *Argentine Republic (\"Lanco\").* Case No. ARB/97/6, Preliminary Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 December 1998, 40 ILM 457 (2001), *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal* v. *Argentine Republic (\"Vivendi\")* Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment of 3 July 2002, 41 ILM 1135 (2002).\n\nObjections at paragraphs 78-80. The passage from *Vivendi Annulment* is cited at paragraph 80 of the Memorial.\n\n51.\n\nPakistan contrasts the present case to *Vivendi,* noting that Section 11.1 of the PSI Agreement contains the parties\u2019 agreement exclusively to submit \"[a]ny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of, or relating to this Agreement or breach, termination or invalidity thereof\" to the PSI Agreement arbitrator. Based on this, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over SGS\u2019s \"Contract Claims.\"\n\n52.\n\nEven if both tribunals could exercise jurisdiction over the \"Contract Claims,\" Pakistan argues that the contractual choice of forum should control, where it broadly provides for mandatory arbitration of all disputes, the parties are identical, the claims for breach of the BIT include a pure claim for breach of contract, and the Claimant when it filed its ICSID request was already participating in contract arbitration proceedings with overlapping claims concerning the same facts and circumstances and seeking the same relief. As a result, the application of the [ *is pendens* doctrine requires dismissal of the second proceeding.52 Pakistan urges the Tribunal to follow the \"clearly expressed intention of the parties as set forth in the PSI Agreement\" and dismiss all claims in the Request for \"breach of contract.\"53\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 97.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 84.\n\n53.\n\nPakistan refers to SGS\u2019s having previously argued that this Tribunal has concurrent jurisdiction over the \"Contract Claims\" by virtue of Article 11 of the BIT. That article states:\n\nEither Contracting Party shall constantly guarantee the observance of the commitments it has entered into with respect to the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party.\n\n54.\n\nSGS has argued that Article 11.1 of the BIT \"elevates\" all contract claims to the level of claims of a breach of the BIT. Pakistan submits that claims under this Article are \"second order\" claims *(i.e.,* claims that will not ripen until after a prior determination has been made of a \"first order\" claim that a contract commitment has been breached).54 In its submission, the tribunal with the authority to make that primary determination is the PSI Agreement arbitrator.55\n\nTranscript, Volume 1, at pp. 15-16, p. 112, lines 2-7.\n\nObjections at paragraphs 87.\n\n55.\n\nEven if SGS were correct, Pakistan argues, the BIT\u2019s general provisions would be superseded by the PSI Agreement\u2019s specific agreement to arbitrate. If the Tribunal accepted SGS\u2019s view of Article 11, it would eviscerate the parties\u2019 specific arbitration agreement in this case. Previous cases have recognized that ICSID tribunals should avoid interpretations of contract provisions, in particular, arbitration clauses, that would render the clauses totally ineffective or violative of \"common sense.\"56\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 88. *Holiday Inns S.A. and others* v. *Morocco (\"Holiday Inns\"),* Case No. ARB/72/1 (an unpublished ICSID award discussed in Pierre Lalive, \"The First \u2018World Bank\u2019 Arbitration *(Holiday Inns v. Morocco)\u2014* Some Legal Problems\", 1 ICSID Reports 645) also affirmed the principle of *ut res magis valeat quam pereat.*\n\n56.\n\nIf the Tribunal accepted SGS\u2019s logic, it would negate routine forum selection clauses in thousands of State-investor contracts where States subject to BITs make routine commitments to investors.57\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 89.\n\n57.\n\nPakistan notes that the Claimant also seeks compensation for damages to its \"reputation resulting from Pakistan\u2019s unlawful acts and omissions,\" allegedly resulting from the manner in which the PSI Agreement was terminated. Pakistan describes this as a \"Defamation Claim.\" Whether it sounds in tort or contract, Pakistan says, the only forum competent to hear SGS\u2019s \"Defamation Claim\" is the PSI Agreement arbitration.58\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 91.\n\n58.\n\nPakistan notes that there is no provision in the BIT that would give the Tribunal jurisdiction over the \"Defamation Claim.\" Consequently, Pakistan argues that the Tribunal should dismiss the \"Defamation Claim\" in SGS\u2019s Request and refer SGS to the PSI Agreement arbitration.59\n\n*Id.,* at paragraphs 92 and 93.\n\n59.\n\nPakistan also controverts SGS\u2019s suggestion that this Tribunal could claim jurisdiction over Pakistan\u2019s own breach of contract claims against SGS.60 It asserts that it has only one possible forum in which to bring its own contract claims against SGS. It is bound firstly under Section 11.1 of the PSI Agreement to pursue its claims in the PSI forum. Second, nothing in the BIT provides Pakistan with any rights on which it could bring its PSI Agreement non-performance claims before an ICSID Tribunal. SGS\u2019s reliance on Article 9 of the BIT is in error as it refers merely to \"disputes with respect to investments\" and this cannot be construed as creating rights for Pakistan to submit any contract claims it has with SGS to ICSID arbitration.61\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 94.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 96.\n\n60.\n\nIn Pakistan\u2019s view, the doctrine of *lis pendens* bars SGS from submitting the \"Contract Claims\" and \"Defamation Claim.\" Where, as here, there is an identity as to parties and claims brought before two tribunals, the one receiving the claims later in time should dismiss its proceedings in favour of the first proceedings.62\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 97.\n\n61.\n\nIn this case, in contrast to ICSID cases where the doctrine\u2019s application was rejected, Pakistan argues, the PSI Agreement arbitration commenced (including SGS\u2019s counter-claim): (i) before SGS consented to ICSID jurisdiction; (ii) with the identical parties; (iii) with identical relief being sought by SGS; and (iv) involving identical causes of action for SGS. The doctrine of *lis pendens* thus requires dismissal of the \"Contract\" and \"Defamation\" claims.63\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 100.\n\n62.\n\nIn Pakistan\u2019s view, the \"essential basis\" of the \"BIT Claims\" is contractual; those claims are also therefore subject to the PSI Agreement arbitrator\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. For four years SGS has argued that Pakistan\u2019s acts or omissions were alleged breaches of contract and no reference was made to a claim of expropriation, failure to provide fair and equitable treatment, or failure to promote or protect an investment under the BIT.64 SGS filed contractual claims in the Swiss courts and contractual counter-claims in the PSI Arbitration. Pakistan argues that SGS then \"re-labeled\" its claims as \"BIT Claims.\"65 However, nothing in the Washington Convention or in ICSID jurisprudence requires the Tribunal to accept that a particular claim arises under a treaty simply because a claimant says so.66\n\nTranscript, Volume 1, pp. 95-96.\n\n*Id,* Volume 1, p. 104, lines 7-8.\n\nObjections at paragraph 102. During the hearing, counsel for Pakistan reviewed the Request for Arbitration and asserted that it \"does not allege facts which if proven would rise to a level of a breach of the BIT; accordingly, they fall to be determined by the PSI Agreement to arbitration as contract claims where they currently stand, and not before this Tribunal.\" Transcript, Volume 1, p. 84, lines 10-14 *et seq.*\n\n63.\n\nAccording to the *Vivendi Annulment* decision, the test of whether the claim sounded in contract or treaty turned on the claim\u2019s \"essential\" or \"fundamental basis.\"67 To Pakistan, the essential nature of SGS\u2019s claims \"is and always will be contractual.\"68 From December 1996 to October 2001, no mention was made of a possible treaty claim; yet the BIT was in force from May 1996. The \"Contract,\" \"Defamation\" and five \"BIT Claims\"69 are based on \"the same limited factual allegations.\"70 In addition, the prayers for relief in the Request for ICSID Arbitration and the PSI counter-claim are virtually identical. No special relief is sought for alleged BIT breaches. The Request itself states: \"this dispute arises out of Pakistan\u2019s actions and omissions with respect to the Pre-Shipment Program and the PSI Agreement.\"71 Further, SGS specifically admits that \"most or all of Pakistan\u2019s acts and omissions... qualify as breaches of the PSI Agreement as well as violations of the BIT.\"72 Accordingly, Pakistan submits that the Tribunal should treat the \"BIT Claims\" as contract claims and dismiss them.73\n\n*Vivendi Annulment,* pp. 38-39, at paragraphs 98-101.\n\nObjections, at paragraph 104.\n\nThe BIT claims are: failure to promote SGS\u2019s investment, failure to protect its investment, failure to provide fail and equitable treatment, expropriation, and failure constantly to guarantee the observance of Pakistan\u2019s commitments to SGS.\n\nObjections at paragraph 105.\n\nRequest, at paragraph 61.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 36.\n\nObjections, at paragraphs 105-109. At the hearing, counsel for the Respondent stated: \"...what the Tribunal has to look at is the claim as stated by the Claimant, and to ask itself the question, the facts as alleged, which we say are purely contractual breaches, it\u2019s all they have alleged, is that sufficient if they prove everything that they claim they wish to prove, is that sufficient to bring them into... the breach of the BIT?\" Transcript, Volume 1, p. 106, lines 11-17.\n\n64.\n\nPakistan submits further that even if SGS has separate \"BIT Claims,\" Article 11.1 of the PSI Agreement is sufficiently broad to encompass claims for breach of a treaty.\n\n65.\n\nThe principle of *generalia. specialibus non derogant* (general words do not derogate from special words) should apply: the specific agreement takes precedence over the general agreement in the BIT.74\n\nObjections at paragraph 112. The Respondent cites the *Holiday Inns, Amco Asia, Lanco,* and *Salini* cases in support of this proposition to determine whether a claim is subject to a particular dispute resolution clause. At the hearing, extensive argument was devoted to the point that the PSI Agreement arbitrator could consider claims that Pakistan breached the Treaty. Transcript, Volume 1, pp. 23-27.\n\n66.\n\nPakistan asserts that the \"arising out of or relating to\" formula used in Section 11.1 is a universally regarded broad arbitration clause. Courts and tribunals have consistently held that the \"arising out of or relating to\" formulation encompasses any and all disputes touching on the contract in question regardless of whether they sound in contract, tort, statute or treaty.75 Thus, Pakistan argues, SGS\u2019s \"BIT Claims\" are subject to arbitration before the PSI Agreement arbitrator.\n\nPakistan refers to various texts and to such cases as *Pennzoil Exploration and Production Co. v. Ramco Energy ltd., Partial Award in ICC Case No. 7319 of 1992,* and *Judgment No. 8375 of 16 November 1987* in this regard. It also cites *JJ. Ryan & Son Inc.* v. *Rhone Poulenc Textile, S.A* for the proposition that an arbitral clause that is worded \"all disputes arising in connection with the present contract\" must be construed to encompass a broad scope of arbitral issues and every dispute between the parties that has a significant relationship to the contract *regardless of the label,* attached to the dispute. *Id.,* at paragraph 113, citing J.J.. *Ryan & Son Inc.* v. *Rhone Poulenc Textile S.A.* 863 F.2d 315, 321 (4th Cir.1988). [Pakistan\u2019s emphasis.] Pakistan also cites both Redfern and Hunter and Fouchard Gaillard Goldman who, it says, agree that the phrase \"arising out of\" will embrace all disputes capable of being submitted to arbitration and arbitrators have jurisdiction as long as the terms of arbitration are wide enough to demonstrate the parties intended it to be so.\n\n67.\n\nIn Pakistan\u2019s submission, since the PSI Agreement encompasses the \"BIT Claims,\" the only remaining question is whether this Tribunal has concurrent jurisdiction over them or whether it must dismiss them in favour of the PSI Agreement arbitration. In its submission, the Tribunal does not have concurrent jurisdiction and must dismiss the \"BIT Claims\" in favour of the PSI Agreement arbitration.76\n\nObjections at paragraphs 120-128.  \n Pakistan cites *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt (\"SPPj,* Case No. ARB/84/3, for the proposition that \"a specific agreement between the parties to a dispute would naturally take precedence with respect to a bilateral treaty between the investors State and [a particular sovereign]... [This hierarchy] reflects the maxim *generalia specialibus non derogant.* \" It also cites Professor Schreuer\u2019s *Commentary* which states that a document with a dispute settlement clause which is more specific in relation to the parties and to the dispute should be given precedence over a document of more general application such as the BIT. Pakistan asserts that, contrary to SGS\u2019s assertion that the specific agreement of the parties should be rendered valueless, the PSI Agreement is a specific agreement regarding dispute resolution and should be given precedence over the more general provisions of the BIT.  \n Pakistan also distinguishes the *Vivendi Annulment* decision from the present case by noting that although both cases present superficially similar facts, in that the *Vivendi* Annulment Committee held that a contractual choice of forum clause did not supersede the parties\u2019 choice of ICSID to resolve the BIT claims, that case differs from the present one in that the clause in the operative contract provided only that \"for purposes of interpretation and application of this Contract the parties submit themselves to the [local courts].\" This was a narrow clause clearly limited to contract claims and not to BIT claims, whereas the clause in the PSI Agreement is a broad form of arbitration clause.  \n Similarly, in *Lanco* and *Salini,* Pakistan says that those cases turned either on a more narrowly drafted clause or on one that was not a true choice of forum clause since it vested jurisdiction over disputes in local courts who, as a matter of law, already had compulsory jurisdiction over the disputes. These are in contrast with the broad clause in question because it is not limited to \"interpretation and application\" of the contract but extends to any and all claims \"arising out of or relating\" thereto.\n\n68.\n\nPakistan argues further that this Tribunal should defer to the PSI Agreement arbitrator because even if, *status quo ex ante,* this Tribunal could have had concurrent jurisdiction, \"that ship has sailed.\"77 The PSI arbitrator: (i) was seized with jurisdiction over the claims of both parties first; and (ii) has a broader ability to resolve the entire dispute among the parties.78\n\nObjections at paragraph 128.\n\n*Id.*\n\n69.\n\nPakistan then addresses the effect of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention on this case. Article 26 provides that:\n\nConsent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention.\n\n70.\n\nPakistan argues that Article 26, which the negotiating history shows is merely a rule of interpretation, precludes parties from pursuing their claims in multiple *fora* simultaneously.79 Once the choice of the forum for dispute resolution has been made, the parties are bound by it. Pakistan argues that SGS has clearly made its choice to resolve the dispute by PSI Agreement arbitration and its submission to ICSID is seeking \"another remedy in the same matter\" in that the counter-claims in the PSI Arbitration are identical to the relief sought before this Tribunal. SGS thus seeks \"another remedy in the same matter.\" SGS is clearly precluded from bringing a claim before ICSID and cannot benefit from the ICSID exclusivity rule.80\n\nAt the hearing, counsel for Pakistan directed the Tribunal to the negotiating history of what became Article 26 of the Convention. The Tribunal was given excerpts from the ICSID\u2019s *History of the ICSID Convention,* a two volume work that reproduces the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the Convention. Counsel observed that the records show that the delegates to the negotiations were assured that the proposed convention would not operate so as to disrupt settled expectations or pre-existing arrangements. Transcript, Volume 1, pp. 38-47, p. 69, lines 13-16.\n\nObjections at paragraphs 130-131.\n\n71.\n\nPakistan asserts that SGS could have raised its \"BIT Claims\" in the PSI Agreement arbitration. Under the general principles of *ne bis in idem* and *res judicata,* the fact that it did not do so is irrelevant.81 It was for this reason that the Supreme Court of Pakistan held SGS was estopped from pursuing its claims before ICSID.82\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 132.\n\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, in *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A.* v. *Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* Exhibit P21 to Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction, at p. 33, paragraph 54.\n\n72.\n\nSGS has made its choice by filing first in the PSI Agreement arbitration and cannot avoid the consequences of this choice.83\n\nObjections at paragraph 133.\n\n73.\n\nPakistan notes that SGS has already argued that even if there is concurrent jurisdiction, the tribunal with narrower jurisdiction should defer to the tribunal with broader jurisdiction. Pakistan submits that the forum with the most comprehensive jurisdiction is the PSI Agreement arbitration because:\n\n(a) only the PSI Agreement arbitrator has jurisdiction over SGS\u2019s \"Contract\" and \"Defamation Claims\";\n\n(b) only the PSI Agreement arbitrator has jurisdiction over Pakistan\u2019s claims against SGS for breach of the PSI Agreement; and\n\n(c) at most, the PSI Agreement arbitrator and ICISD have concurrent jurisdiction over the \"BIT Claims.\"84\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 136.\n\n74.\n\nAccordingly, SGS\u2019s claims should be dismissed in their entirety.\n\n75.\n\nPakistan then advances a separate argument against jurisdiction: SGS\u2019s activities under the PSI Agreement did not constitute an investment within the territory of Pakistan within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the BIT because SGS\u2019s obligations were performed outside Pakistan.\n\n76.\n\nPakistan argues that the pre-inspection of goods being imported into Pakistan was conducted by pre-existing SGS controlled or affiliated entities outside Pakistan and while SGS may have invested in offices and personnel in various ports around the world in order to be able to perform its obligations under the PSI Agreement, this does not involve an investment in the territory of Pakistan.85\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 139.\n\n77.\n\nThe liaison offices established in Pakistan which SGS presents as evidence of its investment were simply to process and convey information and to bill; there was no revenue-generating activity in Pakistan, as agreed by both parties.86 Finally, Pakistan points to what it calls an admission by SGS in the Swiss legal proceedings that its activities pursuant to the PSI Agreement did not constitute an investment in the territory of Pakistan within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the BIT.87\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 140.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 143.\n\n78.\n\nPakistan also observes that possibly unlawful conduct of SGS and its employees in respect of the PSI Agreement is being investigated. In the event that it is found that the PSI Agreement was procured through bribery and corruption, Pakistan reserves its right to argue that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the claims in any event because SGS did not invest \"in accordance with the laws and regulations of\" Pakistan as required in Article 2 of the BIT.88\n\n*Id.,* at paragraphs 144-145.\n\n79.\n\nPakistan also contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction on the ground that SGS failed to comply with a mandatory 12-month consultation period before requesting ICSID to register its claim.\n\n80.\n\nArticle 9 of the BIT states:\n\n(1) For the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party and without prejudice to Article 10 of this Agreement (Disputes between Contracting Parties), consultations will take place between the parties concerned.\n\n(2) If these consultations do not result in a solution within twelve months and if the investor concerned gives written consent, the dispute shall be submitted to the arbitration of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, instituted by the Convention of Washington of March 18, 1965, for the settlement of disputes regarding investments between States and nationals of other States...\n\n81.\n\nIn Pakistan\u2019s submission, under the BIT, SGS was barred from bringing an ICSID arbitration against Pakistan until the conclusion of a 12-month consultation period regarding the alleged BIT violations. SGS notified Pakistan of its belief that a dispute within the ambit of the BIT existed only two days before it submitted a Request for ICSID Arbitration. The Tribunal must give effect to the terms of the Treaty which give Pakistan one year to discuss, analyze and potentially settle SGS\u2019s \"BIT Claims\" before proceeding to ICSID arbitration.89\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 151.\n\n82.\n\nFinally, in its Reply and at the hearing, Pakistan asserted that an ICSID arbitration would be premature at this time. The only forum capable of resolving the contract claims is the PSI Agreement arbitration and this Tribunal should stay this proceeding until that arbitration is concluded; otherwise, there would be greater costs to the parties, risks of inconsistent awards, and so on.90\n\nReply at paragraphs 116-120. Transcript, Volume 1, pp. 115-124.\n\nPART III: SGS\u2019S RESPONSE TO THE OBJECTIONS\n------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nSGS responds to Pakistan\u2019s objections by firstly pointing out that it does not accept the characterization of SGS\u2019s claims as \"Contract,\" \"Defamation\" and \"BIT Claims.\"91 All of SGS\u2019s claims are \"BIT Claims\" in the sense that they are brought before this Tribunal on the basis of the BIT. It is for the Claimant, not the Respondent, to formulate its claims; they must be taken as they are, not as Pakistan would like them to be.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction (\"Reply\") at paragraphs 31-35- SGS also filed an expert report and a supplementary report by Professor Christoph Schreuer.\n\n84.\n\nSGS alleges five breaches of the BIT (including a claim based upon what it calls the Article 11 \"umbrella clause\") and asserts that \"most or all of Pakistan\u2019s acts and omissions described above qualify as breaches of the PSI Agreement as well as violations of the BIT\":92\n\nIn other words, SGS brings before this Tribunal (i) claims alleging violations by Pakistan of a number of specific provisions of the BIT, including the \"umbrella clause\" at Article 11 of that instrument and, in the alternative to its claims alleging the violation of Article 11 of the BIT, (ii) claims alleging breaches of contract by Pakistan which do not constitute violations of the BIT.93\n\nReply at paragraph 34.\n\n*Id.*\n\n85.\n\nIn SGS\u2019s view, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over the dispute, the conditions set forth in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention must be met.94 Article 25 sets out the conditions for jurisdiction as follows:\n\n(a) the dispute must be a \"legal\" one;\n\n(b) it must \"aris[e] directly out of an investment\";\n\n(c) it must be between a Contracting State...and a national of another Contracting State; and\n\n(d) the parties to the dispute must \"consent in writing to submit [it] to the Centre.\"95\n\nArticle 25 states: The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\nReply, at paragraph 37.\n\n86.\n\nIn SGS\u2019s view, Pakistan disputes only the fourth condition. The burden is on Pakistan to prove that this is not met. There is a written consent; Pakistan contests whether that consent, and therefore the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, covers the claims before this Tribunal.96\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 39.\n\n87.\n\nThe parties\u2019 written consent consists of (i) the written offer of ICSID arbitration made by Pakistan, in Article 9 of the BIT, and (ii) the written acceptance by SGS in its letter to Pakistan of 10 October 2001.97\n\n*Id.,* at paragraphs 39-40.\n\n88.\n\nPakistan\u2019s Objection cannot be sustained because the parties\u2019 consent covers all of the claims made in the Request for Arbitration. In this regard, SGS submits that it can be established:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction extends to SGS\u2019s claims as formulated by SGS;\n\n(b) that the forum selection clause in the PSI Agreement does not diminish this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction;\n\n(c) that in the event of *prima facie* overlapping arbitration provisions, this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction must prevail;\n\n(d) that the *lis pendens* principle does not bar this Tribunal from hearing SGS\u2019s claims;\n\n(e) that SGS did not waive its right to pursue ICSID arbitration, nor is it estopped from presenting its claims to this Tribunal;\n\n(f) that this dispute is with respect to investments within the meaning of the BIT; and\n\n(g) that non-observance of the waiting period set out in the BIT does not affect this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.98\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 41.\n\n89.\n\nPakistan ignores the basic principle that it is a claimant\u2019s prerogative to formulate the claims that it is asking the judges to resolve, a principle consistently applied by ICSID tribunals.99\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 44. Transcript, Volume 1, pp. 135-139.\n\n90.\n\nIn SGS\u2019s view, it is only at the merits phase that the Tribunal will have to consider whether SGS\u2019s characterization of its claims is correct, and whether its claims succeed as a result.100 The Tribunal must decide whether claims alleging violations of the BIT, including violations of Article 11, are within its jurisdiction. It will also have to decide whether it has jurisdiction over SGS\u2019s claims alleging only breaches of the PSI Agreement, pleaded in the alternative to the alleged breaches of Article 11. What the Tribunal cannot do at this stage is decide whether SGS\u2019s claims alleging violations of the BIT are in fact, as Pakistan alleges, \"contractual claims\" or claims of any sort other than as stated by SGS.101\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 48.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 49.\n\n91.\n\nSGS observes that the BIT sets forth international law obligations of the Contracting Parties.102 An alleged violation of the BIT is therefore a breach of international law, requiring a determination based on international law standards. A breach of contract, on the other hand, is usually determined by reference to national law standards.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 50.\n\n92.\n\nEven though a claim for breach of contract and a claim for violation of the BIT may be based on similar or identical facts, they rely on fundamentally different legal bases and are assessed according to different standards. SGS refers in this regard to the *Vivendi* Annulment Committee which accepted that questions of breach of contract and violation of the BIT could be closely related:\n\nA state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and *vice versa...* The characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.103\n\n*Vivendi Annulment,* at paragraphs 95-96, quoted in the Reply at paragraph 53.\n\n93.\n\nHowever, SGS submits that this does not mean that a tribunal may not consider contractual issues when determining if there has been a breach of the BIT.104\n\nReply, at paragraph 55.\n\n94.\n\nSGS submits that Pakistan concedes that Article 9 of the BIT covers claims alleging violations of the BIT. Such claims fall within the parties\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration and this Tribunal has jurisdiction over them. Pakistan\u2019s position is that only contractual claims rather than claims alleging violations of the BIT fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and claims alleging violations of the BIT remain within it.105\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 58. SGS cites *Salini* and **Vivendi** for the \"uncontroversial principle\" that a tribunal constituted under a BIT has jurisdiction over claims alleging violations of that BIT. **Vivendi** adds that even if the contract in question refers contractual disputes to the courts of a domestic jurisdiction, it does not affect the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to consider a claim based on the provisions of a BIT.\n\n95.\n\nSGS submits that it is perfectly proper for a tribunal to interpret a contract and consider issues of contractual performance in order to determine whether there has been a breach of international law.\n\n96.\n\nAn ICSID tribunal can make determinations based on the contract and on national law in order to decide whether a State has committed a violation of its international law obligations through a breach of the BIT. SGS alleges that Pakistan\u2019s actions relating to the PSI Agreement are a breach of Articles 3(1), 4(1), 4(2) and 6(1) of the Treaty. These obligations, related to the promotion of investments, the protection of investments, the fair and equitable treatment of investments, and expropriation, are international law obligations. The fact that they are in relation to the performance of a contract does not detract from the qualification of SGS\u2019s claims as international law claims. In deciding those BIT claims, the Tribunal must consider the terms and performance of the PSI Agreement.106\n\n*Id,* at paragraphs 61 and 62.\n\n97.\n\nThis is also the case regarding SGS\u2019s claim that Pakistan breached the \"umbrella clause\" at Article 11 of the BIT. That provision states:\n\nEither Contracting Party shall constantly guarantee the observance of commitments it has entered into with respect to the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party.107\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 63.\n\n98.\n\nIn SGS\u2019s view, the inclusion of an \"umbrella clause\" such as Article 11 of the BIT has the effect of elevating a simple breach of contract claim to a treaty claim under international law.108 SGS\u2019s claim of a breach of Article 11 of the BIT is formulated as an international law claim alleging a breach of the Treaty. In deciding this, however, the Tribunal must consider whether Pakistan breached the PSI Agreement.109 Nothing prevents this Tribunal from \"taking into account and interpreting the PSI agreement and its performance\" when it considers whether the Respondent has breached the BIT.110\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 64 and Transcript, Volume 1 at pp. 140-183 and Volume 2 at pp. 74-106. SGS refers to, among others, R. Dolzer and M. Stevens, who commented in their book, *Bilateral. Investment Treaties,* on the importance of umbrella clauses in protecting the investor\u2019s contractual rights against any interference which might be caused by either a simple breach of contract or by administrative or legislative acts. Umbrella clauses are included because it \"is not entirely clear under general international law whether such measures constitute breaches of international obligations.\" (Dolzer and Stevens at p. 82.) SGS also refers in this regard to a comment of the late Ibrahim Shihata (former Secretary-General of ICSID) and to Professor Schreuer\u2019s opinion.\n\nReply, at paragraph 68.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 72.\n\n99.\n\nArticle 11 of the Treaty is characterized by the Claimant as an \"umbrella clause which says that each time you violate a provision of the contract,..., you also violate norms of international law, you violate the treaty by the same token.\"111 Counsel later elaborated on this characterization of Article 11 as follows:\n\n\u2026 1 myself prefer to call it a mirror effect clause, because in fact it is a mirror effect which it creates.\n\nYou have a violation of the contract, and the Treaty says, as if you had a mirror, that this violation will also be susceptible to being characterized as a violation of the Treaty. So the same facts, the same breach will be a violation of the contract in itself, and a violation of the Treaty.112\n\nAnd,\n\nIf I am the government and if I breach a contract, by the same token I will breach a treaty, so the useful effect of this is to create this mirror effect, to say that I will elevate in essence, and that\u2019s what it does, it may be far-reaching but that\u2019s what it does, to elevate breaches of contract as breaches of a treaty.113\n\nTranscript, Volume 1, p. 130, lines 23-25, p. 131, lines 1-3, pp. 140-168.\n\n*Id.,* Volume 1 at p. 141, lines 15-23\n\n*Id.,* Volume 1 at p.146, lines 16-21.\n\n100.\n\nSGS also maintains that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over claims by SGS which allege breach of contract as opposed to a violation of the BIT. These claims are raised in the alternative, to be decided only if the Tribunal rejects the claims that Pakistan violated the \"umbrella clause.\"114 This jurisdiction to decide contract claims results from the broad terms of Article 9 of the BIT which refers to \"disputes with respect to investments.\"115\n\nTranscript, Volume 1, p. 130, lines 12-16.\n\nReply at paragraphs 74-79.\n\n101.\n\nIn light of the terms of Article 9 of the BIT, Pakistan is bound to submit all disputes to ICSID arbitration including SGS\u2019s claims for breach of contract as distinct from a breach of the BIT.116\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 81.\n\n102.\n\nSGS argues that Pakistan\u2019s contention that Article 11.1 of the PSI Agreement excludes or diminishes this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention is without merit. The question to be confronted is whether there was any stipulation contrary to ICSID\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction in the consent to arbitration.\n\n103.\n\nPakistan consented to ICSID\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction in Article 9 of the BIT which contains no reservations or \"statement otherwise.\" SGS\u2019s consent comes from its Request for Arbitration. SGS argues that \"the consent of each of the parties to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of this Tribunal was unequivocal, and at no time did either of the parties \u2018otherwise state\u2019.\"117\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 93.\n\n104.\n\nSGS goes on to submit that a long line of ICSID decisions shows that a forum selection clause in a contract will not apply to the exclusion of ICSID jurisdiction.118 SGS points out that in every case on which Pakistan relies *(Klockner, Tradex Hellas, Lanco, Salini* and *Vivendi Annulment),* the ICSID tribunal retained jurisdiction.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 97.\n\n105.\n\nSGS concludes that in conformity with the text of the ICSID Convention and the weight of ICSID precedent, the Tribunal must hold that the forum selection clause in the PSI Agreement does not and cannot exclude the jurisdiction of this Tribunal with respect to SGS\u2019s claims. At the very most, the Islamabad arbitrator may have, *prima facie,* concurrent jurisdiction over some aspects of the current dispute relating to the interpretation and performance of the PSI Agreement. However, even then, this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction must prevail.119\n\n*Id,,* at paragraph 113.\n\n106.\n\nThis Tribunal must prevail because the BIT\u2019s dispute resolution provision supersedes the PSI Agreement\u2019s forum selection clause, to the extent they both cover the same ground.120 International methods of dispute settlement take precedence over domestic arbitration. BITs are intended to promote and protect investments and ensure their equitable treatment which gives investors substantive rights under international law, such as the right to have their disputes heard by an international tribunal.121\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 115.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraphs 117-118.\n\n107.\n\nIn SGS\u2019s submission, Pakistan\u2019s argument that the Islamabad arbitrator has jurisdiction over the \"BIT Claims\" is flawed:\n\n(a) Although some BITs include a matrix of *fora* available to claimants, this BIT does not. Article 9(2) speaks only of ICSID jurisdiction and Article 26 of the Convention gives this Tribunal exclusive jurisdiction;\n\n(b) A contract forum selection clause cannot extend the jurisdiction of a domestic court or tribunal to claims of breach of a treaty (see *Vivendi* both in its discussion of *Lanco* and the case before it);\n\n(c) At the time that the PSI Agreement was concluded, the BIT did not exist and therefore the parties could not have intended to cover claims that could not have been made at the time; and\n\n(d) Finally, the Supreme Court of Pakistan concluded that the BIT had not been incorporated into the law of Pakistan and no court could enforce any treaty rights arising from the BIT. Moreover, the Supreme Court stated that the PSI Arbitration shall be confined to the claims based on the terms and conditions of that agreement.122\n\n*Id.,* at paragraphs 131-135.\n\n108.\n\nIn respect of the Respondent\u2019s arguments that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction over SGS\u2019s \"Defamation Claims\" or Pakistan\u2019s potential counterclaims, SGS argues that this Tribunal has jurisdiction over all ancillary claims and counter-claims that arise directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute as long as they are within the scope of the consent of the parties.123 Such consent extends to all \"disputes with respect to investments\" under Article 9 of the BIT, including SGS\u2019s request for compensation for damage to its reputation as a result of Pakistan\u2019s violations of the BIT.124 The consent also covers any eventual counter-claims that might be presented by Pakistan.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Convention states that: Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counter-claims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\nReply, at paragraph 138.\n\n109.\n\nIn SGS\u2019s view, there is nothing remarkable about an ICSID tribunal considering a State party\u2019s counter-claim when its jurisdiction arises out of a BIT. \"It must have been expressly contemplated by Pakistan and Switzerland in this case [that the ICSID tribunal could consider a State party\u2019s counterclaim] because Article 9(3) of the BIT provides that \"each party may start the procedure.\"125\n\n*Id.,* at paragraphs 139-141. SGS observes that in at least one ICSID case, *Alex Genin Eastern Credit Limited Inc. andA.S. Baltoilv. The Republic of Estonia,* Case No. ARB/99/2, the State bought a counter-claim alleging violations of Estonian banking law and the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the counter-claim was never questioned. SGS has also expressly confirmed its agreement to the submission of Pakistan\u2019s eventual counter-claims to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\n110.\n\nPakistan has argued that the maxim *generalia specialibus non derogant* should apply such that the PSI Agreement\u2019s arbitration clause would take precedence over the BIT\u2019s ICSID arbitration clause. SGS argues that the relevance of the ICSID case on which Pakistan relies, *SPP v. Egypt,* is limited to its particular facts.126\n\nIn *SPP,* the tribunal interpreted Egyptian investment legislation which gave an investor three options for resolving disputes: any method agreed between the parties, resolution under a bilateral investment treaty or resolution under the ICSID Convention. The tribunal found that the intention of the legislature was to give precedence to a specific agreement of the parties. But as there was no such agreement between the parties, the tribunal concluded they had given their consent to ICSID arbitration as one of the options provided for by the legislation. However, in the present case, there is no domestic legislation providing for a hierarchical order of alternatives for dispute resolution. \"The Switzerland-Pakistan BIT is the only relevant \u2018investment law\u2019 at issue in this case and it provides exclusively for ICSID arbitration.\" Even if *SPP* did purport to establish a general principle that a contractual forum selection clause should have precedence over a dispute resolution clause in a BIT, it has not been followed by any other ICSID tribunal facing this question. The maxim *generalia specialibus non derogant* has no application here because the two dispute settlement clauses at issue in this case relate to different standards of protection. The BIT\u2019s Article 9 provides the investor with an essential procedural guarantee that cnnot be ousted by the forum selection clause in the PSI Agreement. (Reply, at paragraphs 142-148.)\n\n111.\n\nSGS submits further that the doctrine of **lis pendens** is inoperative here. That doctrine deals with \"overlap between two pending proceedings.\" In the instant case, there is at best concurrent jurisdiction arising from possible overlap between the scope of the two dispute resolution mechanisms.127 Any *prima facie* concurrent jurisdiction of the Islamabad arbitrator on the basis of the forum selection clause in the PSI Agreement would be overridden by this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, based on Article 9 of the BIT which clearly takes precedence. As a result, only this Tribunal has actual jurisdiction over the present dispute and the argument of **lis pendens** is moot.128\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 149.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 150.\n\n112.\n\nEven supposing the *lis pendens* theory did have some *prima facie* application here, Pakistan says that the theory would require this Tribunal to yield to the Islamabad arbitrator for three reasons: (a) the two matters allegedly involve the same parties; (b) the matters allegedly involve the same causes of action; and (c) the PSI Agreement arbitration is said to have commenced prior to the present proceeding.129\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 151.\n\n113.\n\nIn SGS\u2019s submission, *lis pendens* cannot apply here because the first two of the three requisite elements are not present.130\n\n*Id.,* at 154.\n\n114.\n\nFor the *lis pendens* principle to apply, the two tribunals must be of equal status and in SGS\u2019s view they are plainly not in this case. International jurisprudence shows that international tribunals are not subject to *lis pendens* when the parallel case is pending in a domestic forum.131 The inequality of the two tribunals is underscored by the fact that only one, namely, this Tribunal, has jurisdiction over SGS\u2019s claims alleging violations of the BIT. The *lis pendens* principle cannot apply here because it would leave SGS without a forum in which to pursue its BIT claims.132\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 157. For example, in the *Selwyn Case,* the British-Venezuelan Mixed Claims Commission noted that \"international arbitration is not affected jurisdictionally by the fact that the same question is in the courts of one of the nations.\" SGS also cites *Socaciu v. Romania,* where the Romanian-Austrian Mixed Arbitral Tribunal held that once international proceedings have begun, proceedings before the domestic courts had no object. In the *Jean-Baptiste Caire Case,* the French-Mexican Mixed Claims Commission refused to impose supplementary admissibility requirements (not provided for in the governing Convention) on the claimants merely because parallel proceedings were pending in a domestic forum. The commission viewed the domestic proceedings as irrelevant to the question of its jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claims presented to it.  \n SGS cites a more recent authority where the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal held in *E-Systems v. Iran Bank Mell.i* that the Government of Iran should request that Iranian court proceedings be stayed until proceedings in the international tribunal were completed. Similar language was used in the second *Holiday Inns* jurisdiction decision which also stated that international tribunals have a superior status in comparison to domestic proceedings.\n\nReply at paragraph 164.\n\n115.\n\n***Lis pendens*** also does not apply because the two proceedings do not relate to the same causes of action. ***Lis pendens*** is based on the principle of *ne bis in idem* (not twice in the same matter), which means that the object *{peti-tum)* and the ground (*causa petendi)* of the two claims are the same. ***Lis pendens*** will not apply even if a claimant makes identical requests if those requests are based on different legal grounds *{i.e.,* where the petition is identical, but the *causa petendi* is different).133 SGS notes that in a number of BIT cases the *lis pendens* doctrine has not been applied.134\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 166.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraphs 167. In the *Ronald S. Lauder* v. **Czech Republic** case and the *CME Czech Republic B. V* v. **Czech Republic** case, the respondents *lis pendens* arguments were rejected by both tribunals because they involved different parties and different causes of action (under different BITs).  \n SGS also questions Pakistan\u2019s use of *S.A.RI. Benvenuti Bonfant v. Peoples Republic of the Congo (\"Benvenuti Bonfant j,* ICSID Case No. ARB/77/2, and *Amco Asia Corporation* v. *Republic of Indonesia (\"Amco Asia\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, as cases in support of its argument of *lis pendens.* In both cases, the tribunal rejected the principle\u2019s application. SGS asserts, moreover, that these cases were dismissed not merely because the parties in the pending actions were not the same, but also because there was also a lack of identity in the causes of action. In *Benvenuti Ii Bonfant* the tribunal found the principle not to be applicable where there was no identity of the parties and no identity of \"object and cause of action in the proceeding pending before both tribunals.\" Likewise, in *Amco Asia* the tribunal held that neither the parties involved nor the claims raised were identical.\n\n116.\n\nSGS also points out that in the PSI Agreement arbitration Pakistan has raised claims the sole cause of action of which is restitution, whereas in this case, SGS is pursuing claims alleging: (i) violations of the BIT including its \"umbrella clause\" and in the alternative, (ii) claims of breach of contract but not violations of the BIT. Restitution is not pleaded in this case. Therefore, SGS argues, the causes of action in the two jurisdictions are different and *lis pendens* cannot apply.135\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 174.\n\n117.\n\nTo SGS, the *lis pendens* argument is based on an incorrect premise, namely, that \"SGS submitted its claims in the PSI Agreement arbitration first.\" But, SGS merely filed a defensive counter-claim, expressly subject to objections to jurisdiction. In any event, this ICSID arbitration effectively precedes the PSI Agreement arbitration because the latter has only recently begun.136 The arbitrator was appointed by the Pakistani courts on 2 July 2002, and Pakistan filed its Statement of Claim only on 18 October 2002.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 176.\n\n118.\n\nPakistan has argued that SGS waived its right to seek relief under the ICSID Convention when it initiated the Swiss legal proceedings and presented counter-claims in the PSI Agreement arbitration. It also alleges estoppel on the same facts. But objections on waiver and estoppel assume that the causes of action and relief sought in the different proceedings are all identical. This is not so here and where there is no identity of cause of action or remedy sought, there can be no waiver or estoppel.137\n\n*Id.,* at paragraphs 177-178. SGS also denies Pakistan\u2019s assertion that SGS has waived its right to pursue its claims before an ICSID tribunal when it commenced the Swiss legal proceedings or when it filed its counter-claims in the PSI Agreement arbitration. SGS argues that this right arose only when SGS accepted Pakistan\u2019s offer to arbitrate its disputes with SGS in ICSID arbitration. It was only from the date of that agreement (10 October 2001) that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention and the exclusivity rule therein applied to prevent SGS from seeking relief in other *fora.* Pakistan cannot argue that SGS should have given its consent to ICSID arbitration before 10 October 2001, and that by not doing so, it waived its right to consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID by proceeding in the Swiss courts and PSI Agreement arbitration. Reply, at paragraphs 181-182.\n\n119.\n\nFinally, in its decision of 3 July 2002, the Supreme Court of Pakistan noted that the BIT had not been incorporated into the laws of Pakistan and that no Pakistan court could enforce any \"treaty rights\" arising from the BIT. SGS questions how the Islamabad arbitrator would have jurisdiction to consider SGS\u2019s claims arising from the BIT when there is a denial of such rights in the Pakistan courts. The Supreme Court of Pakistan expressly stated that the \"[Islamabad] arbitration proceedings shall be confined to the claims based on the terms and conditions of the [PSI] agreement.\"138 SGS asserts that Pakistan cannot argue that, by not giving its consent to ICSID arbitration prior to the commencement of the PSI Agreement arbitration (commenced on 7 April 2001) and the Swiss legal proceedings (commenced on 12 January 1998), SGS has waived its rights to consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID:\n\n\"... at neither of those times did SGS have an existing right to pursue its claims through ICSID arbitration. This right only arose on 10 October 2001, when SGS accepted Pakistan\u2019s offer to arbitrate its disputes with SGS in ICSID arbitration.\"139\n\nReply, at paragraph 135.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 181.\n\n120.\n\nThe BIT does not require the investor to consent to ICSID arbitration within any designated period of time.\n\n121.\n\nIn SGS\u2019s view, a party can be taken to have waived its right to consent to ICSID arbitration by first pursuing claims in local courts only if the BIT contained a \"fork-in-the-road\" clause providing a choice to pursue claims in domestic courts or in international arbitration. Once the investor\u2019s choice has been made, it is final. However, the Treaty here contains no such fork-in-the-road.140\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 189. Also, SGS\u2019s participation was without prejudice to its legal rights under international law. The Swiss proceedings were dismissed without findings on the merits of the dispute and therefore did not resolve its claim.\n\n122.\n\nFinally in this regard, SGS argues that it is not estopped from pursuing its claims before the ICSID Tribunal by anything done in the domestic proceedings. Estoppel usually applies where a party has misrepresented the existence of facts and another party has acted upon this misrepresentation to its detriment. It does not apply where a claimant has used several remedies to pursue its rights. SGS has never represented to Pakistan that it would not seek to pursue claims in different *forad141* SGS describes its participation in the PSI Agreement arbitration as merely defensive and says that the Swiss proceedings did not make any findings on the merits of the dispute. Therefore, SGS argues it is \"seeking to find the appropriate forum for the resolution of the claims it has now raised\" and under these circumstances, no objection of estoppel or waiver can lie.142\n\n*Id.,* at paragraphs 192-194.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 189.\n\n123.\n\nSGS then turns to Pakistan\u2019s claim that it has not invested within the territory of Pakistan and therefore the dispute before the Tribunal is not \"with respect to an investment\" as stipulated in Article 9 of the BIT. It notes that Pakistan did not contest that this dispute arises directly out of an investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n124.\n\nSGS observes that in Article 1(2) of the BIT the word \"investment\" is specified to include \"every kind of asset\" including *{inter alia):* (c) claims to money or to any performance having an economic value; and (e) concessions under public law, including concessions to search for, extract or exploit natural resources as well as all other rights given by law, by contract or by decision of the authority in accordance with the law. The PSI Agreement grants SGS \"claims to performance having an economic value\" and \"rights given...by contract.\"143 In addition, SGS argues that it made \"substantial investments within the meaning of Article 1 (2) when it leased, equipped and operated its liaison offices, which were essential to the performance of the PSI Agreement.\"144 SGS also submits that ICSID jurisprudence holds that an investment need not be physically or directly made in the territory to satisfy requirements of provisions such as Article 2(1) of the BIT.145\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 197.\n\n*id.*\n\n*Id.,* at paragraphs 200-204.\n\n125.\n\nRegardless of where activities arising out of the PSI Agreement occurred, SGS\u2019s investment was, in any event, made within the territory of Pakistan because a significant transfer of value was made into Pakistan\u2019s territory. The Pre-Shipment Inspection Programme was intended to allow Pakistan to increase its customs\u2019 revenues by up to U.S.$650 million, which was intended to flow into the State of Pakistan and arose directly from SGS\u2019s performance. Further, SGS imported significant revenue-building know-how into Pakistan through assisting the Pakistani Revenue and Customs officials in improving their verification and inspection of goods by the establishment of Clean Reports of Findings. Training was provided to those officials through SGS internal seminars held in Pakistan.146\n\n*Id.,* at paragraphs 205-206.\n\n126.\n\nEven if the PSI Agreement and SGS\u2019s activities do not meet the \"traditional\" notion of an investment, they nevertheless fall within the category of new investments covered by BITs as illustrated by the *Fedax* and *CSOB* cases which demonstrate that ICSID is moving away from traditional notions of investment.147\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 207. *Fedax N.V. (Netherlands Antilles)* v. *Republic of Venezuela (\"Fedax\").* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3 and *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, S.A.* v. *The Slovak Republic (\"CSOB\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4.\n\n127.\n\nAssuming that a direct or physical investment in Pakistan\u2019s territory were required, SGS did make such a direct and physical investment in Pakistani territory. The offices in Karachi and Lahore were \"an instrumental part of the PSI Agreement and overall investment.\"148 While the pre-shipment inspections occurred outside Pakistan, the critical results of those inspections were funneled to and processed within the liaison offices in Pakistan. SGS staffed the offices with about 160 local and foreign employees and spent significant amounts in wages and training. It also paid rent and for their day-to-day maintenance. The offices contained moveable assets (including computers, office furniture and vehicles) valued as early as in 1993 at in excess of U.S.$1.5 million.149 SGS asserts that it forwarded \"hundreds of thousands\" of US dollars to a focal bank to ensure the operation of the offices.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 212.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 215.\n\n128.\n\nSGS believes that Pakistan itself recognized that SGS was making an investment. It required SGS to obtain an authorization from its Board of Investment for the opening and operation of the offices. The objection that these offices had no revenue-earning commercial activities is irrelevant because these offices were vital to the performance of the PSI Agreement.150\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 217.\n\n129.\n\nFurther, to the extent that intangible investments such as \"claims to money\" and \"rights under contract\" recognized in the BIT can be located anywhere, they were situated in Pakistan.\n\n130.\n\nWith respect to its alleged non-compliance with the BIT\u2019s 12-month consultation period, SGS submits that waiting periods in BITs are not prerequisites for jurisdiction, but rather procedural rules intended to encourage consultations or negotiations that may lead to an avoidance of arbitration.151 Where it is clear that negotiations would have been futile, a claimant may submit its claims before the waiting period has expired.\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 223. SGS also refers in this regard to *Wena Hotels Ltd.* v. *Arab Republic of* *Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4.\n\n131.\n\nSGS notes that nothing prevented Pakistan from initiating negotiations or discussions after SGS\u2019s Request for Arbitration was filed. It is reasonable to believe that waiting out the 12-month consultation period would have been futile.152 If jurisdiction were denied on the ground that a waiting period in a BIT dispute resolution clause is a jurisdictional requirement, SGS could resubmit its claims to ICSID and proceedings would begin again after 12 months. This would only result in additional delay and more expense for both parties.\n\nId., at paragraph 224. In this regard, SGS cites *Ethyl Corp. v. Canada* and *RonaldS. Lauder v.* *The Czech Republic.*\n\nPART IV: THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION\n--------------------------------\n\nA. The legal issues to be resolved\n----------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nConsidering the principal objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and the arguments adduced by the Respondent to support those objections, and having regard to the principal claims and arguments submitted by the Claimant to resist the Respondent\u2019s objections and to sustain the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, we believe that the principal issues that we must address in this Decision may be usefully formulated in the following manner:\n\n(a) Has the Claimant made an \"investment\" \"in the territory\" of the Respondent?\n\n(b) What effect may be given to the Claimant\u2019s characterization of its own claims, for purposes of these proceedings on jurisdiction?\n\n(c) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to determine the Claimant\u2019s BIT claims, that is, claims of violation of certain provisions of the Swiss-Pakistan BIT?\n\n(d) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to determine the Claimant\u2019s contractual claims that is, claims of violation of the PSI Agreement?\n\n(e) Does Article 11 of the Swiss-Pakistan BIT transform purely contract claims into BIT claims?\n\n(f) Does the Claimant\u2019s conduct in the Swiss legal proceedings and in the PSI Agreement arbitration give rise to estoppel?\n\n(g) Does the Claimant\u2019s conduct in the Swiss legal proceedings and in the PSI Agreement arbitration amount to waiver of its rights under the Swiss-Pakistan BIT?\n\n(h) Does the doctrine of *lis pendens* preclude the Claimant from pursuing its claims before the Tribunal?\n\n(i) What effect may be given to the requirement of consultations between the parties in Article 9 of the Swiss-Pakistan BIT?\n\n(j) Should this Tribunal dismiss or stay these proceedings as urged by the Respondent until the contract claims are addressed?\n\nWe address each of the above issues below.\n\nB. Findings and Conclusions\n---------------------------\n\n1. Has the Claimant made an \"investment\" \"in the territory\" of the Respondent?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n133.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention requires that there be an \"investment\" dispute, that is, a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment,\" between a Contracting Party and a national of another Contracting Party, in order that the ICSID\u2019s jurisdictional requirements may be satisfied. The ICSID Convention does not delimit the term \"investment,\" leaving to the Contracting Parties a large measure of freedom to define that term as their specific objectives and circumstances may lead them to do so.153 In this case, the BIT between the Swiss Confederation and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan does contain a definition of \"investment.\"\n\nThat freedom does not, however, appear to be unlimited, considering that \"investment\" may well be regarded as embodying certain core meaning which distinguishes it from \"an ordinary commercial transaction\" such as a simple, stand alone, sale of goods or services. Thus, in **Fedax,** the Tribunal, in finding that six promissory notes issued by the Government of Venezuela constituted an investment, observed that \"under both ICSID and the Additional Facility Rules the investment in question, even if indirect, should be distinguishable from an ordinary commercial transaction.\" (At paragraph 14 of the Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction.) The tribunal held that promissory notes did constitute an investment within the meaning of the BIT, noting that the central characteristics of an investment involve a \"certain duration, a certain regularity of profit and return, assumption of risk, a substantial commitment and a significance for the host State\u2019s development.\" *Fedax* also observed that only exceptionally has a treaty excluded claims to money that arise solely from commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services from the definition of investment, citing Article 1139 of the NAFTA and the comments of Mr. Antonio Parra, ICSID\u2019s Deputy Secretary-General, that \"[a] broad definition of investment such as that included in the Agreement is not at all an exceptional situation. On the contrary, most contemporary bilateral treaties of this kind refer to \u2018every kind of asset\u2019 or to \u2018all assets\u2019, including the listing of examples that can qualify for coverage; claims to money and to any performance having a financial value are prominent features of such listing.\" (At paragraph 20 of **Fedax,** citing Antonio Parra, \"The Scope of New Investment Laws and International Instruments\" in Robert Prichard (ed.) *Economic Development, Foreign Investment and the Law* (1996), pp. 27-44 at pp. 35-36 \u2018ICSID and Bilateral Investment Treaties\u2019, News from ICSID, Vol 2, No. 1 (1985), pp. 12-20 at pp. 19-20.)\n\n134.\n\nThat BIT definition is broad. \"Investment\" is defined so as to\n\n...include *every kind of asset* and particularly:...\n\n(c) *claims to money* or to any *performance having economic value;*\n\nand\n\n(e) *concessions under public law,* including concessions to search for, extract or exploit natural resources as well as *all other rights given by law, by contract* or by decision of the authority in accordance with law. (Emphases added)\n\n135.\n\nThis non-exhaustive definition is, in our view, sufficiently broad to encompass the PSI Agreement because: firstly, the Agreement\u2019s performance, by granting SGS the right to carry out pre-shipment inspection services, gave rise to *\"claims to money; \"* secondly, Pakistan effectively granted SGS a *public law concession* (\"a concession under public law\"), since SGS was conferred certain powers that ordinarily would have been exercised by the Pakistani Customs service (the identification and valuation of goods for duty purposes); and thirdly, such rights as SGS exercised pursuant to the PSI Agreement were *\"rights given by law\"* and *\"by contract. \"*\n\n136.\n\nThe PSI Agreement defined the commitments of SGS in such a way as to ensure that SGS, if it was to comply with them, had to make certain expenditures in the territory of Pakistan. While the expenditures may be relatively small (Pakistan\u2019s Reply estimates them as amounting to approximately U.S.$800,000, while SGS presents the estimate of U.S.$1.5 million),154 they involved the injection of funds into the territory of Pakistan for the carrying out of SGS\u2019s engagements under the PSI Agreement.155\n\nPakistan\u2019s Reply at paragraph 109 and SGS\u2019s Reply at paragraph 19(vi) and Exhibits S21 and S22.\n\n*Id.,* at S69 to 71. These documents are said to evidence expenditures made in 1992-1993 related to the liaison offices in Pakistan.\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that those expenditures were \"pre-contractual expenses\" which, under the *Mihaly International Corporation* v. *Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka156* case, are not to be taken as investments. We do not believe that *Mihaly* offers material guidance in the present circumstances. The Claimant here did adduce evidence of expenditures it had incurred in Pakistan to establish and operate liaison offices in Pakistan necessary to enable it to perform its obligations under the PSI Agreement. It is not disputed that that Agreement was in fact eventually signed and went into effect. In *Mihaly,* no investment agreement was actually concluded by the parties; there was, in other words, no agreement to be performed by either party and no investment actually made by the complainant.157\n\n*Mihaly International Corporation v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri lanka (\"Mihaly\"),* ICSID Case Nof ARB/00/2, Award of 7 March 2002, ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ, p. 142 (2002).\n\nThe *Mihaly* tribunal pointed out that under the parties\u2019 Letters of Intent, of Agreement and of Extension, the Respondent had made it clear that until and unless a contract was actually signed by the parties, no expenses incurred by the Claimant could be regarded as investment. (At paragraphs 59-60.)\n\n138.\n\nIt is also important to note certain statements made by the Government of Pakistan when it objected to the litigation pending in the Swiss courts. Pakistan\u2019s Brief on Objections to Jurisdiction filed with the Geneva Court of First Instance described certain aspects of the PSI Agreement as follows:\n\nThis Tender was made in the context of *a delegation to the private sector of part of the Customs power belonging to the State* by virtue of the Pakistan \"Customs Act\" 1969 more particularly Art. 25 which gives competence to the federal public servants to determine the value of the goods imported and exported...\";\n\nIn enumerating *the services to be performed by SGS* it was: \"generally speaking [to] *take care of raising the Customs revenue* by putting into place trustful and simplified proceedings\", \"conduct enquiries in conjunction with the Pakistan Customs,\" \"educate the Pakistani Custom authorities on the techniques of evaluation and application of Customs rules.158 (Emphases added)\n\nBrief on Objections to Jurisdiction filed with the Court of First Instance. Exhibit S58 to Claimant\u2019s Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n139.\n\nIn the same submission, the Government of Pakistan explicitly described the functions delegated to SGS as being *jure imperii* in character:\n\nIn the Contract of 29 September 1994, the Government of Pakistan entrusted SGS with the right to exercise its activity of control in the Customs field.\n\nIdentically to the right of a State to levy taxes, the right to levy Customs duties is a right belonging to the State sovereignty by essence. Only the State of Pakistan\u2014excluding any individual\u2014has the power to levy Customs duties. If Pakistan entrusted SGS with certain powers in that field normally reserved to the State, it did so in the exercise of its public power...\n\nThis link to the State sovereignty of Pakistan seems tighter if one recalls that the activity of SGS was meant to increase the Customs revenue of the State. By doing this, SGS did not perform a simple commercial activity for the account of the State of Pakistan; it had to raise the financial revenue of the State (which indeed SGS alleges to have done)...\n\nIt appears from what has been said that the legal nature of the Contract of 29 September 1994 appears clearly to be a concession of public law by which the State of Pakistan granted to SGS the right (subject to acceptation) to be active\u2014to the exclusion of any other public entity\u2014in a field which is normally left to the public power of the State.\n\nBy concluding the Contract of 29 September 1994, the State of Pakistan acted jure *imperii*159 (Bold characters and italics in the original; underscoring added)\n\n*id.*\n\n140.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the expenditures made by SGS pursuant to the PSI Agreement constituted an investment within the meaning of the BIT and that the PSI Agreement amounted to \"a concession under public laws\" falling well within the BIT\u2019s definition of investment. We hold, moreover, that the ICSID Convention\u2019s requirement that there be a legal dispute arising directly out of an \"investment\" is satisfied.\n\n141.\n\nWe note, finally, that in its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent stated that proceedings are currently underway in both Switzerland and Pakistan involving the review of the lawfulness (under Pakistan law) of certain alleged conduct on the part of SGS and its employees relating to the conclusion of the PSI Agreement. The Respondent therefore reserved the right to argue\u2014in the event that it is found in those proceedings that the PSI Agreement had been procured through bribery and corruption\u2014 that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the claims set forth in the Request for Arbitration submitted to the ICSID on the additional ground that the claimant SGS had not invested \"in accordance with the laws and regulations\" of Pakistan as required by Article 2 of the BIT.160\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimant, in its reply (Counter-Memorial) did not respond to this reservation, a fact pointed out by Pakistan in its subsequent Reply.161 In its Rejoinder, SGS stated it would deal with this issue if and when it arose.162\n\nPakistan\u2019s Reply at paragraph 111.\n\nRejoinder at paragraph 159.\n\n143.\n\nAccordingly, we consider that the Tribunal is not in a position at this time to address this potential additional issue. The Respondent\u2019s reservation is duly noted and placed on the record.163\n\nBy a letter dated 7 May 2003, the Respondent furnished the Tribunal, through its Secretary, as well as the Claimant and its counsel, a copy of a decision of the Swiss Supreme Court dated 4 April 2003, affirming a decision of the *Chambre d\u2019accusation du Canton de Gen'eve* of 15 January 2003, which admitted the Government of Pakistan as a civil party to the criminal proceedings in Switzerland against Ms. Benazir Bhutto, Mr. Arif Ali Zardari (her husband) and Mr. Jens Schlegelmilch (her advisor), in respect of Mr. Schlegelmilch. Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Zardari did not appeal the decision of the *Chambre d\u2019accusation.*\n\n2. What effect may be given to the Claimant\u2019s characterization of its own claims, for purposes of these proceedings on jurisdiction?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nThe parties disagree on this threshold point, each adverting to passages in the various cases that are adduced to support their respective contentions. The Respondent asks the Tribunal to subject the claims to a certain degree of scrutiny to determine whether they are properly characterized as alleged violations of the Treaty. For its part, SGS argues that Pakistan and the Tribunal must accept, at this stage, the claims as these have been formulated by SGS; the determination as to whether there truly have been breaches of the BIT is for the merits phase of the present proceedings.\n\n145.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal has, as a practical matter, a limited ability to scrutinize the claims as formulated by the Claimant. Some cases suggest that the Tribunal need not uncritically accept those claims at face value, but we consider that if the facts asserted by the Claimant are capable of being regarded as alleged breaches of the BIT, consistently with the practice of ICSID tribunals,164 the Claimant should be able to have them considered on their merits.165 We conclude that, at this jurisdiction phase, it is for the Claimant to characterize the claims as it sees fit. We do not exclude the possibility that there may arise a situation where a tribunal may find it necessary at the very beginning to look behind the claimant\u2019s factual claims, but this is not such a case.\n\n*E.g, Amco Asia* at paragraph 38.\n\nAt the hearing, the Claimant contended that the fact that the Request for Arbitration was registered by the ICSID Secretariat showed that the dispute was not manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre and that took care of the *prima facie* test because that test was applied by the Secretariat itself. Transcript, Volume 1, pp. 131-132. The Tribunal does not consider this persuasive. The Secretariat\u2019s screening exercise is minimal and cannot be equated to a subsequent tribunal\u2019s evaluation of its jurisdiction to hear the case. For its part, the Respondent contended in response that the Tribunal should use the analysis employed by the *Klockner ad hoc* Annulment Committee and subject the claims to careful scrutiny to ensure that they fall within its mandate. Transcript, Volume 2, pp. 41-52. While the Tribunal agrees with Respondent\u2019s point that careful professionalism is warranted in establishing jurisdiction to pronounce on a State\u2019s obligations *vis-\u00e0-vis* an investor, the Tribunal finds the approach posited by the Respondent as too exacting at the present stage. The role of an *ad hoc* Annulment Committee is to review a tribunal decision to ensure that it meets the requirements of the ICSID Convention and does not offend any of the grounds set out in its Article 52. This \u2018after the fact\u2019 role is necessarily different from the role of a tribunal at the outset of the case. If the facts as pleaded are plainly incapable of supporting a finding of breach of the Treaty, part or all of the claim might be struck (see *United Parcel Service of America, Inc.* v. *Government of Canada,* Award on Jurisdiction, at paragraphs 33-37, available at www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/tna-nac/document/jurisdiction%20Award.22Nov02.pdf). However, the Tribunal cannot subject the Request for Arbitration to too rigorous a standard of review at this stage as the Claimant is not obliged to set out extensive allegations of fact and arguments as to how the acts complained of might give rise to a breach of the Treaty.\n\n3. Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to determine the Claimant\u2019s BIT claims, that is, claims of violation of certain provisions of the BIT?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. General considerations\u2014Claims of violation of BIT provisions and claims of violation of contract provisions: BIT claims v. contract claims.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nThe central question which the Tribunal must address is whether we have jurisdiction to pass upon and determine SGS\u2019s claims which are grounded on alleged violations by Pakistan of certain provisions of the BIT (\"the Claimant\u2019s BIT claims\"), or its claims grounded on alleged breaches of certain provisions of the PSI Agreement (\"the Claimant\u2019s contract claims\"), or both such types of claims. Before, however, addressing this central issue, it is useful to examine in general terms BIT claims and contract claims.\n\n147.\n\nAs a matter of general principle, the same set of facts can give rise to different claims grounded on differing legal orders: the municipal and the international legal orders. Both the Claimant and Respondent in the present case do not dispute the soundness of this proposition.166 In the event, this proposition has recently been discussed and documented *in extenso* in the *Vivendi Annulment* decision where the Annulment Committee said:\n\n95. As to the relation between breach of contract and breach of treaty in the present case, it must be stressed that *Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT do not relate directly to breach of a municipal contract. Rather they set an independent standard. A state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and vice versa,* and this is certainly true of these provisions of the BIT. The point is made clear in Article 3 of the ILC Articles, which is entitled \"Characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful\":\n\n*The characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law...*\n\n96. *In accordance with this general principle* (which is undoubtedly declaratory of general international law), *whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law\u2014in the case of the BIT, by international law; in the case of the Concession Contract, by the proper law of the contract,* in other words, the law of Tucuman. For example, in the case of a claim based on a treaty, international law rules of attribution apply with the result that the state of Argentina is internationally responsible for the acts of its provincial authorities. [Reference to authorities omitted.] By contrast, the state of Argentina is not liable for the performance of contracts entered into by Tucuman, which possesses separate legal personality under its own law and is responsible for the performance of its own contracts.\n\n97. The distinction between the role of international and municipal law in matters of international responsibility is stressed in the commentary to Article 3 of the ILC Articles, which reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n(4) The International Court has often referred to and applied the principle. For example in the Reparation for Injuries case, it noted that \"[a]s the claim is based on the breach of an international obligation on the part of the Member held responsible... The Member cannot contend that this obligation is governed by municipal law\". In the ELSI case, a Chamber of the Court emphasized this rule, stating that: *\"Compliance with municipal law and compliance with the provisions of a treaty are different questions. What is a breach of treaty may be law-fid in the municipal law and what is unlawful in the municipal law may be wholly innocent of violation of a treaty provision.* Even had the Prefect held the requisition to be entirely justified in Italian law, this would not exclude the possibility that it was a violation of the FCN Treaty.\" Conversely, as the Chamber explained:\n\n*\"... the fact that an act of a public authority may have been unlawful in municipal law does not necessarily mean that that act was unlawful in international law, as a breach of treaty or otherwise.* A finding of the local courts that an act was unlawful may well be relevant to an argument that it was also arbitrary; but by itself, and without more, unlawfulness cannot be said to amount to arbitrariness... Nor does it follow from a finding by a municipal court that an act was unjustified, or unreasonable, or arbitrary, that that act is necessarily to be classed as arbitrary in international law, though the qualification given to the impugned act by a municipal authority may be a valuable indication.\"\n\n(7) *The rule that the characterization of conduct as unlawful in international law cannot be affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful in internal law makes no exception for cases where rules of international law require a State to conform to the provisions of its internal law, for instance by applying to aliens the same legal treatment as to nationals.* It is true that in such a case, compliance with internal law is relevant to the question of international responsibility. But this is because the rule of international law makes it relevant, e.g. by incorporating the standard of compliance with internal law as the applicable international standard or as an aspect of it. Especially in the fields of injury to aliens and their property and of human rights, the content and application of internal law will often be relevant to the question of international responsibility. In every case it will be seen on analysis that either the provisions of internal law are relevant as facts in applying the applicable international standard, or else that they are actually incorporated in some form, conditionally or unconditionally, into that standard.167 (Emphases added)\n\nTranscript of Oral Hearing on Objections to Jurisdiction, Volume 1, at p. 21, lines 7-17 (by the Respondent) and at p. 187, lines 6-9 (by the Claimant).\n\n*Vivendi Annulment, supra,* at paragraphs 95 and 97.\n\n148.\n\nBIT claims and contract claims appear reasonably distinct in principle. Complexities, however, arise on the ground, as it were, particularly where, as in the present case, each party claims that one tribunal (this Tribunal or the PSI Agreement arbitrator) has jurisdiction over both types of claims which are alleged to co-exist. In the *Vivendi Annulment* decision, the Annulment Committee went on to say that:\n\n98. In a case where the *essential basis of a claim* brought before an international tribunal is a *breach of contract, the tribunal will give effect any valid choice of forum clause in the contract.168,*\n\n101. On the other hand, where the *fundamental basis* of the claim is *a treaty laying down an independent standard* by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, *the existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract between the claimant and the respondent state\u2014cannot operate as a bar to the application of the treaty standard.* At most, it might be relevant\u2014as municipal law will often be relevant\u2014in assessing whether there has been a breach of the treaty. (Emphases added)\n\nThe Committee went on to observe in a footnote and subsequent paragraph:  \n That is, unless the treaty in question otherwise provides. See *e.g,* Article II (1) of the Claims\n\nb. Jurisdiction of the Tribunal to determine claims of violation of certain provisions of the BIT.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nThe pertinent portions of Article 9 of the BIT need to be recalled:\n\n*Article 9*\n\nDisputes between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party\n\n(1) For the purpose of solving *disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party* and without prejudice to Article 10 of this Agreement (Disputes between Contracting Parties), consultations will take place between the parties concerned.\n\n(2) If these consultations do not result in a solution within twelve months and *if the investor concerned gives a written consent, the dispute shall be submitted to the arbitration of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes,* instituted by the Convention of Washington of March 18, 1965, for the settlement of disputes regarding investments between States and nationals of other States. (Emphases added)\n\nSettlement Declaration of 19 January 1981, 1 Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal Reports p. 9, which overrode exclusive jurisdiction clauses concerning United States courts but not Iranian courts: see the cases cited by C.N. Brower & J.D. Brueschks, The *Iran-United States Claims Tribunal* (The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, 1998), pp. 60-72. The Committee does not need to consider whether the effect of Article 8 of the BIT is to override exclusive jurisdiction clauses in contracts underlying investments to which the BIT applies.\n\n150.\n\nA treaty interpreter can scarcely avoid noting the sparseness of the language used in Article 9(1) and (2) of the BIT. Textually, Article 9(1) and (2) refer neither to disputes based on claimed violations of the BIT nor to disputes based on claimed violations of some contract between the investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party. But if Article 9 relates to any dispute at all between an investor and a Contracting Party, it must comprehend disputes constituted by claimed violations of BIT provisions establishing substantive standards of treatment by one Contracting Party of investors of the other Contracting Party. Any other view would tend to erode significantly those substantive treaty standards of treatment.\n\n151.\n\nThe difficult question has commonly been whether the jurisdiction to determine issues of violation of certain BIT provisions is exclusively vested in the ICSID tribunal formed under, *e.g,* Article 9(2) of the BIT, or is shared with some other tribunal or a sole arbitrator constituted under some other agreement or instrument. It is important in this connection to observe that Article 9(2) of the BIT provides only one recourse to an investor, that is, recourse to a tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention. No other option is given to the investor by the BIT. There is, therefore, no fork-in-the road provision in Article 9 requiring an investor to stay with the forum it has opted for, whether in respect of BIT claims or of any other kind of claims. At the same time, the BIT does not set out any requirement of prior recourse to the municipal courts of the Contracting Party involved.\n\n152.\n\nCast in slightly different terms, in the BIT itself, the Contracting Parties have not stated that the jurisdiction of the ICSID-constituted tribunal is not exclusive. The written consent of the Claimant to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal is similarly silent on this specific point; it does not state that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to determine claims of violation of the BIT is not exclusive.\n\n153.\n\nIt is also pertinent to recall that the PSI Agreement was concluded by the parties on 29 September 1994, while the BIT was signed by the Contracting Parties on 11 July 1995. It hence cannot be reasonably assumed that the parties to the PSI Agreement intended to vest in an arbitrator appointed under that Agreement and the Pakistan Arbitration Act, 1940, Section 20, authority to pass upon and decide claimed violations of the BIT which was then still hidden in the future. At the same time, it should be noted that the BIT, by its express terms (Article 2), is made applicable to investments made in the territory of a Contracting Party on 2 September 1954 and onward. Thus, disputes arising in respect of investments made as early as 2 September 1954, in other words, pre-BIT disputes, may be brought before an ICSID tribunal constituted pursuant to the BIT.\n\n154.\n\nStill another circumstance which bears noting is that, to the knowledge of the Tribunal, no claims grounded on violation of the substantive standards of the BIT have been submitted by either party to the arbitrator appointed pursuant to the PSI Agreement. The Claimant SGS has not done so. It would be difficult to suppose that the Respondent would do so, in the face of the 3 July 2002 decision, which has become final, of the Supreme Court of Pakistan169 to the effect, *inter alia,* that the BIT has no legal effect inside Pakistan. Nevertheless, Pakistan has argued before us that the arbitrator seized of claims grounded on violation of the PSI Agreement would have jurisdiction not only over such contract claims but also over the BIT claims. We are not persuaded that SGS\u2019s BIT claims against Pakistan are subject to the jurisdiction of the Islamabad arbitrator if only because such claims are based not on the PSI Agreement, but rather allege a cause of action under the BIT. Even if BIT claims were somehow brought before the PSI Agreement arbitrator, and the arbitrator were to take cognizance of them, such filing will not divest the Tribunal of its jurisdiction to determine the Claimant\u2019s BIT claims.\n\nSee the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2, dated 16 October 2002, on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n155.\n\nWe conclude that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to pass upon and determine the claims of violation of provisions of the Swiss-Pakistan BIT raised by the Claimant. We do not consider that that jurisdiction would to any degree be shared by the PSI Agreement arbitrator.\n\n4. Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to determine the Claimants contractual claims, that is, claims of violation of the PSI Agreement?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Respondent argues vigorously that the Tribunal is bereft of jurisdiction to pass upon and decide the *Claimant\u2019s claims which are based on alleged violations by Pakistan of certain provisions of the PSI Agreement.* Pakistan has its own claims based on alleged breaches by SGS of the PSI Agreement; these claims of Pakistan are, however, clearly not before this Tribunal since these have been lodged before the PSI Agreement arbitrator and nowhere else.\n\nOn the other hand, SGS asserts that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to take cognizance of and decide, not only the BIT claims of SGS, but also SGS\u2019s claims that Pakistan has breached the PSI Agreement. These claims of SGS grounded on contract are, however, asserted only in the alternative, that is, they are submitted to the Tribunal only if and to the extent that the Tribunal does not accept SGS\u2019s view of the legal effect of Article 11 of the BIT. SGS in effect contends that through the juridical medium of Article 11 of the BIT, SGS\u2019s claims grounded on alleged violation of the PSI Agreement have been transmuted or \"elevated\" into claims grounded on alleged breach of the BIT, specifically Article 11 thereof. Considering the conclusion we reach below in respect of the application of Article 11 of the BIT in the circumstances of this case, we do not believe that transmutation of SGS\u2019s contract claims into BIT claims has occurred. Accordingly, we must here address the issue of whether we have jurisdiction to determine claims grounded *solely* on contract, that is, contract claims which do not include any element of, or amount to, violation of a substantive BIT standard.\n\n157.\n\nThe evidence before the Tribunal is that when the PSI Agreement was under negotiation, the parties agreed that any disputes arising out of their relationship should be resolved by arbitration rather than by proceedings in the courts of Pakistan. SGS proposed UNCITRAL arbitration; Pakistan countered that the arbitration must be governed by the arbitration statute in force at the time in Pakistan. At the hearing on SGS\u2019s application for interim measures of protection, the Tribunal was informed by both parties that this was considered to be a \"deal-breaker\" for Pakistan and SGS therefore agreed to arbitration under Pakistan law.170\n\nTranscript of hearing on the Claimant\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures held at The Hague on 23 September 2002, at p. 48, lines 27-28.\n\n158.\n\nThe resulting PSI arbitration clause is cast in the following terms:\n\n11.1 Arbitration. Any *dispute,* controversy or *claim arising out of, or relating to this Agreement,* or breach, *termination or invalidity thereof,* shall as far as it is possible, be settled amicably. Failing such amicable settlement, any such dispute *shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Act of the Territory* as presently in force. *The place of arbitration shall be Islamabad, Pakistan* and the language to be used in the arbitration proceedings shall be the English language.171 (Emphases added)\n\nPre-Shipment Inspection Agreement, Article 11.1.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal is not faced with a situation where the parties have entered into different contracts establishing differing dispute resolution mechanisms. The question is more fundamental: How does the parties\u2019 contractually established dispute settlement mechanism relate to a general offer made by Pakistan to arbitrate disputes arising under a BIT that entered into force *after* the PSI Agreement? Does the prior contractual dispute settlement mechanism *take priority over* the BIT for some or all of the disputes between the parties, or *does the BIT take priority over the PSI Agreement\u2019s mechanism* for some or all of the disputes between the parties? These are the questions that this Tribunal must confront.\n\n160.\n\nBy any objective reading, Article 11.1 of the PSI Agreement encompasses at a minimum contractual and other non-treaty-related disputes arising out of the PSI Agreement, including its alleged unlawful termination. While SGS rejects Pakistan\u2019s characterization of its claims as \"Contract,\" \"Defamation,\" and \"BIT Claims,\" we do not take SGS to be contending that allegations of breach of the PSI Agreement and related claims are not covered by the PSI Article 11.1. Indeed, it could not seriously be contended that this was so. SGS argues instead that the PSI Agreement procedure must give way to the ICSID procedure contemplated in the BIT (Article 9) precisely because the contract claims are transformed into BIT claims by the operation of Article 11 of the BIT.\n\n161.\n\nWe recognize that disputes arising from claims grounded on alleged violation of the BIT, and disputes arising from claims based wholly on supposed violations of the PSI Agreement, can both be described as \"disputes with respect to investments,\" the phrase used in Article 9 of the BIT. That phrase, however, while descriptive of the *factual subject matter* of the disputes, does not relate to the *legal basis* of the claims, or the *cause of action* asserted in the claims. In other words, from that description alone, without more, we believe that no implication necessarily arises that both BIT and purely contract claims are intended to be covered by the Contracting Parties in Article 9. Neither, accordingly, does an implication arise that the Article 9 dispute settlement mechanism would supersede and set at naught all otherwise valid non-ICSID forum selection clauses in all earlier agreements between Swiss investors and the Respondent. Thus, we do not see anything in Article 9 or in any other provision of the BIT that can be read as vesting this Tribunal with jurisdiction over claims resting *ex hypothesi* exclusively on contract. Both Claimant and Respondent have already submitted their respective claims sounding solely on the PSI Agreement to the PSI Agreement arbitrator. We recognize that the Claimant did so in a qualified manner and questioned the jurisdiction of the PSI Agreement arbitrator, albeit on grounds which do not appear to relate to the issue we here address. We believe that Article 11.1 of the PSI Agreement is a valid forum selection clause *so far as concerns the Claimants contract claims which do not also amount to BIT claims,* and it is a clause that this Tribunal should respect. We are not suggesting that the parties cannot, by special agreement, lodge in this Tribunal jurisdiction to pass upon and decide claims sounding solely in the contract. Obviously the parties can. But we do not believe that they have done so in this case. And should the parties opt to do that, our jurisdiction over such contract claims will rest on the special agreement, not on the BIT.\n\n162.\n\nWe conclude that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction with respect to claims submitted by SGS and based on alleged breaches of the PSI Agreement which do not also constitute or amount to breaches of the substantive standards of the BIT.\n\n5. Does Article 11 of the BIT transform purely contractual claims into BIT claims?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nArticle 11 of the BIT states:\n\nEither Contracting Party shall constantly guarantee the observance of the commitments it has entered into with respect to the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party.\n\nAs noted earlier, during the hearing on the Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction, counsel for the Claimant characterized this clause as an \"elevator\" or \"mirror effect\" clause that takes breaches of contract under municipal law and elevates them immediately to the level of a breach of an international treaty.172 Counsel for the Claimant freely acknowledged that this interpretation was \"far-reaching\", but asserted that nevertheless this is what the article means and that the Claimant\u2019s view of its meaning was supported by the commentary on articles of this type found in other bilateral investment treaties.173\n\nTranscript, Volume 1, pp. 140-187.\n\n*Id.,* at p. 149, lines 5-6.\n\n164.\n\nIt appears that this is the first international arbitral tribunal that has had to examine the legal effect of a clause such as Article 11 of the BIT. We have not been directed to the award of any ICSID or other tribunal in this regard, and so it appears we have here a case of first impression. We begin, as we commonly do, by examining the words actually used in Article 11 of the BIT, ascribing to them their ordinary meaning in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of Article 11 of the Swiss-Pakistan Treaty and of that Treaty as a whole.\n\n165.\n\nA treaty interpreter must of course seek to give effect to the object and purpose projected by that Article and by the BIT as a whole. That object and purpose must be ascertained, in the first instance, from the text itself of Article 11 and the rest of the BIT.174 Applying these familiar norms of customary international law on treaty interpretation, we do not find a convincing basis for accepting the Claimant\u2019s contention that Article 11 of the BIT has had the effect of entitling a Contracting Party\u2019s investor, like SGS, in the face of a valid forum selection contract clause, to \"elevate\" its claims grounded solely in a contract with another Contracting Party, like the PSI Agreement, to claims grounded on the BIT, and accordingly to bring such contract claims to this Tribunal for resolution and decision.\n\n*ADF Group Inc. v. United States of America, (\"ADF\")* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/l, Final Award, available at www.state.gov/documents/organization/16586.pdf.\n\n166.\n\nFirstly, textually, Article 11 falls considerably short of saying what the Claimant asserts it means. The \"commitments\" the observance of which a Contracting Party is to \"constantly guarantee\" are not limited to *contractual* commitments.175 The commitments referred to may be embedded in, *e.g.,* the municipal legislative or administrative or other unilateral measures of a Contracting Party. The phrase \"constantly [to] guarantee the observance\" of some statutory, administrative or contractual commitment simply does not to our mind, necessarily signal the creation and acceptance of a new international law obligation on the part of the Contracting Party, where clearly there was none before. Further, the \"commitments\" subject matter of Article 11 may, without imposing excessive violence on the text itself, be commitments of the State itself as a legal person, or of any office, entity or subdivision (local government units) or legal representative thereof whose acts are, under the law on state responsibility, attributable to the State itself. As a matter of textuality therefore, the scope of Article 11 of the BIT, while consisting in its entirety of only one sentence, appears susceptible of almost indefinite expansion. The text itself of Article 11 does not purport to state that breaches of contract alleged by an investor in relation to a contract it has concluded with a State (widely considered to be a matter of municipal rather than international law) are automatically \"elevated\" to the level of breaches of international treaty law. Thus, it appears to us that while the Claimant has sought to spell out the consequences or inferences it would draw from Article 11, the Article itself does not set forth those consequences.\n\nThe Claimant has, for instance, not tried to distinguish between (a) a contract between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, the applicable law of which is the national law of the Contracting Party and (b) a State contract with a private investor the applicable law of which is specified as \"international law\" or \"general principles of law.\" The seminal lectures of Prosper Weil, *Probl\u00e8mes Relatifs aux Contrats Pass\u00e9s Entre un Etat et un Particulier, Hague Recueil des Cours* (Vol. III, 1969), Tome 128, pp. 157-188, explored the theoretical consequences of *\"internationalization\"* of contracts the *Ex contractus* of which is determined to be international law or general principles of law, such as the natural resources concessions granted, in an earlier day, by, *e.g.,* Iran, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. The Claimants reading of Article 11 of the BIT apparently extends to every contract, or other commitment, that a Contracting Party has entered into or assumed, or may in the future enter into or undertake with respect to an investor of the other Contracting Party.\n\n167.\n\nConsidering the widely accepted principle with which we started, namely, that under general international law, a violation of a contract entered into by a State with an investor of another State, is not, by itself, a violation of international law, and considering further that the legal consequences that the Claimant would have us attribute to Article 11 of the BIT are so far-reaching in scope, and so automatic and unqualified and sweeping in their operation, so burdensome in their potential impact upon a Contracting Party, we believe that clear and convincing evidence must be adduced by the Claimant. Clear and convincing evidence of what? Clear and convincing evidence that such was indeed the shared intent of the Contracting Parties to the Swiss-Pakistan Investment Protection Treaty in incorporating Article 11 in the BIT We do not find such evidence in the text itself of Article 11. We have not been pointed to any other evidence of the putative common intent of the Contracting Parties by the Claimant.\n\n168.\n\nThe consequences of accepting the Claimant\u2019s reading of Article 11 of the BIT should be spelled out in some detail. Firstly, Article 11 would amount to incorporating by reference an unlimited number of State contracts, as well as other municipal law instruments setting out State commitments including unilateral commitments to an investor of the other Contracting Party. Any alleged violation of those contracts and other instruments would be treated as a breach of the BIT. Secondly, the Claimant\u2019s view of Article 11 tends to make Articles 3 to 7 of the BIT substantially superfluous. There would be no real need to demonstrate a violation of those substantive treaty standards if a simple breach of contract, or of municipal statute or regulation, by itself, would suffice to constitute a treaty violation on the part of a Contracting Party and engage the international responsibility of the Party. A third consequence would be that an investor may, at will, nullify any freely negotiated dispute settlement clause in a State contract. On the reading of Article 11 urged by the Claimant, the benefits of the dispute settlement provisions of a contract with a State also a party to a BIT, would flow only to the investor. For that investor could always defeat the State\u2019s invocation of the contractually specified forum, and render any mutually agreed procedure of dispute settlement, other than BIT-specified ICSID arbitration, a dead-letter, at the investor\u2019s choice. The investor would remain free to go to arbitration either under the contract or under the BIT. But the State party to the contract would be effectively precluded from proceeding to the arbitral forum specified in the contract unless the investor was minded to agree. The Tribunal considers that Article 11 of the BIT should be read in such a way as to enhance mutuality and balance of benefits in the inter-relation of different agreements located in differing legal orders.\n\n169.\n\nAnother consideration that appears to us to support our reading of Article 11 of the BIT, is the location of Article 11 in the BIT. The context of Article 11 includes the structure and content of the rest of the Treaty. We note that Article 11 is not placed together with the substantive obligations undertaken by the Contracting Parties in Articles 3 to 7: promotion and admission of investments in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party (Article 3); prohibition of impairment, by \"unreasonable or discriminating measures,\" of the management, use, enjoyment, *etc.* of such investments and according \"fair and equitable treatment\" to investors of the other Contracting Party (Article 4); free cross-border transfer of payments relating to the protected investments (Article 5); prohibition of expropriation or other measures having the same nature or effect, unless taken in the public interest, on a non-discriminatory basis, under due process of law and with provision for effective and adequate and prompt compensation (Article 6); and the most-favored-investor provision (Article 7). These substantive standards are marked off by Article 8 (\"Principle of Subrogation\") from the two dispute settlement procedures recognized in the BIT: investor v. Contracting Party (Article 9); and Contracting Parties *inter se* (Article 10). Then follows Article 11 (\"Observance of Commitments\") which in turn is followed by the \"Final Provisions\" (Article 12) and the signature clause.\n\n170.\n\nGiven the above structure and sequence of the rest of the Treaty, we consider that, had Switzerland and Pakistan intended Article 11 to embody a substantive \"first order\" standard obligation, they would logically have placed Article 11 among the substantive \"first order\" obligations set out in Articles 3 to 7. The separation of Article 11 from those obligations by the subrogation article and the two dispute settlement provisions (Articles 9 and 10), indicates to our mind that Article 11 was *not* meant to project a substantive obligation like those set out in Articles 3 to 7, let alone one that could, when read as SGS asks us to read it, supersede and render largely redundant the substantive obligations provided for in Articles 3 to 7.176\n\nWe do not, of course, here suggest that the particular location by itself of a provision within the Treaty affords anything like conclusive indication of the specific intent of the Contracting Parties. We are saying that the interpretation urged by the Claimant raises questions as to the coherence of the structuring of the BIT.\n\n171.\n\nWe believe, for the foregoing considerations, that Article 11 of the BIT would have to be considerably more specifically worded before it can reasonably be read in the extraordinarily expansive manner submitted by the Claimant.177 The appropriate interpretive approach is the prudential one summed up in the literature as *in dubio pars mitior est sequenda,* or more tersely, *in dubio mi tins.178*\n\nThe Claimant also invites our attention to Article II (2) of the UK-Pakistan BIT and contends that on the basis of the most-favored-investor clause in Article 7 of the Swiss-Pakistan BIT and *Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain (\"Maffezini\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 January 2000, paragraphs 38-64, the Claimant is entitled to the benefit of the UK-Pakistan BIT. Without passing upon the applicability of Article 7 of the Swiss-Pakistan BIT to the specific issue we are addressing, we consider that Article 11(2) of the UK-Pakistan BIT does not exhibit the kind of clarity and specificity that is appropriately demanded in this respect by a treaty interpreter. We do not see a significant difference between Article 11 of the Swiss-Pakistan BIT and Article 11(2) of the UK-Pakistan BIT.\n\nSee in this connection, *e.g,* Appellate Body Report, *EC Measures Concerning Meat and Meat Products (Hormones),* WT/DS26/AB/R; WT/DS48/AB/R, adopted 16 January 1998, paragraphs 163-165. Footnote 154 in this Appellate Body Report sets out a representative collection of the pertinent literature on this interpretative principle.  \n In the very recent decision in *The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond I. Loewen v. United States of America (\"loewen\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, 26 June 2003, available at www.state.gov/docu-ments/organization/22094.pdf, the claimants contended that NAFTA Article 1121, which requires an investor to waive its right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party to NAFTA any proceedings with respect to the measure of a Party, if the investor wishes to proceed under Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA, in effect dispenses with the requirement that a decision of a lower court be challenged through the judicial process before a Party can be held responsible for a breach of international law constituted by a judicial decision. The **loewen** Tribunal rejected this contention and refused to read NAFTA Article 1121 as the claimants urged. The **loewen** Tribunal said:  \n 160. *An important principle of international law should not be held to have been tacitly dispensed with by international agreement, in the absence of words making clear an intention to do so (Elettronica Sicula SpA (ELSI) United States* v. *Italy* (1989) ICJ 15 at 42). *Such an intention may be exhibited by express provisions which are at variance with the continued operation of the relevant principle of international law.*  \n 161. Although the precise purpose of NAFTA Article 1121 is not altogether clear, it requires a waiver of domestic proceedings as a condition of making a claim to a NAFTA tribunal. Professor Greenwood and Sir Robert Jennings agree that Article 1121 \"is not about the local remedies rule\". *One thing is, however, reasonably clear about Article 1121 and that is that it says nothing expressly about the requirement that, in the context of a judicial violation of international law, the judicial process be continued to the highest level.*  \n 162. *Nor is there any basis for implying an y dispensation of that requirement. It would be strange indeed if sub silentio the international rule were to be swept away.* And it would be very strange if a State were to be confronted with liability for a breach of international law committed by its magistrate or low-ranking judicial officer when domestic avenues of appeal are not pursued, let alone exhausted. If Article 1121 were to have that effect, it would encourage resort to NAFTA tribunals rather than resort to the appellate courts and review processes of the host State, an outcome which would seem surprising, having regard to the sophisticated legal systems of the NAFTA Parties. *Such an outcome would have the effect of making a State potentially liable for NAFTA violations when domestic appeal or review, if pursued might have avoided any liability on the part of the State.* Further, *it is unlikely that the Parties to NAFTA would have wished to encourage recourse to NAFTA arbitration at the expense of domestic appeal or review when, in the general run of cases, domestic appeal or review would offer more wide-ranging review as they are not confined to breaches of international law.*  \n 164. For the reasons given, Article 1121 involves no waiver of the duty to pursue local remedies in its application to a breach of international law constituted by a judicial act. (Emphases added)  \n We agree with the interpretative approach of the *Loewen* Tribunal.\n\n172.\n\nThe Claimant vigorously submits that any view of Article 11 of the BIT other than the one urged by it, would render Article 11 inutile, a result abhorrent to the principle of effectiveness in treaty interpretation. We are not persuaded that rejecting SGS\u2019s reading of Article 11 would necessarily reduce that Article to \"pure exhortation\", that is, to a non-normative statement. At least two points may be usefully made in this connection. Firstly, we do not consider that confirmation in a treaty that a Contracting Party is bound under and pursuant to a contract, or a statute or other municipal law issuance is devoid of appreciable normative value, either in the municipal or in the international legal sphere. That confirmation could, for instance, signal an implied affirmative commitment to enact implementing rules and regulations necessary or appropriate to give effect to a contractual or statutory undertaking in favor of investors of another Contracting Party that would otherwise be a dead letter. Secondly, we do not preclude the possibility that under exceptional circumstances, a violation of certain provisions of a State contract with an investor of another State might constitute violation of a treaty provision (like Article 11 of the BIT) enjoining a Contracting Party constantly to guarantee the observance of contracts with investors of another Contracting Party. For instance, if a Contracting Party were to take action that materially impedes the ability of an investor to prosecute its claims before an international arbitration tribunal (having previously agreed to such arbitration in a contract with the investor), or were to refuse to go to such arbitration at all and leave the investor only the option of going before the ordinary courts of the Contracting Party (which actions need not amount to \"denial of justice\"), that Contracting Party may arguably be regarded as having failed \"constantly [to] guarantee the observance of [its] commitments\" within the meaning of Article 11 of the Swiss-Pakistan BIT. The modes by which a Contracting Party may \"constantly guarantee the observance of\" its contractual or statutory or administrative municipal law commitments with respect to investments are not necessarily exhausted by the instant transubstantiation of contract claims into BIT claims posited by the Claimant.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal is not saying that States may not agree with each other in a BIT that henceforth, all breaches of each State\u2019s contracts with investors of the other State are forthwith converted into and to be treated as breaches of the BIT. What the Tribunal is stressing is that in this case, there is no clear and persuasive evidence that such was in fact the intention of both Switzerland and Pakistan in adopting Article 11 of the BIT. Pakistan for its part in effect denies that, in concluding the BIT, it had any such intention. SGS, of course, does not speak for Switzerland. But it has not submitted evidence of the necessary level of specificity and explicitness of text. We believe and so hold that, in the circumstances of this case, SGS\u2019s claim about Article 11 of the BIT must be rejected.\n\n174.\n\nIn view of the conclusion we have reached in respect of the application of Article 9 of the BIT to the facts of this case, the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to address Article 26 of the ICSID Convention in any detail.\n\n6. Does the Claimant\u2019s conduct in the Swiss legal proceedings and in the PSI Agreement arbitration give rise to estoppel?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the estoppel argument has been advanced by the Respondent on a general basis regarding SGS\u2019s contract and tort claims and its BIT claims. However, as SGS points out, whatever may have occurred in the prior proceedings, SGS has not alleged a breach of the BIT either in the Swiss courts or in its counter-claim before the PSI Agreement arbitrator.\n\n176.\n\nUnlike some BITs and investment protection treaties, the Swiss-Pakistan BIT does not contain a \"fork in the road\" provision akin to Article 8(3) of the France-Argentina BIT, which provides that \"[o]nce an investor has submitted the dispute to the courts of the Contracting Party concerned or to international arbitration, the choice of one or the other of these procedures is final.\"179 Neither does the BIT set out a provision like Article 1121 of the NAFTA which requires that the would-be claimant must waive its \"right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing [NAFTA] Party that is alleged to be a breach\" of Section A of Chapter Eleven of NAFTA180 and must desist from pursuing claims for damages in relation to such measure.\n\nUnited Nations Treaty Series, vol. 1819, p. 456.\n\nNAFTA, Article 1121.\n\n177.\n\nIn the absence of such treaty language, we are not free to read into the Swiss-Pakistan BIT a requirement that would preclude a would-be claimant from resorting to other remedies in respect of contract claims prior to the exercise of its BIT rights. Moreover, given the general purpose of the ICSID Convention and the object and purpose of the BIT, we would be hesitant to imply estoppel (or waiver for that matter) with respect to BIT claims that have not in fact been alleged in another forum. As they have not been advanced, and SGS did not hold out in any way that they would not be advanced, we cannot find that it is estopped from advancing its BIT claims now.\n\n7. Does the Claimant\u2019s conduct in the Swiss legal proceedings and in the PSI Agreement arbitration amount to waiver of its rights under the BIT?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nIn its pleadings and at the oral hearing, Pakistan emphasized that SGS of its own volition not only objected to the jurisdiction of the PSI Agreement arbitrator, but also filed a counter-claim in the PSI arbitration proceeding.181\n\nTranscript, Volume 1, pp. 60-65.\n\n179.\n\nThe counter-claim filed by SGS did contain a general reservation, stating that SGS\u2019s participation in that arbitration was conditional182 and \"without prejudice to the respondent\u2019s other legal rights under the laws of Pakistan as well as such other law of the domicile of the respondent or international law as may be applicable.\"183 Pakistan countered, arguing that SGS\u2019s objections were baseless, and that SGS had gone further than what was necessary to do in order to object to the jurisdiction of the Islamabad arbitrator by filing a counter-claim setting out substantive claims, and that none of SGS\u2019s objections referred at all to the possibility of ICSID arbitration.184\n\nTranscript, Volume 1, p. 73, lines 17-23.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply. Exhibit S26.\n\nTranscript, Volume 1, pp. 73-83.\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal must note that SGS did object to the jurisdiction of the PSI Agreement arbitrator and did reserve its rights \"without prejudice to [its]...rights under...international law.\" While it is true that in doing so SGS made no reference to the possibility of ICSID arbitration, it cannot be said that SGS unequivocally submitted to the jurisdiction of the PSI Agreement arbitrator. Since the BIT does not contain a provision that requires a would-be claimant to refrain from pursuing claims for damages in other *fora* in order to invoke ICSID jurisdiction, the Tribunal cannot read such a requirement into the BIT.\n\n181.\n\nPakistan describes the BIT claims as \"dressed up\" contract claims. Whatever the merits of the BIT claims (and we do not speak to those merits at this time), SGS has alleged them as separate BIT claims, and it is entitled to have this Tribunal pass upon them.185 To accept the argument of the Respondent that the BIT claims are in reality contract claims and that SGS has waived the right to come to this Tribunal, would deny the Claimant its right to make out its arguments that they are not and would require the Tribunal to pass upon, here and now, the merits of the BIT claims. While SGS has presented contractual counter-claims in the PSI Agreement arbitration and has sought relief that in six of seven heads is identical to that claimed in this proceeding, SGS has not presented claims expressly based on alleged violations of the BIT before any other court or tribunal. We must reject the waiver argument with respect to the Claimant\u2019s BIT claims.\n\nTranscript, Volume 1, pp. 129-130.\n\n8. Does the doctrine of lis pendens preclude the Claimant from pursuing its claims before the Tribunal?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s earlier finding that it has no concurrent jurisdiction over the PSI Agreement claims leads it to the conclusion that the **lis pendens**  doctrine has no application in this case. Pakistan asserted that the doctrine of *ne bis in idem* dictates a dismissal; however, if the claims are not *idem, bis* does not arise. As the causes of action are not identical, the doctrine of **lis pendens**  cannot operate to preclude us from exercising jurisdiction over the BIT claims.\n\n9. What effect may be given to the requirement of consultations between the parties in Article 9 of the BIT?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe Respondent underscores the fact that SGS filed its Request for Arbitration only two (2) days after filing its consent to the ICSID arbitration under the BIT. Article 9(1) of the BIT provides that \"for the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party,...consultations shall take place between the parties concerned.\" Article 9(2) goes on to state that \" [i]f these consultations do not result in a solution within twelve months\" and the investor concerned gives its consent, the dispute shall be submitted to ICSID arbitration.\n\n184.\n\nTribunals have generally tended to treat consultation periods as directory and procedural rather than as mandatory and jurisdictional in nature.186 Compliance with such a requirement is, accordingly, not seen as amounting to a condition precedent for the vesting of jurisdiction. The investor\u2019s consent was given in October 2001 and the Respondent has not (to our knowledge) tried to enter into consultations in respect of the BIT claims. Indeed, considering what the Supreme Court of Pakistan has said about the BIT, it would have been surprising had the Respondent manifested an inclination to comply with Article 9\u2019s consultation provisions. It should also be noted that in the prolonged period of time from termination of the PSI Agreement by Pakistan to the submission of SGS\u2019s written consent under the BIT, there was little indication of any inclination on the part of either party to enter into negotiations or consultations in respect of the unfolding dispute. Finally, it does not appear consistent with the need for orderly and cost-effective procedure to halt this arbitration at this juncture and require the Claimant first to consult with the Respondent before re-submitting the Claimant\u2019s BIT claims to this Tribunal.\n\n*E.g., Ethyl Corporation* v. *The Government of Canada,* Award on Jurisdiction, 24 June 1998, 38 I.L.M. 708, 724.\n\n10. Should this Tribunal dismiss or stay the proceeding as urged by the Respondent until the contract claims are addressed?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent urges the Tribunal to dismiss or stay this proceeding because all of SGS\u2019s BIT claims will require a prior finding that Pakistan has breached Sections 10.4 and 10.6 of the PSI Agreement.187 Pakistan asserts that in such circumstances, international tribunals have either dismissed or stayed the claims, without prejudice to the claimant\u2019s right to re-file its case when the underlying factual claims are resolved or to stay proceedings until such factual issues can be resolved.188\n\nTranscript, Volume 1, at pp. 115-124.\n\nReply at paragraphs 113-114. Transcript, Volume 2, pp. 1126-128.\n\n186.\n\nThis Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Treaty claims. The right to exercise that jurisdiction does not depend upon the findings of the PSI Agreement arbitrator; that is, such findings are not a factual or legal predicate for the consideration of whether Pakistan violated the Treaty obligations to which SGS points.189 This Tribunal can and must consider all facts relevant to determination of the BIT causes of action, including facts relating to the terms of the PSI Agreement. In doing so, we shall not seek to determine the claims asserted under the PSI Agreement; we will determine only the BIT claims of the Claimant. As the *Vivendi* Annulment Committee observed:\n\n105.... *it is one thing to exercise contractual jurisdiction* (arguably exclusively vested in the administrative tribunals of Tucuman by virtue of the Concession Contract) *and another to* *take into account the terms of a contract in determining whether there has been a breach of a distinct standard of international law..*.190 (Emphases added)\n\nWhile SGS contended that the Tribunal was the judge of the contract breaches in light of Articles 9 and 11, it went on to say that \"in any event if you were not, you don\u2019t need to be the judge of the contract in order to be the judge of the violation of the treaty, be it the classic violations or be it the violations because of the observance of commitments provision.\" Transcript, Volume 2, p. 114, lines 3-7.\n\n*Vivendi Annulment, supra,* at paragraph 105.\n\n187.\n\nWe agree with the above observation. This Tribunal is bound to exercise its jurisdiction and proceed to consider the BIT claims that are properly before it. Accordingly, we cannot grant the request for a stay of these proceedings.\n\n188.\n\nThe Claimant can proceed with the BIT claims that are within the subject-matter jurisdiction of this Tribunal without having the factual predicate of a determination by the PSI Agreement arbitrator that either party breached that Agreement. SGS would be in the same position as the claimant in the *Vivendi* case. It is entitled to assert that the acts complained of, individually or collectively, rise to the level of a breach of the BIT, but must make a clear showing of conduct which is, in the circumstances, contrary to the relevant BIT standard.191\n\n*Id.,* at paragraph 113.\n\n189.\n\nThe determination of the PSI Agreement arbitrator as to whether the Respondent (or the Claimant, for that matter) acted in accordance with that Agreement is in any event not dispositive of whether Pakistan acted consistently with its BIT obligations. The completion of the PSI Agreement arbitration is thus not a necessary pre-condition to the resolution of SGS\u2019s BIT claims.\n\nPART V: DECISION\n----------------\n\n190.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(a) This Tribunal has jurisdiction over SGS\u2019s claims that Pakistan breached the Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments of 11 July 1995;\n\n(b) This Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over SGS\u2019s claims that Pakistan breached the PSI Agreement or over Pakistan\u2019s claims that SGS breached the PSI Agreement;\n\n(c) The Tribunal\u2019s second recommendation in its Procedural Order No. 2, dated 16 October 2002, that the PSI Agreement arbitration be stayed pending a resolution of this jurisdictional objection is hereby withdrawn;\n\n(d) The balance of Procedural Order No. 2 remains fully in effect;\n\n(e) Pakistan\u2019s request that this Tribunal stay this arbitration pending a resolution of the PSI Agreement arbitration is denied; and\n\n(f) The Tribunal will proceed to the merits phase of the proceeding.\n\n191.\n\nBoth parties requested an award of costs. The Tribunal declines to issue such an award at this time."}]}
