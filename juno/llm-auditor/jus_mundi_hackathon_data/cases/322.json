There, the following was established, *inter alia*: (i) a procedural timetable agreed by the Parties, including a prior phase of jurisdictional objections in order to determine whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the Treaty; (ii) that the members of the Tribunal have been validly appointed in accordance with the Treaty and the UNCITRAL Rules; and (iii) the immunity of the Tribunal, with the Parties agreeing to not hold the Tribunal or any of its members liable for any act or omission in connection with the Arbitration or to request any member of the Tribunal to be a party or witness in any proceeding, judicial, administrative or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with this Arbitration.\n\n**B. Decision on Jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn November 21, 2013, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 1**, by means of which it provided, *inter alia,* that the UNCITRAL Rules would apply to the present Arbitration, with the modifications agreed by the Parties with respect to the application of Article 41, paragraphs 3 to 6, of the UNCITRAL 2010 Rules.\n\n22.\n\nThe Parties submitted their pleadings corresponding to the jurisdiction phase in accordance with the procedural timetable contained in the Constitution Act and its subsequent amendments. Namely, on January 13, 2014, the Respondent filed the Memorial of Objections on Jurisdiction; on March 7, 2014, the Claimants filed the Answer to the Objections on Jurisdiction; on April 11, 2014, the Respondent filed a Reply on Jurisdiction; and on May 11, 2014, the Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n23.\n\nOn May 26 and 27, 2014, the Parties and the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction in Paris, France.\n\n24.\n\nAfter some exchanges with the Parties relating to questions raised by the Tribunal during the jurisdiction hearing, the PCA forwarded to the Parties the **Procedural Order No. 2**, rendered by the Tribunal on July 16, 2014, by which the Tribunal declared the objections to its jurisdiction phase closed in accordance with Article 29 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n25.\n\nOn December 15, 2014, the Tribunal issued its **Decision on Jurisdiction**,3 in which it ruled unanimously:4\n\n*i. That the Claimants qualify as \"investors\" and the investments made by them qualify as \"investments\" in the terms of Article I of the Treaty;*\n\n*ii. To reject the jurisdictional objections raised by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela;*\n\n*iii. To declare that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to conduct this process and to resolve the dispute between the Parties, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) of 15 December 1976 and the Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (APPRI);*\n\n*iv.

In this regard, the Respondent stated that it had already produced numerous documents in response to the Tribunal's orders and that it was continuing to seek other potential documents.\n\n39.\n\nOn May 25, 2015, the Claimants filed their Statement of Claim (\"**Statement of Claim**\"), together with the Witness Statement of Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas (\"**First Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas**\"), the Witness Statement of Gerardo Zandar\u00edn (\"**First Statement of Mr. Zandar\u00edn**\"), the Expert Report of Compass Lexecon (\"**First Report of Mr. Dellepiane**\", together with its Exhibits CLEX001 to CLEX-034), Exhibits C-14(bis), C-22(bis), C-29(bis), and C-80 to C-119, and the legal authorities CLA-49 to CLA-121.\n\n40.\n\nBy letter dated June 1, 2015, the Claimants responded to the Respondent's letter of May 25, 2015, setting forth the reasons for reiterating their request to the Tribunal \"*that it derive the relevant inferences from the Respondent's failure to comply.\"*8\n\nClaimants' letter to Ms. Jung Lee in response to Respondent's Exhibit of Documents of June 1, 2015.\n\n41.\n\nOn June 8, 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Parties' positions regarding the documents requested by the Claimants would be evaluated in light of the arguments put forward in the Statement of Claim and Statement of Defense, as well as any other evidence to be presented during the course of the Arbitration.\n\n42.\n\nOn October 1, 2015, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defense (\"**Statement of Defense**\"), along with the Witness Statement of Mr. Howard Felipe D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n (\"**First Statement of Mr. D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n**\"), Econ One's Expert Report (\"**First Report of Dr. Flores**\", along with its exhibits EO-1 to EO-102), exhibits R-18 to R-57, and legal authorities RLA-111 to RLA-164.\n\n43.\n\nOn January 15, 2016, the Claimants submitted their Reply (\"**Reply**\"), together with the Second Witness Statements of Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas (\"**Second Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas**\", as Exhibit CWS-3), and Gerardo Zandar\u00edn (\"**Second Statement of Mr. Zandar\u00edn**\", as Exhibit CWS-4), the Second Report of Compass Lexecon (\"**Second Report of Mr. Dellepiane**\", together with its Exhibits CLEX-35 to CLEX-90), Schedule A, Exhibits C-120 to C-189 and the legal authorities CLA-122 to CLA-169.\n\n44.\n\nOn February 15, 2016, the Respondent reported that the law firm Hogan Lovells ceased its representation in the Arbitration and that the law firm De Jes\u00fas & De Jes\u00fas would continue representing the Respondent. The next day, the law firm De Jes\u00fas & De Jes\u00fas confirmed the terms of the February 15 letter.\n\n45.\n\nOn March 14, 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to hold the hearing on the merits of the dispute in Paris, France, between August 1 and 5, 2016, with August 6, 2016 as a reserve.\n\n46.\n\nOn May 23, 2016, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder (\"**Rejoinder**\"), together with the Witness Statement of Lair\u00e9 Montilla (\"**First Statement of Ms. Montilla**\", as Exhibit RWS-1), the Second Witness Statement of Howard Felipe D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n (\"**Second Statement of Mr. Howard D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n**\", as Exhibit RWS-2), the Second Expert Report of Econ One (\"**Second Report of Dr. Flores**\", along with its exhibits EO-103 to EO-172), the Report on Results of Findings of Marco Gonzalez (\"**Report of Mr. Gonzalez**\", along with its exhibits MG-01 to MG-15), the Graphite Technical Report of Pedro Miguel Lollet Rivero (\"**Mr. Lollett Rivero's Graphite Technical Report**\"), exhibits R-58 to R-104 and legal authorities RLA-165 to RLA-235.\n\n47.\n\nOn May 27, 2016, the Respondent submitted an amended Rejoinder, as requested by the Claimants and ordered by the Tribunal.\n\n48.\n\nOn June 27, 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal of the witnesses and experts they were convening to the hearing. In addition, the Claimants alleged that the Respondent had introduced with its Rejoinder new arguments and evidence that were previously available and therefore should have been filed with the Statement of Defense. With that in mind, the Claimants sought the Tribunal's authorization to submit additional evidence in response.\n\n49.\n\nOn July 1, 2016, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 8**, concerning the organization of the hearing, confirmed that the hearing on the merits would be held as scheduled and called a conference call for July 6, 2016.\n\n50.\n\nOn July 4, 2016, the Respondent disputed the fact that the Tribunal had issued Procedural Order No. 8 prior to holding the conference call and having heard the Parties at the conference call.\n\n51.\n\nOn July 5, 2016, the Tribunal determined that the issues referred to in the Respondent's letter of July 4, 2016 would be discussed at the July 6, 2016 conference call.\n\n52.\n\nOn July 6, 2016, the Tribunal held a conference call with the Parties.\n\n53.\n\nOn July 7, 2016, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 8, as amended,** incorporating the changes resulting from the July 6, 2016 conference call.\n\n54.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 8, as amended, (i) on July 8, 2016, the Claimants served notice that they did not require the presence of Mr. Lollett Rivero at the hearing; (ii) on July 18, 2016, the Claimants filed the Third Statements of Messrs.

The Claimants in turn requested exclusion from legal authorities RLA-247, RLA-248 and RLA-249, reserving the right to request exclusion from any of the documents identified as RLA-250 to RLA-272.\n\n**D. The Requests for Review**\n------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nOn June 8, 2016, the Respondent filed with the Tribunal a **First Request for Review** against the Decision on Jurisdiction, along with Exhibit R-105, and legal authorities RLA-236 to RLA-245, requesting the Tribunal:\n\n*6.

Post-Hearing proceeding**\n------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nBy letter dated September 26, 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that on August 1, 2016, it filed a complaint for forgery, use of false documents, fraud and attempted fraud (\"*faux, usage de faux, escroquerie et tentative d'escroquerie\"*) in connection with this Arbitration before the competent criminal authorities of the French Republic. The next day, the Tribunal requested the Respondent to submit a complete copy of the complaint.\n\n71.\n\nOn October 3, 2016, the Respondent indicated that it considered it inappropriate to disclose the contents of the complaint referred to in its letter of September 26, 2016.\n\n72.\n\nBy letter dated October 7, 2016, the Claimants commented on the Respondent's criminal complaint and reiterated their request that the Respondent pay the advance on costs owed by it due to this Arbitration.\n\n73.\n\nOn October 13, 2016, in response to the Claimants' letter of October 7, 2016, and in light of the Respondent's failure to pay its share of the advance on costs required throughout the Arbitration, the Tribunal requested the Respondent to report on the steps taken in connection with its obligation to pay its share of the advance on costs.\n\n74.\n\nOn November 14, 2016, the Parties filed their respective **Post-Hearing Briefs**.\n\n75.\n\nIn a letter dated December 1, 2016, the Respondent stated that it had considered allocating funds from the 2017 budget for the purpose of paying its share of the advance on costs. However, based on its allegations of fraud and the alleged Tribunal's inaction in this regard, the Respondent reiterated its reluctance to pay its share by the due date.\n\n76.\n\nOn December 6, 2016, the Claimants asserted that the Respondent's position was contrary to its obligations to pay the advance on costs under the UNCITRAL Rules, applicable under the Treaty, a fact that should be taken into account for the purposes of a potential decision on costs against the Respondent.\n\n77.\n\nOn December 12, 2016, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 9**, related to the deposit of the advance on costs, the progress of the arbitration proceeding and the Respondent's allegations of fraud. Among other things, on the basis of Articles X(4)(a) and X(4)(b) of the Treaty and Article 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, and in exercise of its inherent powers, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to deposit EUR 700,000 to the PCA as the advance on costs owed by it to date.\n\n78.\n\nOn November 24 and December 16, 2016, the Parties submitted their respective **Submissions on Costs**.

Challenge against Prof. Tawil**\n------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nOn December 13, 2017, the Respondent filed a new challenge against Prof. Tawil.

The Tribunal also ruled that it had all the elements necessary to render the award, as already reported in the letter dated March 21, 2018, and added that, following the conclusion of the deliberations, the award was in the process of being rendered.\n\n**I.

The request for annulment brought by the Respondent**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nOn January 23, 2015, the Respondent reported that on January 14, 2015, it had filed before the Paris Court of Appeal a request for annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction (the \"**Request for Annulment**\") and requested the Tribunal suspend the Arbitration regarding the merits until the annulment judge ruled on the Request for Annulment.\n\n94.\n\nOn January 26, 2015, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to comment on the Respondent's request and requested from the Respondent a copy of the submission to the Court of Appeal referred to in its letter dated January 23, 2015.\n\n95.\n\nOn January 28, 2015, the Respondent reported that, under the applicable French law, although it had filed the request, it had not yet filed the corresponding memorial.\n\n96.\n\nOn February 9, 2015, the Claimants requested that the Respondent's request for suspending the proceedings be rejected.\n\n97.\n\nOn February 20, 2015, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 3** of February 19, 2015, in which it denied the Respondent's request to suspend the arbitral proceedings and ruled that the Parties were to comply with the procedural timetable.\n\n98.\n\nOn September 7, 2015, the Respondent attached a copy of the findings filed before the Court of Appeal on June 15, 2015 in the context of its Request for Annulment.\n\n99.\n\nOn May 12, 2016, the Respondent attached a copy of the brief filed before the Court of Appeal on the same date and in the context of the Request for Annulment.\n\n**2. The Court of Appeal Judgment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n100.\n\nOn April 25, 2017, the Respondent sent to the Tribunal and the PCA a copy of the judgment issued by the Court of Appeal (the \"**Court of Appeal Judgment**\"), alleging that the judgment had annulled the Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n101.\n\nBy letter dated April 25, 2017, the Claimants expressed their disagreement with the Respondent because, according to them, the Court of Appeal Judgment did not annul the Tribunal's Decision. On the contrary, it granted an *exequatur* to its content except for the parts indicated therein. They also requested that the Tribunal set a procedural timetable for the Parties to comment on the relevance of the Court of Appeal Judgment in this Arbitration.\n\n102.\n\nBy letter dated May 1, 2017, the Tribunal accepted the Claimants' request and accordingly invited the Parties to consult with each other in order to agree on a procedural timetable for this purpose. It also required them to submit a Spanish translation of the Court of Appeal Judgment, which they agreed to do.\n\n103.\n\nBy note dated May 1, 2017, the Respondent sent to the Tribunal the Spanish translation of the Court of Appeal Judgment and ratified that the Court had annulled the award on the grounds of the Tribunal's lack of *rationae materiae* jurisdiction and ignorance by the arbitrators of their mission.\n\n104.\n\nThe Respondent rejected the Claimants' request stating that the effects of the Court of Appeal Judgment are not subject to the opinion of the Parties and cannot be debated before this Tribunal. Accordingly, it requested that the members of the Tribunal refrain from further action in this Arbitration.\n\n105.\n\nBy letter dated May 4, 2017, the Claimants insisted that the Respondent did not correctly describe the Court of Appeal Judgment and noted that the Tribunal should exercise its jurisdiction as upheld by the Court of Appeal. They therefore requested that the Tribunal reject the Respondent's request for an injunction and instead establish a timetable for the Parties to comment on the matter.\n\n106.\n\nOn May 9, 2017, the Tribunal issued **Procedural Order No. 10,** establishing a timeline for the Parties to submit (i) their comments and evidence regarding the effects of the Court of Appeal Judgment, including a possible injunction on further action in this case, and (ii) their responses to the comments of the counterparty. The Tribunal decided to continue exercising its jurisdiction until it could objectively resolve the issue raised.\n\n107.\n\nOn July 12, 2017, the Tribunal decided to resume the proceedings. As resolved by Procedural Order No. 10, it invited the Parties to submit their comments and evidence regarding the scope and effects of the Court of Appeal Judgment, as well as their respective responses to the counterparty's comments and evidence.\n\n108.\n\nOn September 8, 2017, the Respondent sent to the Tribunal the **Respondent's Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment**, accompanied by the Opinion of Professor Jean Pierre Ancel and the Opinion of Professor Jean-Baptiste Racine.\n\n109.\n\nOn September 9, 2017, the Claimants filed the **Claimants' Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment**, accompanied by the First Opinion of Prof. Mayer and Mr. Dellepiane's Supplementary Report.\n\n110.\n\nOn October 13, 2017, the Respondent submitted the **Respondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment** together with the Supplementary Report of Dr. Flores and Professor Ancel's *curriculum vitae*. In that brief, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had recently filed an appeal before the Court of Cassation against part of the Court of Appeal Judgment.\n\n111.\n\nOn October 13, 2017, the Claimants submitted their **Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment**, accompanied by the Second Opinion of Prof. Pierre Mayer and the Opinion of Dr. Andrea Pinna.\n\n112.\n\nOn October 17, 2017, the Claimants submitted their Exhibit C-227, as well as the Exhibits to the Opinions of Prof. Mayer and Dr. Pinna.\n\n113.\n\nOn December 17, 2018, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to suspend the proceedings until the Court of Cassation ruled on the appeal it had filed.\n\n114.\n\nOn December 21, 2018, the Claimants informed the Tribunal of their rejection of the Respondent's request to suspend the proceedings.\n\n115.\n\nOn January 2, 2019, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent's request to not render any further decision in these proceedings until the Court of Cassation had issued its decision on the appeal.\n\n116.\n\nOn January 15, 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Court of Cassation would issue its decision on the appeal filed by Venezuela on February 13, 2019. Accordingly, the Respondent requested the Tribunal await the decision of the Court of Cassation before taking any further decisions in the present proceedings, in particular the final award announced by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n117.\n\nOn January 22, 2019, the Tribunal reported that it took note of the request and that it would issue a decision on such request in due course.\n\n**3. The Court of Cassation Judgment**\n--------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nOn February 13, 2019, the Claimants sent to the Tribunal and the PCA a copy of the Judgment issued by the Court of Cassation (the **\"Court of Cassation Judgment\"**) and requested that the Tribunal grant the Parties an opportunity to express their views on the content and effects of this process in two rounds of simultaneous exchanges for each Party. By letter dated February 14, 2019, the Arbitral Tribunal granted the Claimants' request and ordered the Parties to submit two simultaneous rounds of written submissions referring to the content and effects of the Court of Cassation Judgment in this Arbitration.\n\n119.\n\nOn February 19, 2019, the Respondent addressed the Tribunal, requesting a modification of the timetable set by the Arbitral Tribunal with respect to the Court of Cassation Judgment and the holding of a hearing following the submission of the written submissions by the Parties.\n\n120.\n\nOn February 21, 2019, the Tribunal answered the Respondent's request, partially granting the Respondent's request to modify the procedural timetable, and further informed that, despite considering in principle that a specific hearing on the matter was unnecessary, it would make a determination on this issue after hearing the Parties.\n\n121.\n\nOn March 1, 2019, the Claimants provided the Spanish translation, agreed to by the Parties, of the Court of Cassation Judgment, which was assigned the number C-243.\n\n122.\n\nOn March 4, 2019, the Parties filed their respective briefs, and the Respondent attached to its brief Exhibit R-134. On March 25, 2019, the Parties submitted their respective final comments on that judgment, accompanied by Exhibits C-244 to C-247, which were attached by the Claimants.\n\n123.\n\nOn April [-], 2019, in response to the Respondent's request of February 19, 2019 for a hearing on the Court of Cassation Judgment, the Tribunal confirmed its preliminary decision of February 21, 2019 that such a hearing would be unnecessary, which was communicated to the Parties by the respective letter from the Secretariat.\n\n**J. The Respondent's challenges against the members of the Tribunal**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's First Challenge against all members of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nOn May 9, 2017, the Respondent filed a **First Challenge** against all members of the Tribunal based on the Court of Appeal Judgment.\n\n125.\n\nBy letter dated May 10, 2017, the PCA acknowledged receipt of the Challenge and invited the Claimants to state whether they accepted the Challenge, and the members of the Tribunal to confirm whether they resigned from their position in this case.\n\n126.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Claimants rejected the Challenge.\n\n127.\n\nBy letters dated May 11, 2017, Prof. Tawil, Prof. Grebler and Mr. Oreamuno stated that they had no intention of resigning their positions for no justifiable reason.\n\n128.\n\nBy letter dated May 12, 2017, the PCA informed that because the Claimants did not accept the Challenge and the members of the Tribunal did not resign their position, the decision on the Challenge would be made by the Secretary General of the PCA, in his capacity as appointing authority. In this regard, the PCA established a timetable for the submission of additional comments by the Parties.\n\n129.\n\nOn May 13, 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to suspend all proceedings and time limits in this Arbitration until the Secretary General of the PCA decided on the challenge filed.\n\n130.\n\nOn May 20, 2017, the Claimants filed their **Response to the Challenge**.\n\n131.\n\nBy letter dated May 24, 2017, Prof. Tawil stated that the Tribunal's decision to request the Parties to comment on the effects of the judgment rendered by the Court of Appeal did not affect his independence or impartiality and, therefore, in his view, the Challenge presented was not appropriate.\n\n132.\n\nBy letter of the same date, Prof. Grebler indicated that the issues raised in the Challenge did not compromise his impartiality and independence, and noted that the Tribunal had proceeded correctly.\n\n133.\n\nOn the same date, Mr. Oreamuno stated that the Challenge was inadmissible since the Court of Appeal Judgment did not affect his impartiality or independence.\n\n134.\n\nOn May 31, 2017, the Respondent filed its **Reply on the Challenge** and attached documents.\n\n135.\n\nOn June 7, 2017, the Claimants sent their **Rejoinder on the Challenge** along with the First Opinion of Prof. Pierre Mayer and informed that they would deliver their translation in Spanish on June 12, 2017.\n\n136.\n\nOn June 8, 2017, the Respondent referred to the previous communication and indicated that the submission of the First Opinion of Prof. Mayer was irregular and in violation of due process.\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent argued that (i) the time at which it was filed did not allow the Respondent to refute its content and did not respond to any report submitted by the Respondent or to the existence of a new element justifying it, and (ii) it was filed in French and not in the language of the Arbitration, which affected the Respondent's time to present its arguments and evidence. Consequently, it requested the Secretary General of the PCA to issue his comments on the irregularities denounced, to pronounce on the admission or exclusion of the First Opinion of Prof. Mayer and, in the event of admitting it, to be granted a period of 15 days to respond.\n\n138.\n\nOn June 9, 2017, the Claimants referred to the Respondent's communication of June 8, 2017 and stated that (i) the submission of the First Opinion of Prof. Mayer was not limited to answering a prior report, and (ii) there were no language limitations for the supporting documents since the challenge procedure is autonomous. They highlighted the fact that the Respondent did not identify any specific harm it might suffer if it received the translation of the First Opinion of Prof. Mayer on June 12, 2017, and consequently requested that the application for exclusion be rejected.\n\n139.\n\nOn June 12, 2017, the Claimants sent the Spanish translation of the First Opinion of Prof. Mayer.\n\n140.\n\nOn June 16, 2017, the PCA informed the Parties that the Secretary General of the PCA decided to admit the First Opinion of Prof. Mayer and invited the Respondent to submit the corresponding Response.\n\n141.\n\nOn June 26, 2017, the Respondent filed its Response to the First Opinion of Prof. Mayer.\n\n142.\n\nBy letter dated July 5, 2017, the Secretary General of the PCA rejected the Respondent's challenge to the members of the Tribunal.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Second Challenge to All Members of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nOn February 21, 2019, the Respondent filed a second challenge against all members of the Tribunal on the grounds that its decision of February 14, 2019 to grant the Claimants' request to open a debate on the content and effects of the Court of Cassation Judgment without previously requesting the Respondent's position raised justifiable doubts about the impartiality and independence of the members of the Tribunal.\n\n144.\n\nBy letter dated February 21, 2019, the PCA acknowledged receipt of the **Second Challenge** and invited the Claimants to submit their comments thereon, which the Claimants did by letter dated February 28, 2019, accompanied by Exhibits A through O.\n\n145.\n\nBy letter dated March 1, 2019, the PCA invited the arbitrators to comment on whether they were resigning their position and to submit their comments. On March 7, 2019, each of the members of the Tribunal informed the PCA that they were not resigning their duties.\n\n146.\n\nOn March 15, 2019, the Respondent filed its reply to the Claimants' response and on March 22, 2019, the Claimants filed their rejoinder on the challenge.\n\n147.\n\nBy decision of March 25, 2019, the Secretary General of the PCA rejected the Respondent's second challenge to the members of the Tribunal.\n\n**K. Updating the costs of the Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nWhile the Tribunal had timely requested the Parties to file their respective pleadings for costs (in November and December 2016), a number of subsequent procedural developments generated additional costs. Accordingly, by letter dated January 2, 2019, the Tribunal requested the Parties to file their updated submissions on costs no later than January 14, 2019.\n\n149.\n\nOn January 14, 2019, the Parties simultaneously submitted their **Updated Submissions on Costs**, which were forwarded by the PCA to the Tribunal and the counterparty on January 15, 2019.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**CHAPTER III. REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Request**\n-----------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe Claimants request the Tribunal to:14\n\n*i) DECLARE that Venezuela has violated the Treaty and international law, and in particular that:*\n\n*1) It unlawfully expropriated the investments of Mr. Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas and Ms. Karina Garc\u00eda Gruber in violation of Article V of the Treaty;*\n\n*2) It failed to accord the Claimants' investments fair and equitable treatment in violation of Article IV of the Treaty; and*\n\n*3) It failed to comply with the prohibition in Article III of the Treaty not to take arbitrary measures.*\n\n*ii) ORDER Venezuela to compensate the Claimants in full for damages suffered as a result of Venezuela's breaches of the Treaty, which as of August 1, 2016, amount to US$ 1,155.5 million plus interest (or such other amount as the Arbitral Tribunal may decide) until actual payment of the full amount of the award takes place, without the Tribunal being able to withhold any amount by way of taxes;*\n\n*iii) GRANT any other remedy that the Tribunal may deem appropriate;*\n\n*iv) ORDER Venezuela to pay the costs of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the fees and expenses related to the legal representation of the Claimants, and the fees and expenses of the experts appointed by the Claimants and/or the Tribunal, plus interest thereon.*\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6239. See also the Statement of Claim, \u00b6206; Reply, \u00b6407.\n\n151.\n\nThe Claimants amended their petition in the Claimants' Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment as follows:\n\n*(a) Exercise jurisdiction in this arbitration which has been confirmed by the Paris Judgment, proceeding to make a final award on the merits of the dispute as requested by the Claimants in their respective Memorandums and in this brief, with damages claimed as of May 20, 2019: (i) US$ 404.5 million in respect of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, and (ii) US$ 117.3 million in respect of Ms. Garc\u00eda Gruber, updated to the date of actual payment; and*\n\n*(b) Impose all the costs of this procedural incident on Venezuela, including the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal, the administrative costs of the PCA, as well as the fees and expenses related to the Claimants' legal representation and the fees and expenses of their experts, with interest until actual payment.*\n\n152.\n\nIn their comments following the Court of Cassation Judgment, the Claimants confirmed their waiver of part of their original claim, as follows:\n\n*i) take note of the content of the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation Judgments;*\n\n*ii) recognize that the Claimants waived the Tribunal's jurisdiction over investments made when they were not Spanish nationals and claims relating to such investments; and*\n\n*iii) expressly clarify that the issue of nationality and the temporal element of the Tribunal's jurisdiction 'ratione materiae' referred to in paragraph 214 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, and any other statements by the Tribunal in the Decision on Jurisdiction that the nationality of the Claimants at the time the investments were made is irrelevant to considering whether such investments are protected by the Treaty, are 'obiter dicta', as they constitute an issue that has become abstract in light of the Claimants' partial waiver of jurisdiction over claims relating to investments made when the Claimants were not Spanish nationals, since the Tribunal is only exercising jurisdiction over the Claimants' investments made by them when they possessed Spanish nationality.*\n\n**B. The Respondent's Request**\n-------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal:\n\n*IN ITS MAIN REQUEST:*\n\n*1. To RESOLVE, in advance and independently, each of the requests for review filed against the Decision on Jurisdiction, as well as the announced jurisdictional objections;*\n\n*2. To DECLARE its lack of jurisdiction to acknowledge and resolve this controversy.*\n\n*IN ITS SUBSIDIARY REQUEST: If, par impossible, the Tribunal declares that it considers that it has jurisdiction to hear and resolve this dispute*\n\n*1. To DECLARE that the Claimants have filed a fraudulent and bad faith claim against the Republic;*\n\n*2. To REJECT in limine litis all the claims of the Claimants.*\n\n*IN ITS SUBSIDIARY REQUEST: If, par impossible, the Arbitral Tribunal declares not only that it has jurisdiction to hear and resolve this dispute, but also that the Claimants have not introduced a fraudulent claim:*\n\n*1. To REJECT all of the Claimants' claims for lack of the alleged investments protected under the* [Treaty] *or, alternatively, for not having been proven or for lack of merit;*\n\n*2. To DECLARE that the Republic has not violated its international obligations under the* [Treaty];\n\n*3. To DECLARE that the Claimants are not entitled to any economic compensation or reparation from the Republic.*\n\n*IN EACH OF THE ABOVE CASES:*\n\n*1. To CONDEMN the Claimants to pay all expenses and costs related to this proceeding, including professional fees, expenses and costs of legal representatives and experts, incurred by the Republic;*\n\n*2. To CONDEMN the Claimants to pay the interest it deems appropriate on the amounts owed to the Republic as may be generated between the time of the decision on costs and the time of the actual payment; and,*\n\n*3. To ORDER any other measure of satisfaction to the Republic that it deems appropriate.*15\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, p. 100 [Respondent's emphasis]; Rejoinder, \u00b6687.\n\n154.\n\nThe Respondent modified its request in the Respondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment as follows:\n\n*A new arbitral tribunal should be established. The arbitral tribunal must (i) suspend the substantive phase of the proceedings, (ii) order the opening of a jurisdictional phase and organize an adversarial proceeding between the parties on the jurisdiction ratione materiae of the arbitral tribunal, (iii) issue a new decision on jurisdiction in accordance with the Paris Court of Appeal Judgment and only then, (iv) if necessary, order the opening of a substantive phase of the dispute.*\n\n*Even if the present Arbitral Tribunal insists on maintaining the functions it mentions in its Procedural Order No. 10, despite the arguments and reservations made, which is denied, it must then (i) suspend the substantive phase of the proceedings, (ii) order the opening of a jurisdictional phase and organize an adversarial proceeding between the parties on the jurisdiction ratione materiae of the Arbitral Tribunal, (iii) issue a new decision on jurisdiction in accordance with the Paris Court of Appeal Judgment and only then, (iv) if necessary, order the opening of a substantive phase of the dispute.*\n\n*Even if the Arbitral Tribunal considers that it can proceed to the merits of the controversy, despite all the arguments and evidence that have been offered, which is denied, the Republic requests that the Arbitral Tribunal (i) organize an adversarial proceeding on the determination of an adequate and reliable method to establish the value of the alleged investments protected by the BIT and (ii) that the parties perform the respective valuation exercise based on such method.*\n\n*The Republic reserves the right to demand payment of the costs incurred in connection with this incident, including, inter alia, the fees and expenses of its representatives.*16\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b6\u00b665-68.\n\n**CHAPTER IV.

The Venezuelan Government's measures against the Claimants' operations**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nIn April 2003, the Venezuelan National Executive created the business association Mercados de Alimentos, C.A.

In particular, the Respondent points out that, since 1999, there has been a commitment on the Venezuelan Government's side to ensure access to safe food,58 focusing on storage capacities, especially refrigeration and transportation.59 The relevance of these functions meant that activities related to the food sector were subject to greater supervision and control by the State.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b649; Silo Law of 2003, Articles 2.14, 2.15, 21, 30 (**Exhibit R-27**); SADA resolution dictating the rules, guidelines and criteria for the issuance of the Mobilization Guide for Stored and Conditioned Harvest in Silos, Warehouses and Agricultural Deposits, of March 15, 2008, Official Gazette No. 38.967 of July 7, 2008 (**Exhibit R-32**); Resolution DM/n\u00b0 017-09 of March 12, 2009 of the Ministry of People's Power for Food, which establishes the guidelines and criteria that govern the issuance of Mobilization Guides of finished food products, intended for marketing, human consumption and animal consumption with direct impact on human consumption, articles 2 and 3 (**Exhibit R-33**).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b647.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b649; Decree 525 enacting the General Food Regulations, of January 12, 1959, Official Gazette No. 25,864 of January 16, 1959 (**Exhibit R-18**).\n\n170.\n\nOne of the bodies in charge of this control process is the National Superintendency of Silos, Warehouses and Agricultural Deposits (Spanish acronym \"**SADA**\"), which is empowered to implement the policies adopted by the Ministry of People's Power for Food, in order to \"*guarantee fair and equitable distribution in matters of national production and food imports*\".

As a result of this policy, at the beginning of 2010, sanctioning proceedings were initiated affecting \"important companies\" in the food sector63 and, in March, the expansion of the Mercal network was announced.64 Thus, the opening of more than one thousand new points of sale was ordered, which according to the Claimants required to expand the capacity of cold stores and an increase in the distribution capacity of the Government's merchandise.65\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 26:13-16; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b61.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 27:13-14.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b645; Reply, \u00b64; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 26:16-18; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b628, footnotes 64-66, referring to Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 189:30-190:2; Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b645-47; \"President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez launches a plan of expansion for the Mercal Mission\", *Correo del Orinoco*, March 18, 2010 (**Exhibit C-94**); Reply, \u00b6\u00b627-29; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 17:7-18:2; \"Mercal: 7 years of a network that continues to grow*\"*, Ministry of the Office of the President and Monitoring of Government Management (**Exhibit C-112**); Mercal Price List: \"The list of products it markets includes staple foods such as oil, flour, sugar, meat and milk\" (**Exhibit C-111**).\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b645; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 30:18-20.

Consequences of the measures**\n-----------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the \"principal damage\" caused by the Measures was the total loss of the value of their equity in the Companies.152\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b676.\n\n201.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the sums in Alimentos Frisa's bank accounts amounted to US$ 47.9 million (Bs. 103 million).153\n\nStatement of Claim, 77.\n\n202.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants allege that they lost the amounts allegedly advanced by Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas as a security deposit to Alimentos Frisa suppliers to import the goods, which as of May 2010 amounted to US$ 86.6 million.154 These deposits were necessary because, on the one hand, due to exchange restrictions, since 2003 it was necessary in Venezuela to obtain a foreign exchange purchase authorization from the Foreign Exchange Administration Commission (Spanish acronym \"**CADIVI**\")155 to purchase goods abroad, which could take up to six months. On the other hand, most of the suppliers were not willing to assume the costs of the delay of the CADIVI process, and payment was required as a condition to ship the goods. For these reasons, Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas made security deposits to suppliers, which were returned to him when the foreign currency transfers authorized by CADIVI were paid by the respective bank from Alimentos Frisa's account to the supplier.156 After the takeover of the Companies, the amounts pending before CADIVI remained unpaid and the suppliers, not receiving payment from the banks, kept the security deposits.157\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b678, footnote 127; List of unliquidated applications to CADIVI (**Exhibit C-115**); Letters from suppliers of Alimentos Frisa, C.A. to Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (**Exhibit C-117**).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b663; Decree 2.301, February 5, 2003, Official Gazette No. 37.625 of February 5, 2003 (**Exhibit R-24**).\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b680; First Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, \u00b638 (**CWS-1**).\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b680; First Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, \u00b638 (**CWS-1**).\n\n203.\n\nThe Claimants state that they have lost the loans that Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas made in favor of Alimentos Frisa,158 which in 2009 amounted to US$ 49.6 million (Bs. 106.7 million) and became irrecoverable after the Measures.159\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, 116:1-28.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b638, 82-83; Reply, \u00b625; Rejoinder, \u00b6634-644, 655-665; Summary of the Agrofino Project (**Exhibit C-116**).\n\n204.\n\nFinally, due to its cancellation, the investments made for the New Refrigerated Warehouse project were also lost.160\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b683.\n\n**CHAPTER V. APPLICABLE LAW**\n-----------------------------\n\n**A. Relevant provisions of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe text of the provisions of the Treaty most frequently invoked by the Parties in this procedure is transcribed below:\n\n*Article III. Protection*\n\n*1. Each Contracting Party shall afford full protection and security, in accordance with international law, to investments made in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not obstruct, by arbitrary or discriminatory measures, the management, maintenance, development, use, enjoyment, extension, sale or, as the case may be, liquidation of such investments.*\n\n*2. Each Contracting Party shall endeavor to grant the necessary authorizations in relation to these investments and shall permit, within the framework of its legislation, the execution of labor contracts, manufacturing licenses, technical, commercial, financial and administrative assistance.*\n\n*3. Each Contracting Party shall also endeavor to grant, whenever necessary, the required authorizations in relation to the activities of consultants or experts engaged by investors of the other Contracting Party.*\n\n*4. Each Contracting Party shall comply with any obligations it may have incurred with respect to the treatment of investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party.*\n\n*Article IV. Treatment*\n\n*1. Each Contracting Party shall ensure in its territory fair and equitable treatment, in accordance with international law, to the investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party.*\n\n*2. This treatment shall not be less favorable than that accorded by each Contracting Party to investments made and to income obtained in its territory by its own investors or by investors of any third State.*\n\n*3. However, this treatment shall not extend to the privileges a Contracting Party grants to investors from a third State by virtue of its present or future association or participation in a customs union, or by virtue of any other international agreement of a similar nature.*\n\n*4. The treatment accorded under this Article shall not extend to deductions, tax exemptions or other similar privileges accorded by either Contracting Party to investors from third countries under a double taxation avoidance agreement or any other agreement on taxation.*\n\n*Article V. Nationalization and expropriation*\n\n*1. Investments made in the territory of a Contracting Party by investors of the other Contracting Party shall not be subject to nationalizations, expropriations, or any other measure of similar characteristics or effects unless any of that measures is carried out exclusively for reasons of public utility, in accordance with legal provisions, in a non-discriminatory manner and compensating the investor or his successor in title with a prompt, adequate and effective compensation.*\n\n*2. The compensation for the acts referred to in paragraph 1 shall be equivalent to the actual value of the investment immediately before the measures were taken or before they were announced or published, whichever is the sooner. The compensation shall be paid without delay, in convertible currency and shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable in accordance with the rules laid down in Article VII.*\n\n*3. If a Contracting Party takes any of the measures referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Article in relation to the assets of an enterprise constituted under the law in force in any part of its territory in which investors of the other Contracting Party participate, it shall ensure prompt, adequate and effective compensation to them in accordance with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs of this Article.* [\u2026]\n\n*Article XI. Disputes between a Contracting Party and investors of the other Contracting Party*\n\n*1. Any dispute between the investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning the latter's performance of its obligations under this Agreement shall be notified in writing, including detailed information, by the investor to the Contracting Party receiving the investment. To the extent possible, the parties to the dispute shall endeavor to settle these differences by an amicable agreement.*\n\n*2. If the dispute cannot be resolved in this manner within six months from the date of the written notification referred to in paragraph 1, it shall be submitted to the choice of the investor:*\n\n*a) To the competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, or*\n\n*b) To the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) established by the Convention for the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, opened for signature in Washington on March 18, 1965, when each State party in the present Agreement has acceded to it. In the event that one of the Contracting Parties has not acceded to the said Convention, the Additional Facility for the Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and Fact-Finding Proceedings by the ICSID Secretariat shall be resorted to.*\n\n*3. If for any reason the arbitral bodies referred to in paragraph 2(b) of this Article are not available, or if both parties so agree, the dispute shall be submitted to an \"ad hoc\" arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.*\n\n*4. Arbitration shall be based on:*\n\n*a) The provisions of this Agreement and those of other agreements concluded between the Contracting Parties;*\n\n*b) The rules and principles of International Law;*\n\n*c) The national law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment has been made, including the conflicts of law rules.*\n\n*5. The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the Contracting Party of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach of obligations has caused damage to the investor of the other Contracting Party, and, if so, to fixing the amount of compensation.*\n\n**B. The Claimants' arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nBased on Article XI(4) of the Treaty,161 according to which the Parties have established as \"*sources of law applicable to the substance of the dispute*\", and Article 35(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules,162 the Claimants identified as sources of law (i) the Treaty, which operates as *lex specialis*;163 (ii) the rules and principles of international law, which supplement the Treaty;164 and (iii) Venezuelan law, which defines the Claimants' property rights and to which recourse may be had, as part of the applicable international standard.165\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b685.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b686.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b686-87.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b686, 88.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b686, 89; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b692, footnotes 209-211, referring to Statement of Defense, \u00b6129, 131; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 101:24-102:11, 50:10-51:9; Statement of Claim, Section III.A; Reply, Section III.A; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TECMED S.A. v.

The Respondent's arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Measures, adopted only for the purpose of complying with domestic law, are not sufficient to be considered an international wrongful act, citing Articles 2 and 3 of the Articles on Responsibility.172\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6129, referring to Resolution A/RES/56/83 adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations annexing the articles on \"Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts\" prepared by the International Law Commission, articles 2 and 3 (**Exhibit RLA-124**).\n\n209.\n\nGenerally, the Respondent \"*invokes the principle of international irresponsibility of the State towards its nationals, a fundamental principle of international law that must be* [taken] *into consideration by the Arbitral Tribunal under the law applicable to this arbitration\".*173 The Respondent also requests that the arguments of the Claimants concerning the international responsibility of the State be dismissed.174\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6482.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6138.\n\n210.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent argues that the interpretation of Article IV of the Treaty should be made \"*in light of the applicable law for the resolution of investor-State disputes*\",175 in such a way that \"*the provisions regarding* [fair and equitable treatment] *must be interpreted according to the minimum standard of treatment of customary international law*\",176 taking into account that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties has not established a \"*hierarchy or priority among the sources of law applicable to arbitration to constitute a violation of the* [Treaty]\".177\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6437.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6437.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b684, footnote 188.\n\n**D. Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n211.\n\nUnder the Treaty,178 the legality of the Respondent's measures must be analyzed in light of the provisions of the Treaty itself and international law, as well as the national law of the host State \u2013 in the present case, Venezuelan law \u2013 governing the property rights of the Claimants.\n\n\"Arbitration shall be based on:  \na) The provisions of this Agreement and those of other agreements concluded between the Parties Contractors;  \nb) The rules and principles of International Law;  \nc) The national law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment has been made, including the rules relating to conflicts of law\". Treaty, Article XI(4).\n\n212.\n\nIndeed, the Parties do not disagree on the application of international law to decide on the Claimants' claims. It is also true that the Respondent did not contest the application of the substantive rules of the Treaty, nor of the body of customary international investment law. Therefore, to the extent necessary to settle the dispute under its jurisdiction, the Tribunal will focus its analysis, first, on the Treaty and other applicable legal rules, supplementing it, when necessary, with relevant case law and doctrine, all of which are part of international investment law.\n\n213.\n\nThe right of ownership over the shares in the Companies, the expropriation of which has damaged the Claimants, has also not been denied by the Respondent. In its defense, the Respondent alleged that certain procedural rules related to the Companies' general meetings would have been violated, without questioning whether those facts affected the Claimants' ownership of the shares they claimed to own.179 Like the Claimants, the Respondent considered that the ownership of the Claimants' shares is governed by Venezuelan domestic law. The Parties therefore agree that the law applicable to the substance of the dispute is the Treaty itself and the other sources referred to in Article XI(4) thereof.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6109-117.\n\n**CHAPTER VI. EFFECTS OF THE COURT OF APPEAL AND THE COURT OF CASSATION JUDGMENTS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nIn its brief referring to the Court of Appeal Judgment, the Respondent argued that the Judgment annulled the entire Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n215.\n\nFor the Respondent, it is appropriate that a new arbitral tribunal be constituted, which should suspend the substantive phase of this process, order the opening of a jurisdictional phase and issue a new decision on jurisdiction. Alternatively, if the Tribunal were to continue in its present composition, it should take the same steps as mentioned above. If it did not do so, and to proceed and rule on the merits, the Tribunal would have the obligation to (i) organize an adversarial proceeding on the determination of an adequate and reliable method to establish the value of the alleged investments protected by the Treaty and (ii) order the Parties to perform the respective valuation exercise on the basis of such method.\n\n216.\n\nOn the other hand, the Claimants contended that the Court of Appeal Judgment annulled only the part of the Decision on Jurisdiction relating to the temporal element of jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, expressly ratifying the rest of the decision and granting it the *exequatur*. Thus, the Tribunal would have jurisdiction *ratione personae* and jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* limited to those investments made by the Claimants when they were already Spanish. Consequently, the Tribunal should continue this Arbitration exercising its jurisdiction within the limits recognized by the Court of Appeal Judgment, taking note of its content and ruling on the merits of the dispute in relation to the investments under its jurisdiction. Finally, as a result of the Court of Appeal Judgment, the Claimants adjusted the amount of their original claims.\n\n217.\n\nConsidering that the Court of Appeal Judgment was annulled by the Court of Cassation Judgment, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to examine the arguments of the Parties with respect to the above-mentioned Court of Appeal Judgment, whose legal effects disappeared after their cassation. On the contrary, the Tribunal will analyze in detail the arguments presented by the Parties regarding the effects of the Court of Cassation Judgment in this Arbitration.\n\n**A. The Claimant's arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, by virtue of the annulment of the Court of Appeal Judgment by the Court of Cassation, the case was set back to the state it was in before that Judgment, *i.e.*, with the full effect of the Decision on Jurisdiction issued by the Arbitral Tribunal, which, for the purposes of its jurisdiction, did not distinguish between investments made by the Claimants before or after the acquisition of Spanish nationality by the respective investors.180\n\nClaimants' First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b6\u00b61, 14.\n\n219.\n\nHowever, the Claimants waived the portion of the investments made by them when they were not Spanish nationals, in their September 8, 2017 brief referring to the Court of Appeal Judgment. As a result of that waiver, the Claimants reduced their claim to the equivalent value of 4,750,000 shares in Alimentos Frisa and 199,200 shares in Transporte Dole.181\n\nClaimants' First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b618.\n\n220.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants argued, in their Second Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, that the Tribunal should not suspend the proceedings since, under French law, a Request for Annulment against a decision or partial award does not have suspensive effect on the arbitration procedure in an ongoing arbitration. They also deny that the Court of *Renvoi*'s decision will be issued within a short period of time, the stages of which, according to the Claimants, will add up to at least one year.182\n\nClaimants' Second Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b6\u00b612, 16.\n\n221.\n\nFinally, the Claimants requested the Tribunal expressly clarify that the issue of nationality and the temporal element of the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, referred to in paragraph 214 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, and any other statements of the Tribunal in that Decision, with respect to the irrelevance of the nationality of the Claimants at the time the investments were made in order to conclude whether or not such investments are protected by the Treaty, are *obiter dicta*, as they have become abstract in light of the partial waiver of the Tribunal's jurisdiction over claims relating to investments made when the Claimants were not Spanish nationals. So it is that, according to the Claimants, the Tribunal is only exercising its jurisdiction over the Claimants' investments made when they already had Spanish nationality.183\n\nClaimants' First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b625.\n\n**B. The Respondent's arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nThe Respondent alleged that the Court of Cassation censured the fact that the Court of Appeal partially annulled the Decision on Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, after finding that it did not comply with the criterion of jurisdiction *rationae materiae* provided for in the Treaty.184 In addition, the Respondent asserted that, for reasons of proper administration of justice, the Arbitral Tribunal should suspend the arbitral instance until the Request for Annulment is decided by the Court of *Renvoi*.185 According to the Respondent, the Court of *Renvoi* will only have to draw the legal consequences from the findings of the Court of Appeal and declare the Decision of Jurisdiction null and void,186 since the Court of Cassation has issued an orientation, which will certainly be followed by the Court of *Renvoi*.187 For these reasons, the Respondent requested the suspension of the proceedings or the issuance of any decision on the merits of the dispute, until the Court of *Renvoi* issues its decision pursuant to the Court of Cassation Judgment.188 Finally, the Respondent argues that the time limits for the Court of *Renvoi* to decide the issue will be quite short, with reduced lead times and the setting of the hearing within a short time frame.189\n\nRespondent's First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b64.\n\nRespondent's First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b65.\n\nRespondent's First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b622.\n\nRespondent's First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b624.\n\nRespondent's First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b642.\n\nRespondent's First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b639.\n\n223.\n\nThe Respondent added, in its Second Brief, its objection to the Tribunal considering in this award the Claimants' waiver of part of their claim because the Court of Cassation Judgment does not confer to the Arbitral Tribunal the power to reverse and modify its Decision on Jurisdiction.190\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b67.\n\n224.\n\nFinally, the Respondent objects to the economic adjustment presented by the Claimants in their September 8, 2017 Brief, reiterated in their First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, which the Respondent considers absurd, because it is neither possible nor reasonable to use the number of shares of a company and their issue dates to determine which part of the company's value was created before a certain date.191\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b622.\n\n**C. Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n225.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Arbitral Tribunal, by a majority of its members, understood that it was not relevant to inquire into the nationality of the Claimants on the dates on which they made their investments in Venezuela, since, for the majority of the Tribunal, those dates did not constitute a determining factor in deciding on the application of the Treaty.192\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6214.\n\n226.\n\nThe Court of Appeal Judgment held that the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* would also require that the investment had been made when the Claimants had Spanish nationality; consequently, that Judgment declared the absence of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the investments made by the Claimants when they did not have Spanish nationality.\n\n227.\n\nNot satisfied with such outcome, the Respondent filed an Appeal before the Court of Cassation, challenging the judgment that partially annulled the Decision on Jurisdiction. Faced with this appeal, the Court of Cassation annulled the Court of Appeal Judgment, declaring that it\n\n*reverses and annuls, in all its provisions, the Judgment rendered on April 25, 2017 between the parties, by the Court of Appeal of Paris; consequently, it restores the case and the parties to the state in which they were before the said Judgment and, in order for justice to be served, it forwards them to the Court of Appeal of Paris, with a different composition.*193\n\nCourt of Cassation Judgment of February 13, 2019, p. 21 (**Exhibit C-243**).\n\n228.\n\nAccording to the Court of Cassation Judgment, the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal was fully restored with the annulment of the Court of Appeal Judgment. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal may render the final award in this Arbitration in accordance with the Decision on Jurisdiction, that is, in relation to all the investments that could have been expropriated by the Respondent, observing, in addition, the new limits of the Claimant's claim.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**CHAPTER VII. EFFECTS OF THE CHILEAN JUDGMENT**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nBy bringing to this process the Chilean Judgment after the closing of the evidentiary stage, the Respondent attempted to prove that certain persons who had ties to Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas were convicted by the Chilean Judiciary and that the facts on which the conviction of such individuals was based would also implicate him. To the extent that the sums claimed for loans and security deposits would have resulted from various frauds committed with the help of persons convicted in Chile, the Respondent argued that such claims would not be admissible in this Arbitration, where the Claimants' claims in this respect should not be considered.194\n\nRespondent's Comments on the Chilean Judgment, \u00b641-70.\n\n230.\n\nIn its analysis of the Respondent's argument, the Tribunal considered it relevant that, since October 2015, the facts dealt with in the Chilean Judgment were already known to the Parties. Indeed, in its Response, the Respondent asserted that\n\n*the Chilean government continues investigating possible fraudulent activities between 2007 and 2010 aiming at Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas environment and consisting of discrepancies between the purchase amounts declared by Alimentos Frisa (and Friosa) to the Chilean companies MSM and Benipaula Chile, as opposed to those declared to the tax authorities. MSM and Benipaula Chile share Ms. Marlene Beriestain as general manager.*195\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6101.\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimants, in turn, responded to such arguments in their Reply Brief, asserting that\n\n*the allegations referred to by Econ One involve companies outside this process, in which neither the Claimants nor Alimentos Frisa or Transporte Dole, nor any member of the Garc\u00eda Armas family, have any involvement. Neither the Claimants, nor Alimentos Frisa or Transporte Dole are a party to the proceedings in Chile and are therefore unaware (other than the attached journalistic reports) of the factual and legal bases of the claims, and the position of the indicted in the investigation.*196\n\nReply, \u00b6243.\n\n232.\n\nThus, it was clear to the Tribunal that the Chilean Judgment did not bring to the proceeding facts beyond the knowledge of the Parties during the stage of the principal exchanges in this Arbitration and that would not have been subject to sufficient and timely debate and evidence.\n\n233.\n\nLikewise, the Tribunal does not find that the Chilean Judgment and the elements provided by the Respondent substantiate the alleged frauds referred to with respect to the Claimants and the Companies to be validly considered for the purposes of this Arbitration. As an example, the Respondent has not identified in the facts referred to in the Chilean Judgment those that would affect the value of the Companies, nor the impact that they could have in relation to the claims made by the Claimants in this proceeding.\n\n234.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal has no elements to conclude, as the Respondent does, that \"*the judgment crystallized, judicially, that the organization of the Claimants and the alleged Chilean 'suppliers' had the purpose of deceiving the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\".*197 The Chilean Judgment presented its conclusions in a generic manner,198 without indicating which would have been the amounts actually exported, nor the undue increase in those amounts. The Respondent also failed to submit the calculation of the value of the Companies affected by the alleged fraudulent conduct, merely submitting assumptions that do not authorize the Tribunal to draw from them the conclusions held by the Respondent.\n\nRespondent's Comments on the Chilean Judgment, \u00b620.\n\nChilean Judgment, pp. 2-3: \"the amounts exported were not real and were inflated in order to obtain exchange benefits in Venezuela\".\n\n235.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent has failed to meet the burden of proving that the alleged frauds would invalidate the claims brought by the Claimants in this Arbitration.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**CHAPTER VIII. THE SUBSTANCE OF THE DISPUTE**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe arguments put forward by the Parties are summarized below. While the Tribunal has considered and analyzed the totality of the Parties' factual and legal allegations, the following summary is not intended to be exhaustive, but only sufficient to give context to the reader of the Tribunal's analysis and decisions in this Award.\n\n**A. The alleged expropriation of the Claimants' investments**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nIn summary, the Claimants allege that the Respondent has indirectly and illegally expropriated their investment by implementing the Measures, in violation of Article V of the Treaty.199\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b691.\n\n238.\n\nOn the other hand, in short, the Respondent submits that there was no expropriation200 since the Measures were adopted in the exercise of its police power, with the purpose of preserving Venezuelan public order. In addition, the Respondent alleges that no arbitrary measures were taken, and no violation of due process occurred, but simply that the provisions of Venezuelan law were complied with. In addition, the Respondent submits that the cessation of the business of the Claimants is not attributable to the Respondent, but to the Claimants themselves.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b617, 20.\n\n**1. On the Measures taken against the Companies**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Claimants' Arguments*\n------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Article V(1) of the Treaty embodies the principle of international law that an expropriation may take place indirectly when the measures have \"*characteristics or effects similar*\" to a direct expropriation. The Claimants state that the criterion for determining whether a governmental measure constitutes an indirect expropriation is the effect of the measure on the value, use or enjoyment of the201 investment.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6106; Reply, \u00b6122-125; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b693.

In particular, they allude to President Ch\u00e1vez's speeches about the need to expand the Mercal network and the headlines of the press.230 In addition, the Administrative Ruling No. 181 indicates that the justification for temporarily occupying Alimentos Frisa was \"*for the people to have food that is marketed there*\" and \"*not to adapt their activity in the production chain to the needs of the market\".*231\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6144-146; Administrative Ruling No. 181, May 21, 2010, p. 6 (**Exhibit C-33**).\n\nReply, \u00b6146.\n\n248.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, unlike the adoption of measures for the protection of food security and the right to dispose of goods and services \u2013 which may culminate in expropriation upon payment to the rightful owner in the public interest \u2013 the Respondent sought to achieve the same result free of charge and without following the corresponding expropriation procedure.232\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6114; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 21:9-11; 22:8-12.\n\n249.\n\nThe Claimants indicate that the Venezuelan authorities conducted numerous intervention and forfeiture measures against the Companies following the announcement, in 2010, of the expansion of the Mercal state network for the distribution and marketing of basic necessities at subsidized prices. After the announcement, in May and June 2010, the correlative inspections conducted by SADA and INDEPABIS took place.233 According to the Claimants, as a result of these inspections, the Measures materializing the Respondent's expropriation were adopted.234\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6103.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6107.\n\n250.\n\nThe Claimants criticize the inspections of the Companies, according to the *modus operandi* followed with other private food companies, whose real objective was not to sanction alleged irregularities, but to supply the Mercales free of charge.235 Among others, they emphasize the following inconsistencies in the inspection report of May 19, 2010, which served as the basis for Administrative Ruling No. 181:\n\n(a) First, according to the Claimants, there were no inconsistencies between the theoretical inventory and the physical inventory of Alimentos Frisa, detected by INDEPABIS in the report of May 19, 2010;236 such inconsistencies arose simply from methodological flaws incurred by the officials in charge in counting the merchandise.237\n\n(b) Second, on the lack of mobilization guides, the Claimants emphasize that INDEPABIS does not refer in the report to any document or evidence confirming that Alimentos Frisa did not issue mobilization guides.238 The Claimants add that neither SADA nor INDEPABIS charged Alimentos Frisa with any wrongdoing in connection with these alleged irregularities.239\n\n(c) Third, on the alleged price increase, the Claimants point out that their prices were not regulated, so that their fixing did not constitute a wrongdoing of any kind,240 nor, indeed, were there such increases.241\n\n(d) Fourth, on the alleged insalubrity, the Claimants assert that, contrary to INDEPABIS's allegations, there were no pollutants inside the cool stores and that the most reliable proof that the products were not contaminated is the fact that the Temporary Board not only did not destroy those foods, but also arranged for their distribution and marketing to the Mercal.242 In turn, in its minutes, the Temporary Board did not register any insalubrity problems.243\n\n(e) Fifth, on the alleged omission of information, the Claimants state that the only information requested that they did not provide to the officials was the asset inventory book which, in any event, came under the control of the Temporary Board as of May 21, 2010.244 They also state that Alimentos Frisa appeared before INDEPABIS within the legal deadlines and presented evidence and documentation in the framework of the administrative process that followed the inspection of May 19, 2010.245 However, before the legal deadlines for submitting the information required by the Respondent had expired, Administrative Ruling No. 181 was issued, and the Temporary Board took control of the company, its offices and documentation.246\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b645, footnotes 111-115, referring to Administrative Ruling No. 181, May 21, 2010, p. 7 (**Exhibit C-33**); Decree No. 2.304, February 5, 2003, Official Gazette No. 37.626 of February 6, 2003, art. 1 (**Exhibit C-83**); Law Partial Amendment of the Goods and Services Act, Official Gazette No. 39.358 (excerpt) of February 1, 2010, art. 5 (**Exhibit C-29(bis)**); Statement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b634, 56, 59; Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 120:29-130:4; Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 154:21-28; Hearing Transcript, Day 4, 62:1-8, 82:23-83:20, 145:27-146:7.\n\nReply, \u00b644.\n\nReply, \u00b644.\n\nReply, \u00b650; Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 106:14-22, 123:4-6.\n\nReply, \u00b651.\n\nReply, \u00b652.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b641, footnotes 100-103, referring to INDEPABIS Inspection Act, May 19, 2010 (**Exhibit C-32)**; Second Statement of Mr. Zandar\u00edn, \u00b6\u00b629-31; Decree No. 2,304, February 5, 2003, Official Gazette No. 37.626 of February 6, 2003, art. 1 (**Exhibit C83**); Law of Partial Reform of the Goods and Services Act, Official Gazette No. 39.358 (excerpt) of February 1, 2010, art. 5 (**Exhibit C-29(bis)**); Reply, \u00b6\u00b652-55.\n\nReply, \u00b657.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b651-52, footnotes 125-130, referring to First Statement of Ms. Montilla, \u00b6\u00b629-43; INDEPABIS Inspection Act, May 19, 2010, p. 4 (**Exhibit C32**); Transcript of Hearing, Day 4, 108:21-25, 111:3-8, 111:24-29; Minutes of the Temporary Board, May and June 2010, pp. 1-46 (**Exhibit R-37**).\n\nReply, \u00b661.\n\nReply, \u00b662.\n\nReply, \u00b662.\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Administrative Ruling No. 181 did not charge Alimentos Frisa with any conduct under the Goods and Services Act, nor did it determine the commission of other alleged irregularities by it, including the currency fraud, counterfeiting, and smuggling insinuated by the Respondent. On August 19, 2010, the administrative sanctioning procedure against Alimentos Frisa247 was initiated. The Claimants state that INDEPABIS simply alleged that the company had violated Article 8(17) of the Goods and Services Act,248 but this illicit act was not related to any of the conducts allegedly accredited in the Frisa Food inspections.249 The same thing happened at the arraignment and defense hearings held on September 3250 and September 15, 2010.251\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b685, footnotes 193, 194, referring to Act to Initiate Sanctioning Proceedings before INDEPABIS, August 19, 2010, p. 100 (**Exhibit C-103**).\n\nReply, \u00b697; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b685, footnote 195, referring to Notice of Initiation of Administrative Proceedings against Alimentos Frisa, August 19, 2010, p. 1 (**Exhibit R-48**).\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 36:5-8.\n\nReply, \u00b697.

They claim that he contacted them to inform them of the situation and that he would no longer guarantee with his own funds the pending or future orders of Alimentos Frisa.263 On the other hand, according to Mr. D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n's statement, Mr. Zandar\u00edn did not leave his position as general manager of Alimentos Frisa either, but continued in his position until the company ceased operating in 2010,264 after the Temporary Board ceased to be present in the company, towards mid-September 2010.265 As the Claimants explain,\n\n*While Mr. Zandar\u00edn initially participated regularly in meetings with the members of the Temporary Board, on some occasions he refused to sign the minutes on the grounds that the content of the minutes did not reflect what had been discussed at the meetings.

According to the Respondent, the Claimants' alleged investments are not protected by the Treaty because they were not made in accordance with Venezuelan law but rather in bad faith through fraud,267 which the Respondent alleges to be the usual conduct of the Claimants268 and which affects both the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the merits of the dispute.269\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6359; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 77:30-32.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 82:1-4.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 79:22-31; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b64-5, 15.\n\n255.\n\nIn relation to the foregoing, the Respondent points out that the Measures were adopted as a consequence of the illegalities and irregularities of the Companies and cannot be interpreted as an expropriation or a measure having effects equivalent to an expropriation.270 Without arguing that the imposition of the Measures is attributable to the State, the Respondent denies having breached any international obligation.271\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6360-363; Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Official Gazette Ext.

According to the Respondent, the Claimants were treated as any other company, national or international, and the Claimants had the right to raise their complaints against the functioning of the administrative bodies before the courts of the contentious-administrative jurisdiction but decided not to do so.273\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6128-129, 132.

On the contrary, the inspections carried out in the Companies confirmed (i) the existence of inconsistencies between the inventory of products and the physical inventory;274 (ii) the absence of mobilization guides to justify the tons of merchandise stored, in contravention of the Silos Law;275 (iii) the increase in the prices of stored products by 286%;276 (iv) the existence of pollutants in the cool stores;277 and (v) the lack of information requested by the inspectors.278\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6160-161; Reply, \u00b643.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b673, 159; Reply, \u00b6\u00b643-44; Inspection Act INDEPABIS, May 19, 2010, p. 2 (**Exhibit C-32**).\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6162; Reply, \u00b643.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6163; Reply, \u00b643.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6165-166; Reply, \u00b643.\n\n258.\n\nThe Respondent asserts, on the contrary, that it never had an interest in expropriating the Companies and that it has not taken any measure contrary to the legitimate police powers of the State.279 On this basis, the Respondent insists that the Measures cannot be qualified as expropriatory for the following reasons:\n\n(a) The Measures would not amount to an indirect and unlawful expropriation, because the Respondent has not usurped the Claimants' management or control over their Companies, nor has it prevented the Claimants from continuing their business.280 In fact, the Respondent submits that it was absurd to argue that the Temporary Board could import products,281 since neither the Temporary Board nor the General Manager had any relationship with suppliers,282 particularly in relation to the Dole trademark,283 nor access to the \"*Profit Plus*\" system.284 The Respondent submits that the Claimants claim that the Measures are expropriatory because they lost control of their investment, but have not explained or verified that the control of their companies has been taken away from them by the Respondent.285\n\n(b) The Measures were adopted to protect the Venezuelan public order. The State has broad discretion to take measures for the protection of that order and, therefore, to determine if the Measures are expropriatory,286 the purpose of the Measures and the true interest of the State in executing them must be taken into account.287\n\n(c) The Respondent insists that the Claimants retained not only control at all times, but also the management over the Companies.288 The Temporary Board was only intended to supervise and regularize the operations of companies that had been discovered, *in flagranti*, conducting illegal activities.289 According to the Respondent, the Claimants maliciously claim that the State usurped the management and direction of the Companies. The Respondent notes that Mr. Zandar\u00edn was always present as General Manager of Alimentos Frisa,290 even participating in the meetings of the Temporary Board, until he decided to stop attending them.291\n\n(d) According to the Respondent, the Temporary Board was limited to the \"*administration and use of the business, functions as 'simple general agents' that do not correspond to acts of disposition or management of the business*\", which always remained under the responsibility of the owners of the Companies.292 The Claimants also maintained control of the Companies through their trusted personnel.293\n\n(e) According to the Respondent, the Venezuelan authorities found irregularities. The mobilization guides issued by the SADA are the documents that authorize the transfer of food to the storage centers and must be requested for each dispatch that is made.294 On May 13, 2010, the authorities identified the absence of such guides in one of the trucks that was accessing Alimentos Frisa's facilities at that time. This was confirmed by INDEPABIS officials on May 19 and June 7, 2010.295 The Respondent emphasizes that the Director of Alimentos Frisa acknowledged the entry and exit of food without the required documentation and claimed as an excuse the malfunction of the network.296 The Respondent observes that the absence of this documentation violates Articles 2.15, 19 and 28 of the Silos Law.297\n\n(f) On May 19, 2010, the inconsistency of inventories was verified, a non-compliance that allows issuing preventive measures in accordance with Articles 110.6, 9 and 10 of the Goods and Services Act, among others. On the same date another irregularity was detected: the presence of pollutants inside the cool stores, which endangered the salubrity of Alimentos Frisa's facilities and led to the adoption of measures provided for in Articles 147 and 150 of the Agrifood Security Law, such as the suspension of distribution, confiscation, temporary occupation of establishments or goods necessary for the development of the activity, or the storage of confiscated goods.\n\n(g) According to the Respondent, the Claimants also failed to cooperate with the Venezuelan administrative authorities.298 Despite being requested to provide information, the Claimants failed to do so: they did not provide the information relating to the mobilization guides, nor did they provide the fiscal information record, product inventory, transportation fleet documentation, lease contracts, and sales invoices.299\n\n(h) The Respondent points out that the purpose of the inspection carried out by the authorities was not known beforehand, as the Claimants allege. It states that it never attempted to take control of Alimentos Frisa's suppliers and customers since, following the takeover of that Company, orders continued to be delivered to customers until Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas himself decided to cancel all orders to Alimentos Frisa300 and that the alleged looting of accounts referred to by the Claimants was not approved in the first or second inspection, but with Administrative Ruling No. 181. In addition, the Temporary Board was responsible for paying the Companies' payrolls for months until the funds were exhausted.301 The Temporary Board also took care of the regularization of the activities of the Companies assuring the employees' jobs,302 the maintenance and the cleaning of the cool stores303 and the other business commitments assumed by the Claimants.304\n\n(i) The alleged permanent effects on the business are due to the cessation of the operations of the Companies by the Claimants. The decision of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas that the suppliers did not continue with the supply of merchandise was what prevented them to continue with the import and distribution activities of the Companies.305 The Respondent asserts that the sabotage of the companies by the Claimants is reflected in Mr. Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda's306 cancellation of orders from customers and suppliers, having the effect of \"*killing his own company\".*307 The Respondent adds that the Claimants' disinterest in Alimentos Frisa is also evidenced by their decision not to pick up their goods from the Taz\u00f3n Warehouse, in accordance with their contractual obligations.308\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6369, 398; Defendant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b621, 97, footnote 4, referring to the National Project Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar \u2013 First Socialist Plan, PPS- Economic and Social Development of the Nation, September 2007 (**Exhibit R-92**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6369; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6103.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6100, footnotes 230-231, referring to Hearing Transcript, Day 4, 12:20-29; Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 144:16-28: \"RESPONDENT (Ms. Lavista): And you had a relationship with, or saw the contracts with, or knew the agreements with the different customers and suppliers of the company, didn't you?

On the legality or not of the expropriation**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Claimants' Arguments*\n------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nThe Claimants indicate that Article V(1) of the Treaty provides that a lawful expropriation shall be considered as such if it is carried out (i) \"*solely for reasons of public benefit*\", (ii) \"*in accordance with statutory provisions*\", (iii) \"*in a non-discriminatory manner*\", and (iv) \"*with compensation to the investor* [*..*.] *in the form of prompt, adequate and effective compensation*\".320 The Claimants contend that expropriation is unlawful if the Respondent does not meet all of the requirements.321\n\nReply, \u00b6175.\n\nReply, \u00b6175.\n\n264.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, under the Treaty and case law,322 the legality requirements of expropriation apply to both direct and indirect expropriation.323 Thus, the Claimants point out, by way of example, that a State may take regulatory measures for reasons of public utility, following the established procedure and agreeing to compensation for the damage caused to the sacrificed investments, and thus expropriate indirectly, but legally. However, the Claimants assert that, in the present case, the expropriation is indirect and illegal because (i) the State's expropriatory motivation existed,324 despite the fact that the Respondent did not formally appropriate the ownership of the shares of the Claimants in the Companies and other investments, and (ii) the corresponding procedure was not followed nor were the investors compensated for the damage caused.325\n\nReply, \u00b6179, footnote 347, quoting: *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v.

Thus, the measure adopted by INDEPABIS on May 21, 2010 was due to the significant irregularities observed during the inspections of Alimentos Frisa on May 13 and May 19, 2010. A similar situation was observed for Transporte Dole on May 19 and June 7, 2010.343\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6427-431; Inspection Act INDEPABIS May 19, 2010 (**Attachment C- 32**).\n\n270.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, under international law the Measures did not involve the transfer of ownership from the Claimants to the State, or indirectly, through \"*measures with similar effects\"*. In this regard, the Respondent quotes Prof. De Nanteuil to justify that public interest measures - such as those taken by the Respondent - escape the concept of indirect expropriation.344\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6416-417; De Nanteuil, A., *\"Droit International des Investissements et Droit de l'OMC\"*, Droit International des Investissements et de l'arbitrage Transnational.

On the obligation to pay compensation**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Claimants' Arguments*\n------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe Claimants assert that failure to comply with the Treaty requirement that an expropriation is accompanied by a compensation is sufficient to establish the illegality of an expropriation. In particular, they contend that the Respondent's failure to pay compensation results in an unlawful expropriation under the principle of international law that compensation for expropriated property must be \"*prompt*\" and \"*without delay*,\" which is explicitly enshrined in Article V of the Treaty and has been adopted, *inter alia*, by the arbitral tribunals in *Owens-Illinois v.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n276.\n\nArticle V of the Treaty provides:\n\n*Article V. Nationalization and expropriation*\n\n*1. Investments made in the territory of a Contracting Party by investors of the other Contracting Party shall not be subject to nationalizations, expropriations, or any other measure of similar characteristics or effects unless any such measure is carried out exclusively for reasons of public utility, in accordance with legal provisions, in a non-discriminatory manner and with compensation to the investor or his successor in title for prompt, adequate and effective compensation.*\n\n*2. The compensation for the acts referred to in paragraph 1 shall be equivalent to the actual value of the investment immediately before the measures were taken or before they were announced or published, if this happens before. The compensation shall be paid without delay, in convertible currency and shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable in accordance with the rules laid down in Article VII.*\n\n*3. If a Contracting Party takes any of the measures referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this Article in relation to the assets of an enterprise constituted under the law in force in any part of its territory in which investors of the other Contracting Party participate, it shall ensure prompt, adequate and effective compensation to them in accordance with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs of this Article.* [\u2026]\n\n277.\n\nIt follows from the provisions of the above-mentioned Article of the Treaty that the Contracting Party retains the prerogative to expropriate investments made in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party, so long as it does so in accordance with legal provisions, in a non-discriminatory manner and by providing prompt, adequate and effective compensation to the investor. In addition, compensation must be paid without delay, in convertible currency, effectively realizable and freely transferable, in accordance with the rules of the Treaty itself.\n\n278.\n\nThe adoption of measures with characteristics or effects similar to legal expropriation by one of the Contracting Parties does not fall outside the protection of the Treaty, even if such measures do not follow the procedures established in this sense in their national laws. In other words, considering that investments possibly subject to expropriation according to legal formalities are protected by the Treaty, measures of equivalent effect leading to expropriation without observing such formalities must also, *a fortiori*, be subject to the rules of the Treaty, as results from its spirit and from its own letter; otherwise, the protection granted by the Treaty would be ineffective. From that perspective, the Tribunal will analyze the facts submitted by the Parties for its appreciation.\n\n*(a) The Measures constituted an expropriatory act on the Respondent's side.*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the preventive measures of seizure, occupation and temporary operation executed by the Respondent against Alimentos Frisa, confirmed by Administrative Ruling No. 181 of May 21, 2010 and the preventive measure of retention of means of transport in Transporte Dole, confirmed by Administrative Ruling No. 208 of July 14, 2010, led to the cessation of the activities of the Companies without the consent of the Claimants, depriving them of the use and enjoyment of their property.\n\n280.\n\nEven if it were considered that the Respondent may not have intended to expropriate the Claimants' property, the measures taken greatly exceeded the objectives mentioned in Administrative Rulings Nos. 181356 and 208.357 And the effects of the preventive measures resulted, without a doubt, in an indirect expropriation of the Companies.\n\nAdministrative Ruling No. 181, p. 6 (**Exhibit C-33**) (\"[...] That according to the Act of Inspection dated May 19, 2010, previously mentioned practiced at the Commercial establishment FRISA FOOD C.A, this Institute for the purpose of ensuring the operation and continuity in providing the service of the company, so that the people have food that is currently marketed there in a timely, uninterrupted, continuous, effective, efficient, in accordance with the provisions of Article 112 numeral 1 dictates measure of **OCCUPATION AND TEMPORARY OPERATIVITY OF THE COMPANY FOOD FRISA, C.A**, for a period of **NINETY CONTINUOUS DAYS (90)** counted from the present date, such measure consists of the immediate possession, continuation of the operation, and the use of the local establishment, branches, purchase posts, redistribution centers, deposits is left to the custody of the company with supervision and accompaniment by the Institute and the commission designated for that purpose, composed of officials of INDEPABIS, or other authorities, this in order to ensure that people are available to goods and services. It orders the review of the asset inventory and execute all necessary actions in order to ensure the continuity of service provision or the corresponding phase of the production, distribution and consumption chain. [\u2026]\").\n\nAdministrative Ruling No. 208, p. 2 (**Exhibit C-39**) (\"[...] It is the case that, as already indicated, Transporte Dole C.A. has not collaborated in the delivery of the requests, a situation that has hindered the inspection only having contact with Attorney Trina Guancue, who claims to be a Judicial Power of Attorney, but who up to the present time has not consigned all the documentation requested and the most transcendental has not presented a power of attorney to accredit her on their behalf. Considering that likewise, has not been consigned: Inventory of assets, all documentation of its transport fleet and other documents to specify the operations carried out as a company and their corresponding relationship with FRISA, it is decided to issue PREVENTIVE MEASURE in accordance with Article 112 paragraph 2 which is as follows: The Preventive Measures that may be marketed to are as follows: Nral 2: Taking possession [of] the means and use of means of transport... Omissis since Articles 5, 6, and 7 of the above-mentioned legal instrument consider the activity carried out by this company as an essential service[s] among other peculiarities, it therefore proceeds in this act to take possession of the transport fleet for its use which is described below [...]').\n\n281.\n\nThe expropriation took place after the physical takeover of the Companies, which acquired permanent effects by virtue of the actions of the Respondent's agents. Indeed, Administrative Ruling No. 181 provided for a 90-day term for the Intervention Measure, which was extended for an additional 90 days.358 In this period, the Administrative Board sent the products of Alimentos Frisa to the Mercal network and other locations, took possession of the funds of the bank accounts of the Companies and did not try to give continuity to the imports and activities of Alimentos Frisa.359 The Claimants were prevented from managing the Companies, whose business activities were completely and definitively suspended, resulting in the loss of their tangible and intangible assets.\n\nINDEPABIS Resolution of August 19, 2010 (**Exhibit C-40**).\n\nFirst Statement of Mr. Zandar\u00edn, \u00b6\u00b624-37, (**Exhibit CWS-1**).\n\n282.\n\nMr. D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n's testimony evidences that the actions of the Respondent's agents seriously affected the regular operation of the Companies and, consequently, their economic value, as evidenced by the termination of Alimentos Frisa's activities as a food importer and distributor.360 The lack of allocation of financial resources to develop its main activities and the absence of a management with experience in the business prevented Alimentos Frisa from remaining in operation.\n\n\"CLAIMANT (Mr. Blackaby): Who controlled Alimentos Frisa's bank accounts after the takeover? WITNESS (Mr. D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n): By delegation and authorization of the act that makes the measure of temporary occupation, Alimentos Frisa, because indeed, it was proceeded to make the changes of holders of the bank accounts. In this case the signatories were Ms. Laire Montilla and myself.  \nCLAIMANT (Mr. Blackaby): So explain to me, how could the owners of Alimentos Frisa have continued to import if they didn't have the right to sign checks for the company?  \nWITNESS (Mr. D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n): The case in this matter was that the money that we found in the accounts of Alimentos Frisa scarcely served us to pay the personnel or the salaries accrued from the personnel assigned to the company. There was not enough money in the Alimentos Frisa accounts for us to be able to maintain the import activities -if any-. But for this, we needed the direct authorization of the owners of the company to continue operations.  \nCLAIMANT (Mr. Blackaby): So, your... You said there wasn't enough money in Alimentos Frisa's accounts to make imports. Is that your testimony?  \nWITNESS (Mr. D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n): Yes, exactly.\" Hearing Transcript, Day 4, 8:25-9:15.\n\n283.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that the Respondent's Measures did not result from the imposition of statutory sanctions for alleged breaches by the Companies, but from the Respondent's decision to dispose of the assets of the Companies and the Claimants. This decision resulted in the deprivation of the control and management of the assets of the Companies and the Claimants \u2013 which became permanent due to their undue prolongation over time \u2013 and the abandonment by the Respondent of the commercial and business structures, plans and objectives.\n\n284.\n\nMr. Zandar\u00edn's testimony confirms that the Respondent's agents went on to manage the Companies361 and dispose of their assets362 without adopting minimally adequate procedures for preserving or accounting for an estate that did not belong to them, or maintaining control on the merchandise inventories and/or existing fixed assets. According to Mr. Zandar\u00edn, the Temporary Board \"*was focused on dispatching the merchandise that was in the cool stores, and I was attending the meetings with them, as I told you, and at the end of September, when the inventories had been exhausted, they gradually stopped attending the Alimentos Frisa facilities every day*\"*.*363\n\n\"CLAIMANT (Mr. Pom\u00e9s): Mr. Zandar\u00edn, in your opinion, who maintained the administration of Alimentos Frisa since the arrival of the Board?  \nWITNESS (Mr. Zandar\u00edn): The administration was maintained by the Board of Auditors. I was focused on trying to assist them in the activities they allowed me to do. I even - as I've just said - made the greatest effort to give them the knowledge of how to handle the merchandise. Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 107:13-18.\n\n\"WITNESS (Mr. Zandar\u00edn): At the time of the intervention, Alimentos Frisa had valid import permits. I remember talking to Mr. Howard Diaz and telling him that we had that availability and that there was money in the accounts and that we could start an import, keep the company moving. He told me... I felt that he had been interested in the idea and he told me the next day that his superiors had told him no, that there would be no more foreign currency for Alimentos Frisa.  \nCLAIMANT (Mr. Pom\u00e9s): And could you comment on what the Temporary Board of Directors used the Alimentos Frisa funds for?  \nWITNESS (Mr. Zandar\u00edn): Look, I don't know the total of how you used the funds. I know you were in the payroll business. I remember in particular a payment that was made... -Ms. Lilia, who was in charge of writing the checks, told me, a payment was made for cleaning the cool stores, which was close to two million bolivars, but I don't know how the company's funds were used\". Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 107:27-108:8.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, 107:8-11.\n\n285.\n\nAs a mere example of the existing situation, when Mr. D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n, member of the Temporary Board, was interrogated during the Hearing regarding if there was any record of the dispatch of five tons of cuttlefish in the minutes of the Temporary Board, he informed that \"*not necessarily* [...] *possibly the instruction received by the Ministers was perhaps subsequent to this date, and perhaps the dispatches had already been made previously*\". When asked if five tons of cuttlefish could have been shipped without any record, Mr. D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n replied that \"*I cannot answer that because \u2013 and I repeat \u2013 Doctor, we were not responsible for those inventories. Those responsible for the inventories were Alimentos Mercal, not us\".*364\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, 40:2-14.\n\n286.\n\nThe testimonies and other evidence gathered during this Arbitration accredit that the management of the Temporary Board over the operational assets of the Companies was inorganic, characterized by the significant absence of control and a clear definition of the responsibilities, competences and obligations of those who had to ensure the preservation, administration and control of a foreign estate during the validity of the Measures \u2013 be it the Temporary Board or other State bodies such as INDEPABIS, SADA, and Mercal \u2013 that intervened during the process.\n\n287.\n\nIn that regard, the Tribunal's attention is drawn to the fact that the new administrators of Alimentos Frisa, appointed by the Respondent, had not taken any measures defending the Company in relation to the contract it had signed with IPSFA for the use of the facilities of the Taz\u00f3n Warehouse. The Respondent's agents in charge of the management of the company limited themselves to receiving the IPSFA notice of June 3, 2010 that communicated the termination of the contract, without exercising any action, management, opposition or defense or generating an alternative for its replacement, depriving the Company of a central element for its commercial survival.365\n\n\"PRESIDENT OF THE TRIBUNAL: OK. One other question: when the members of the Temporary Board informed you that the lease for use contract with IPSFA had already ended, that it was going to end, did they inform you of what attitude they intended to take? If they intended in any way to make some kind of appeal or some measure for continuation or...? What kind of information did they pass on to you?  \nWITNESS (Mr. Zandar\u00edn): I remember that it was Howard Diaz who informed me, initially verbally. After he spoke with Ms. Gascue, that meeting took place where she was present, and he merely gave me that information that they had been given a notice of termination of the contract. I don't remember any more.\" Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 156:1-9.\n\n288.\n\nThe Tribunal was also impressed by the sequence of situations that led to the operational unfeasibility of the Companies. Mr. D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n, a member of the Temporary Board, acknowledged that the ninety days of temporary occupation were extended \"*for a further ninety days* [...] *and then kept in time\"*. Asked by Prof. Tawil about how the trial proceeded, the witness reported that:\n\n*a posteriori the contract that Alimentos Frisa had in the*\n\n*Taz\u00f3n Warehouse was terminated.* [...]*Then, Frisa could no longer use the cool stores that were leased inside of the Taz\u00f3n Warehouse. That is to say, Alimentos Frisa at that time was left without physical* [...] *headquarters.* [...] *So, that's the first trigger* [...] *because obviously, let's say we are left without* [...] *or Frisa Food is left without physical headquarters. We, then obviously, each of us, Laire had his office, I had my office, and at times we would meet, either at the Ministry of Commerce in the office assigned to Laire, or at my office in the Ministry of Food, we would meet to discuss a few things. But obviously in the end, given the absence of representatives of the company, we could not do more* [...].366\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, 88:22-89:2.\n\n289.\n\nThis testimony from the principal member of the Temporary Board demonstrates the irresponsibility evidenced by the Respondent's agents in the management of the Companies and the passive acceptance of their virtual liquidation as business entities.\n\n290.\n\nIt has not been proven that, as the Respondent claims, the Claimants abandoned the Companies.367 On the contrary, the evidence provided shows that the Claimants attempted, as far as possible, to defend themselves against the forced intervention in the management of the Companies through administrative appeals against INDEPABIS and MINCO, which as to this date have not been resolved by such entities of the Respondent.368\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6256-266.\n\nReply, \u00b6192-214.\n\n291.\n\nBased on these legal positions, the Tribunal concludes that the Measures taken by the Respondent's agents against the Companies did not reflect the legitimate exercise of the regulatory power or the preservation of the national public order. On the contrary, evidence such as (i) the Administrative Rulings Nos. 181 and 208; (ii) the Respondent's failure to respond to the Claimants' claims with respect to those rulings; (iii) proof of the deprivation of control and management of the Companies, corroborated by the detailed testimonies referred to above from Messrs. Zandar\u00edn and D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n; and (iv) their undue prolongation in time, confirm that such actions resulted in an expropriation by the Respondent, which seriously violated the Claimants' property rights in the Companies,369 without being compensated for the losses suffered as a result, in violation of the Treaty370 and the principles of international law.\n\nThe arbitral tribunal in the *Flughafen Z\u00fcrich A.G. and Gesti\u00f3n e Ingenier\u00eda IDC S.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* case concluded that \"[t]he 'expropriation' lies in the fact that the State, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, dispossesses an investor protected by the Treaty, depriving him of control or ownership of a protected investment in violation of the conditions required by the Treaty. Dispossession implies that the investor suffers the loss of use and enjoyment (and not necessarily ownership) of the investment. The definition of the Treaty therefore focuses on the investor, not on the State. ICSID Case No. ARB/10/19, Award, November 18, 2014, \u00b6456 (**Exhibit CLA-118**).\n\nTreaty, Articles III, IV and V.\n\n*(b) The Respondent's Measures were not legitimate*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nLike most legal systems, the Venezuelan legal system provides for the possibility that, under certain conditions and in accordance with certain procedures, the State may acquire ownership of private property for reasons of public interest, provided that the expropriated person is paid a fair compensation. In this line, the Treaty recognizes the possibility that investments made by nationals of Contracting Parties may be expropriated, subject to compliance with certain conditions and the payment of fair compensation.371\n\n\"Investments made in the territory of one Contracting Party by investors of the other Contracting Party shall not be subject to nationalizations, expropriations, or any other measure of similar characteristics or effects unless any such measure is carried out exclusively for reasons of public utility, in accordance with legal provisions, in a non-discriminatory manner and with compensation to the investor or his successor in title for prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Treaty, Article V, 1.\n\n293.\n\nThe Claimants do not question the possibility of expropriation but allege that \"*expropriation under Venezuelan law should follow an established procedure and entail payment of the fair price. None of this happened. Instead of initiating an expropriation lawsuit and paying compensation as required by the National Constitution, the Expropriation Law, the Goods and Services Act and the Agrifood Security Law, Venezuela resorted to other improper legal instruments, abusing them to get the Companies for free, violating due process and the Venezuelan law*\"*.*372\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6135.\n\n294.\n\nIn the present case, the deprivation of the property of the Claimants by the Respondent did not comply with the expropriation procedures provided for in the Venezuelan law or the Treaty and without paying the Claimants the compensation provided therein for the loss of their property.\n\n295.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that, according to Article V of the Treaty, for an expropriation to be considered unlawful it is not required that each and every one of the exceptions established in it is presented simultaneously \u2013 \"*that it be carried out* [...] *exclusively for reasons of public utility, in accordance with legal provisions, in a non-discriminatory manner and with compensation to the investor or his successor in title for prompt, adequate and effective compensation*\" \u2013 but instead it is sufficient to demonstrate the noncompliance of one of them. In the specific case, even assuming that the Measures could have complied with public purpose requirements and not be discriminatory, the failure to pay \"*prompt, adequate and effective*\" compensation constitutes in itself a breach of sufficient entity to render the expropriation illegal.\n\n296.\n\nIn addition to the requirements of the Treaty, the payment of fair compensation by the Respondent constitutes one of the essential requirements under Article 115 of the National Constitution of Venezuela, according to which\n\n*the right of ownership is guaranteed. Everyone has the right to the use, enjoyment and disposition of his or her property. The property shall be subject to the contributions, restrictions and obligations established by law for purposes of public utility or general interest. The expropriation of any kind of property may be declared only for reasons of public utility or social interest, by means of a final judgment and timely payment of fair compensation.*373\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6131. Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, article 115 (**Exhibit C26**).\n\n297.\n\nIn turn, Article 7 of the Expropriation Law for Public or Social Use of 2002 (the \"**Expropriation Law**\") determines that, in order to carry out an expropriation under the Venezuelan law, it is required, among other things, that a timely payment, in cash, of a fair compensation is made, prior to taking over physical possession of the goods, and that, in the absence of agreement between the parties on the fair price, the expropriating entity may \"*go to court to request the expropriation of the affected goods*\".374\n\nLaw of Partial Reform of the Law of Expropriation for reasons of public or social utility, May 21, 2002, Official Gazette No. 37.475 of July 1, 2002, arts. 6, 8, 19-20, 22, 45-46 and 56 (**Exhibit C-82**).\n\n298.\n\nThe Respondent's use of the extraordinary power to expropriate an investment protected by the Treaty was not lawful. The Measures did not comply with the essential requirement of the payment of a \"*prompt, adequate and effective compensation*\" for the Claimants' investments under Article V of the Treaty, nor did they comply with the provisions of Venezuelan law regarding the payment of fair compensation prior to the taking of possession of the expropriated property.\n\n*(c) The Claimants should be compensated for damages suffered as a result of the Measures taken by the Respondent*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n299.\n\nHaving concluded that the Measures meant the expropriation of the investment, the Tribunal determines that the Claimants are entitled to fair compensation for the damages suffered, in accordance with Article V of the Treaty. The elements contributed to this process demonstrate that the Claimants were unable to recover ownership of the assets taken by the Respondent, nor did they receive any compensation for such loss. They must therefore be compensated.\n\n**B. The alleged violation of the standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment and the prohibition of arbitrariness**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, pursuant to Article IV of the Treaty, the Respondent failed to execute the Measures within a transparent legal framework and to respect due process guarantees and that it violated the prohibition of arbitrariness.375\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6101.\n\n301.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Measures were not anomalous but were adopted in accordance with the principles of international law, including those contained in Article IV of the Treaty376 and Venezuelan law, and therefore the Respondent should not be considered to have violated due process or to have acted arbitrarily.377\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6109, footnote 247, referring to Reply, \u00b6203.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b617.\n\n**1. The application of the international standard of fair and equitable treatment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Claimants' Arguments*\n------------------------------\n\n302.\n\nThe Claimants note that, since the Respondent did not pay them any compensation, the Tribunal could conclude its analysis of unlawful expropriation at this point, since failure to comply with any of the expropriation legality requirements makes the expropriation illegal.378 However, the Claimants add that the Respondent's conduct also violated due process and the standard of fair and equitable treatment (the \"**FET**\"), given the arbitrary, unreasonable and disproportionate nature of the Measures.379\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6101.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b614, 174, 207; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b697, 101.\n\n303.\n\nThe Claimants note that Article IV(1) of the Treaty contains the FET standard, which each Contracting Party must ensure in its territory,380 and that Article III(1) of the Treaty establishes, *inter alia*, the obligation of each Contracting Party not to hinder by arbitrary and discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, development, use, enjoyment, extension, sale, or \u2013 where appropriate \u2013 liquidation of investments made in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.381\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6195, 198.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6200-202.\n\n304.\n\nThe Claimants interpret the FET standard and the concept of arbitrariness in international law and contend that the Measures violated the principles of transparency and due process and were arbitrary.382\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6153; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 21:15-22.\n\n305.\n\nThe Claimants add that the FET standard is not limited to the international minimum standard and that, even if it were, a non-bad-faith measure is considered a violation of international law if it is unfair and inequitable.383 On the basis of case law,384 the Claimants contend that, *inter alia,* \"*due process violations*\",385 \"*lack of transparency in the legal process or in State acts*\"386 and \"*measures that are arbitrary*\"387 violate the FET standard.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6103-104, footnotes 233-238, referring to Rejoinder, para. 437-446; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 57:16-58:3, 106:27-108:8; *L.

The Respondent also clarifies that the SENIAT imposed on June 7, 2011 a sanction for the irregularities detected on May 19, 2010.415\n\n(d) In connection with the alleged irregularity of the failure to initiate an administrative proceeding against Transporte Dole, the Respondent believes that the Claimants were aware of Transporte Dole's accessoriness to Alimentos Frisa. The trucks were owned by Transporte Dole, but their use and exploitation belonged solely to Alimentos Frisa. Therefore, although the Claimants allege a violation of due process for the failure to initiate sanctioning proceedings against Transporte Dole, the Claimants dispense with the individuality of Transporte Dole for the purpose of rejecting the Measures at the administrative procedure.416\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6197 and footnote 247.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, 120:8-29, 121:1-11.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6217-218; SADA Inspection Report, May 13, 2010 (**Attachment C-30**).

The Respondent asserts that the lack of recourse to the courts weakens the Claimants' claim and precludes their claim for investment protection because:\n\n(a) There is a reasonable obligation to attempt to exhaust the domestic remedies, endorsed by investment tribunals.417 The Measures and the audit procedure were at a preliminary stage in which it is common, even in the most sophisticated legal systems, for there to be delays in their resolution or minor anomalies.418\n\n(b) The Claimants never attempted to initiate a contentious-administrative procedure, although they had the right to bring their claims before the courts with contentious-administrative jurisdiction. Therefore, the Claimants abandoned the remedies available to them and never elevated their views from the administrative layer to the judicial one.419 The Claimants, however, did not raise their views from the administrative layer to the judicial layer.

The alleged violation of due process**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Claimants' Arguments*\n------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nThe Claimants allege that their due process was violated since, despite having repeatedly filed briefs before the INDEPABIS after the issuance of Administrative Rulings Nos. 181 and 208,425 neither INDEPABIS nor MINCO issued final resolutions regarding the appeals filed.426\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b664, 70.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b667; Reply, \u00b678; Rejoinder, \u00b6343. Written communication from Alimentos Frisa and Transporte Dole to the Ministry of Commerce, March 4, 2011 (**Exhibit C-105**).\n\n315.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that the Respondent has violated their right to due process because:\n\n(a) The Respondent physically occupied the companies and took control of them, their management, assets and operations, by preventive and transitory measures.427\n\n(b) The Respondent neither filed an expropriation suit nor paid the compensation, as required by the Venezuelan National Constitution, the Expropriation Law, the Goods and Services Act, and the Agrifood Security Law.428\n\n(c) In the end, the Respondent has deprived the Claimants of all the value, use and economic benefit of their investments in the Companies, without paying any compensation and without the initiation of any expropriation proceedings.429\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b66, 184(iii).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b613, 94-96, 104-106.\n\nReply, \u00b6177.\n\n316.\n\nThe Claimants refute the Respondent's argument that the Companies should have initiated the sanctioning proceedings after the administrative silence had taken place430 because:\n\n(a) The Companies were not inactive, since they submitted new writings, even after lodging administrative appeals against the preventive measures.431\n\n(b) The Respondent was the one who initiated the procedure against Alimentos Frisa accusing it of alleged irregularities, and therefore it was up to it to conclude it.432\n\n(c) The SENIAT resolution to which the Respondent refers, in which a fine of 70 tax units was applied for allegedly failing to comply with its obligation to display certain certificates at the offices and to provide information on the payment of VAT in its daily books, was not the culmination of any of the administrative or sanctioning proceedings brought by INDEPABIS, nor did it have any relation with the preventive measures taken against the Companies.433 Therefore, the measures taken preventively were absolutely arbitrary and lacked proportionality.434\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6107-108, Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6350-352.\n\nReply, \u00b6108.\n\nReply, \u00b6110, footnote 231, citing Judgment No. 1588, Supreme Court of Justice, Political-Administrative Chamber, November 25, 1999, p. 5 (**Exhibit C-122**).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6113-114, footnote 237, referring to Resolution of imposition of sanction of the Integrated National Service of Customs and Tax Administration (SENIAT) No. 1389, June 7, 2011 (**Exhibit R-44**).\n\nReply, \u00b6114; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6353-356.\n\n317.\n\nIn line with the foregoing, the Claimants contend that administrative proceedings should be conducted in a transparent manner and that this duty typically includes the possibility of a reasonable legislative or procedural remedy to challenge the intended measure.435 In this regard, the Claimants invoke the standards applied by the arbitral tribunals in, *inter alia*, *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela*436 and *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan437* to justify that the Measures violate the standard of FET.438\n\nReply, \u00b6199, referring to *Mohammad Ammar Al-Bahloul v.

On the one hand, Alimentos Frisa offered and requested the production of a significant amount of evidence that INDEPABIS rejected *in limine*. INDEPABIS never issued a definitive resolution regarding the accusation, leaving the procedure unfinished and without any sanction being applied against Alimentos Frisa.439 The Claimants state that the conduct charged to Alimentos Frisa in the sanctioning process could never have been resolved with such a serious sanction as the seizure and subsequent commercialization of 1,225.91 tons of food and the substitution of the management and administration of the company by the State, indefinitely and permanently.440\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b699-100.\n\nReply Brief, \u00b6\u00b6100-101.\n\n319.\n\nIn relation to Transporte Dole, the Claimants state that INDEPABIS did not even attempt to initiate a proper sanctioning process under the Goods and Services Act,441 basing the measures relating to Transporte Dole solely on the absence of the managers during the inspection.442 For the Claimants, INDEPABIS's failure to charge any economic or administrative wrongdoing under the Goods and Services Act against Transporte Dole resulted in the *de facto* and permanent application of the protective measures provided for under Administrative Ruling No. 208. All of this constituted a violation of the principles of presumption of innocence and due process and the Claimants' right of defense. In addition, the Claimants emphasize the Respondent's acceptance that there was an \"anomaly\" in the failure to initiate sanctioning proceedings against Transporte Dole.443\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 36:29-31.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 19:12-13.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6232; Reply, \u00b6104-106; Rejoinder, \u00b6347-348; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b61; Administrative Ruling No. 208, July 14, 2010 (**Exhibit R-83**).\n\n*(b) The Respondent's Arguments*\n--------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nThe Respondent reiterates that it has complied with the requirements of legality, proportionality and due process444 and that, in the unlikely event that the Measures are deemed to have had an expropriatory effect, the Respondent would still be in time to pay an adequate compensation under the Treaty.445\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6115, 125.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6147-167, 190.\n\n321.\n\nFor the Respondent, as there was no expropriation proceeding, it is not possible to assess whether the expropriation proceeding was complied with. The fact that a State does not expropriate a company and instead merely intervenes it in a sanctioning procedure does not imply that due process is violated.446\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6191.\n\n322.\n\nIn relation to the standard of proportionality, the Respondent submits that, pursuant to the *Mellacher et al. v. Austria* decision of the European Court of Human Rights447 and the *Tecmed*448 award, the Measures were proportionate to the irregularities found in the exercise of the faculties of inspection of the SADA and INDEPABIS, adopted and prolonged for the purpose of regularizing Alimentos Frisa's activities in light of the Claimants' disinterest.449\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6116, footnote 264, referring to *Mellacher et al. v.

The alleged violation of the prohibition of arbitrariness**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Claimants' Arguments*\n------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nThe Claimants consider that the classic concept of arbitrariness is that adopted in the *Elettronica Sicula* case of the International Court of Justice, which is based on the deliberate ignorance of the law and on conducts that are clearly based on motives that differ from those declared by the party taking the arbitrary measure.460 In this sense, the Claimants rely on the decisions that in this regard were adopted by the tribunals in *Siemens v. Argentina,*461 *OI European Group B.V. v. Venezuela*462 and *Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan*. In the latter decision it was concluded that the presence of bad faith, while not a requirement of arbitrary conduct, represents a clear indication of arbitrariness.463\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6148-150, referring to *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI)* (United States of America v. Italy)*,* ICJ Rep. 1989, 15, 1989 (**Exhibit CLA-56**); also, The Claimants cite Schreuer, who defines an arbitrary measure as: \"(A) measure which causes harm to the investor without serving an apparent legitimate purpose; a measure which is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference; a measure adopted for reasons which differ from those declared by the person taking it; a measure adopted in deliberate disregard of due process and proper procedure\".\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6150, referring to *Siemens A.G. v.

Venezuela.*464 According to the Claimants, the Measures that violated the FET standard and the prohibition to act arbitrarily were:\n\n(a) The application of the first preventive measure on May 13, 2010, suspending the activity of Alimentos Frisa and retaining its products, issued by the SADA, which was based on alleged irregularities detected during the inspection of the company, taking into account that no investigation was ever started to verify the alleged breaches.465\n\n(b) The food confiscation of Alimentos Frisa and its immediate transfer to the Mercal on May 19, 2010, without opening a sanctioning procedure, in contravention of the provisions of the Goods and Services Act, since such procedure was not initiated against Transporte Dole and in the case of Alimentos Frisa it was *de facto* abandoned.466\n\n(c) The application of the preventive measures of temporary occupation and appointment of the Temporary Board on May 21 and July 14, 2010, which did not lead to the corresponding administrative sanctioning procedures, and which were confirmed and executed before the expiry of the opposition period provided for in the Goods and Services Act.467\n\n(d) The emptying of Alimentos Frisa by the Temporary Board, alienating and disposing of all its assets, without preserving the operations, and violating the duty under any preventive measure to preserve the business.468\n\n(e) The takeover of the transport fleet of Transporte Dole on June 7, 2010, its administration and management *sine die* by the Temporary Board, due to alleged documentary irregularities of the company's vehicles, without this measure being reviewed.469\n\n(f) The lack of any decision in the sanctioning procedure against Alimentos Frisa and the complete absence of a similar procedure against Transporte Dole.470\n\n(g) The permanent and *de facto* nature of the preventive measures of occupation and management of Companies, even though the sanction applicable under the Goods and Services Act could never have had that effect.471\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6154; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b64, referring to *OI European Group B.V. v.

Reply\n\n328.\n\nThe Claimants note that the adoption of temporary encroachment measures by Venezuelan regulatory bodies required at least the initiation of sanctioning proceedings, as determined by the tribunal in *Owens-Illinois.*473 In this line, the Claimants reject the fact that the above case is different from the present one, as asserted by the Respondent, arguing that the court's decision in that case was not based on whether or not the irregularities existed, but was based to a large extent on the fact that the adoption of temporary occupation measures required the initiation of a sanctioning procedure, which INDEPABIS never did.474\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6209-210.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6210-211; *OI European Group B.V. v.

The preventive measures of INDEPABIS or SADA do not constitute the culmination of an administrative or sanctioning process of any of these bodies.479 Similarly, the Claimants reject the Respondent's argument of administrative silence to explain the lack of express determination. According to the Claimants, administrative silence is a guarantee for the benefit of the requesting party, but not a burden,480 and since it is a sanctioning process with characteristics similar to those of the criminal process, the burden of driving it until the imposition of a sanction is the responsibility of the State.481 Otherwise, the accused would be obliged to initiate the procedure leading to their own sanction.482\n\nReply, \u00b6214.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b689, footnotes 203-205, referring to Reply, Section II.C and Schedule A, Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 98:27-99:7; Rejoinder, \u00b6320.\n\nReply, \u00b6215, footnote 439; Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (**Exhibit C26**); Supreme Court, Constitutional Chamber, Judgement No. 444, April 4, 2001, p. 5 (**Exhibit C124**).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b689, footnote 206, referring to Reply, Section II.C.3.\n\n331.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants deny the Respondent's argument that \"*there is a requirement, supported by case law on investment treaty arbitrations, that a reasonable attempt must be made to resolve the dispute* [at the domestic level] *before resorting to the protection of international treaties*\",483 considering that the case law is clear in that any type of governmental measures may violate the FET standard, regardless of whether or not they have been challenged locally, given the absence of a rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies in the Treaty.484\n\nReply, \u00b6218.\n\nReply, \u00b6219, Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6105-106, footnotes 241-242, referring to *Helnan International Hotels A/S v.

In such cases, if a State organ has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, disproportionately or in violation of the rules of due process, such conduct violates the FET rule, regardless of any recourse to local courts.485 In this case, the Respondent abused its authority, for improper purposes not contemplated by law, or for its negligence and administrative inconsistencies, and violated the FET standard.486 In consequence, according to the Claimants, in this case there has been a total lack of transparency and honesty in the administrative process, which generates a violation of due process.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6222-224; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6105-106, 107, footnotes 242-244; Schreuer, C., Calvo's *Grandchildren: The Return of Local Remedies, in Investment Arbitration*, 4.L. & Pract.

Republic of Peru*, the Respondent asserts that the threshold for identifying whether a measure is arbitrary is high. It must be an \"*act or proceeding contrary to justice, reason or law, dictated only by will or caprice,*\" or a \"*proceeding based on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or the facts\".*491 The Respondent also cites the standard set by the arbitral tribunal in *Genin v.

The protection policy was first implemented in 1999 and the Respondent acted in accordance with the rules promulgated between 1999 and 2010, detailing the irregularities that could lead to administrative intervention and the adoption of other measures provided for in those standards; such as the temporary occupation and retention of vehicles, foreseen in the Goods and Services Act and in the Agrifood Security Law.496 The Respondent adds that the Measures were rational in relation to the aforementioned food security protection policy.497\n\n(b) The prolongation of the Measures denounced by the Claimants does not endorse their accusation of arbitrariness as this was due to the commercial abandonment of the Companies498 and the poor condition of the facilities leased in the Taz\u00f3n Warehouse.499\n\n(c) The Claimants have not discredited the findings that justified the imposition of the Measures and, faced with the presumption of administrative legality, the acts of Government are *juris tantum* certain, valid, and legal.500 The Respondent adds that on May 28, 2010, Alimentos Frisa filed a brief to produce unsolicited evidence and without discrediting the irregularities detected.501\n\n(d) According to the Respondent, the failure of the State to resolve administrative recourses against the Administrative Rulings does not constitute an arbitrary act, inasmuch as the Claimants could have had recourse to the contentious-administrative or the constitutional jurisdiction.502\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6201-202; Law of Partial Amendment of the Goods and Services Act, article 111 (Exhibit C-29(bis)).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6135, footnotes 325-330, referring to INDEPABIS Inspection Act, May 19, 2010 (**Exhibit C-32**); INDEPABIS Act, June 7, 2010 (**Exhibit C-36**); Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 164:18, Administrative Ruling No. E.03. 181, May 21, 2010, p. 4 (**Exhibit C-33**); Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Article 305 (**Exhibit R-22**); Silos Law, Article 28 (**Exhibit C-17**); Ministry of Food, Resolution DM/n\u00b0017-09, Official Gazette No. 39.141, March 18, 2009, Article 6 (**Exhibit R-33**); Law for the Defense of Persons in Access to Goods and Services, Article 111.2, 111.3, 111.6, 111.10, 111.11; and 111.12 (**Exhibit C-29**); Decree with Rank, Value and Force of the Organic Law on Agrifood Security and Sovereignty (**Exhibit C-21**).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6137, footnote 336, referring to INDEPABIS Determination, August 19, 2010 (**Exhibit C-40**); Extension of the Temporary Occupancy Measure (**Exhibit R-82**).\n\nReply, \u00b6580.

Mexico*506 and in relation to the intended purpose of protecting food security, which had been violated by Alimentos Frisa's irregular operations.507 If the required documents existed (mobilization guides, invoices, etc.), it would have been easy to prove the error of the Venezuelan authorities.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n341.\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Tribunal finds that, having determined that the Respondent's Measures constituted an indirect and unlawful expropriation \u2013 and thus the Respondent violated Article V of the Treaty \u2013, the analysis of the arguments of the Parties with respect to the possible violation of the FET standard constitutes an additional element of the *ratio decidendi*, since the Respondent's actions may give rise, in addition to the violation of Article V of the Treaty, to the violation of Article IV(1) of the Treaty.509\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall ensure in its territory a fair and equitable treatment, in accordance with international law, to investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party\". Treaty, Article IV, 1.\n\n342.\n\nAccording to the terms of the Treaty itself, the FET standard under Article IV(1) must be \"*in conformity with international law*\", meaning that the criteria developed by international investment law must be applied. These criteria provide reasonably clear outlines for the protection of investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party and certainly include the principles of proportionality,510 transparency511 and the prohibition of arbitrariness,512 the latter being often assimilated to due process.513 For the purposes of this Arbitration, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to examine whether good faith integrates the concept of FET, since the principles discussed here are more specific and objective.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn.

Republic of Tajikistan,* SCC Case No. V (064/2008), Partial Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, September 2, 2009, \u00b6221 (**Exhibit CLA-103).**\n\n343.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Measures were not proportionate to the alleged infringements committed by the Companies, and the administrative proceedings instituted as a result of the alleged violations did not allow the Claimants to defend themselves adequately, and thus the administrative action lacked transparency and was arbitrary.\n\n344.\n\nMr. Zandar\u00edn's account of the events that occurred on May 19, 2010 illustrates some of the excesses and arbitrariness committed during the inspection carried out by INDEPABIS officials, as a consequence of the lack of merchandise mobilization guides. According to the aforementioned witness,\n\n*On May 19, at about nine o'clock in the morning, a contingent of uniformed, armed soldiers, approximately twenty officers of the National Guard, appears*. *There were also four state agencies, about thirty people. [...] In this inspection, these officials began to request in unison, at the same time, all documents that were relevant to the activity of the company. Although we made every effort to supply them with all the information they were requesting, this turned into a chaotic moment because they were asking for the same documentation at the same time. This was pretty complicated. All these groups of officials were always accompanied by the armed officers of the National Guard, which was quite uncomfortable and a subject of intimidation. The staff tried to do their best. Then, also remember that a couple of situations made it difficult to deliver the information: Ms. Valentina, who was... the President of INDEPABIS, threatened to have me arrested if I did not deliver everything they were requesting. Among other events of the day, I can remember that by going to the company's archives, I was able to observe two government officials \u2013 I can no longer remember which of these agencies they belonged to \u2013 connected to the company's servers, where the main server was, connected to laptops. In view of the situation, I turned to the person I considered the highest ranked at the time, who was a National Guard General with the surname Mota, and I pointed out the irregularity I had seen but he did not pay much attention to me.*514\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, 105:29-31, 106:1-18.\n\n345.\n\nEven when the lack of mobilization guides could be considered an irregular conduct or constitute an illegal act, subject to administrative sanctions such as the application of fines or the confiscation and seizure of specific goods not covered by such guides, the Tribunal finds it seriously disproportionate that such alleged infringement could give rise to a military action of the magnitude of the aforementioned. Among other things, the Respondent proceeded, within a few days, to fully intervene in the operations of the infringing company, to replace its administrators, and to seize all of its inventories. All this resulted in the divestment of all the company's assets, including the funds available in banking institutions and their physical facilities.\n\n346.\n\nA similar view was expressed by the arbitral tribunal in *Owens-Illinois v. Venezuela*, involving actions by INDEPABIS itself that resulted in the occupation of the claimant's plant by agents of the respondent, by qualifying the use of the \"*concept of temporary occupation provided for in the INDEPABIS Law to take over the Plants, not as a provisional measure in case of alleged breaches by the Companies of the INDEPABIS Law, but to deprive the Claimant of their rights*\".515\n\n*OI European Group B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25, Award, March 10, 2015(**Exhibit CLA 119)**.\n\n347.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the occupation of the Companies by the Respondent's agents, on a permanent basis and bypassing the procedures provided for in Venezuelan law for an expropriation, coupled with the lack of response by INDEBAPIS and MINCO to the claims made by the Claimants in administrative proceedings in relation to Administrative Rulings No. 181 and 208, constituted serious violations of the Claimants' due process who, in turn, entailed the violation of the FET standard. As stated above, the Tribunal does not consider it valid that the Respondent has bypassed the legal expropriation procedures.\n\n348.\n\nNor does the Tribunal share the Respondent's argument that the failure to respond to the Claimants' claims is validated by the theory of administrative silence. As in several other legal systems, the concept of negative administrative silence in Venezuela acts as a mere legal fiction at the option of the administered and not as a fictitious act that frees the State from its obligation to make a pronouncement. In this line, the Supreme Court of Justice of Venezuela has affirmed, in relation to administrative silence, that \"*it must be interpreted that the regulation of this concept is conceived for the benefit of the interested party, and not to his detriment*\".516 This is consistent with the vision expressed by Venezuelan doctrine, according to which,\n\n*[t]he Administration is obliged to decide on the matters and recourses submitted to it, that is to say, it is obliged to give a timely response, so, despite the lapses of administrative silence and the fact that the individual does not use the benefit of exercising the next immediate remedy that the Organic Law grants him, the Administration has the duty to decide, for which it cannot be considered that it has lost competence.*517\n\nSupreme Court of Justice, Political Administrative Chamber, 30/05/2000, Judgement No. 1213, *Carlos P. Garc\u00eda P. v. Republic (Ministry of Justice). Judicial Police Technical Corps*.\n\nBrewer Car\u00edas, Allan R., \"*El sentido del silencio administrativo negativo en la Ley Org\u00e1nica de Procedimientos Administrativos*\", Revista de Derecho P\u00fablico No. 8, Editorial Jur\u00eddica Venezolana, Caracas, 1981, pp. 33-34 (**Exhibit C-120**).\n\n349.\n\nThus, the argument that, by failing to exercise the prerogative to invoke the theory of administrative silence to file additional appeals, the Claimants would have prejudiced their right to obtain from the Respondent a response to their claims does not constitute a correct application of that legal institute.\n\n350.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimants failed to go to the Venezuelan courts to challenge the Respondent's actions, which would lead to the loss of their right to compensation.518 The Tribunal does not share this view and considers that the FET standard does not support this argument.519\n\nRespondent's Statement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6234-248.\n\n*Helnan International Hotels A/S v. Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Decision of the Cancellation Committee, June 14, 2010, \u00b6\u00b647-48 (**Exhibit CLA-137)**; *Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

Argentine Republic)* , ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision of the Cancellation Committee, July 3, 2002, \u00b6102 (**Exhibit CLA-127**).\n\n351.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the fact that the Claimants did not bring actions before the Venezuelan courts \u2013 who, as has been said, had the right to obtain express pronouncements from the administrative bodies to which they had appealed \u2013 in no way alters the recognition of the Respondent's violations. The Tribunal agrees that the exhaustion of local remedies, in Professor Schreuer's words, \"is not a requirement of modern investment arbitration\",520 and that\n\n*it would empty the development of investment arbitration of much of its force and effect, if, despite a clear intention of States parties not to require the pursuit of local remedies as a pre-condition to arbitration, such a requirement were to be read back in as part of the substantive cause of action*.521\n\nSchreuer, C., Calvo's Grandchildren: The Return of Local Remedies, in Investment Arbitration, 4.L. & Pract.

Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Decision of the Annulment Committee, June 14, 2010, \u00b647 (**Exhibit CLA-137**).\n\n352.\n\nMoreover, it cannot be ignored that, if they had chosen to submit their claims to the Venezuelan courts, the Claimants could run the risk of closing the doors of the investment arbitration system for the same claims.\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that, in the present case, there is a causal link between the measures taken by the Respondent \u2013 characterized by the violation of the principles of proportionality and transparency, by arbitrariness and the violation of due process, in breach of the standards of protection of the Treaty \u2013 and the loss of the investments of the Claimants.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**CHAPTER IX. QUANTIFICATION OF THE DAMAGES CLAIMED**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The alleged violation of the principle of full reparation under International Law**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, as a result of the unlawful indirect expropriation of their investments and the Respondent's violation of the FET standard, they are entitled to compensation based on the principle of full reparation. Such compensation must include pre- and post-award interest, so that the compensation is adequate in respect of the damage they have suffered.522\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6271, 275 Rejoinder\n\n355.\n\nThe Respondent objects that the Claimants are entitled to receive any compensation, since there has been no reparable economic damage suffered by the Claimants, or that the damage was caused by the Respondent.523\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6492.\n\n**1. The Claimants' Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nThe Claimants claim that they are entitled to receive full compensation for the harm caused to them by the Respondent's conduct, pursuant to Article XI of the Treaty. Since this provision of the Treaty does not establish the applicable standard for determining compensation, the Claimants are seeking the amount of US$ 550.7 million, which, together with pre-award interest, computed as of August 1, 2016, amounts to a total of US$ 1,155.5 million.524\n\nReply, \u00b6404; Second Report of Mr. Dellepiane, Table I; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b67, 146, 149-150, 238, footnotes 320, 324, 511, referring to Complaint Brief, \u00b6\u00b6169 et seq., Power Point Submission of Claimants' Opening Argument, p. 128.\n\n357.\n\nPursuant to Article XI(5) of the Treaty, the Claimants invoke the standard of customary international law of full reparation,525 which is reflected in the Articles on Responsibility526 and applied by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case.527 Similarly, this principle has been recognized by other international tribunals in investment arbitrations.528 This standard states that the reparation granted must \"*eliminate all the consequences of the wrongful act and re-establish the situation that, in all probability, would have existed had it not been committed*\".529\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 1, 60:4-14.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6172; International Law Commission, *Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Illicit Acts*, with commentary, 2001, article 31(1) (**Exhibit CLA-66**).\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6170; Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 60:7-13. *Chorz\u00f3w Plant* (Germany v.

Thus, while for lawful expropriations it is necessary to recognize the \"*value of the affected property*\", for unlawful expropriations \u2013 such as the one that occurred in this case \u2013 it is a matter of determining the subjective value that will restore the aggrieved party to the \"*financial situation in which it would be if the damage had not been committed*\".530\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6172; I Marboe, *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law*, *Investment Claims* (2013), August 20, 1999, \u00b62.101 (**Exhibit CLA-62**).\n\n359.\n\nThe Claimants state that, in cases of indirect expropriation, tribunals seek to compensate the investor by various means, including (i) through interest rates higher than those established for legal expropriations in investment treaties;531 (ii) by awarding indirect damages;532 or (iii) by awarding \"*damages for adverse impacts\".*533\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6173, in relation to *Compa\u00f1i\u00e1 de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

The Claimants request that the following accusations of the Respondent be dismissed *ad hominem*:\n\n(a) In connection with an investigation carried out against Semary C.A. in 1996 for alleged \"*forging of tariff settlement schedules*\" in Venezuela, the Claimants state that (i) the allegations are supported by three articles without the author's signature, two of which are subsequent to the expropriation of the Companies, published on unknown websites, and (ii) Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas was never the subject of any legal proceedings nor was any sanction imposed in relation to these539 matters.\n\n(b) On the investigation for \"*alleged money laundering of dubious origin*\" carried out by the *Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)* of the United States of America against the North American financial institution Ocean Bank, the Claimants state that Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas explained that he has never had, either on his own or through any other person, a shareholder, corporate or any other relationship with Ocean Bank.540\n\n(c) With respect to the non-payment of certain commercial awards issued by the *United States Department of Agriculture* in connection with a dispute with a fruit and vegetable supplier in the United States, the Claimants assert that the two press releases referred to by Dr. Flores refer only to a commercial dispute between a company in which Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas is a shareholder and a punctual supplier, which was resolved in 2005.541\n\n(d) On the press articles citing the existence of alleged fraudulent activities of Alimentos Frisa for having \"*inflated*\", between 2007 and 2010, the prices of the products it purchased from Benipaula, S.A., Chile and MSM, S.A.,542 the Claimants argue that they do not know the grounds of such claims because none of the companies is a party to the proceedings in Chile.543\n\n(e) In relation to Dr. Flores' argument about the prices allegedly paid by Alimentos Frisa for tuna purchased from its supplier in Ecuador, Dibicer S.A.,544 the Claimants submit that the purchase prices of Alimentos Frisa's goods were subject to a strict control by the CADIVI and that the publication used by Venezuela to support its comparative price analysis mentions export quantities and amounts, but does not specify what types of tuna are included in those figures.545\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6238-239, referring to H\u00e9ctor Herrera Jim\u00e9nez, \"Message to Andr\u00e9s Caldera.

The Claimants state that they continued the practice of paying such tax early in the year after closing by purchasing tax credits at a discounted value, *i.e.*, they included the amount directly as an administrative expense in the year in which it was paid.546\n\n(b) The criticism that \"*according to the audited financial statements of 2005-2006, Frisa's share capital in 2005 was Bs. 2.51 million, but according to the audited financial statements of 2006-2007, it was Bs. 2.50 million*\" and that \"*according to the audited financial statements of 2006-2007, Frisa increased its share capital by Bs. 2.05 million in 2006, but according to the audited financial statements of 2005-2006, the increase was Bs. 2.04 million*\". According to the Claimants, these alleged inconsistencies are the result of the rounding up in preparing the financial statements.547\n\n(c) The Claimants point out that the financial statements for the years 2004 and 2005 do not include the income statement548 or the cash flow for the year 2004, as Dr. Flores disputes, because the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in effect in 2005 did not require the presentation of prior-period information for comparative purposes.549\n\n(d) The Claimants contend that the opinions signed between 2006 and 2010 were reprinted subsequently to their original issuance \u2013 a fact criticized by Dr. Flores \u2013 because the original versions of those financial statements remained in Alimentos Frisa's offices after its occupation in May 2010.550\n\n(e) According to the Claimants, the investment of US$ 12.2 million made in 2009 in connection with the New Refrigerated Warehouse, which Dr. Flores objects to, is registered under the heading \"*Other Assets*\"551 in the 2009 Statements of Cash Flows.552\n\n(f) With respect to the observation that the notes to the 2008 and 2009 financial statements of the Companies do not mention the adoption of the VEN-NIF principles or their effects, the Claimants note that Dr. Flores omitted to clarify that for the year 2010 the Application Bulletins that would have allowed the effective application of the VEN-NIF had not yet been issued,553 but that these began to be applied in January 2013, and therefore the VEN-NIF did not have any practical impact on the preparation of the financial statements in question.554\n\n(g) Dr. Flores criticizes the fact that the audited financial statements of the Companies do not mention the two-folded exchange system that took place in January 2010, resulting from the adoption of Exchange Agreement No. 14. In this regard, the Claimants assert that, under the applicable Venezuelan law at the time, the obligation to report post-closing circumstances only applied to those cases in which such circumstances created an uncertainty that could result in a \"*significant loss*\" and that, as the Exchange Agreement No. 14 did not fall into that category, the January 2010 two-folded exchange system did not affect the 2008 and 2009 financial statements, which were already closed, nor did it generate an uncertainty that could result in a \"*significant loss*\", so there was no obligation to mention that circumstance.555\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6255-256; Alimentos Frisa Affidavits for the Years 2006-2009 (**Exhibit CLEX-017**) Declaration on Auditing Standards and Procedures No. 11 (DNA11), \"Definitions\", pp. 45, \"General Aspects\", item 3, p. 6, and \"The Standard Auditing Opinion\", item 11(c), pp. 7-8 (**Exhibit C185**).\n\nReply, \u00b6258.

Thus, according to the Claimants, the sole purpose of Dr. Flores' practice is to sow doubts, without any evidence, about the reputation of the Claimants, as illustrated by his attempt to involve them in alleged illegal activities in Chile560 and his overpricing allegations, which proved to be merely hypothetical,561 thus violating the duty of professionalism, independence and objectivity that should guide the work of the expert.562\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b616; footnote 23, referring to Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 153:23-155:15.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b616, footnotes 24-25, referring to Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 157:25-158:6, 158:25-159:3, 165:13-23.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6268-270.\n\n365.\n\nThe Claimants add, with respect to the allegations of continuation of Alimentos Frisa's business through other companies in Venezuela neither engaged in the importation of food nor owned by the Claimants,563 that Dr. Flores admitted not having analyzed the exports of such companies and attempted to discredit information provided by the Respondent itself according to which such companies, as explained by the Claimants, had indeed reduced their operations after the expropriation.564 In sum, the Claimants reject Dr. Flores' conclusion that their investments were worthless at the time of the alleged expropriation, despite their significant participation in the Venezuelan food import market.565\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b617, footnotes 26-27, referring to Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 178:4-181:9, 182:14-183:16.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b617, footnote 28.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b68, \u00b622, referring to National Institute of Statistics and Imports, by chapters 1998 - I Sem. 2014, Venezuela, total of chapters 1-23 (for food imports) (**Exhibit C-114)**; Consolidated Financial Statements of Alimentos Frisa and Transporte Dole and Complementary Information, years 2005 to 2009, Statements of Earnings in Historical Bolivares, \"Costos de Ventas\" (**Exhibits C-84** to **C-88**); Statement of Claim, \u00b636.\n\n366.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the business of Alimentos Frisa was not continued through other companies and, therefore, there are no third companies that currently benefit from the cash flows that previously corresponded to Alimentos Frisa, contrary to Dr. Flores' speculations.566 In effect, (i) Agrofino C.A. and Agropecuaria SG 295 C.A., whose sole purpose was to participate in the development of the New Refrigerated Warehouse as landowner and construction principal, respectively, were not dedicated to the import and distribution of food;567 (ii) the income of Global Rustico C.A. and the companies of the Garc\u00eda Armas extended family are not attributable to the Claimants;568 and (iii) Benipaula Inc. and MSM Inc., which are owned by the Claimants and still export to Venezuela, have suffered a significant decrease in their income, given that their sales volume was ten times greater prior to the expropriation.569 In any event, the continuation of the Claimants' business through other companies was not proven and, even if it were, it would still not justify the Measures.570\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6193, 199, footnote 405, referring to Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 169:7-12, Second Report of Dr. Flores, \u00b6\u00b6101-110.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6195, footnotes 410-414, referring to Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 178:4-28, 180:14-22, 180:24-181:4, 181:6-18, Second Report of Dr. Flores, \u00b6108, Agrofino Project, pp. 2, 3 y 7 (b), Second Report of Dr. Flores, p. 7, footnote 137 (**Exhibit C-116**).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6196, footnotes 415-418, referring to (Exhibit R76) p. 39; Third Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, \u00b617; Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 183:9-16; Second Report of Dr. Flores, \u00b6108, footnote 137; Registry Information of Frutas Fino, p. 0005 (**Exhibit R-75**); Registry Information of Alimentos Aleka, pp. 0004-0005 (**Exhibit R-71**); Third Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, \u00b621.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6197-198, footnotes 419-425, referring to Dr. Flores' Second Report, \u00b6\u00b6110, 111, footnote 141, Second Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, \u00b625; Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 160:28-161:6, 162:16-20, 171:18-26, 173:23 - 174:9; (**Exhibits R-87**, **R-88** and **R-89)**; PowerPoint Presentation of Claimants' Opening Argument, p. 176, (**Exhibit EO-130)**.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6194, footnotes 406-409, referring to Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 180:24-181:4; Second Report of Dr. Flores, \u00b6\u00b6106-107.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n367.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the Claimants have a right to receive a compensation because there is no reparable economic damage suffered by the Claimants or caused by the State, and its estimate has been modified by the Claimants during the arbitration.571\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6139, footnotes 337-343, referring to Compass Lexecon Updated Valuation Model (**Exhibit CLEX-035**); Second Report of Mr. Dellepiane, \u00b6\u00b68, 131, 138, Table I.\n\n368.\n\nFirst, according to the Respondent, the standard of compensation set forth in Article XI(5) of the Treaty requires that the Respondent be deemed to have breached its international obligations, before the Tribunal determines whether the investor has suffered damage.572\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6487-491, referring to Ripinsky, S., \"Damages in International Investment Law\"*, British Institute of International and Comparative Law,* 2008, reprinted in 2015, p. 113, (**Exhibit RLA**-**226**): *Rompetrol Group N.V v. Romania*, ISCID Case, No. ARB/06/3, Award, May 6, 2013, \u00b6190 (**Exhibit RLA 155**).\n\n369.\n\nSecond, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have not suffered any damages since:\n\n(a) The State did not expropriate the Companies and, therefore, the Claimants did not suffer damage as a result of the expropriation.573 The Claimants have only provided Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas' statement, Alimentos Frisa's financial statements as of December 31, 2009, and CADIVI's foreign exchange acquisition list, which have not proven the existence of the damage.574 The damage relating to the seizure alleged by the Claimants is due to the Claimants' unlawful conduct, since the products contained in the truck were not only being transported without the proper mobilization guideline, but also, among other reasons, the Claimants did not submit the legal documents for the rest of the food stored in those cool stores.575\n\n(b) The security deposits and loans allegedly granted by Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas never existed. The Respondent points out that the Claimants have not provided evidence of the existence of such deposits and loans, except (i) in the case of deposits, (1) the testimony submitted by Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas (which the Respondent considers insufficient); (2) the information contained in the \"*suppliers' letters*\"576 (which the Respondent considers to be insufficient); and (3) the information the Claimants intend to deduce from the CADIVI currency applications;577 and (ii) in the case of loans, the information contained in the financial statements (which the Respondent considers to be false).578\n\n(c) The Claimants have uninterruptedly continued their usual operations in Venezuela with other companies of their organization,579 such as Global R\u00fastico,580 which, according to the Respondent, operated irregularly in the Alimentos Frisa spaces in the Taz\u00f3n Warehouse,581 Frutas Fino,582 and Alimentos Aleka.583\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6494-496.

According to the Respondent:\n\n(a) It never stopped the Claimants from continuing their business. On the one hand, the Claimants distinguish between the business of importing and distributing frozen fruit and fish, and the activity of the Companies. On the other hand, they argue that the end of the Companies' activity would not prevent the Claimants from continuing to import and distribute fruit and fish in Venezuela, since the Claimants have not alleged that they have been disqualified from continuing such business.585 On the contrary, Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas said he has a \"*portfolio of companies in the food sectors*\",586 so the cause of the cessation of activities of the Companies was the continuation of the business through other companies,587 since Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas did not lose the Dole brand, and he could still commercialize its products in Venezuela through companies incorporated by his relatives,588 and the import and distribution business was continued through Alimentos Aleka, Frutas Fino, Global R\u00fastico, and Benipaula,589 and through the construction of the New Refrigerated Warehouse under the control of Frimaca, one of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas' family businesses.590 The Respondent adds that, in any event, the Claimants directly and indirectly retained the control over the Companies.591\n\n(b) The Claimants abandoned their business. The Respondent submits that it has been proved that, following the imposition of the occupation measure and the appointment of the Temporary Board, the latter was unable to carry out its mission of normalizing and regulating the activity because the Claimants prevented the continuation of Alimentos Frisa's activity and the contact with suppliers, in particular through the suspension of orders by Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, the only person capable of contacting the suppliers.592 The Respondent further states that the abandonment of the business by the Claimants included (i) the request for the supervening termination of the inspection and supervision procedure, since, according to the Claimants, they had to close the company because they did not have any merchandise to trade; (ii) the lack of cooperation from the representatives of Alimentos Frisa's management who, despite showing up at the refrigerated warehouse premises, refused to attend the meetings of the Temporary Board,593 and never collaborated to continue the distribution activity;594 and (iii) the lack of action by the Claimants before the Venezuelan courts,595 both at the time the Measures were adopted596 and subsequently.597\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b660, footnote 126, referring to Reply, \u00b691.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6251-255.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6254; First Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, \u00b62 (**CWS-1**).\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b667.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b668-69, footnotes 141-146, referring to Dole Trademark Use Agreement (**Exhibit C-16**); Dole Letter, January 7, 2016 (**Exhibit C-181**); Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 79:10, 18:18-22, 21:21-30.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b670-74, footnotes 147-163, referring to Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6236-271, SENIAT Listing, p. 4 (**Exhibit R-102**); Nonproduction Certificates 2, pp. 4, 20-30, 45, 52-55 (**Exhibit R-88**); List of applications for certificates of non-production or insufficient national production from November 2007 to 2016 from the Ministry of Food, pp. 30, 50-53 (**Exhibit R-88**); Transcript of the Hearing, Day 2, 80:9, 79:27-31, 109:10-12, 68:22-23, 69:5-6; Global Rustico File, C.A.., (**Exhibit R-105**); Official Information from Florida Department of Divisions Corporative, domestic profit of Italespa Investments LLC, Benipaula Inc., p. 4 (**Exhibit R-62**); Video Jessica G.

In the Respondent's view, regardless of the causes of the alleged abandonment, the facts show that the Companies were abandoned by the Claimants,598 which would respond to the *modus operandi* of the Claimants.599 The Respondent adds that the termination of the lease \u2013 in respect of which it also denies that the causal link has been proven600 \u2013 is alien to the Measures since the lease was not subject to an extension601 and the contract provided its unilateral termination.602\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6265-266; footnote 298.

Therefore, the Measures adopted are not sufficient cause to claim the alleged loss of the loans and deposits claimed by the Claimants.603\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6370-371.\n\n373.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, even correcting the absence of evidence, the Claimants have failed to establish a causal link between the alleged injury and the Measures.604 According to the Respondent, the need to establish this causal link is necessary under Venezuelan law605 and has been raised by various arbitral tribunals.606 The Respondent believes that the Claimants are attempting to establish a false causal relationship between the Measures and the frustration of the construction project for the New Refrigerated Warehouse607 In this regard, the Respondent submits that the frustration of the contract was due to some reason attributable to the parties to that contract.608 The Respondent does not attach value to Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas' statements, nor to Mr. Ram\u00f3n Vizca\u00edno's letter of November 18, 2010 stating that the contract never entered into force because of the Respondent's Measures against the Companies.609\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6517.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6521, referring to Supreme Court of Justice, Political-Administrative Chamber, Decision N\u00b0 00863, April 13, 2000, Exp. 14.707, in *Corporaci\u00f3n Revi, C.A v.

In this case, the expropriation of the Companies was unlawful*.* Thus, Article V(2) does not apply, and the amount of damages suffered by the Claimants must be calculated on the basis of the parameters of customary international law and in accordance with the principle of full reparation.618\n\nReply, \u00b6272-274; Statement of Defense, \u00b6280; footnote 536: \"This follows from a simple reading of article V.2, an interpretation which has been confirmed by case law on several occasions.

According to Mr. Dellepiane, the Claimants' expert, this method is appropriate from an economic perspective as it allows the Companies' operational and financial history to be used to project their ability to generate profits in the future.627\n\n(b) In order to capture the risk implicit in the transaction, it is necessary to discount cash flows at a discount rate. The discount rate used by the Claimants' expert was the weighted average cost of capital (\"**WACC**\").628\n\n(c) The estimation of the FMV of the Companies at the Valuation Date was made using a WACC of 11.61%.629\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6183.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* and *Luis Garc\u00eda Armas v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*,633 whose relevance to the present arbitration is of a technical nature.634 In addition, the Respondent questions the credibility of the statements and valuation of Mr. Dellepiane, the Claimants' expert, for failing to verify the reliability of the sources of financial information used.635\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6561-562; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b618, 219-222.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6219-222, footnotes 521-529, referring to Mark Kantor, \"Valuation for Arbitration, Compensation Standards, Valuation Methods and Expert Evidence\", Wolters Kluwer, 2008, pp. 8-9 (**Exhibit EO-132**); Frisa bank accounts (**Exhibit EO-133**); Profit Plus Administrative, Alimentos Frisa, Inventories (**Exhibit EO-134**); Profit Plus Administrative, Alimentos Frisa, Accounts Payable (**Exhibit EO-135**); Administrative Profit Plus, Alimentos Frisa, Receivable Accounts (**Exhibit EO-136**); Consultation of historical values of the BD INMA as of May 2010 (**Exhibit EO-137**); Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6291, 299; Second report of Dr. Flores, pp. 45-46, 48-49, 53-54, Table 1 and 2.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6223-225, footnotes 530-533.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6226, footnotes 534-535.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6226, footnote 536.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b614.\n\n384.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the market value of the Companies calculated by the Claimants is not real, nor is it the market value. A correct application of the DCF method would show that there would be no buyers interested in purchasing Alimentos Frisa, since the result of their expected income minus their debt would offer negative results. The Respondent addresses the following issues:\n\n(a) The general economic conditions of Venezuela and the particular conditions of the Claimants show the absence of adequate market conditions for the DCF method proposed by the Claimants to reasonably project the eventual flows of Alimentos Frisa into the future.636 According to the Respondent, the compensation, if due, should be calculated according to the principle of the \"real value\" of the investment, which is the standard regulated in Article V(2) of the Treaty,637 generally applied by case law638 and expressly recognized by the Claimant's expert as applicable to the present case.639 Thus, the market value of an asset should be established taking into account its possible value in a hypothetical market.640 However, according to the Respondent, the Claimants take into account the role of a buyer who ignores, *inter alia*, (i) the decrease in the bolivar-dollar exchange rate five months before the purchase, *i.e.,* the Valuation Date; (ii) the uncertainty related to the continuation of the lease of the Taz\u00f3n Warehouse; (iii) the dynamics of direct sales and warehousing of the business to be acquired; (iv) that regulatory and public policy trends suggested an increase in the Respondent's controls; and (v) the decline in the participation of the private sector in the relevant market.641 As a result, the Claimants define their business without considering the Venezuelan market conditions.642 Therefore, for the Respondent, there is no methodological or substantial justification for contemplating an increase in the fund flows of Alimentos Frisa, rather than suffering the effects of the economic downturn.643\n\n(b) There is no reliable information that allows us to appreciate the historical flows of Alimentos Frisa, due to the fact that all the financial information about Alimentos Frisa comes from fraudulent documents. In particular, according to the Respondent, the Claimants created the financial statements \"*to deceive the Tribunal through fraud\".*644 In addition, the Respondent rejects the use of the technique of consolidation of the financial statements of both Companies645 and asserts that what would have been appropriate, in this case, was the combination of the financial statements of both Companies, and that, under the principle of full disclosure, the accountant or auditor of the Claimants should have made a reference to the financial position and results of Transporte Dole in the notes to those financial statements.646 In the absence of such full disclosure, according to the Respondent, Transporte Dole lacks financial information647 and an interested person would not be able to know the financial position of this company and perform an analysis of its financial statements.648\n\n(c) For the Respondent, its historical flow analysis was based on fraudulent information contained in the Companies' financial statements.649 For this reason, information on the Claimants' alleged loans,650 Alimentos Frisa's bank deposits,651 shareholders' minutes,652 alleged \"*fraudulent letters to suppliers*\" and \"*fraudulent history relating to the Agrofino Project*\"653 cannot be included in the model.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6564-566, referring to *Tenaris v.

See Summary of the Agrofino Project, various dates (**Exhibit C-116**).\n\n385.\n\nIn addition to the absence of reliable information and the inclusion of alleged fraudulent information that would make the model submitted by the Claimants non-viable, the Respondent points out certain errors in the valuation of Alimentos Frisa, highlighting the following:\n\n(a) Overestimation of income, while Mr. Dellepiane projects a sales volume of Alimentos Frisa quadrupled after the construction of the New Refrigerated Warehouse (up to 323%).654 Dr. Flores proposes adjusting that projection, taking into account the capacity calculations that an interested buyer would revise in May 2010 and those that could be reached after the construction of the New Refrigerated Warehouse (reducing the growth rate to 304%).655 An interested buyer would take into account that Alimentos Frisa would stop using the Taz\u00f3n Warehouse and that the New Refrigerated Warehouse would replace it as a warehouse, so that the available capacity would only be that of the latter.\n\n(b) An interested buyer would take into account the percentage of direct distribution from port and warehouse. Thus, this buyer would revise a calculation that assumes that the increase in storage capacity due to the construction of the New Refrigerated Warehouse would affect 100% of the turnover, regardless of the previous distribution. Therefore, it would adjust expectations so that the total increase in sales of Alimentos Frisa, in real terms, would be approximately 129%. In view of the above, the expected future growth would be, at most, 82% and not 323%.656\n\n(c) The income projection would also be affected by the moment when Alimentos Frisa could effectively enjoy this new capacity. Mr. Dellepiane predicts in his model that it would be operational by mid-2012. However, Dr. Flores adjusts the projections taking into account the possibility of replacing the builder, because he was in a critical economic situation in 2010. Thus, the start of the project could be postponed for up to two years and an additional year in its execution. In other words, capacity expansion would have been available in 2013, rather than 2012.657 Dr. Flores proposes adjusting the occupancy rate of the New Refrigerated Warehouse and maintains that a hypothetical buyer would not have considered the scenario of the New Refrigerated operating at 50% of its capacity as the most pessimistic, but would have contemplated the possibility that Alimentos Frisa's future income would rise less than projected in Mr. Dellepiane's most pessimistic scenario, would not rise at all, or would even decrease658 Thus, Dr. Flores presents the average of these three income scenarios, obtaining a result similar to the scenario estimated by Mr. Dellepiane as the \"*most pessimistic*\", under which the New Refrigerator would have operated at 50% of its capacity.659\n\n(d) Dr. Flores considers an additional element: the inadequate treatment of the bolivar-dollar exchange rate. While Mr. Dellepiane assumes that it remains constant in real terms with respect to 2009, Dr. Flores maintains that the exchange rate was very overvalued in 2009 and, in factual terms, as of the date immediately prior to the Valuation Date, the fixed exchange rate had already been devalued by 100%. Specifically, it went from Bs. 2.15 per U.S. dollar fixed in 2009 to Bs. 4.30. Dr. Flores takes into account the negative effect of devaluation and projects the exchange rate by assuming the purchasing power parity over that corrected figure.660\n\n(e) Errors in the estimation of the costs and investments to be made, which affect the sales and administrative costs and the investments that Alimentos Frisa would have to make during the valuation period. These discrepancies are:\n\na. Adjustments in the cost of sales projections considering that Alimentos Frisa was buying at more expensive prices than usual, in relation to the market. When the exchange rate is reduced, these high prices cannot be maintained, so it would need cheaper suppliers. Dr. Flores adjusts the projected costs to reflect the effort the interested buyer should make to reduce costs and maintain the historical gross margin.661\n\nb. Errors in the projection of administrative costs, since the Respondent alleges that its actual historical evolution has not been taken into account. The calculations are arbitrary and lack support, and the methodology used is baseless.662\n\nc. Errors in the valuation of investments that Alimentos Frisa would have had to make during the valuation period. On the one hand, the Claimants claim to have made a total investment of US$ 43.5 million, of which US$ 12.2 million do not appear to be adequately substantiated or to have carried associated cash flows. On the other hand, it does not include investments that would be consistent with the enormous growth projected for sales.663\n\nd. Dr. Flores considers it necessary to adjust the value of the initial investment in the New Refrigerated Warehouse, given that, at the Valuation Date, the project was delayed, and no payment had been made to the builder, Mr. Ram\u00f3n Vizca\u00edno. This implies including the entire construction cost as an investment to be made and assuming that there would be certain delays in the execution of the project, as opposed to the initially planned deadlines.664\n\ne.

Calculation of the share capital value**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Claimants' Arguments*\n------------------------------\n\n387.\n\nThe Claimants observe that, despite having applied the same valuation methodology, the Parties' experts have reached diametrically opposed conclusions.673 In this regard, the Claimants consider that the value of the Companies, estimated at US$ 493.3 million, as opposed to the zero value attributed by Dr. Flores, is a valuation based on the revenues of the Company as projected by Mr. Dellepiane.674 According to the Claimants, it is conservative, as it is based on: (i) an average of the growth capacities of Alimentos Frisa that contemplates both adverse and positive scenarios, with respect to the eventual use of the New Refrigerated Warehouse;675 (ii) a compound annual growth rate of 15%, lower than the 39% observed between 2006 and 2009, so the projected 15% growth corresponds to a third of the historical growth of Alimentos Frisa;676 and (iii) in a context in which Alimentos Frisa was one of the largest importers, having gone from 2006 to 2009 to import, respectively, 1.3% to 3.2% of all food imported into Venezuela, whose food production was declining.677\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6200.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6201.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6201, footnotes 426-427, referring to Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 18:18-29, Compass Lexecon Power Point Presentation, p. 14.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6202, footnotes 428-429, referring to Compass Lexecon PowerPoint Presentation, p. 14.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6203, footnotes 430-432, referring to Compass Lexecon PowerPoint Presentation, pp. 6-7; Second Report Mr. Dellepiane, \u00b627, Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 16:18-17:11.\n\n388.\n\nThe DCF model developed by Mr. Dellepiane addresses the following key assumptions:\n\n(a) Sales revenue. The future revenues of the Companies were projected based on the consolidated financial statements and other available financial information as of December 31, 2009, under the assumption of business continuity after May 20, 2010,678 without prejudice to the knowledge of the suspension measure of May 13, 2010, for purposes of the application of the DCF model.679 It was assumed that, in the absence of expropriation, Alimentos Frisa would have increased its trading volume thanks to the state of the import market and the New Refrigerated Warehouse. According to Mr. Dellepiane, Alimentos Frisa grew, before the takeover, at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 70% and 40% in real terms (from US$ 35.9 million in 2005 to US$ 300 million in December 2009).680 With the incorporation of the new space offered by the New Refrigerated Warehouse, Alimentos Frisa would have increased its installed capacity by 323%,681 materialized as of May 2012. Thus, Alimentos Frisa's future revenue stream was calculated between 2012 and 2016 in three possible scenarios: (i) a more optimistic one, where sales of Alimentos Frisa would have grown at a nominal rate of 36% per annum, until reaching its maximum capacity in 2017; (ii) a more conservative one, where they would have grown at a nominal rate of 24% per annum, until using 50% of their installed capacity; and (iii) an intermediate one, calculated as the average of the two previous ones, with a nominal growth rate of 30% per annum.682 In the model, the intermediate scenario is used to calculate future revenue streams. The Claimants dismiss Dr. Flores' income projections, according to which Alimentos Frisa's historical yield would grow at a compound annual rate of 1%, because it: (i) eliminates the income of the Taz\u00f3n Warehouse since 2011, on the basis that Alimentos Frisa could not have renewed its lease contract, which was renewed, discrediting the thesis of Dr. Flores;683 (ii) foresees a one-year delay in the start-up of the New Refrigeration Plant, which is arbitrary and inconsistent with the fact that the construction company was operating normally at the time of the expropriation;684 and (iii) maintains the sales growth at zero, which ignores, without any reason, the impact that the increase in storage capacity would have.685 According to the Claimants, the unreasonableness of Dr. Flores' analysis is evidenced by his postulate that the construction of the New Refrigerated Warehouse would have destroyed the value of Alimentos Frisa686 and because he does not take into account how much a reasonable seller would be willing to sell. In fact, Dr. Flores performs an asset valuation, but not a cash flow analysis, to which he assigns a negative value.687\n\n(b) Cost of sales.688 According to Mr. Dellepiane, the costs are equivalent to the price that Alimentos Frisa paid to buy the products that it then sold in the domestic market. His model contemplates an average gross margin of 18.3% on the historical sales of Alimentos Frisa in the 2005-2009 period,689 in view of the stability of historical costs as a percentage of the revenues.\n\n(c) Administrative costs. Mr. Dellepiane's model distinguishes fixed (*i.e.*, sales volumes) and variable (*i.e.*, product and fuel transports) components and, since Venezuela has allegedly failed to provide the complete documents related to the operation of Alimentos Frisa requested by the Claimants, Mr. Dellepiane estimates that administrative costs would grow at 50% of the sales volume growth rate and assumes that Alimentos Frisa's administrative costs would have evolved based on the Venezuelan consumer price index, and additionally, variable costs would have evolved following the production level.690 The Claimants consider, in this regard, that Dr. Flores' projection is unreasonable, since he assumes that Alimentos Frisa's revenue increases are necessarily accompanied by cost increases. In addition, the Claimants observe that this error reduces the value calculated by Mr. Dellepiane by 59.3%.691\n\n(d) Capital investments. Mr. Dellepiane assumes that Alimentos Frisa's requirements would have been the same as those of the food wholesale industry, given that, due to their activity, they did not require large capital and infrastructure investments,692 and includes the US$ 65 million that Alimentos Frisa would have invested in the construction of the New Refrigerated Warehouse during the execution of the project.\n\n(e) Working capital.693 The Claimants' model relates the evolution of accounts receivable and payable and revenues to establish future working capital needs based on their historical evolution, while contemplating the larger projected revenue volumes.694 Mr. Dellepiane adds to Alimentos Frisa's cash flows an excess cash value of US$ 46.1 million, since, when the Companies were taken over, the funds they held in boxes and banks were also confiscated. This level of cash was very high, since the Companies decided not to distribute dividends.695 The Claimants state that Dr. Flores' estimate of the working capital of US$ 51 million, which would lead to a 50% reduction in the value of the Companies, is erroneous, since that amount was intended for the New Refrigerated Warehouse, the construction of which is, by definition, an investment activity and not an operating activity, a category to which working capital is linked.696\n\n(f) Taxes levied on the Companies and their activity, as reflected in their financial statements and applicable laws.697\n\n(g) WACC Discount Rate. CAPM is used to estimate the cost of capital of a U.S. company in the same category as Alimentos Frisa, then adjusting the result to reflect the political and macroeconomic risks of investing in Venezuela.698 It is also considered reasonable699 to include a country risk premium of 5.19%, calculated on the basis of the historical yields of the Venezuela's long-term sovereign bonds.700\n\n(h) Terminal value. Mr. Dellepiane estimates the terminal value of the Companies as the value of a perpetuity, assuming a nominal growth rate of 2.2%, which keeps its projections constant in real terms, and a discount rate equal to his WACC estimate of 11.61%,701 this rate being lower than the one proposed by Dr. Flores in his model, of 24.73%, and the one used by the investment tribunals in Venezuela so far.702 The Claimants add that the rate proposed by Dr. Flores, the application of which would reduce the value of the Companies by 83%,703 is based on: (i) a size premium of 2.85%, mostly rejected by the doctrine,704 and (ii) a country risk rate of 14.27%, as opposed to Mr. Dellepiane's proposal of 5.19%, consistent with the rates applied in awards against the Respondent of 4%, 6%, and 7.9%705, and with Moody's rating of B1, assigned to Venezuela.706\n\n(i) Exchange rate and inflation. The Claimants note that the Respondent must pay expropriation compensation in a \"*convertible and effectively realizable and freely transferable currency,*\" and therefore perform the valuation in U.S. dollars.707 Mr. Dellepiane converts his projections of revenues, costs and other variables of the Companies' cash flows into U.S. dollars, assuming that the Bolivar exchange rate would have remained constant in real terms with respect to 2009.708\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 5, 79:8-27.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 5, 79:29-30, 80:1-5.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6186; First Report of Mr. Dellepiane, \u00b6\u00b620, 59.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6187.

In addition, in any event, the Respondent decided not to provide the accounting books of the Companies, which would show the entries corresponding to each loan, which is why it could not hide behind its own default.712\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6189; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6223; Consolidated Financial Statements of Alimentos Frisa and Transporte Dole and Supplementary Information, years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, Note 13 (Accounts Payable to Partners) (**Exhibit C-88**); First Report of Mr. Dellepiane, \u00b695-96.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6189-190; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6223-224, footnotes 476-480, referring to Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 25:17-22, 34:19-35:10, 38:19-20, 60:3-5.

Romania* does not assist the Respondent in its argument that the standard of probabilities is not applicable, since the Respondent confuses valuation with burden of proof and, furthermore, in that case the balance of probabilities was applied to assess the evidence.715 Noting that the documents on the record are sufficient to adequately meet the evidentiary standard in question, the Claimants also request that the Tribunal derive any negative inferences that would arise in connection with the Respondent's breach of the Tribunal's document production order; the Respondent did not deny that such documents were in its possession or control.716\n\nReply, 354-355.

Ariza and Garc\u00eda, presented to the local banks, is irrelevant for purposes of the valuation exercise in the present Arbitration; in this framework, it is only important to understand the capacity to generate cash flows, based on the statement of income, and not on the balance sheets. In any event, the Claimants argue that any difference between such information and the financial statements audited by Mr. P\u00e9rez is explained by the difference in context.720 Thus, in particular, banks did not require non-consolidated balance sheets, but only for Alimentos Frisa, nor was a full audit required.721 The Claimants add that the financial information provided by the Respondent is incomplete, having omitted to contribute to the record cash flow statements in its possession.722 And, in any case, had the financial information given to the banks been taken into account, the amount of compensation would have increased by 23%, mainly because Alimentos Frisa would be even more efficient, since its working capital is lower than in the financial statements audited by Mr. P\u00e9rez.723\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6172, 178, footnotes 362, 379-380, referring to Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 46:25 - 47:2, Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 17:25-28.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6172-177, footnotes 362-378, referring to Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 46:25 -47:2, Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 25:2-20, Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 108:28-109:2, 124:27-125:5, 157:8-21, 195:6-22, 212:3-214:5, 215:13-16, 158:3-9, 109:9-12; Third Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, \u00b614; Witness Statement Ram\u00f3n Ariza, \u00b610, Statement of Mr. Ariza Mart\u00ednez, \u00b610, Historical Financial Statements \"Frisa\", year 2008, Ram\u00f3n audit Ariza, signed March 9, 2009, p. 3 (**Exhibits EO-112)**; Historical Financial Statements \"Frisa\", year 2009, Ram\u00f3n Ariza audit, signed April 20, 2010, p. 3 (**Exhibit EO-113**); Historical Financial Statements Frisa\", year 2008, audit by P\u00e9rez S\u00e1nchez, signed March 12, 2009, p. 28 (**Exhibit C-87**) and Historical Financial Statements \"Frisa\", year 2009, audit by P\u00e9rez S\u00e1nchez, signed February 10, 2010, p. 28 (**Exhibit C-88**); PowerPoint Presentation of Claimants' Opening Argument, p. 138; Historical Financial Statements \"Frisa\", year 2006, audit by P\u00e9rez S\u00e1nchez, signed on February 21, 2007 (**Exhibit C-85**); Historical Financial Statements \"Frisa\", year 2006, audit by Ram\u00f3n Ariza, signed on November 9, 2007 (**Exhibit EO-116**); Historical Financial Statements \"Frisa\", year 2007, audit by P\u00e9rez S\u00e1nchez, signed on March 18, 2008 (**Exhibit C-86**); Historical Financial Statements \"Frisa\", year 2007, audit by Ram\u00f3n Ariza, signed on February 19, 2008 (**Exhibit EO-115**);, **Exhibit C-87, Exhibit E-114, Exhibit C-88, Exhibit EO-113**.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6169-171, footnotes 354-361, referring to Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6165 et seq, Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 158:14-23, 158:17-20, 157:14-21, **Exhibit EO-112**, **Exhibit EO-113**, p. 1. 4-6, **Exhibit EO-114**, **Exhibit EO-115**, **Exhibit EO-116**, Alimentos Frisa, Balance Sheet 2008, Ariza, March 9, 2009, p. 2 (**Exhibit EO-112**), Letter from Common Fund Bank, March 17, 2016, p. 1 (**Exhibit EO-133**).\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6179-183, footnotes 381-385, referring to Second Econ One Report, \u00b6216; Second Compass Lexecon Report, \u00b663, Hearing Transcript, Day 1, 63:13-16, Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 91:3-5.\n\n394.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Mr. Dellepiane correctly calculates the damages corresponding to deposits and loans, considering the accounting information provided in the financial statements of the Companies, given that Alimentos Frisa received the imported merchandise corresponding to the deposits, but did not pay it immediately, as it did not have the necessary foreign currency, so that registering this debt with its suppliers was724 necessary.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6373-374; Second Compass Lexecon Report, \u00b6\u00b6134-135.\n\n395.\n\nIn addition, in the Reply, the Claimants reject Dr. Flores' criticism of Mr. Dellepiane's calculation of the compensation. In relation to the income and capacity of the New Refrigerated Warehouse, the Claimants state the following:\n\n(a) The increase in capacity of Alimentos Frisa would not have been 204%, as calculated by Dr. Flores, because:\n\na. The relationship between dedicated area and storage capacity is not the same in dry and cold stores. In refrigeration and freezing chambers, it is necessary to leave spaces between the stored goods and the walls, and between the different piles of goods, to allow the cold to circulate, which is not necessary in a warehouse. The design of the New Refrigerated Warehouse would allow for optimizing the operations of loading, unloading, organization and mobilization of the merchandise.725\n\nb. Dr. Flores' predictions about the expulsion of Alimentos Frisa from the Taz\u00f3n Warehouse as a consequence of Mercal's arrival at the said warehouse were not fulfilled, since the announcement of Mercal's arrival at the Taz\u00f3n Warehouse took place in 2004 and, three years after such announcement, Alimentos Frisa not only continued to use cool stores in the Taz\u00f3n Warehouse, but had also increased the leased area by 25%.726\n\n(b) Mr. Dellepiane correctly assumes that the added capacity of the New Refrigerated Warehouse would have allowed him to increase all sales, both from the fridges and from the port.727 The new inventory that would be available in the New Refrigerated Warehouse would have allowed Alimentos Frisa to start selling other products and add new customers to its portfolio.728\n\n(c) The Claimants contend that the financial situation of the Ram\u00f3n Vizca\u00edno Group in Spain did not affect the Claimants' project in Venezuela. On the one hand, the Claimants point out that the contract for the construction of the New Refrigerated Warehouse was not signed by Vizca\u00edno Espa\u00f1a, but by a Venezuelan subsidiary of the group, Ram\u00f3n Vizca\u00edno, S.A., which was financially stable.729 On the other hand, the Claimants specify that Vizca\u00edno Espa\u00f1a filed for bankruptcy between March and April 2011, almost one year after the Valuation Date.730 Consequently, the situation that would have been assessed by a willing buyer in May 2010 was that of a group in the process of financial and corporate relaunching and not that of one on the verge of bankruptcy.731\n\n(d) The Claimants deny that the growth rates of Mr. Dellepiane's model are aggressive by allegedly ignoring the seasonal component of demand, since Mr. Dellepiane's projections are based on 2009 sales as they arise from the Companies' financial statements and therefore incorporate any possible seasonal fluctuations732. The Claimants also deny that the contraction experienced by the Venezuelan economy from 2009 onwards would have affected the future growth expectations of a hypothetical purchaser of Alimentos Frisa,733 since, between 2005 and 2009, Alimentos Frisa was able to increase its sales volume by 40% annually, in real terms (and 70% in nominal terms), without prejudice to economic fluctuations, and furthermore, because the model of Mr. Dellepiane estimates that the company's revenues in the 2010-2019 period would have grown at a compound annual rate of 15%, that is, less than a quarter of the historical rate, consistent with the expected behavior of Venezuelan food demand.734\n\nReply, \u00b6286; Second Statement of Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas, \u00b6\u00b65-7 (**CWS-3**); Second Report of Compass Lexecon, \u00b618.\n\nReply, \u00b6287; Second Report of Compass Lexecon, \u00b6\u00b614-16; Second Statement of Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas, \u00b6\u00b615-17 (**CWS-3**).\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, 129:22-30, 130:1-8.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6289-291; Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, \u00b622 (**CWS-1**); First Report of Dr Flores, \u00b654-56.

Report of Mr. Dellepiane, \u00b656.\n\n398.\n\nWith respect to the second issue, the Claimants state that Mr. Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas explained that certain extraordinary expenses not recurring in the expansion and improvement of the facilities of the Taz\u00f3n Warehouse were computed as administrative expenses to adapt the old facilities of Taz\u00f3n to the growth levels of Alimentos Frisa and to the technological advances in the sector, which would not be repeated in the future and, as such, should not be included in the projections of the administrative expenses of Alimentos Frisa.737 Hence, the estimate of the proportion between variable and fixed components (50%-50%) of Alimentos Frisa's administrative expenses is not only adequate, but conservative.\n\nReply, \u00b6308; Second Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, \u00b614 (**CWS-3**).\n\n399.\n\nDr. Flores also questions the investments in freight transport projected by Mr. Dellepiane by suggesting that, like the commissioning of the New Refrigerated Warehouse, Alimentos Frisa would quadruple its sales and the investments in the transport fleet should increase proportionally,738 and criticizes Mr. Dellepiane for apportioning the payment of the investment in the New Refrigerated Warehouse during the year 2010.739 With respect to the first aspect, the Claimants note that the Transporte Dole fleet was primarily used for emergency situations, and it was not in Alimentos Frisa's plans to expand it.740 In relation to the second aspect, the apportionment of the payment of the investment is the only consistent approach, if the income for each year in question is also apportioned income for each year in question, as proposed by Dr. Flores.741\n\nReply, \u00b6311; First Report of Dr. Flores, \u00b6\u00b6105-107.

According to the Claimants, Dr. Flores' model is incorrect because it includes a 100% devaluation (at Bs. 4.30)745 in January 2010 and then assumes that the exchange rate would have continued to depreciate at the rate of inflation. Mr. Dellepiane adjusted his model to reflect the rate of Bs. 4.30, applicable to Alimentos Frisa products as of January 11, 2010. As Mr. Dellepiane explains, the adjustment occurred abruptly and in a single year (2010), but with similar effects in the medium term. The Claimants argue that the theory that the Company's revenues would have decreased in terms of U.S. Dollars, while its costs would have increased as a result of the two-fold exchange, is not correct either. The Claimants believe that this view would be applicable in a scenario of perfect substitution between domestic and imported goods. Finally, Mr. Dellepiane, in agreement with Dr. Flores, assumes that Alimentos Frisa would have been able to lower its costs in the short term, instead of increasing its selling prices, and then adjust both its costs and prices upwards.746\n\nReply, \u00b6321; Second Report of Mr. Dellepiane, \u00b676.\n\nReply, \u00b6324; First Report of Dr. Flores, \u00b686-87, 90-91. Statement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b694, 95, 296, 298.\n\n402.\n\nThe Claimants note that the difference in discount rates proposed by the experts is explained by the different criteria they used to address the following issues:\n\n(a) Calculation of the country risk premium. According to the Claimants, the Respondent's expert uses an exorbitant country risk rate of 14.27%, almost triple the 5.19% calculated by Mr. Dellepiane, based on the Country Risk Rating Model, whose deficiencies make it unreliable, and overestimates the country risk premium applicable to Venezuela.747 The Claimants, on the other hand, believe that the *Emerging Market Bond Index* (\"**EMBI**\") average should exclude the period of the financial crisis, given that market volatility during that period was unusually high. Likewise, considering that the financial transactions during that period occurred in a crisis situation, they should not be considered in the valuation of a long-term investment such as that of the Companies, nor should they use a multiplier of 1.5, because such multiplier is only appropriate for short-term valuations, which is not the case of the valuation of the Companies.748 Finally, the Claimants contend that a State cannot rely on its propensity to violate international standards in order to artificially reduce the value of the compensation due and, therefore, the country risk premium must necessarily exclude from its valuation the consideration of the Claimants' unlawful acts, which may have diminished the value of the Companies.749\n\n(b) Size premium. According to the Claimants, it should be rejected750 for three reasons: (i) the absence of empirical evidence of itself questions its use;751 (ii) it is not appropriate to apply a size premium to companies operating in developing countries, because this would double the consideration of risk, such as the comparison between Venezuela and the United States;752 and (iii) Alimentos Frisa should be considered a large company, relative to the size of the Venezuelan market in which it operates.753\n\n(c) Market risk premium. Mr. Dellepiane uses a premium of 4.75%, calculated as the geometric average, because it is in line with the majority doctrine, since most of the estimates in the financial literature for the period prior to the Valuation Date place the market risk premium in the range of 3% to 5.5% on long-term US Treasury bonds754 and very rarely above 5%.755\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6329-330.

Dr. Flores uses the Country Risk Rating Model.766 This model uses data from 80 countries to establish the relationship between risk ratings published by *Institutional Investor* for each country and stock returns in those countries. The model shows that the higher the country risk, the higher the returns on shares in that country.\n\n(b) Dr. Flores contrasts the 5.19% premium, estimated by Mr. Dellepiane on the basis of the EMBI model, by stating that Venezuela's EMBI at the Valuation Date was 11.61% and that, on average, since it began to be published, it would be 8.92%. According to Dr. Flores, the average data used by Mr. Dellepiane to find that premium \u2013 September 2004 to May 2010, excluding September 2008 to April 2009 \u2013 is not representative of the \"long term\", especially when those 5 years include the lowest values observed in the history of Venezuela's EMBI.767\n\n(c) Dr. Flores also disagrees with Mr. Dellepiane for not having adjusted EMBI due to the greater volatility of stock markets versus bonds. Consequently, to apply the EMBI to the assessment of Alimentos Frisa, Dr. Flores considers that this should be adjusted and, after the adjustment, obtains a country risk premium of 17.42%, which is close to the 14.27% obtained with the Country Risk Rating Model.\n\n(d) Dr. Flores considers that Alimentos Frisa should not be valued excluding the risk of confiscation or expropriation without compensation, because it would lead to the absurd conclusion that the valuation of a company in an arbitration would be greater than its FMV.768 The Respondent points out that the error of wanting to immunize the market's calculation of any risk of confiscation is recognized by the investment tribunals.769 The Respondent further asserts that risks of expropriation without compensation and of any government action that could in the future affect investors negatively are taken into account in the marketplace and should therefore also be taken into account in the valuation of Alimentos Frisa.770\n\n(e) Dr. Flores does not agree with the application of the credit rating method developed by Prof. Damodaran, because this method is intended for countries without sovereign bonds in strong currencies. As Venezuela has sovereign bonds that are traded in the international market, Dr. Flores states that this method could not be applied;771 instead, he understands that it is more appropriate to use the estimated premium of 14.27%, and that it is close to, and even exceeds, that obtained after a correct application of the EMBI model.772\n\n(f) The Respondent alleges that the Claimants' working capital calculation does not recognize that Alimentos Frisa did not have cash; that a hypothetical buyer would have to inject funds, decreasing the value of the business; and that the level of cash is erroneously modeled after that of U.S. companies, given the differences in the operating environment; that the ratio applicable to Frisa Food is that of emerging countries, greater than the one claimed by the Claimants; that the construction of the New Refrigerated Warehouse is based on a false premise; and that the Claimants intend to exclude the use of cash equivalents, such as checks, credit cards, and bank transfers.773\n\n(g) Finally, the Respondent submits that the value of the deposits was erroneously calculated by the Claimants. On the one hand, Dr. Flores seems to detect an error in the application of the exchange rate concerning this item. If the new exchange rate is applied, the amount allegedly due is reduced from US$ 86.6 million to US$ 24.8 million. From an economic perspective, Dr. Flores explains that it does not matter if the supplier settled the invoice by liquidating the deposit or with a transfer from Alimentos Frisa. The Claimants remain in the same position, since the economic displacement for the payment of the goods had to take place, in any case. Given the identity between the person that supposedly made the deposit and the shareholders of Alimentos Frisa, the real scenario and the counterfactual scenario are identical, so there is no economic damage. Consequently, this amount would be a loss and would not be included in the calculation of damages. The Respondent concludes that awarding damages for the reason demanded by the Claimants would imply not incurring any cost for the goods sold.774\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 5, 23:12-29, 24:1-2.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6316.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6314-317.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6322-325; First Report of Dr. Flores, \u00b6\u00b6185-188.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6326; *Venezuela Holdings, B.V.; Mobil Cerro Negro Holdings, LTD.; Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos Holdings, Inc.; Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd.; and* *Mobil Venezolana de Petr\u00f3leos, Inc. v.

This means that there would be no buyers interested in acquiring the Companies as operating companies, as they would not be considered profitable. In addition, Dr. Flores relates the result to a fact that the Claimants themselves reveal: the contract for the construction of the New Refrigerated Warehouse was signed in April 2009 and the Claimants were required to make a first advance of 30% of the price in order to commence execution, but this did not occur. The fact that the Claimants postponed construction confirms, according to the Respondent, that the benefits that Alimentos Frisa had been generating were not sufficient to cover its costs.775\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6214-225, footnotes 505-507, referring to Statement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6333-336; Second Report of Mr. Dellepiane, \u00b672, Report of Mr. Gonzalez, p. 18; First Report of Mr. Gonzalez, \u00b6123-127.\n\n407.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Dr. Flores states that, although there are no buyers interested in buying a company with zero value, they could be interested in acquiring its assets, which are valued at US$ 19 million.776\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6338.\n\n408.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent alleges that the information contained in the financial statements used by the Claimants in their calculation of the DCF:\n\n(a) Is contradictory and incompatible with contemporary financial statements concealed by the Claimants:777 in this regard, the Respondent adds that for a hypothetical purchaser this alleged incompatibility, resulting from differences that the Respondent considers to be \"very significant\", would be unacceptable for the following reasons:778\n\n(1) It is false that the financial statements audited by Mr. Ariza have been the \"closing of accounts\" carried out to for their submission to the banks, since they expressed the results of the entire annual financial year and were made for tax and fiscal purposes, *i.e.* not only for banks.779\n\n(2) It is false to assert that the values of Mr. P\u00e9rez's financial statements are usable for purposes of applying the DCF method, merely because they are consistent with the tax returns and taxes paid by Alimentos Frisa in 2009,780 given that: (i) the calculation of the DCF requires complete historical information that allows the observation of the trends of the company, not merely the total values of income, expenses and profit, sufficient for income tax purposes;781 (ii) the coincidence between the financial statement audited by Mr. P\u00e9rez and the tax declared in 2009 is irrelevant, given that the financial statements used for tax purposes were those prepared by Mr. Ariza;782 (iii) there were serious breaches of the applicable accounting standards;783 and (iv) the financial statements are not reliable, since the purchase of tax credits was erroneously treated as an expense, in violation of applicable accounting standards.784\n\n(3) It is reckless to justify the use of contradictory and incompatible financial statements on the grounds that the DCF method requires only the determination of revenues, cost of sales, operating expenses and profit for the period, nor is it sustainable that cash flows be separate elements.785\n\n(4) The consolidation of the Companies in the financial statements audited by Mr. P\u00e9rez does not make them incomparable with those audited by Mr. Ariza, in light of the following aspects:786 (i) based on the income account, the consolidation of Transporte Dole, which lacked commercial operations and own income, could not have affected the income account of Alimentos Frisa;787 (ii) in the statement of income and loss there are irreconcilable elements, even in items in respect of which Transporte Dole had no results;788 (iii) the inventory account could not have been affected by Transporte Dole either, since it lacks inventories;789 and (iv) the consolidated operating and financial expenses could not have been affected by Transporte Dole either, as it has no revenues, personnel or other operating and financial expenses.790\n\n(b) The minimum accounting standards were not met, as evidenced by the absence of basic information, financial information on Transporte Dole, and certain sensitive accounts, such as social benefits, as well as disclosure of other sensitive information, in addition to errors and discrepancies in the equity and legal reserve accounts, the inability to consolidate financial statements of non-integrated companies as to their actions and the use of information published in 2008 in the audited financial statements between 2004 and 2007, in accordance with the conclusions and disclosures of the Report of Mr. Gonzalez, not contested by the Claimants.791\n\n(c) It contains artificial asset values, as illustrated by the value of certain Transporte Dole assets, such as its trucks, whose value was estimated to be \"10 times the market value\".792\n\n(d) It is inconsistent with other sources of information,793 for the following reasons:\n\n(1) The personal balance sheet of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas as of December 31, 2009 confirms that the value of Alimentos Frisa, according to which 75% of Alimentos Frisa is worth Bs. 102.8 million (US$ 23.9 million), is lower than that intended by the Claimants and, on the contrary, close to that established by the Respondent.794\n\n(2) Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas' statements are not reliable sources for the purposes of using the DCF method, which are, according to the Respondent, \"unfounded and purely speculative\" and do not in any event constitute evidence that satisfies the burden of proof of the damages suffered, which falls on the Claimants.795\n\n(3) In particular, Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas' statements about his relationships with suppliers are unreliable, for the following reasons: (i) because of the criminal investigations of the Chilean Judiciary, as observed in the complaints of the Chilean Internal Tax Service;796 (ii) the Chilean suppliers of Alimentos Frisa exported their products at exorbitant prices, which would have been considered unreliable by a hypothetical buyer;797 (iii) Alimentos Frisa paid prices above the market average, as happened in the case of the tuna exported by Dibicer, S.A.;798 and (iv) the imports of Alimentos Frisa are well below the costs reflected in their financial statements.799\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief,

Noting that the Claimants have changed their position in this regard, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants have failed to meet the burden of proof and have been unable to explain the source of the additional claims they make, since the financial statements on which the Claimants would exclusively rely are not reliable. In the event, denied by the Respondent, that such loans and guarantees exist, the Respondent believes that they should be deducted from Alimentos Frisa's actual balance, since in May 2010 Alimentos Frisa's bank accounts had been emptied.800\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6193-194, footnotes 443-444, referring to Import Genius, Food Imports Frisa 2009 (**Exhibit EO-127**); Compass Lexecon updated valuation model, sheet \"Cash Flow (100%)\" (**Exhibit CLEX-035**); Frisa 2009 Financial Statements, p. 26 (**Exhibit C-88**); Second Report of Dr. Flores, \u00b6\u00b698-99.\n\n410.\n\nThe Respondent submits, in the alternative, that a correct DCF calculation would result in a negative FMV and that Mr. Dellepiane's calculation contains methodological errors and leads to exorbitant results, particularly in light of such aspects as revenues and capacity expansion, sales and administrative costs, capital investments, working capital, taxes, terminal value and discount rate,801 and for the following reasons:\n\n(a) Mr. Dellepiane's income and capacity expansion calculations are based on serious errors and false premises, relying exclusively on Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas' witness statements and in view of the lack of connection between the alleged construction of the warehouse, the income and capacity increase of Alimentos Frisa, as well as the unjustified optimism of the expansion projected by Mr. Dellepiane.802\n\n(b) Administrative costs obtained through an unfounded methodology based on arbitrary parameters, it being more appropriate to project administrative costs in relation to projected revenues.803\n\n(c) The capital investments were underestimated, given the artificiality of Mr. Dellepiane's calculations and, in any case, the causal link between the New Refrigerated Warehouse and the Companies804 has not been proven.\n\n(d) Working capital was miscalculated, given that the cash level applicable to U.S. companies, which is not the same for Venezuelan importing companies, was taken into account; furthermore, Alimentos Frisa did not have cash in excess. In view of the lack of sufficient cash for the company's operations at the Valuation Date, a hypothetical buyer would have had to inject an approximate sum of Bs. 9,5 million.805\n\n(e) The discount rate used is unreasonable, as can be seen by taking into account aspects such as the estimation of the costs of equity and debt, as well as the optimal capital structure.806\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6195-197, footnotes 445-453, referring to Updated Valuation Model (**Exhibit CLEX-035**); Second Report of Mr. Dellepiane, \u00b66: First Report of Dr. Flores, pp. 20-95; Second Report of Dr. Flores, pp. 54-69, 72-93, Schedule B.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6198-208, footnotes 454-481, referring to the First Report of Mr. Dellepiane, \u00b629; Compass Lexecon Valuation Model, pp. 3-4 (**Exhibit CLEX-002**), First Report of Dr. Flores, \u00b6\u00b645-49 and Table 2; updated valuation model (**Exhibit CLEX-035**); First Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, \u00b647; Summary of the Agrofino Project, p. 6 (**Exhibit C-116**); Draft Refrigerated Warehouse, Ram\u00f3n Vizca\u00edno S.A., p. 12 (**Exhibit C-92**); Hearing Transcript, Day 5, 84:2325, 85:9-19, 87:1-4, 91:29-92:2, 92:28, Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 92:18-20, 92:20-23, 93:5-9, 170:10-19, Hearing Transcript, Day 3, 66:11-20; Composition of Assets in Earnings Release 2009 (**Exhibit EO-113**), Second Report of Dr. Flores, p. 58-69; Rejoinder Writing, \u00b6\u00b6527-532; Presentation at Dr. Flores' Audience, Slide No. 35; Audience Transcript, Day 5, 110:8-12.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6209-210.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6211-212.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6213-218.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6193-194, footnotes 443-444, referring to Import Genius, Food Imports Frisa 2009 (**Exhibit EO-127**); Compass Lexecon updated valuation model, sheet \"Cash Flow (100%)\" (**Exhibit CLEX-035**); Frisa 2009 Financial Statements, p. 26 (**Exhibit C-88**); Second Report of Dr. Flores, \u00b6\u00b698-99.\n\n**C. Readjustment of the Claimants' claim as a result of the partial waiver of their original claim**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimants' Arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n411.\n\nIn their Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, the Claimants modified the calculation of their claim. Following the annulment of that judgment by the Court of Cassation, the Claimants reaffirmed that the amount of their claim was reduced under the same conditions as previously filed,807 as a result of which the compensation initially calculated should be reduced by 5.25%.808\n\nSecond Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b6\u00b617-23.\n\nClaimants' Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b635.\n\n412.\n\nIn order to explain the adjustment of the claim for the value of the Companies, the Claimants included a history of the acquisition and transfer of shares of their property in Alimentos Frisa and Transporte Dole. On this basis, the Claimants indicated that, of the 5,000,000 shares in Alimentos Frisa existing as of May 20, 2010, 4,750,000 shares were acquired by the Claimants while they were Spanish nationals. They also point out that of the 200,000 shares of Transporte Dole existing on the same date, 199,200 shares were acquired by Ms. Garc\u00eda Gruber after obtaining Spanish nationality.809\n\nClaimants' Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b6\u00b636-40.\n\n413.\n\nFor that purpose, the Claimants state that the number of shares acquired by them while they had Spanish nationality and up to the Valuation Date should be considered. They also assert that each of the shares issued by Alimentos Frisa and Transporte Dole must have the same value because the Companies operated as an economic unit. They explain that the protected interest is reduced to 95.2% and its valuation is reduced from US$ 439.3 million to US$ 418.1 million.810\n\nClaimants' Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b641.\n\n414.\n\nBefore the Court of Cassation overturned the Court of Appeal Judgment, the Claimants based the partial waiver of their purported rights on the proportion of the investments made when they were not Spanish, to distinguish them from those made when they were Spanish. For that purpose, the Claimants confronted the dates on which they made the acquisitions of the Companies' shares, loans, and security deposits that were the subject of the claim, with the dates on which they had Spanish nationality. The headings referring to the shares of the Companies are summarized in the following table:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Company** | **Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas** | **Karina Garc\u00eda Gruber** |\n| Alimentos Frisa | Shares acquired before 8/2/2004 | 190,.000 | Shares acquired before 10/20/2003 | 60,000 |\n| Shares acquired after 8/2/2004 | 3,560,000 | Shares acquired after 10/20/2003 | 1,190,000 |\n| Transporte Dole | Shares acquired before 8/2/2004 | 0 | Shares acquired before 10/20/2003 | 800 |\n| Shares acquired after 8/2/2004 | 0 | Shares acquired after 10/20/2003 | 199,200 |\n| Protected shares | 3,560,000 | 1,389,200 |\n\n415.\n\nAs to the loans made by Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, the Claimants explain that Mr. Dellepiane \"*assumes that any loan existing prior to December 31, 2004 was made without the protection of the Treaty*\"*.*811\" Therefore, excluding such loans, the claim to that title is reduced to US$ 17.1 million. With respect to the guarantees granted by Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas to the foreign suppliers of Alimentos Frisa,812 which were allegedly provided after he reacquired the Spanish nationality, the Claimants maintain the amounts originally sought.\n\nClaimants' Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b643.\n\nClaimants' Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b644.\n\n416.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that, in total, the claim for damages is reduced from US$ 550.7 million to US$ 521.8 million and add that, in any event, that value must be discounted by interest until the date of actual payment.813\n\nClaimants' First Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b645.\n\n**2. The Respondent's Arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nVenezuela argues that the Claimants' proposed method of calculating the reduction in equity value in Alimentos Frisa and Transporte Dole is erroneous.814 In particular, it rejects the application of a rule of three from the value and issue dates of the shares in order to determine what part of the value of the companies was created at a given time.815 It argues that this method does not allow distinguishing the portion of the amount of damages corresponding to the investments that are supposedly protected816 and indicates that the values found contradict what is indicated in the books of shareholders of Alimentos Frisa and Transporte Dole.817\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment , \u00b641.\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment , \u00b645.\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment , \u00b647.\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment , \u00b652.\n\n418.\n\nThe Respondent insists that the DCF method is inapplicable and that, if applied, it would result in a negative value.818 Consequently, it reiterates that the only available method is the net asset method and affirms that, according to Dr. Flores, the corresponding adjustment could be made based on the acquisition dates of the different assets.819\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment , \u00b663.\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment , \u00b664.\n\n419.\n\nThe Respondent focuses on the adjustment of the Claimants' equity value in Alimentos Frisa and Transporte Dole*,* and indicates that it will not rule on the other damages, since \"*(i) there is no evidence of the existence of such loans and guarantees, (ii) there is evidence (Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas' own testimony) of the non-existence of such loans and guarantees, and (iii) even if it is considered proven, which is denied, such damage does not fall within the standard of compensation provided for in* [the Treaty]'.820\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment , \u00b642.\n\n420.\n\nIn relation to the Claimants' equity, the Respondent rejects the method proposed by them. It relies on the conclusions of Dr. Flores, who explains that *\"from an economic point of view it is not reasonable to use the number of shares of a company and their dates of issue to determine what part of the value of the company was created before a certain date\".*821 In addition, Dr. Flores states that *\"from an economic point of view, the use of the dates on which certain shares were supposedly issued is not a good method for adjusting the total amount of compensation*\".822\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b645.\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b645.\n\n421.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that Mr. Dellepiane did not make any comment or analysis of this method in the Supplementary Report of Mr. Dellepiane, and that he merely followed the Claimants' instructions. He quotes Dr. Flores, who states that Mr. Dellepiane \"*does not make any independent economic or financial analysis with respect to what part of the total amount of damages he calculated would correspond to the portion of investments that allegedly would have been made after the Claimants acquired or regained Spanish nationality\".*823\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b647.\n\n422.\n\nLikewise, the Respondent submits that the documents produced by the Claimants contradict the findings of the report as to the total amount of damages. Indeed, he explains that, although it is true that Transporte Dole and Alimentos Frisa jointly held 5,200,00 shares as of the Valuation Date, in accordance with *\"the 'reconstructed' shareholder books it is also clear that the value of these shares was Bs 52 million, which is equivalent to US$ 12 million\".*824\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b652.\n\n423.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent points out that Mr. Dellepiane does not explain how \"*an investment of only US$12 million, 91% of which would have occurred in 2007 and 2009, would have resulted in a value of US$ 439.3 million as of the Valuation Date\".*825 He also criticizes the fact that the calculations made by Mr. Dellepiane have not taken into account the effect of inflation to adjust the value of the shares.\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b656.\n\n424.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that only once a new decision on jurisdiction is issued, provided that a substantive phase is initiated, would the Tribunal have the necessary elements to determine an appropriate and reliable method for calculating an eventual compensation. The Respondent adds that, should the Tribunal decide to move toward a substantive decision, it has a duty to give them the opportunity to determine the method.826\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b659-60.\n\n425.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the discounted cash flow method is not applicable in this case and that if the value of Alimentos Frisa and Transporte Dole is calculated using the net asset method, adjustments could be made \"*based on the dates of acquisition of the various assets\"*.827\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b664.\n\n**D. Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Effects of the Claimants' waiver of a part of the claims**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n426.\n\nThe Tribunal must consider a new circumstance following the Decision on Jurisdiction, which is the Claimants' waiver of part of their original claims. Indeed, in their Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment of September 8, 2017, the Claimants expressly stated that they adjusted their claim, reducing the number of shares in the Companies for which they seek indemnification, as well as the loans allegedly granted by Mr. Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas to Alimentos Frisa when he was not a Spanish national.828 The Claimants' waiver of that part of their claim was expressly affirmed in their First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, in the following terms:\n\n*In addition, in order to avoid any doubt in this regard, on September 8, 2017, the Claimants expressly waived before this Tribunal their claims for investments made when they were not Spanish nationals, in strict application of the partial annulment criterion of the Court of Appeal (and they confirm their waiver in this brief). As a consequence, from that date onwards, the Claimants only claim for the investments made when they did have Spanish nationality* [...]*.*829\n\nClaimants' First Brief on Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b6\u00b636-43.\n\nClaimants' First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b618.\n\n427.\n\nAs an explanation for their waiver, the Claimants relied on the fact that, during the validity of the Court of Appeal Judgment, Treaty protection was limited to 4,750,000 shares in Alimentos Frisa and 199,200 shares in Transporte Dole, totaling 4,949,200 shares in the two Companies together.\n\n428.\n\nThe Claimants also considered that the loans made by Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas when he was not of Spanish nationality \u2013 *i.e*. before August 2, 2004830 \u2013 did not enjoy the protection of the Treaty, which is why they were not subject to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Therefore, during the validity of the Court of Appeal Judgment, the Claimants themselves excluded loans made prior to that date, reducing their claim to the equivalent of US$ 17.1 million.\n\nClaimants' First Brief on the Court of Appeal Judgment, \u00b643.\n\n429.\n\nIn response to the Claimants' waiver of part of their claims, the Respondent objected, arguing that the Claimants would be attempting, through the waiver, to have the Tribunal redeem its own jurisdiction.831\n\nRespondent's Second Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b6\u00b620-21.\n\n430.\n\nIn the analysis of the Claimants' reasoning, it is relevant to consider that the Respondent challenged the validity of the document entitled \"Amendments to the Constitutive Document of Transporte Dole, C.A.\" of February 8, 2007 (Exhibit C19) and \"Amendments to the Constitutive Document of Alimentos Frisa, C.A.\", of April 14, 2009 (Exhibit C-28), under the allegation of fraud. According to the Respondent, the signatures of Ms. Karina Garc\u00eda Gruber and Ms. Raquel Garc\u00eda Gruber would be forgeries, which would render those documents unacceptable as evidence.\n\n431.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects this argument, given that there was no allegation of fraud by the persons involved in these transactions, who did not express opposition to the acts referred to in the corporate documents of the Companies. On the contrary, both signatories fully ratified the validity of the transfers made and reflected in those documents by affirming that \"*we approve and ratify in their entirety the assembly minutes and inventories questioned by Venezuela*\";832 their strictly private nature gives them sufficient credibility as evidence in this procedure.\n\nThird Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, Exhibit A (Letter from Ms. Karina and Ms. Raquel Garc\u00eda Gruber of July 15, 2016).\n\n432.\n\nThe Respondent also argued that it would not be possible to calculate the Companies' recoverable portion by the proportional method. According to it, it would be necessary to reopen the expert evidence and give the Parties the opportunity to discuss the appropriate method to identify the affected actions at each point in time when the investments became effective over time.\n\n433.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, after contributions have been made to the capital stock of a company, all of its shares become, from then on, identical in value to the other shares of the same class previously issued, regardless of the amount paid in the respective subscriptions. In corporations, each share represents a fraction of the share capital, and its value obeys to the proportion it has over the total number of shares that make up the share capital at each moment of evaluation.\n\n434.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the waiver of the Claimants, as a unilateral act of will of the purported owner of a right of economic nature, is not capable of being rejected by the Arbitral Tribunal. Indeed, the Claimants' claim, at the commencement of this arbitration, was for compensation for the entirety of the damages suffered in connection with all of their investments in the Companies, allegedly expropriated by the Respondent in violation of the Treaty. The Tribunal considers that there is nothing to prevent the holder of an allegedly infringed right from waiving a part of the compensation that it might eventually claim. Therefore, if the Claimants find it satisfactory to collect the value of 4,750,000 of the 5,000,000 shares of in Frisa and 199,200 of the 200,000 shares in Transporte Dole and, in addition, only a portion of the value of the loans that Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas would have made in favor of Alimentos Frisa, it is not up to the Arbitral Tribunal to prevent them from doing so.\n\n435.\n\nIn exercising its jurisdiction, the Tribunal has full powers to accept the Claimants' waiver of a part of their claims. In this regard, it is appropriate to distinguish between the eventual waiver by the Claimants of part of their claims forming the subject matter of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the question of the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal itself. The Tribunal has no doubt that, in accordance with the terms of the Court of Cassation Judgment, it is in full exercise of the jurisdiction previously asserted in its own Decision on Jurisdiction and, therefore, it is completely unnecessary to issue a new decision on jurisdiction, as the Respondent claims in its brief dated March 25, 2019.\n\n436.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the Claimants' reasoning regarding the timing of the investments, expressed before the Court of Appeal Judgment was annulled, has become irrelevant to the decision on merits of this Arbitration, in which, as a consequence of the Court of Cassation Judgment, there is no longer any debate as to whether or not the investments made are under the protection of the Treaty.\n\n437.\n\nIndeed, the reasons why the Claimants decided to waive a portion of the compensation claimed are not relevant to the purposes of such waiver. However, it results from the waiver that the shares of the Companies acquired when the Claimants did not have Spanish nationality have been excluded from compensation. On this basis, the Arbitral Tribunal understands that it is not for it to rule on whether or not such actions are protected by the Treaty; in that sense, the assertions contained in the Decision on Jurisdiction concerning the effects of such a distinction do not affect the conclusions of this award and, consequently, became ancillary considerations to the *ratio decidendi*.\n\n438.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal considers the reduction in the amount of compensation claimed to be the equivalent of 4,750,000 shares in Alimentos Frisa and 199,200 shares in Transporte Dole, and the reduction in the value of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas' loans to Alimentos Frisa to be those loans made after August 2, 2004, as requested by the Claimants, regardless of the reasons that led them to waive a portion of the compensation initially required.\n\n**2. The Claimants' Rights**\n----------------------------\n\n439.\n\nThe Claimants have the right to recover from the Respondent the compensation for their losses, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and the principles of international law, limited to the amount resulting from the readjustment of their claim.\n\n474.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, according to the Claimants, there would be a distinction between the remedy referred to in Article V(1) of the Treaty, applicable in the case of a legal expropriation, and that which is enforceable in the case of an unlawful expropriation, as is the case discussed in this Arbitration. On the basis of that distinction, the Claimants allege that, while in lawful expropriations it is incumbent to find the value of the affected property, in unlawful ones the standard of full reparation present in the Articles on Responsibility and in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case would be adopted. Accordingly, the Claimants argue that, beyond being compensated by the value of the Claimants' shares in the Companies,833 they should also be compensated by the value of the guarantees provided by Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas to enable the importation of food,834 by the value of the loans made to Alimentos Frisa by Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas,835 and by compound interest before and after the award.836\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6148, footnote 321, referring to Statement of Claim, Section V.B.3.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6148, footnote 322, referring to Statement of Claim, Section V.B.4.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6148, footnote 322, referring to Statement of Claim, Section V.B.4.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6148, footnote 323, referring to Statement of Claim, Section V.C.\n\n475.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Article V of the Treaty guarantees the Claimants the right to fair compensation for situations of nationalization and expropriation, which should include the value of expropriated property, verified in accordance with objective criteria;837 it is the Tribunal's responsibility to determine the amount of the838 compensation.\n\n\"The compensation for the acts referred to in paragraph 1 shall be equivalent to the actual value of the investment immediately before the measures were taken or before they were announced or published, whichever is the earlier. The compensation shall be paid without delay, in convertible currency and shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable in accordance with the rules set out in Article VII\". Treaty, Art.V, 2.\n\n\"The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach by the Contracting Party of its obligations under this Agreement, whether such breach of obligations has caused damage to the investor of the other Contracting Party, and, if so, to fixing the amount of compensation\". Treaty, Article XI, 5.\n\n476.\n\nHowever, customary international law also recognizes, more broadly, the Claimants' right to obtain full reparation for damages suffered as a result of the Respondent's actions. The Articles on Responsibility are emphatic, stating that \"*the responsible State has an obligation to fully repair the damage caused by its internationally wrongful act*\".839 Similarly, the case law of investment arbitration tribunals offers countless examples of this, stating that\n\n*[t]he customary international law standard for the assessment of damages resulting from an unlawful act is set out in the decision of the PCIJ in the Chorz\u00f3w Factory case at page 47 of the Judgment which reads: 'reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.*840\n\nInternational Law Commission, \"*Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Illicit Acts, with commentaries*\", 2001, art. 31(1) (**Exhibit CLA-66**): -\"[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act\".\n\n*ADC Affiliate Limited y ADC & ADMC Management Limited c. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, October 2, 2006, \u00b6484 (**Exhibit CLA-83**); *Gold Reserve Inc. c. Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/09/1, Award, September 22, 2014, \u00b6\u00b6678-679 (**Exhibit CLA116**); *CMS Gas Transmission Company c. Argentinian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, May 12, 2005, \u00b6400 (**Exhibit CLA-39**).\n\n477.\n\nThe Claimants' right to full compensation is not altered or diminished by the Respondent's allegations of fraud in connection with the Companies' financial statements. Beyond the fact that the allegations of fraud have not been proven, the corporate minutes of the Companies were not challenged by any of their shareholders or individuals who might be affected (in particular, by Ms. Karina Garc\u00eda Gruber and Ms. Raquel Garc\u00eda Gruber), nor were they declared null and void by a court with jurisdiction over the matter. Therefore, such allegations are irrelevant to the Claimants' right to be compensated, as well as their quantification.\n\n478.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that the irregularities alleged by the Respondent to Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas or to members of his family relating to transactions between the Companies and other companies owned by him do not affect the right of the Claimants to obtain fair and full compensation for the losses suffered as a result of the Respondent's violation of the Treaty and the rules of international law.\n\n479.\n\nThe Respondent's arguments that the Claimants continued to operate in Venezuela after the Respondent's Measures and that the losses suffered under them have otherwise been recovered were not substantiated. Nor was it shown that the Claimants contributed to the aggravation of the damages claimed for allegedly abandoning the Companies, as alleged by the Respondent.841 The complete absence of proof of these allegations is added to the testimonies of Mr. D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n842 and Mr. Zandar\u00edn843 in a diametrically opposed sense. For these reasons, the Respondent is not entitled to the reduction of compensation due, as the Respondent claims. Therefore, the damages recoverable from the Claimants are those resulting from the Measures taken by the Respondent in violation of the Treaty.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6175-180.\n\nFirst Statement of Mr. D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n, \u00b6\u00b644 and 47 (**RWS-1**); Second Statement of Mr. D\u00edaz Le\u00f3n, \u00b6\u00b642 and 43 (**RWS-2**)\n\nFirst Statement of Mr. Zandar\u00edn, \u00b6\u00b624, 34 and 37 (**CWS-2**); Second Statement of Mr. Zandar\u00edn, \u00b6\u00b633-41 (**CWS-3**)\n\n480.\n\nThe Tribunal carefully examined the reports of the experts of both Parties. Having considered each and every one of the arguments presented by the Parties and their experts, the Tribunal reached the following conclusions on the calculation of the compensable value of the Companies, loans and security deposits.\n\n**3. The Companies**\n--------------------\n\n481.\n\nThe Tribunal took into consideration both the Claimants' arguments that it is a matter of compensating for the actual loss of an ongoing business, and the Respondent's arguments that the compensation should cover nothing more than the actual value of the Companies. Having examined the different positions, the Tribunal concludes that the DCF method is adequate for the quantification of damages, since it considers the flows that would be generated by the Companies during a period since the expropriation, brought to their present value at the market interest rate. This method is the most suitable for fulfilling the condition that the compensation is sufficient to fully restore the value of the losses suffered due to the indirect expropriation of the Companies.\n\n482.\n\nIndeed, the value lost by the Claimants as a result of the Respondent's Measures was not restricted to the value of each individual item of property, but encompassed an entire business operation developed over a period of more than 10 years.844\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b618-25.\n\n483.\n\nBeyond the differences observed between the Parties regarding the valuation method to be used, once the DCF method was chosen, both Parties agreed on certain technical criteria to arrive at a consistent result. Thus, both Parties admitted that the New Refrigerated Warehouse, whose construction had been initiated by Alimentos Frisa before the date of expropriation, should be considered to have operated from its alleged completion. Similarly, the Parties did not disagree that the business evaluation should compute the investments, operating expenses and increased sales resulting from the start-up of the New Refrigerated Warehouse.\n\n484.\n\nThe Tribunal assumes as correct that, in the absence of the expropriation, the activities of the Taz\u00f3n Warehouse would have continued regularly, insofar that it was not demonstrated that such activities would necessarily be paralyzed from the start-up of the New Refrigerated Warehouse. Based on this, the Tribunal considered that the income from sales of products by the Companies would be increased from the opening of the New Refrigerated Warehouse, admitting a 50% increase in the capacity of the New Refrigerated Warehouse \u2013 the minimum percentage foreseen by the Claimants, coincidental with the percentage admitted by the Respondent.845 The Tribunal also found the Claimants' projections of capital investments and depreciations adequate.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6295; First Report of Dr. Flores, \u00b682 and Chart 2 Frisa Income Projection: Three Scenarios.\n\n485.\n\nAfter considering the reasoning presented by each Party regarding annual revenue growth in the event that the Companies had continued to operate, the Tribunal has estimated a more realistic scenario of 21% growth from 2012 to 2016, with revenue stabilizing from 2017 to 2019 as the end point of the evaluation period.\n\n486.\n\nThe gross margin on sales was admitted by both Parties as 18.3% of revenues.846 This percentage has therefore been adopted by the Tribunal in the calculation of the valuation.\n\nFirst Report of Dr. Flores, \u00b695; First Report of Mr. Dellepiane, \u00b669.\n\n487.\n\nSimilarly, both Parties admitted that administrative costs would increase on the basis of the consumer price index. The Claimants argue that half of them would have increased in proportion to the volume of sales, while the other half would be fixed costs; the Respondent, in turn, pointed out that all administrative costs would evolve with the same rate of increase in sales. The Tribunal found that due to the scale factor, the increase proposed by the Claimants is more realistic than that defended by the Respondent and, consequently, it adopted the first of them.\n\n488.\n\nFor the purposes of calculating the investments in the New Refrigerated Warehouse and the resulting sales increases, the Tribunal admitted that it would enter into operation in 2012, as projected by the Claimants. The Respondent's claim that there would be delays and that, therefore, the respective implementation would only be completed in 2013 was not substantiated. The Tribunal therefore dismissed that objection.\n\n489.\n\nThe Claimants estimated that the level of working capital consistent with the Companies' operations was 17.7% of sales revenue, which would lead to a cash surplus of US$ 23,071 million in working capital. The Respondent argued that the ratio between working capital and income would be 43.0%, where there would be no excess working capital. The projection made by the Claimants is more consistent with the reality of the Companies and the historical data on working capital, observing that the considerable difference between the indexes presented by the Parties resulted from the different methodologies used by each of the experts in their respective calculations.\n\n490.\n\nThe percentage of WACC claimed by the Claimants was 11.61%, and the percentage proposed by the Respondent was 24.73%. By breaking down the components of this item, the Tribunal reached the percentage of 17.88%, according to the following results:\n\n(a) In composing the *cost of equity*, the Tribunal found that **(i)** both the Claimants' proposed *risk-free rate* (3.58%) and the Respondent's proposed *risk-free rate* (4.07%) are technically acceptable; therefore, the average of 3.82% was adopted between the two; **(ii)** both the Claimants' proposed *market risk premium* (4.75%) and the Respondent's proposed market *risk premium* (6.7%) are technically acceptable; therefore, the average of 5.73% was adopted between the two; **(iii)** an *adjusted releveraged beta* coefficient of 0.96, which refers to the wholesale market, as proposed by the Respondent, is more appropriate than the coefficient proposed by the Claimants (0.83), which refers to the retail market, which is not Alimentos Frisa's market; **(iv)** the *size premium* is a necessary but essentially variable factor according to each evaluator, and both the one proposed by the Claimants (0%) and the one proposed by the Respondent (2.85%) would be acceptable on an objective valuation basis; therefore, the average between the two of 1.43% was adopted; **(v)** the *country-risk premium* was considered to be 8.92%, the historical average of the EMBI index for the three-year period 2008-2010, since the percentage proposed by the Claimants (5.19%) was undervalued and the percentage proposed by the Respondent (14.27%) was considered overvalued.\n\n(b) In the *after-tax cost of debt*, the Tribunal admitted: (i) that both the Claimants' proposed *risk-free rate* (3.58%) and the Respondent's proposed *risk-free rate* (4.07%) are technically acceptable. Accordingly, the average of 3.82% was adopted between the two; (ii) the *risk premium of* Venezuela's *sovereign debt* was considered at 8.92%, the historical average of the EMBI index for the three-year period 2008-2010, since the percentage proposed by the Claimants (5.19%) was undervalued and the percentage proposed by the Respondent was considered overvalued (11.61%); (iii) the *corporate debt risk premium* accepted by both Parties of 2.5%; (iv) the *cost of the pre-tax debt* of 15.24%, which results from the application of the elements and percentages adopted by the Tribunal in this award;847 (iv) the *tax rate* in Venezuela of 34.66%, as the Respondent reported, slightly more burdensome than that indicated by the Claimants (34%).\n\n(c) In the *optimal capital structure*, the ratio of debt to equity, as proposed by the Respondent, was estimated (18.25%) because it applies to the wholesale sector, since the percentage proposed by the Claimants (20.74%) applies to the retail sector, alien to Alimentos Frisa.\n\nThe *pre-tax cost of debt* is calculated from the sum of the Risk-Free Rate, the Risk Premium of the Sovereign Debt of Venezuela and the Risk Premium of Corporate Indebtedness.\n\n491.\n\nThe exchange rate and the inflation rate were considered as a whole for the purpose of comparing different currencies during the period under review. It was estimated that the conversion to U.S. dollars of values expressed in Bolivars (prior to the 2018 monetary exchange rate) should be due to the evolution projected by the Claimants \u2013 from 2010 to 2019 of Bs. 4.30/US$ 1 in 2010 to Bs. 22.70/US$ 1 in 2018 \u2013 which was consistent with the effective devaluation of the Venezuelan currency against the U.S. dollar, evolving from Bs. 4.29/US$ 1 in 2010 to Bs. 9.99/US$ 1 in 2017,848 encompassing eight of the ten years of the period covered by the compensation.\n\nData available at: www.bloomberg.com/quote/US$VEF:CUR and www.reuters.com/finance/currencies/quote?srcCurr+VEF&destCurr=US$ (accessed August 1, 2018).\n\n492.\n\nConsidering the information mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, the Tribunal found that the Net Projected Value for the period 2010 to 2019 is US$ 52,168,855.31 and, with the calculation of perpetuity, the Terminal Value reached US$ 88,707,800.79. Adding to these values the Excess Cash of US$ 23,070,418.05, the Value of the Companies as of May 20, 2010 reached US$ 163,947,074.15. From this value the Financial Debt recorded in the Financial Statements of the Companies, amounting to US$ 18,350,877.44, must be deducted.\n\n493.\n\nThe application of the criteria and calculation methodology explained above leads to a total value of the Companies, on the date immediately preceding the expropriation, of US$ 145,596,197.70 (one hundred and forty-five million, five hundred and ninety-six thousand, one hundred and ninety-seven U.S. dollars and seventy cents), which corresponds to the set of 5,200,000 shares in both Companies. As a result of the Claimants' waiver of part of their claims, only 4,949,200 of those shares, valued at US$ 138,573,981.08 (one hundred and thirty-eight million, five hundred and seventy-three thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one U.S. dollars and eight cents), are compensable.\n\n**4. Loans**\n------------\n\n494.\n\nIn their Statement of Claim, the Claimants claimed payment of a debt that Alimentos Frisa would have with Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, which would have remained unpaid after the Respondent's takeover of the Company. According to the Claimants, \"*the loans he had made to Alimentos Frisa on various occasions* [...] *amounted to approximately US$ 49.6 million (Bs. 106.7 million) in 2009 and became irrecoverable after the destruction of the Companies' operations\".*849 They also explained that the amount of Bs. 106,694,369.00 was recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Alimentos Frisa and Transporte Dole and in the Complementary Information referring to the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,850 in the account \"Non-current Liabilities \u2013 payable to partners\", confirmed in the Note 13 of the referred financial statement.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b682.\n\nHistorical Financial Statements \"Frisa\", year 2009, audited by P\u00e9rez S\u00e1nchez, signed on February 10, 2010 (**Exhibit C-88**).\n\n495.\n\nThe Respondent, in turn, argued in its Statement of Defense that the causal link between the alleged harm and the imputed conduct had not been proven, that the conversion of Bolivares to U.S. dollars presented by the Claimants would be incorrect, and that the financial statements would be fraudulent and could not be considered by the Tribunal. The Respondent further contested that the Claimants failed to provide evidence of \"*how many, who granted them, under what conditions they were returned, what was their destination, whether there were installments already due on the Date of Valuation; and/or when they expired, among many other issues*\"*.*851 In addition, the Respondent contested the authenticity of the financial statements in Exhibit C-88, especially with respect to the devaluation of the bolivar against the U.S. dollar on January 8, 2010, and errors in the share capital and legal reserve, pointing to possible irregularities in the numbering of the Security Single Paper of the Federation of the College of Chartered Accountants of Venezuela.852\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6352.\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6\u00b6351-356.\n\n496.\n\nIn the Preliminary Document Exhibit Stage, the Claimants requested the exhibition of documents listed in the Redfern Table,853 presumably in the possession of the Respondent. Among such documents, it was required to submit copies of the Journals and Ledgers of the Companies for the years 2005 to 2010, which as of May 21, 2010 were in the fireproof and anti-theft file cabinets of Alimentos Frisa.\n\nProcedural Order No. 6 of April 29, 2015.\n\n497.\n\nThe Respondent objected to the request for production of such documents, on the grounds that the Claimants had not been able to prove that they remained with the Company after their occupation, and because the Claimants would not have demonstrated the existence of damages justifying the request.\n\n498.\n\nThe Respondent did not deny possession of the documents that it was required to provide, and the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to disclose them, stating that it was \"*satisfied with the Claimants' statement as to the potential relevance of the documents requested with respect to the quantification-evaluation of the damages alleged by the Claimants and, therefore, of their relevance to the resolution of the case*\"*.*854 The Tribunal also stated that\n\n*in most cases, the Respondent has not denied that the documents requested by the Claimants may be relevant to the quantification of damages and has merely asserted that the Claimants must prove the existence of the damages in order to make the request for production of the documents.*855\n\nProcedural Order No. 6 of April 29, 2015.\n\nProcedural Order No. 6 of April 29, 2015.\n\n499.\n\nIn spite of this, the Respondent did not produce the documents that were likely in its possession.\n\n500.\n\nThe evidence submitted by the Claimants consisted of Alimentos Frisa's Financial Statements, in which there is an accounting record of the debt to the shareholders,856 and Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas' First Statement,857 which explains the circumstances and the manner in which the loans were made. The Claimants asserted that the copy of the Journals and Ledgers, and electronic records, referred to in the Applications 4 and 6 of the Redfern Table, would confirm the information contained in the Companies' financial statements by recording payments to suppliers and loans made by Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, but the Respondent did not make its submission, disregarding the Tribunal's order to that effect.\n\nHistorical Financial Statements \"Frisa\", year 2009, audited by P\u00e9rez S\u00e1nchez, signed on February 10, 2010 (**Exhibit C-88**).\n\nFirst Statement of Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, \u00b625.\n\n501.\n\nThe Claimants invoked the principle that \"*no one may invoke the non-performance of a charge if such non-performance has been made impossible or impeded by his own unlawful actions\".*858 That theory, according to the Claimants, would apply to the present case insofar that the Respondent has refused to comply with the Tribunal's order to provide copies of the Journals and Ledgers, and electronic records of the Companies, which remained in Alimentos Frisa and which the Respondent never denied possessing.\n\nReply, \u00b6355.\n\n502.\n\nThe Respondent asserted, in turn, that the documents produced by the Claimants to substantiate their claims would be fraudulent, particularly since \"*the Claimants fabricated 'post factum' the said Financial Statements with false information for the sole purpose of misleading, through fraud, the Tribunal\".*859 The Respondent reiterated that the reprinted financial statements were not consistent with the financial statements submitted to banks and that there was no evidence of the amount of each transaction, who granted them, on what terms they were returned, what was their destination, whether there were installments already due on the Valuation Date, and/or when they expired.860\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6155.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6152-167.\n\n503.\n\nRegarding the conversion of the amount of the alleged loans into U.S. dollars, the Claimants complied with the Respondent's objection as to the exchange rate to be used, referring that its expert \"*has restated the amount of damages corresponding to the loans into U.S. dollars to take into account the higher Bolivar 4.30 exchange rate\".*861 As a result, the claim filed was reduced from the US$ 49.6 million originally filed to US$ 24.8 million after the exchange rate adjustment.\n\nReply, \u00b6362.\n\n504.\n\nPursuant to the Court of Appeal Judgment, on September 8, 2017, the Claimants filed a modification of the amount of the claim relating to those loans, considering the nationality of the Claimants at the time they were made. The Claimants asserted, at that time, \"*that any loan existing prior to December 31, 2004 was made without the protection of the Treaty*\" and that, therefore, \"*the Claimants' protected claim for this concept is reduced to Bs. 73.7 million, or US$ 17.1 million.*862 According to the Claimants' First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment,863 this reduction was maintained after the Court of Cassation Judgment.\n\nClaimants' Statement of September 8, 2018, \u00b643.\n\nClaimants' First Brief on the Court of Cassation Judgment, \u00b618.\n\n505.\n\nIn the analysis of the possible admission of the alleged loans in the amount of compensation, it is important to determine who bore the burden of proof. The Respondent ignored the Tribunal's order to exhibit the documents referred to in Application No. 4 of the Redfern Panel, an exhibit that could have dispelled the Respondent's alleged doubts. The Respondent's attitude in that regard should be subject to reproach and, under certain conditions, its conduct would allow it to reverse the burden of proof on the Respondent. As Professor Born points out:\n\n*Indeed, there is no serious basis for doubt as to arbitrators' power to draw adverse evidentiary inferences, including as a consequence of a party's refusal to comply with a valid disclosure order. This authority is a fundamental aspect of the arbitrators' adjudicative mandate and is subsumed within the tribunal's general authority over the admission and assessment of evidence. Before drawing adverse inferences, tribunals often require showing that (a) the requesting party itself produced material evidence relating to the disputed issue, (b) the non-produced evidence could have been produced by the non-producing party, (c) the requested inference to be drawn from the non-production of evidence is reasonable, supported by prima facie evidence and consistent with the evidentiary record, and (d) the on-producing party was aware of the possibilities of adverse inference. Although useful guidelines, in some cases these criteria are applied in an unrealistic fashion which approaches a denial of justice. Part of the explanation for such decision may lie in differing attitudes towards the disclosure process, rather than in any rational assessment of the probative effect of non-production of material documents: arbitrators who are skeptical regarding the value and legitimacy of disclosure may translate that attitude into decisions regarding the consequences of noncompliance with disclosure orders. This approach neglects the logical and common sense probative value of a party's deliberate withhold of material evidence, and even more so the deliberate noncompliance with a disclosure order: in these circumstances, both common sense and basic justice require a tribunal to draw negative inferences about the contents of those documents. [\u2026] Where a party violates a disclosure order \u2013 thereby also violating its promise to arbitrate and its obligations to cooperate in good faith in the arbitral process \u2013 it is not merely appropriate but necessary as a matter of justice that the probative consequences of this breach be drawn.*864\n\nBorn, Gary. *International Commercial Arbitration*. Vol. II. Wolters Kluwer, 2014, pp. 2391-2393.\n\n506.\n\nHowever, the Court is of the opinion that, in order to reverse the burden of proof, the presence of *prima facie* evidence that the facts alleged actually occurred is indispensable. In the present case, the Claimants' evidence was not convincing, in the Tribunal's view, to prove the actual existence of the loans. Neither a breakdown of the amounts claimed, with an indication of the dates and individual amounts of the loans, nor proof of the bank transfers or bank activity that would normally have existed, nor a current account that might have existed between the alleged creditor and debtor, was presented. In the Tribunal's opinion, there is no documentary evidence that would allow it to establish a debit and credit relationship between those parties, with a minimum of probability.\n\n507.\n\nThe witness evidence could have made up for that lack, but it failed to do so. The Tribunal carefully reviewed the statements of the accountants Mr. Ariza and Mr. P\u00e9rez at the hearing on August 2 and 3, 2016, to verify whether there was any logical explanation for the item \"Accounts payable to shareholders\" to be Bs. 26.2 million in the balance sheet prepared by the accountant Ariza dated January 25, 2010, of Bs. 106.6 million in the consolidated balance sheet prepared by the accountant P\u00e9rez on February 10, 2016, and, of Bs. 87.2 million in the second balance sheet prepared by the accountant Ariza on April 20, 2010. The responses of witnesses865 did not convince the Tribunal that the accounting records of the item \"Accounts Payable to Shareholders\" in the balance sheets prepared by them had the necessary credibility.\n\n\"THE RESPONDENT (Mr. Gosis): On the long-term liability side are these accounts payable to shareholders. Is that correct?  \nWITNESS (Mr. Ariza Mart\u00ednez): Yes.  \nTHE RESPONDENT (Mr. Gosis): And here it appeared, in the previous version, quantified as 87.252.431 bolivars.  \nWITNESS (Mr. Ariza Mart\u00ednez): Yes.  \nTHE RESPONDENT (Mr. Gosis): And here it appears as 26.252.431. Right?  \nWITNESS (Mr. Ariza Mart\u00ednez): Yes, sir.  \nTHE RESPONDENT (Mr. Gosis): These are two balance sheets audited by your company for the same company for the same period, prepared 60 days apart, I believe, one is signed on April 20 and the other is signed in January. Is that correct?  \nWITNESS (Mr. Ariza Mart\u00ednez): Yes, sir.  \nTHE RESPONDENT (Mr. Gosis): Did you change the counter in the middle?  \nWITNESS (Mr. Ariza Mart\u00ednez): No, the accountant didn't change.  \nTHE RESPONDENT (Mr. Gosis): Did the balance change in the environment?  \nWITNESS (Mr. Ariza Mart\u00ednez): When I began my explanation of my work there, one of the things I said was that financial statements were sometimes presented at different times. That is to say, it is possible that the balance of which the doctor speaks to me, signed in April could have gone to a bank and this could have been and gone to another bank. But I'm going to explain what the fundamental difference is. I request that you allow me to file an income tax return for the year ended December 31, 2009, and I think I can explain your question much better there.  \nTHE RESPONDENT (Mr. Gosis): I don't know if I understood what you're saying, but I'm sure that if it has any relevance to the Claimant in your Redirect they will lend you that document and let you do that exercise, but I don't even know what document you're asking for.  \nWITNESS (Mr. Ariza Mart\u00ednez): I am asking you for the final tax return as of December 31, 2009 of the company Alimentos Frisa.  \nPRESIDENT OF THE TRIBUNAL: For what purpose, sir...?  \nWITNESS (Mr. Ariza Mart\u00ednez): The purpose is as follows, Mr. President. It is that I am observing that this report of which the doctor speaks, was elaborated by me on January 25. And this is certain, very certain, totally certain, that this is a cut of account to that exercise, it is not the definitive closing of the exercise. How can I...? Yeah, but I want to show him how. Because in the Income Tax Declaration surely, I'm totally sure, was made after that date. I want to explain the following. In Venezuela for companies whose fiscal periods are January 1-December 31, the Income Tax Law allows you to file your tax returns and final results by March 31 of the following year. It is common practice that every company takes all the space -it does not necessarily have to take it all, but it takes enough space- to reconcile, to close the numbers as they should be, to be able to manifest the sales that are, the purchases that are, the real costs that are. And of course, when the first closing on 31 December occurs, several partial closures may occur before reaching that definitive closing, which runs until 31 March of the following year. That is to say, today I could have a closing... a second closing or pre-closing -because it is not a closing, we call it with its appropriate name-, I can have a second pre-closing, and at that moment a bank asks me for it, the bank is not going to wait until the end of the fiscal year to give it the definitive number, we have to liquidate a credit. A preliminary report is then submitted to that closure. If we looked for and could grant me, I don't know, who can here in this room the income tax return for fiscal year December 31, 2009, I am absolutely sure that the closing was made after January and before April, which is the one you are comparing.\" Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 185;29-31, 188:1-28, 1-31;129.\n\n508.\n\nFaced with this, considering the absence of sufficient evidence of the alleged credit relationship between Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas and Alimentos Frisa, the Tribunal concludes that it is not appropriate to recognize the existence of the loans claimed.\n\n**5. Security deposits**\n------------------------\n\n509.\n\nIn their Statement of Claim, the Claimants argued that \"*Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas has also lost the amounts advanced as a security deposit to Alimentos Frisa suppliers in order to import the merchandise, which amounted to US$ 86.6 million as of May 2010*\". They also explained that \"*Alimentos Frisa could not freely access foreign currency in order to make purchases of its merchandise abroad, but had to obtain an authorization to purchase foreign currency from the Foreign Currency Administration Commission (CADIVI)*\"; that authorizations to purchase foreign currency should be obtained prior to the shipment of the goods being imported; and that, *\"Once the merchandise arrived at the port and was verified by CADIVI's Customs Verification Office, Alimentos Frisa could ask CADIVI for the liquidation of the foreign currency authorized for that import*\". Only after completing this procedure, Alimentos Frisa \"*transferred to the supplier of goods abroad the corresponding currencies for the payment of the import.* [...] *After the takeover of the Companies, the foreign currency pending payment to suppliers by virtue of authorizations approved by CADIVI remained unliquidated by CADIVI*\".866\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b681.\n\n510.\n\nIn its Statement of Defense, the Respondent argued that the Claimants have not proved the existence of damage and that there is no causal link between the hypothetical damage and the actions that resulted in the Respondent's takeover of Alimentos Frisa.867 It also argued that the payment settlement statements issued by the Claimants' suppliers, produced by companies related to Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, were not credible. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent further added that the letters from suppliers were fraudulent and showed signs of counterfeiting.868\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6339-372.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6152-208.\n\n511.\n\nThe Respondent did not deny that obtaining CADIVI's foreign exchange depended on regulatory procedures as a condition for payment of imports by Alimentos Frisa, nor did the Respondent refute or justify CADIVI's failure to provide foreign exchange concerning the imports identified in the list submitted by the Claimants. Nor did the Respondent question the authenticity of the invoices identified in the list, their accuracy, or the arguments related to CADIVI's actions.\n\n512.\n\nIn items 12, 22 and 23 of the Redfern Table, the Claimants requested the exhibition of 155 CADIVI's files that would be in the Respondent's possession, which, once provided, would demonstrate that the payments to the suppliers were not made by CADIVI and, therefore, that the security deposits were withheld by the suppliers.869 In its objections, the Respondent objected to exhibiting the documents on the ground that a principle of proof would be lacking to justify it. After analyzing the arguments of the Parties, the Tribunal ordered that such documents be filed,870 but only part of them were brought into the proceeding by the Respondent, with the documents referred to in Applications Nos. 12, 22 and 23 of the Schedule missing without reasonable justification.\n\nProcedural Order No. 6 of April 29, 2015.\n\nProcedural Order No. 6 of April 29, 2015.\n\n513.\n\nIn their comments on the Court of Appeal Judgment, the Claimants informed that the security deposits correspond in their entirety to operations carried out by Alimentos Frisa in 2008 and 2009, when Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas had already recovered his Spanish nationality and, therefore, it would not be necessary to update the value of that part of the claim.871 The Respondent did not comment on that aspect.\n\nClaimants' Statement of September 8, 2017, \u00b644.\n\n514.\n\nIn their additional comments with respect to the Chilean Judgment, the Claimants asserted that the Respondent did not identify any Alimentos Frisa's transactions that were affected by its allegations of illegality, nor did it address which part of the Claimants' damages calculation was allegedly affected.872\n\nClaimants' Statement of March 3, 2018, \u00b676.\n\n515.\n\nWith respect to the Chilean Judgment, the Respondent argued that Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas would maintain an illicit activity through the alleged Chilean suppliers MSM Chile and Benipaula Chile and, therefore, that \"*the judicial determination has as its immediate effect the elimination of the calculation of damages, however imprecise and unreliable, that may be related to these alleged 'suppliers*'\".873\n\nRespondent's Statement of February 14, 2018, \u00b669.\n\n516.\n\nIn the analysis of the relevant documents, the Tribunal has verified that each request made to CADIVI was identified by its number, the number and date of the request for foreign exchange, the products covered by each invoice, the amount of each invoice and the bank that should make the payment, totaling US$ 86,638,369.54. Likewise, the Tribunal observed that, according to CADIVI's Ruling No. 89, the liquidation of foreign currency for the import of the products listed in Annex C-115 depended on CADIVI authorizing it to the banks, after verifying the entry of the goods.874 In addition, the Tribunal also noted that the Respondent did not deny that the goods were imported into Venezuela, nor that CADIVI did not authorize the payment of those imports.\n\nCADIVI Ruling No. 089 of July 31, 2008, published in Gazette No. 38.987 of August 5, 2008 (**Exhibit C-89**).\n\n517.\n\nThe elements mentioned in the preceding paragraph lead the Tribunal to conclude that (i) the goods described in the CADIVI listing were imported as authorized by the competent control body;875 (ii) the goods entered Venezuela and were received by Alimentos Frisa, a fact alleged by the Claimants and not contested by the Respondent; and (iii) the goods were not paid for through the currency settlement system in force in Venezuela, a fact also alleged by the Claimants and not contested by the Respondent.876\n\nClaimants' Letter of May 11, 2015; Listing of Unliquidated CADIVI Applications (**Exhibit C-115**).\n\nLetters from suppliers of Alimentos Frisa, C.A. to Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (**Exhibit C-117**).\n\n518.\n\nThus, the Tribunal considers that the import of the goods, the respective prices and CADIVI's authorization for the acquisition of foreign currency to pay for them have been verified. Even though no documents were presented by Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas to settle the invoices, by means of a money order or a letter of credit, the suppliers recognized that the goods purchased by Alimentos Frisa were paid and that the Company no longer owed them anything.877 In this case, the Tribunal considers the existence of the security deposits to have been proven on the basis of the balance of probabilities standard, according to which \"*it is sufficient that the judge is able to admit with sufficient probability the existence and extent of the damage*\".878\n\nLetters from suppliers of Alimentos Frisa, C.A. to Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer (**Exhibit C-117**).\n\n\"On the contrary, when such proof is impossible, particularly as a result of the behavior of the author of the damage, it is enough for the judge to be able to admit with sufficient probability the existence and extent of the damage.\" *Sapphire International Petroleum, Ltd. c. National Iranian Oil Co*., Award, March 15, 1963, p. 54 (**Exhibit CLA-124**).\n\n519.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent refused to file the accounting books of the Companies that were in its possession, which the Respondent itself has not denied. The books were located in the offices of Alimentos Frisa, in a location precisely identified by the Claimants, a fact that the Respondent did not dispute.879 If the Respondent had exhibited the books of Alimentos Frisa, a documentary verification could be made as to whether the invoices of the suppliers had been paid. By not bringing them to the proceeding, the Respondent allowed it to be reasonably inferred, based on the other circumstantial elements, that the payments were not recorded in the books. From that circumstance, the letters from the suppliers, confirming the amounts of each invoice, the description of the goods and the respective creditors, allow us to deduce that Alimentos Frisa did not liquidate them and, consequently, Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas' claim that he made the payments in its place is credible and acceptable for the purposes of this Arbitration.\n\nProcedural Order No. 6 of April 29, 2015, item 4.\n\n520.\n\nHaving generally accepted the claim, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to make some particular observations.\n\n521.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider the documentation submitted in the Dibicer case to be sufficient, because the note of April 15, 2015 is inconsistent with the cessation of activities of that company in 2012880 and with the fact that Mr. Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez, a signatory on behalf of Dibicer, did not appear in the corporate documents of that company as its administrator.881\n\nDibicer file (**Exhibit R-68**)\n\nBanco Nacional de Cr\u00e9dito v. Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda (**Exhibit R-66**)\n\n522.\n\nIn a similar vein, Agr\u00edcola Riachuelo did not respond to the request sent to it to confirm payment of Alimentos Frisa's debt, so, in the absence of convincing proof that his invoices have been settled, it is not possible to accept Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas' assertion that he would have paid them.\n\n523.\n\nIn the cases of Benipaula Inc., Calcar, Dole Chile, Seven Stars, Benipaula S.A. and MSM, the declarations submitted by the suppliers do not contain defects that raise relevant doubts as to their veracity, in addition to being consistent with the discrimination of the goods and the respective values included in CADIVI's list of imports. The argument that Benipaula Inc. is owned by Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas, or that the statements of Seven Stars, Benipaula S.A. and MSM have been signed by a front man of him, or even that some of the statements have the same date and appearance, are of a merely formal nature, insufficient to doubt the effects of their material content.\n\n524.\n\nBased on the foregoing, it is recognized that, on the date of expropriation, Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas was a creditor of Alimentos Frisa by virtue of the security deposits granted to its suppliers: Benipaula Inc. for US$ 10.420,441.90, Calcar for US$ 1,906,560.40, Dole Chile for US$ 164,736.00, Seven Stars for US$ 11,116,740.48, Benipaula S.A. for US$ 10,853,307.42 and MSM for US$ 41,215,607.74, for a total of US$ 75,677,393.94. On the contrary and based on the above, the Tribunal rejects the security deposits allegedly granted by Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas to suppliers Dibicer S.A. for US$ 10,471,660.80 and Agr\u00edcola Riachuelo for US$ 537,840.00, totaling US$ 11,009,500.80. Consequently, the Tribunal determines the amount of US$ 75,677,393.94 as the compensation owed by the Respondent to Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas for the security deposits rendered by him to Alimentos Frisa's suppliers.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**CHAPTER X. INTEREST**\n-----------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n525.\n\nThe Claimants submit that interest is an essential component of reparation,882 which is part of full compensation under customary international law, including the appropriate rate and its capitalization.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6192; Memorial Following Claimants' Hearing, \u00b6\u00b6230-232, footnotes 488-495, referring to International Law Commission, \"*Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Illicit Acts, with Comments*\", 2001, art. 38 (**Exhibit CLA-66**): *Siemens A.G. v.

Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/5, Award, September 23, 2003, \u00b6380 (**Exhibit CLA-71**).\n\n527.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the interest calculation proposed by the Claimants is as follows:\n\n(a) The Claimants consider that, in order to obtain full reparation for the damage, the applicable interest rate must be equivalent to the return that the Claimants would have obtained from their investment in Venezuela in a counterfactual scenario, *i.e.*, the opportunity cost of their capital.885 The Claimants note that this standard of application has previously been adopted by the tribunal in *Vivendi v. Argentina*, among others.886 That tribunal calculated the pre-award interest on the basis of the claimant's cost of capital, while stressing that the cost of capital constitutes \"*a reasonable approximation of the return that the Claimants might otherwise have obtained on the amounts invested and lost\".*887 In addition, the Claimants argue that case law and doctrine have established that a LIBOR rate does not meet the standard of full compensation888 and that the interest rate should not be less than the cost of Venezuela's debt in international markets, otherwise it would be encouraged to continue expropriating without compensation.889 Thus, in a counterfactual scenario, the Claimants state that they would have invested their funds in a business with a risk profile similar to that of Alimentos Frisa that would guarantee a return at least equivalent to its cost of capital of 12.7%.890 Mr. Dellepiane updates the amount of compensation from the Valuation Date to the date of his report, *i.e.* May 25, 2015, using the cost of Alimentos Frisa's own capital as the updating index at a rate of 12.7%.891 In the event that the Respondent does not immediately pay the Tribunal's Award, the Claimants would be entitled to interest from the date of the award until the date of actual payment, on the same terms as the interest prior to the award, at the cost of capital rate of 12.7%.892\n\n(b) The Claimants criticize the principle of mitigation of damages used by the Respondent, as it confuses this principle with the opportunity cost. For the Claimants, the Respondent's approach does not satisfy the reasonableness test applied by the investment tribunals.893\n\n(c) With respect to the capitalization of interest, the Claimants indicate that the interest prior to the award must be compound, because they ensure that the host State will not receive an extraordinary gain as a result of the violation, since their capitalization recognizes the time value of the Claimant's losses.894 They further note that pre- and post-award interest should be capitalized at a reasonable frequency and on an annual basis.895 Thus, they reject the Respondent's opposition to the payment of compound interest on the grounds that, under customary international law, a State cannot invoke its domestic law, as the Respondent claims, to excuse itself from fulfilling its international obligations.896\n\n(d) According to the Claimants, interest should accrue from the date of the wrongful act until the date of full payment, contrary to what the Respondent claims, because that is the current and almost universal practice.897 In addition, interest must be calculated at the same cost of capital rate and898 capitalized annually, in accordance with the principle of full reparation.899\n\n(e) The compensation must be net of tax, a principle that has recently been confirmed by the tribunal in the case of *Phillips Petroleum Company and another v. PDVSA.*900\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6195; Reply, \u00b6377; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6233, footnote 496; Second Report of Mr. Dellepiane, \u00b6\u00b6137-138; J.

In that case, the arbitral tribunal calculated interest on the basis of a free risk rate plus a market risk premium, adjusted for the risks involved in investing in Ukraine. In developed economies, the cost of capital equals the risk-free rate plus a market risk premium. In emerging economies, on the other hand, the country risk premium must be added to this.

The Respondent's arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n528.\n\nThe Respondent considers that there has been no breach of the Treaty that may entail the payment of compensation by the Respondent. However, if the Tribunal finds that there is an obligation to pay compensation, Venezuela objects to the interest rate sought by the Claimants, considering it unfounded901 and disproportionate,902 based on the following grounds:\n\n(a) The principle of full compensation does not imply assuming unbearable risks. The Respondent explains that the Claimants' interpretation of this principle, understanding that it includes recognition of an interest rate equivalent to the return they would have obtained from investing compensation money in a risk business similar to Alimentos Frisa's, is erroneous from an economic and legal standpoint:\n\na. From an economic perspective, Dr. Flores explains that the application of the cost of own resources is incorrect, since the opportunity cost of capital includes a return that offsets the investment risk, but this risk, associated with the uncertain future of the Claimants' investments, would have been eliminated by calculating the compensation at the date of the alleged wrongdoing.903 Therefore, the Respondent considers that the appropriate rate for the calculation of interest is the yield on the 6-month or 1-year U.S. Treasury bond.904\n\nb. From a legal perspective, such compensation results in the doubling of the compensation claimed at the time of the Claim, which continues to increase exponentially every day.905 According to the Respondent, interest could not be computed until the moment the Tribunal renders an award906 and, alternatively, if the Tribunal were to consider awarding interest, the date of commencement of its computation would be the date of the Notice of Arbitration, *i.e.*, \"*January 27, 2012*\" [sic].907\n\n(b) Investment arbitration tribunals are more likely to apply a commercial interest rate or one equivalent to the yield on government bonds than a rate similar to the opportunity cost.908\n\n(c) The Claimants did not prove the existence of an alternative investment opportunity, but merely assert that \"*if they had received the compensation at the Valuation Date, they would have reinvested it in a risk investment similar to that of the Companies*\". According to the Respondent, the lack of evidence should lead to the dismissal of the claim in question.909\n\n(d) The Claimants have breached their duty to mitigate damages, which is a general principle of law, as recognized by multiple arbitral tribunals.910\n\n(e) The Claimants failed to demonstrate that they had turned to external financing to reduce the damage resulting from not having the amount of compensation on the date of the Respondent's alleged wrongful act and, therefore, the Tribunal must reject the claim.911\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6238, footnote 559, referring to Franklin M.

They are also due when, by mutual agreement, or by judicial condemnation, the balance of accounts is established, including accrued interest\".

The Respondent considers it abusive to seek to compensate the Claimants for the delay of nearly two years in seeking compensation. The Respondent relies on the decision of the court of *CME v. Czech Republic*922 and on the opinion of Prof. Ripinsky.923\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6420, referring to *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. The Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Final Award, March 14, 2003, **\u00b6\u00b6630**, 631 (**Exhibit CLA-69**).\n\nSergey Ripinsky and Kevin Williams, *Damages in International Investment Law*, p. 337 (**Exhibit RLA-135**).\n\n532.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent points out that Venezuelan law provides for the date of the first claim as the date of commencement of interest accrual.924\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6423, referring to Article 1269 of the Venezuelan Civil Code, which states: \"If the obligation is to give or to do, the debtor is in default only for the expiration of the time period established in the convention. If the term expires after the debtor's death, the heir will not be in default, but by an injunction or other equivalent act; and, only eight days after the injunction. If no time limit is set in the convention, the debtor is not in default but by an injunction or other equivalent act.\"\n\n533.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent submits that the specific features of this case lead to the *dies a quo* being January 27, 2012, the date on which compensation for the alleged breaches was first requested.925\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6424.\n\n**C. Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n534.\n\nIn their Statement of Claim, the Claimants submitted that, in addition to the compensation to be paid by the Respondent, interest should be added at a rate equivalent to the return that the Claimants would have obtained from their investment in Venezuela, in a counterfactual scenario \u2013 that is, the \"*opportunity cost of their capital,*\" as well as that \"*the compensation due to Mr. Garc\u00eda Armas and Ms. Garc\u00eda Gruber should also be updated considering the opportunity cost of their capital*\".926 Based on this reasoning, they proposed the use of an annual rate of 12.7%, which would supposedly reflect the opportunity cost of their capital.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6198.\n\n535.\n\nIn its Statement of Defense, the Respondent argued that \"*there is no support from case law for the application of the cost-of-capital rate as an interest rate,*\" and that the Tribunal should grant the Claimants, if any, the right to \"*interest fixed at a risk-free interest rate that remunerates only the loss of value of money over time*\"*.*927 In its Rejoinder, the Respondent asserted that its expert \"*considers that the yield on the 6-month or 1-year U.S. Treasury bond is an appropriate rate for calculating interest.*928\n\nStatement of Defense, \u00b6402.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6686.\n\n536.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the calculation of interest in investment arbitrations has not been treated uniformly. A significant number of recent arbitral awards have adopted the LIBOR reference rate, increased by a margin of between 2% and 4% per annum.929 Some courts have adopted fixed percentages, between 4.5% and 10.55% per annum,930 and a few used the U.S. Treasury Bond rate.931 With regard to the capitalization period, the tendency of investment arbitration tribunals has been to adopt annual, half-yearly or quarterly periods as the basis for compound interest.\n\n*Gold Reserve Inc v.

The Republic of Argentina*, ICSID Case ARB/07/31, Award, December 21, 2016.\n\n537.\n\nIn light of that history, the Tribunal considers the 12.7% annual interest rate sought by the Claimants to be excessive. To base it on the cost of Alimentos Frisa's own capital would lead to an optimal return on its capital without any entrepreneurial risk, leading to a profit inconsistent with the objective of remedying damages, albeit broadly.\n\n538.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal finds that an interest rate equivalent to the yield on U.S. Treasury Bonds, as the Respondent claims, would be insufficient to compensate the investment of which the Claimants have been deprived since the date of the Respondent's indirect expropriation. In addition, an investment in U.S. Treasury Bonds is the lowest risk in the global financial market, which is not the case with an investment in Venezuela, whose risk was significantly higher.\n\n539.\n\nThe interest must apply from the date of the expropriation \u2013 *i.e.* May 20, 2010 \u2013 and not since the notice of arbitration, as claimed by the Respondent. This is so because the expropriation in question violated elementary rules of the Treaty and international law, as well as Venezuelan national law, by taking control of the Companies without observing the expropriation procedure and by liquidating their economic activities without any compensation to their previous owners. The Respondent's conduct violated the concept of the FET, which justifies the obligation to make full reparation for the losses incurred by the Claimants from the time the wrongful act was committed, *i.e.*, the time of the takeover of the Companies.\n\n540.\n\nDifferent arbitral tribunals faced similar cases, adopting the principle of full reparation to fix the initial term of interest on the date of the wrongful act, as long as the expropriation was shown to be illegal. Cases like *Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. Republic of Ecuador*932 and *BG Group Plc. v. Argentine Republic,*933 among others, are paradigms that cannot be ignored in the context of investment arbitrations in Latin America. Likewise, the specialized doctrine recognizes the *dies a quo* for the computation of interest934 as the date of an illegal expropriation, as adopted in *Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic.*935\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corp. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, October 5, 2012, \u00b6829 (**Exhibit CLA-113**).\n\n*BG Group Plc. v. Argentine Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, December 24, 2007, \u00b6457 (**Exhibit CLA-90**).\n\nP. Bienvenu & M. Valasek, \"Compensation for Unlawful Expropriation and Other Recent Manifestations of the Principle of Full Reparation in International Investment Law\", in Van Den Berg, AJ (ed), *50 Years of the New York Convention: ICCA International Arbitration Conference (2009)*, 14 ICCA Congress Series 231, Exhibit CLA-97, \u00b6261.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/08/8, February 6, 2007, \u00b6397 (**Exhibit CLA-86**).\n\n541.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal adopts the twelve-month LIBOR rate, increased by 4.5% per annum, as the compound interest rate to be applied prior to this Arbitration award, as of May 20, 2010. Based on the data published by the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)936 regarding the LIBOR rate for 12 months in the relevant periods, the Tribunal adopts the index 1.1278, to which is added the composite spread from May 20, 2010 until and even February 2019, reaching the index 1.6691.\n\nData available at: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/US$12MD156N (accessed on January 11, 2019).\n\n542.\n\nThe form of calculation will apply both to interest prior to the Award and, in the event of the Respondent's delay in complying with the Award, in both cases capitalizing on an annual basis. In the event that the LIBOR rate ceases to be published by the agency in charge of supervising it, the rate reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to replace it shall be adopted for the period following that fact.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**CHAPTER XI. THE ARBITRATION COSTS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' arguments**\n-------------------------------\n\n543.\n\nThe Claimants, invoking Articles 38 and 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, as well as decisions in accordance with these provisions,937 argue that the defeated party should pay the costs, which include the following items: (a) fees of the arbitral tribunal, (b) expenses of the arbitral tribunal, (c) expert advice, (d) expenses of witnesses, and (f) expenses of the administering institution.938\n\nThe Claimants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b63-5, footnotes 3-4, referring to *Gemplus SA and others c.

The Respondent's arguments**\n---------------------------------\n\n550.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction and that, in the absence of any international liability in light of the conduct of the Claimants, it is justified that the Claimants should face the costs of the proceedings.977\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b61-5, footnotes 1-2, referring to Procedural Order No. 8 (Amended), \u00b6\u00b62.7, 45.\n\n551.\n\nThe Respondent invokes Articles 38 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which it considers applicable in the absence of rules on the allocation of costs of arbitration in the Treaty,978 to affirm that the Tribunal is competent to fix the costs of arbitration in the award.979 For this purpose, as held by arbitral tribunals in relation to article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, it states that the Tribunal must take into account the circumstances of the case as the \"*sole guide*\" when exercising its discretion in this regard.980 Such factors include, according to the Respondent, \"*the existence of frivolous, excessive, and unreasonable claims, the conduct of the parties, and the obstruction of the parties during the process*\".981 Thus, the Respondent argues that it is justified to allocate the costs of arbitration exclusively to the Claimants,982 particularly in light of the unreasonableness and frivolity of the Claimants' claims, as well as their \"*abusive, fraudulent and obstructive conduct during the arbitral proceedings.*983\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b66, 13, footnote 3, referring to *Dunkeld International Investment Ltd. v.

Arab Republic of Egypt*, submits that the Claimants should pay the full costs of the proceedings, inasmuch as the Respondent has been forced, as a State, to participate in a proceeding over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction and in which, in addition to the absence of international liability, the Claimants have filed a claim 150 times higher than the amount of compensable damages, which, in their view, are non-existent and could never, in any event, exceed US$ 6.3 million.984\n\nRespondent's Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b614-19, footnotes 8-16, referring to John Yukio Gotanda*, Awarding Costs and Attorneys' Fees in International Commercial Arbitrations,* in \"21 Michigan Journal of International Law\", 1999, pp. 6-7, (**Exhibit RLA-279**); Post-Hearing Brief, Chapter II, pp. 32-51; *Link-Trading Joint Stock Company c.

Tribunal's analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n556.\n\nThe Tribunal proceeds to decide on the liability for the costs related to this Arbitration, in accordance with Articles 38, 39 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules 1976, applicable to the present arbitral proceedings.\n\n557.\n\nUnder the UNCITRAL Rules, the term \"costs\" includes (a) the fees of the arbitral tribunal, (b) travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators, (c) the cost of expert advice or of any other type of assistance provided by the arbitral tribunal, (d) the representation and assistance costs of the lawyers of the prevailing party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceeding, (e) travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators, (f) any fees and expenses of the appointing authority, as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\n558.\n\nUnder the same rules, in principle, the costs of arbitration (other than the cost of representation) shall be borne by the defeated party, but the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of the elements of these costs between the parties if it decides that apportionment is reasonable under the circumstances of the case.993 With respect to the cost of representation and legal assistance, the arbitral tribunal shall decide, taking into account the circumstances of the case, which party shall pay such cost, or may apportion it among the parties if it decides that the apportionment is reasonable.994\n\nUNCITRAL Rules, art. 40(1).\n\nUNCITRAL Rules, art. 40(2).\n\n559.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal emphasizes that Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules gives the Tribunal discretion to decide on costs. The Tribunal also notes that there is a distinction between the first and second paragraphs of that Article.995 Indeed, Article 40(1) establishes the general principle that the costs of arbitration (except for the costs of legal representation under Article 38(e)) shall be borne by the defeated party. While a court may deviate from that general rule when the circumstances of the case indicate that this would be reasonable, the Tribunal anticipates that, in the present case, there is no justifiable reason to deviate from the general rule. Accordingly, it will impose all of the costs mentioned in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) of Article 38 on the defeated party, that is, on the Respondent.\n\nEuropean American Investment Bank AG v. the Slovak Republic, PCA Case No. 2010-17, Award on Costs, \u00b640.\n\n560.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal also anticipates that it will order the Respondent to pay the Claimants' attorneys' representation and assistance costs.\n\n561.\n\nThere are two reasons which lead the Tribunal to the above conclusions. First, that the Claimants have substantially prevailed in this Arbitration, both in the discussion of the Tribunal's jurisdiction and in the merits of the dispute. Second, the Respondent's conduct in this Arbitration.\n\n562.\n\nAs Caron and Caplan have pointed out,\n\n*the conduct of a party during the arbitral proceedings is another potential factor for consideration when apportioning and awarding costs. Tribunals, for example, have awarded costs to a party as 'estimated compensation' for expenses incurred as a direct resolute of another party's conduct that was frivolous, in bad faith, or unnecessarily burdensome. As described by one arbitral tribunal, this practice 'serves the dual function of reparation and dissuasion'. Apportionment based on the conduct of the parties has occurred under a variety of circumstances: [\u2026] a respondent's failure to produce documents requested by the tribunal, [\u2026] a respondent's attempt to reargue a previously decided jurisdictional question, a respondent's delay by making unfounded allegations of forgery* [...].996\n\nDavid D. Caron y Lee M. Caplan, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary* (2da ed.), Oxford, 2013, p. 871-872 (**Exhibit CLA-225**).\n\n563.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal has noted with concern the Respondent's repeated refusal to make the deposits requested by the PCA, in accordance with the CNDUMI Rules and the Treaty; the failure to disclose documents from the Redfern Table ordered by the Tribunal; and the Respondent's multiple requests for review, nullity, allegations of fraud, challenges, and incidences that, taken together, unduly affected the regular conduct of this Arbitration, significantly increasing its costs and duration.\n\n564.\n\nIndeed, during the Arbitration, the Respondent filed no less than four motions to challenge the members of the Tribunal, all of which were rejected by the PCA Secretary General; on November 12, 2017, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to suspend the proceedings; on August 9, 2018, the Respondent again requested the suspension of the Arbitration; and on December 17, 2018 and again on January 15, 2019, the Respondent again requested the suspension of the proceedings. In so doing, the Respondent has exceeded the limits of the legitimate exercise of its rights of defense, engaging in repeated delaying practices that have adversely affected the normal course of this Arbitration proceeding.\n\n565.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that, even if some of the Claimants' claims were rejected, in whole or in part, the Respondent shall bear the full costs of this Arbitration, which are detailed as follows.\n\n566.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings, the Parties deposited with the PCA a total of EUR 2,350,000 (half of which would correspond to each Party, but the Claimants deposited the full amount) to cover the costs of the Arbitration.\n\n567.\n\nThe expenses and fees of the Tribunal were as follows: EUR 402,375.00 in fees and EUR 14,522.83 in expenses of arbitrator Rodrigo Oreamuno Blanco; EUR 531,512.67 in fees and EUR 29,780.31 in expenses for Prof. Guido Tawil; and EUR 946,946.04 in fees and EUR 34,336.82 in expenses for President Eduardo Grebler. The fees of the PCA for registration and secretarial services in this Arbitration amount to EUR 218,778.92 in fees and EUR 1,862.22 in expenses. Other costs of the Arbitration, including stenography, interpretation, hearing and meeting rooms, travel, teleconferencing, bank charges and all other costs relating to the proceedings amount to EUR 91,997.04. The total amount of the Arbitration costs is EUR 2,273,111.85.\n\n568.\n\nThis leaves an unused balance on deposit with the PCA of EUR 76,888.15, which will be promptly returned by the PCA to the Claimants by bank transfer.\n\n569.\n\nIn their Second Submission on Costs of January 14, 2019, the Claimants reported total expenses of US$ 7,267,953.06 and EUR 2,194,893, including (i) the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the PCA (EUR 2,150,000); (ii) attorneys' fees and expenses (US$ 6,439.704.23 plus US$ 60,866.27); (iii) fees and expenses of experts and technical advisors (US$ 352,416.15 with Compass Lexecon, US$ 140,720.15 with Berkeley Research Group, US$ 210,746.26 with Michael Seelhof, EUR 32,893 with Pierre Mayer, EUR 12,000 with Andrea Pinna); and (iv) US$ 63,500 in other costs.\n\n570.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimants' legal and expert representation expenses are reasonable in light of the relevant circumstances of the present case, the amounts in dispute, the complexity of the legal and factual issues at stake, the size of the briefs filed, the number of procedural issues that arose, and other circumstances.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n**CHAPTER XII. DECISION**\n-------------------------\n\n571.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, in light of the petitions made respectively by each Party, set forth in CHAPTER III *above*, the Tribunal, by unanimity of its members:\n\n(a) Finds that the Respondent has violated the Treaty and international law, as a result of the following:\n\n(i) It unlawfully expropriated the Claimants' investments, in violation of Article V of the Treaty;\n\n(ii) It failed to accord the Claimants' investments fair and equitable treatment in violation of Article IV of the Treaty;\n\n(iii) It failed to comply with the prohibition in Article III of the Treaty, which obliges it not to adopt arbitrary measures;\n\n(b) Orders the Respondent to compensate the Claimants for the indirect expropriation of their shares in the Companies, in the following amounts:\n\n(i) For Mr. Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas, the value of 3,560,000 shares owned by him in the capital stock of Alimentos Frisa, in the amount of **US$ 99,677,396.88** (ninety-nine million, six hundred and seventy-seven thousand, three hundred and ninety-six U.S. dollars and eighty-eight cents);\n\n(ii) For Ms. Karina Garc\u00eda Gruber, the value of 1,389,200 shares owned by her in both Companies, consisting of 1,190,000 shares of Alimentos Frisa and 199,200 shares of Transporte Dole, in the amount of **US$ 38,896,584.20** (thirty-eight million, eight hundred and ninety-six thousand, five hundred and eighty-four U.S. dollars and twenty cents);\n\n(c) Orders the Respondent to compensate Mr. Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas for the value that corresponds to the security deposits granted to the merchandise suppliers of Alimentos Frisa, in the amount of US$ 75,677,393.94 (seventy-five million, six hundred seventy-seven thousand, three hundred ninety-three US Dollars and ninety-four cents);\n\n(d) Orders the Respondent to pay the Claimants, on such sums, interest on the 12-month LIBOR rate plus 4,5% per-year, capitalized at each twelve-months period since May 20, 2010, whose value until February 2019 amounted:\n\n(i) for Mr. Seraf\u00edn Garc\u00eda Armas, **US$ 66,696,006.60** (sixty-six million, six hundred and ninety-six thousand and six U.S. dollars and sixty cents) on the amount stipulated in item (b)(i) *above,* plus **US$ 50,637.156.71** (fifty million, six hundred and thirty-seven thousand, one hundred and fifty-six U.S. dollars and seventy-one cents) on the amount stipulated in item (c) *above,* totaling **US$ 117,333,163.31** (one hundred and seventeen million, three hundred and thirty-three thousand, one hundred and sixty-three U.S. dollars and thirty-one cents);\n\n(ii) for Ms. Karina Garc\u00eda Gruber, the amount stipulated in item (b)(ii) *above*, of **US$ 26,026,430.44** (twenty-six million, twenty-six thousand, four hundred and thirty United States dollars and forty-four cents);\n\n(e) Orders the Respondent to compensate the Claimants jointly for the value of the expenses they incurred in the present Arbitration, in the aggregate amount of **US$ 7,267,953.06** (seven million, two hundred and sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred and fifty-three United States dollars and six cents) and **EUR 44,893.00** (forty-four thousand, eight hundred and ninety-three Euros);\n\n(f) Orders the Respondent to cover the total of the sums paid by the Claimant to the PCA, amounting to **EUR 2,273,111,85** (two million, two hundred and seventy-three thousand, a hundred and eleven Euros and eighty-five cents).\n\n572.\n\nIn the event that the Respondent fails to pay the compensation and interest referred to in subparagraphs *above* within thirty days of the issuance of this award, the Respondent shall pay to the Claimants interest at the LIBOR rate for 12 months plus 4.5% per annum on those sums, capitalized at each twelve-month period. In the event that the LIBOR rate ceases to be published by the agency in charge of supervising it, the rate reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to replace it shall be adopted for the period following that fact.\n\n573.\n\nOther requests by the Parties not expressly granted in the operative part of this award are denied.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nSigned on April 26, 2019\n\nArbitral Seat: Paris, France"}]}
