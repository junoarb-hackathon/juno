THE DISPUTE**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nIn 1987 a series of meetings were held between Mr Hesham Alashmawy, a dual citizen of the United States and Egypt, who is Claimant's President, and senior officials of Grand Hotels of Egypt (\" **GHE** \"), a company owned by the Government of Egypt, which at that time owned and managed certain of the country's hotels as well as with the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism. Following these meetings, Mr Alashmawy was invited to inspect existing hotel properties in which the Egyptian Government was seeking foreign investment and various tracts of land that the Government had designated for tourism development or sale.\n\n2.\n\nIn February 1988, Claimant was incorporated in the State of California, and in February 1989, Mr Alashmawy formed the Egyptian American Company for Development and Tourism - H&H Enterprises (\" **H&H Egypt** \"). On 10 April 1989, Mr. Alashmawy made a proposal to GHE for the purchase of the Ain El Sokhna hotel and adjoining land. The proposal, which Claimant alleges was accepted by GHE, and which Claimant therefore says granted it an option to buy the Resort (the \" **Option to Buy** \"), took the form of a one-page letter addressed to the then chairman of GHE.\n\n3.\n\nOn 27 April 1989, Claimant and GHE signed a Management and Operation Contract (the \" **MOC** \"), followed, on 20 November 1989, by an addendum agreed to form an integral part of the MOC.\n\n4.\n\nOn 1 January 1990, Mr. Alashmawy, together with two other individuals, formed an Egyptian partnership - HA&H for Tourism & Resorts (\" **HA&H** \"). In June 1990, Claimant was suspended by the US tax authorities, for failure to pay taxes.\n\n5.\n\nOn 14 October 1993, GHE commenced arbitration against Claimant, in Cairo, under the MOC, seeking, *inter alia*, termination of that agreement for breach. Claimant subsequently filed a series of claims before the local courts. On 22 December 2001, Claimant was evicted from the Resort. On 10 April 2008, eighteen years following its corporate suspension, and eight years after vacating the Resort, Claimant applied to the California Franchise Tax Board for a Certificate of Revivor, enclosing backdated tax returns and cheques covering taxes for the years 1989 to 2007. On 1 May 2008, the California Tax Board granted Claimant a Certificate of Revivor.\n\n6.\n\nOn 17 July 2009, Claimant filed the present ICSID proceedings.\n\n**II. THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 1 and following Respondent's request to extend the time limit to file its Jurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation, Respondent filed its Jurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation on 6 June 2011.\n\n8.\n\nClaimant filed its Response to Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation on 9 September 2011.\n\n9.\n\nOn 15 November 2011, a hearing on bifurcation only was held between the Tribunal and the Parties. Further to the Parties' agreement at the hearing, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 on 22 November 2011, by which it confirmed the Parties' agreement to bifurcate the proceedings into a preliminary jurisdictional phase to be decided by the Tribunal before moving finally to the merits phase. The Tribunal also set forth the remaining procedural steps in the jurisdiction phase.\n\n10.\n\nPursuant to Procedural Order No. 3, Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction on 19 January 2012. Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on 15 March 2012. A hearing on preliminary jurisdictional issues was held between the Tribunal and the Parties on 23, 24 and 25 March 2012.\n\n**III. RATIONE MATERIAE**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n**1. THE OPTION TO BUY DOES NOT EXIST UNDER EGYPTIAN LAW**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The 1989 Option to Buy does not exist under Egyptian Law**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nRespondent submits that the 1989 exchange of letters does not constitute a valid and binding contract under Egyptian law. Respondent argues that to be validly concluded, a contract requires the parties' consent. Egyptian law requires a firm acceptance without alteration of the terms of the offer. Article 89 of the Egyptian Civil Code provides:\n\n*\"A contract is created when two parties exchange exact matching wills, subject to any special formalities that may be required by law for its conclusion\"*.\n\n12.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the correspondence on record does not evidence the Parties' *\"matching will\"*. Respondent also states that Claimant cannot rely on Article 95 of the Egyptian Civil Code, since the essential elements of the alleged Option to Buy, *i.e.*, land and price, were not agreed upon or specified in the Parties' exchange of letters.\n\n13.\n\nMoreover, Respondent submits that the MOC which was entered into between the Parties on 27 April 1989, provides that the MOC is the full agreement between the Parties and any negotiations, correspondence, agreements preceding the conclusion of the MOC should be invalid. Respondent also submits that Article 16.11 of the MOC evidences that the Parties did not consider the purported Option to Buy - allegedly created by the exchange of letters in 1989 and confirmed by the 10 April 1989 letter - to be a valid contract.\n\nArticle 16.1 of the MOC provides:  \n*\"This Contract, along with the attached enclosures and any documents that must be signed and delivered thereunder, shall represent the full agreement between the Proprietor and the Manages with respect to the management and operation of the hotel, and any negotiations, correspondence, documents or agreements thereon that precede this Contract shall be invalid\"*\n\n**(b) Alternatively, the Parties mutually rescinded the Option to Buy**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nRespondent submits that even if the Option to Buy was validly concluded, it was subsequently rescinded by the Parties' conduct following the conclusion of the MOC on 27 April 1989. Respondent further states that in an exchange of letters between April and June 1991, the Parties negotiated the sale of the Resort without mention of any previously concluded Option to Buy. Respondent submits that negotiating the sale of the Resort outside of the purported Option to Buy clearly amounts to an offer to rescind the Option to Buy.\n\n**(c) The conditions precedent to exercise the Option to Buy were not satisfied**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nRespondent submits that the exercise of the Option to Buy was conditional upon the incorporation of a local company with Claimant and Grand Hotels of Egypt (\" **GHE** \") as shareholders, and the exercise of the Option within five years of the incorporation of this company, which was provided for in Claimant's letter of 10 April 1989. According to Respondent these conditions were never met. Respondent further submits that, according to Claimant's own draft of the clause that it suggested be inserted in the MOC, the five-year period would start to run \"after satisfying the required legal form.\" This legal form was never satisfied therefore the conditions could not have been met at the closing.\n\n**(d) The opinion of the minister's state council legal advisor is non-binding on public entities and state courts**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nRespondent states that in order to establish the existence of the Option to Buy, Claimant relies on the opinion issued by the State Council Advisor. Respondent submits that this opinion has no legal effect under Egyptian law and Claimant cannot now rely on it to establish the existence of the purported Option to Buy. Under Egyptian law, advice given to public entities is non-binding. Article 58.1 of the State Council Law allows public entities to seek State Council advice on any matter it deems appropriate. Respondent submits that neither GHE nor the Egyptian courts were bound to follow State Council advice on the Option to Buy. Respondent submits that it cannot now be held liable for the alleged failure to implement an opinion that it was not, in the first place, obliged to follow.\n\n**2. THE OPTION TO BUY DOES NOT QUALIFY AS AN INVESTMENT UNDER THE BIT OR THE ICSID CONVENTION**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Both the BIT and the ICSID Convention should apply**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nRespondent submits that the Option to Buy is neither an investment under the BIT nor under the ICSID Convention, and submits that Claimant cannot rely on the BIT alone and exclude the application of the ICSID Convention to determine the existence of an investment. Respondent further submits that the Tribunal in the present case must apply a dual test to determine whether the purported investment qualifies for protection under the US-Egypt BIT (the \" **BIT** \"). Respondent submits that the purported Option to Buy fails to meet the Treaty definition of \"investment\" in Article 1(c) as it does not exist under Egyptian law and is not a valid and binding contract.\n\n**(b) The Option to Buy does not satisfy the criteria of the ICSID Convention**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nRespondent submits that the objective test for the existence of an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention requires that the activity in question fulfil the following requirements: certain duration, regularity of profit and return, an assumption of risk, a substantial commitment, and significance for the host State's development.\n\n**(i) An Option has no duration**\n---------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nRespondent submits that the Option to Buy does not have \"certain duration\", instead, if exercised it is no more than a one-off transaction. Respondent further submits that a duration between two and five years is considered a minimal requirement by doctrinal authorities and awards for an activity to be qualified as investment under the ICSID Convention. Respondent submits that the purported Option to Buy does not satisfy the duration requirement.\n\n**(ii) The Option to Buy does not entail an investment risk**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nRespondent submits that the Option to Buy lacks the element of risk required for the activity to qualify as an investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The Option to Buy does not entail an investment risk. The only possible risk is the commercial risk of non-performance or termination.\n\n**(iii) The Option to Buy does not generate regular profit or return**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nRespondent submits that the purported Option to Buy lacks regularity of profit and return. The Option to Buy is not a revenue-generating activity. Instead, if exercised, it can be characterised more as a one-time lump sum payment agreement with no prospect of regular profit or return.\n\n**(iv) There is no substantial contribution**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nRespondent submits that no financial contribution was made by Claimant in respect to the Option to Buy. The price to be paid (had the Option to Buy been exercised) does not amount to a contribution, but merely a lump sum payment.\n\n**(v) There is no contribution to the host State's development**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nRespondent submits that an Option to Buy, exercised at Claimant's discretion and involving a one-time lump-sum payment, without any transfer to know-how, technology or equipment to the host State, does not constitute a significant contribution to Egypt's economic development.\n\n**(c) The Option to Buy if exercised, is a purchase contract not an investment**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nAccording to Respondent ordinary sale contracts do not constitute investments as they lack two fundamental interrelated elements: assumption of risk and regularity of profit and return. The absence of an expected profit leads to the absence of risk. The operation should thus be qualified as \"sale\" rather than \"investment\".\n\n**(d) The Option to Buy is not an investment according to the Doctrine of the Unity of Investment**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nRespondent submits that the MOC, which is the act considered as the basis of the investment, is indivisible with the Option to Buy. Respondent further submits that for the unity of investment doctrine to apply, the secondary act must have had as purpose the accomplishment of an aspect of this investment and represent a close link to it. Respondent submits that the alleged Option to Buy cannot be a secondary act to the MOC. The Option to Buy has no influence on the management and the operation of the resort. According to Respondent, this is confirmed by the fact that an option to acquire property may or may not be exercised. Respondent further submits that Claimant itself has recognised that the alleged Option to Buy and the MOC are separate and unrelated agreements.\n\n**B. CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. THE PARTIES CONCLUDED A VALID OPTION TO BUY THE RESORT PURSUANT TO EGYPTIAN LAW**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Option to Buy is a binding contract under Egyptian Law**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nClaimant submits that the 1989 exchange of letters constituted a valid contract under Egyptian law. Claimant states that under Egyptian law, there are three conditions that must be satisfied for an option to buy to come into effect:\n\n(i) Determination of the asset to be sold;\n\n(ii) Determination of the price; and\n\n(iii) Identification of the period of time within which the party may exercise the option.\n\n27.\n\nClaimant submits that the exchange of letters in January 1989 between Respondent and Claimant constitutes the expression of the two parties' \"matching wills\" regarding Claimant's right to purchase the Resort and the terms under which such purchase could be exercised. All elements required for the formation of a binding Option to Buy were present: the identification of the asset to be sold, the Ain Sokhna Resort; the price, 18 million Egyptian pounds (or USD 7.4 million as of April 1989); and the period of time during which Claimant could exercise the Option to Buy, *i.e.,* within five years of the commencement of commercial operations. As of January 23, 1989, then, Claimant had an Option to Buy the Resort that was valid and binding under Egyptian law.\n\n28.\n\nFurthermore, Claimant submits that both parties were aware that the MOC could only be negotiated and finalized once the Option to Buy had been concluded, as Claimant had always made it clear that the purchase of the Resort was its ultimate goal. The reference to the conclusion of a contract subsequent to Claimant's acceptance of GHE's offer therefore concerns the MOC; that was the only agreement remaining to be finalized once the Option to Buy had been concluded. Had there been no agreement on the terms of Claimant's option rights, there would have been no MOC.\n\n**(b) The Parties did not mutually rescind the Option to Buy**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nClaimant submits that while it did entertain the possibility of buying the Resort prematurely, before all the conditions precedent for exercising the Option to Buy had been met, it always insisted on the agreed-upon purchase price of USD 7.4 million, or the equivalent of 19 million Egyptian pounds. The various methods of payment that it suggested in its letters to GHE in the spring of 1991 concerned only the timing of payment and the form of payment, not the amount. Claimant submits that when it became clear that GHE wanted to sell the Resort for substantially more money, Claimant reminded GHE of its contractual commitments, sending it a copy of the 10 April 1989 letter in which it had expressly confirmed those commitments. Claimant further insisted on its Option to Buy rights in letters to GHE in October and November 1991, when GHE began to advertise the Resort for sale to third parties. Claimant states that this is hardly the conduct of a company that had decided to rescind its Option to Buy the Resort.\n\n30.\n\nClaimant submits that under Egyptian law, rescission cannot be implied from conduct that is in any way ambiguous, much less conduct that points toward precisely the opposite conclusion. On the contrary, there must be concrete evidence that leaves no doubt as to the intention of the parties to rescind their contract. According to Claimant there is no inherent contradiction between the Option to Buy and the MOC - which was not a lease contract in any case, but a management and operation contract. Claimant submits that there is no support in fact or law for Respondent's argument that the parties agreed to mutually rescind the Option to Buy.\n\n**(c) The conditions precedent to exercise the Option to Buy were satisfied**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nClaimant submits that it formed a local affiliate, H&H Egypt, in 1989 for the express purpose of acquiring the Resort; all Respondent had to do was to acquire the requisite percentage of shares in H&H Egypt as part of the sale of the Resort to Claimant via H&H Egypt. Claimant submits that this transaction never took place, not because the conditions for exercising the Option to Buy were not met, but because Respondent breached its obligations under the Treaty.\n\n**2. THE OPTION TO BUY DOES QUALIFY AS AN INVESTMENT UNDER THE BIT AND THE ICSID CONVENTION**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Salini Criteria Are Not a Jurisdictional Requirement of the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nClaimant submits that it is self-evident that the determination of another arbitral tribunal such as the one in *Salini* does not bind the present Arbitral Tribunal to adopt the same interpretation of ICSID Article 25(1). It is the Convention itself that is authoritative as to its meaning, not the interpretation of it taken by a subset of tribunals considering it. This is particularly so when the interpretation is as ill-defined and controversial as is the so-called *Salini* test.\n\n**(b) The Option Qualifies As an Investment Even If the** ***Salini*** **Criteria Are Considered**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nAccording to Claimant, it could not exercise the Option to Buy until the Resort was fully renovated and operational. This primary precondition to the exercise of the Option to Buy itself required a multi-million-dollar investment and several years of sustained effort on Claimant's part. It also meant that the exercise of the Option to Buy was the purchase of a going concern. Further, had Claimant not been prevented from exercising the Option to Buy, it would have bought and operated the Resort for an unlimited duration. Claimant also states that Respondent ignored that the economic reality of Claimant's investment, which was in the Resort, and that the investment in the Option to Buy was only part of a larger whole.\n\n34.\n\nWith respect to substantial contribution, Claimant submits that its commitment was substantial. Claimant states that in order to exercise its Option to Buy, Claimant first had to demonstrate its ability to manage and operate the Resort. This required a substantial commitment of money and effort to renovate and make successful a war-damaged property. Its commitment in these areas allowed Claimant to operate the Resort with a sufficient return so as to make the purchase of the property feasible. Claimant was also to pay USD 7.4 million to acquire the Resort. At the same time, it had committed to sharing the expected profits from the Resort with GHE. All of these represent a substantial contribution by Claimant in terms of finances and know-how, a commitment that would have been renewed and deepened had Claimant been allowed to exercise its Option to Buy.\n\n35.\n\nFinally, with respect to contribution to host state development, Claimant states that Egypt has long recognized tourism as a critical industry for its continued development. Minister Sultan, in particular, favored expanding and strengthening the tourism industry through privatization as a means of furthering Egypt's larger development goals. Claimant's investment in the Resort, including the Option to Buy, clearly meets this criterion.\n\n36.\n\nClaimant further submits that, according to Respondent's own authorities and the facts of this case, Claimant's Option to Buy constitutes an \"investment\" under the standard urged on this Tribunal by Respondent.\n\n**(c) The Option Is Manifestly Not a Mere \"Purchase Contract,\" But an Investment in a Going Concern**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nClaimant submits that far from being a mere \"purchase contract,\" the Option to Buy instead represented a crucial feature of the endeavour in which Claimant was engaged in Egypt - namely, the operation, management, development, and eventual purchase of the Resort.\n\n38.\n\nClaimant also states that Respondent's position that this was a mere *\"purchase contract\"* not within the scope of the definition of *\"investment\"* is also at odds with the clear language of the BIT, and with decisions of other tribunals finding that contractual rights do represent qualifying investments. The BIT states that *\"investment\"* means *\"every kind of asset\"* including *\"any right conferred by law or contract... \".* Claimant states that this broad definition surely includes the right conferred by a contract to purchase an active hotel resort and its assets at the purchaser's option. Other tribunals have similarly confirmed that rights conferred by contract do amount to *\"investments\"* under both the ICSID Convention and the relevant instrument of consent.\n\n39.\n\nClaimant further states that the Option to Buy did not put Claimant in the position of a seller of industrial plant or equipment, seeking a one-time remuneration in the form of the purchase. It rather would have put Claimant in the position of a buyer, seeking remuneration in the form of future expected profits generated from the ongoing operation and improvement of the property.\n\n**(d) The MOC and the Option to Buy Formed a Single Investment in the Resort**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nClaimant submits that the MOC and the Option to Buy were highly interrelated contracts which could never have garnered the assent of both parties were they not inextricably linked. Claimant also states that these two elements of its investment were inextricably linked during the negotiation; they remained inextricably linked once agreed and memorialized into contracts.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nRespondent does not object to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* as a whole, but rather Respondent argues that the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* is limited to the MOC. Respondent submits that (i) the Option to Buy does not exist under Egyptian law, and (ii) even if it existed, it does not qualify as an investment under the BIT or the ICSID Convention.\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that for purposes of determining whether there is an investment, the Tribunal must look at the contractual arrangements as a whole and not just at certain aspects of these arrangements. The Tribunal considers that in practice, an investment may be composed of several contracts, and different types of assets, which together form the \"venture\" that constitutes the investment. In the Tribunal's view, determining whether there is an investment is a matter of substance and not form. In the present case, the MOC and the alleged Option to Buy together formed such a venture. The question of whether the Option to Buy constitutes an investment is a matter that cannot be viewed in isolation from the MOC.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that it has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* as there was clearly an investment made by Claimant, and not contested by Respondent. The Tribunal, however, decides to join the question of the validity of the Option to Buy to the merits as the matter may require an overall assessment of the merits of the dispute.\n\n**IV. RATIONE TEMPORIS**\n------------------------\n\n**A. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n44.\n\nRespondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis*, since Respondent did not consent to arbitrate disputes with respect to investments that fall outside of the temporal scope of the BIT.\n\n45.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant's investment allegedly made in 1989 was not accepted by Respondent under the then prevailing investment legislation - Law 43 of 1974 on Arab and Foreign Capital Investment and Free Zones (**\"Law 43\"**). Respondent states that the BIT subject of this arbitration came into force in 1992, and according to Respondent, Claimant's purported investment was therefore made prior to the entry into force of the BIT. Respondent further submits that the BIT applies to investments made after its entry into force as well as to pre-existing investments accepted in accordance with the legislation of either Contracting State.\n\n46.\n\nRespondent also states that Paragraph 2 of the Letter of Submittal dated 20 May 1986, which the U.S. Secretary of State sent to President Regan, along with the BIT and Supplementary Protocol dated 2 June 1986, and which President Regan subsequently transmitted to the Senate for ratification, explains what is meant by *\"accepted in accordance with the respective legislation\"* at Article II2 (b) of the BIT. Respondent states that to benefit from the protection under the BIT, existing investments must have been accepted in accordance with Egypt's Law 43. Furthermore, Respondent submits that Law 43 requires (i) that qualifying foreign capital be invested in a qualifying project, and that such capital be registered with the Authority; and (ii) that the project be accepted according to the procedures mandate by Law 43 and its Executives Regulations. According to Respondent, Claimant did not meet either of these conditions.\n\n**B. CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Respondent Fundamentally Misconstrues the Relevant Language of the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nClaimant submits that there is nothing in Article II (2)(b) of the BIT's reference to investments *\"accepted in accordance with the prevailing legislation of either party\"* that suggests that this language means anything other than a prohibition on treaty protection for investments that are contrary to the law of either party. Claimant also states that as is the case in interpreting any treaty, Article II(2)(b) must be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" A \"special meaning\" may be given to a term only if \"it is established that the parties so intended\".\n\n48.\n\nFurthermore, Claimant submits that the language of Article II(2)(b), when interpreted in context and in light of the Treaty's object and purpose, is clear and straightforward, and that is to promote economic development and cooperation between Egypt and the United States, thus, the object and purpose of the Treaty is to ensure the reciprocal encouragement and protection of a very broad range of investments, both tangible and intangible, for the specific purpose of furthering certain international policy goals of the two parties.\n\n49.\n\nConcerning the Submittal Letter, Claimant submits that a plain reading of the text confirms that the Secretary's concern in this portion of the Letter had absolutely nothing to do with whether or not U.S. nationals' existing investments in Egypt would or would not fall within the scope of the BIT. In other words, the Secretary was alerting the Senate to the possibility that the BIT might give rise to claims of U.S. nationals with existing investments in Egypt registered under Law 43, a fact the Senate might wish to take into consideration in determining whether or not to give its advice and consent to the President to ratify the Treaty. Indeed, the fact that the Secretary was concerned about the possible inconsistency of registered foreign investments with the Treaty suggests that the extension of Treaty protections to such investments may have been more tenuous than for investments that were not registered under Law 43.\n\n**2. Respondent Misinterprets the Scope of Law 43**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nClaimant submits that foreign investments never had to be registered pursuant to Law 43 in order to be \"accepted\" under Egyptian law, *i.e.,* to be legal. The purpose of Law 43 was simply to provide the protections of the investment law regime to foreign investments. Claimant states that foreign investments not registered under Law 43 were by no means illegal. They simply did not benefit from the special protections of the investment law. According to Claimant, the fact that Claimant never sought to register its investment pursuant to Law 43 does not mean that the investment was not \"accepted\" under Egyptian law. In fact, foreign investment could and did frequently take place outside the scope of Law 43. Thus, the fact that Claimant never sought registration pursuant to Law 43 did not mean that its investment was illegal only that it would not benefit from the privileges conferred by Law 43.\n\n**3. Respondent accepted Claimant's investment by conduct**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nClaimant submits that even if Respondent was correct that Claimant's investment was required to be registered under Law 43 in order to be \"accepted\" within the meaning of the Treaty, Respondent is nonetheless estopped from raising this as a defense by virtue of its own conduct. Claimant states that Respondent actively solicited, and accepted, Claimant's investment in the Resort as a foreign investment. The Minister of Tourism himself personally encouraged Claimant to make the investment, and took the lead on negotiating both the Option to Buy and the MOC. Claimant further submits that in the years that followed, Respondent accepted Claimant's renovation, improvement, and management of the Resort, including Claimant's regular profit-sharing payments - up until its continued refusal to grant Claimant an operating license led Claimant to suspend those payments in mid-1993. Moreover, there is no evidence that Respondent ever requested Claimant to register under Law 43, although it could certainly have done so either when the Option to Buy and MOC were concluded in early 1989, or later that same year, when the Addendum to the MOC was concluded. Specifically, the MOC was accepted by the Ministry of Tourism and by GHE, pursuant to the relevant laws.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant's investment is not covered by the BIT, which allegedly excludes investments prior to its entry into force, unless they were specifically \"accepted\" under the Egyptian Investment Law 43. Furthermore, Respondent relies on the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the BIT, in particular the Submittal Letter of the U.S. Secretary of State, which refers to Law 43 and which Respondent argues confirms that the BIT only intended to cover investments of U.S. nationals in Egypt that had been specifically \"accepted\" pursuant to Law 43.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that nothing in Law 43 or its associated decree 375 of 1977 suggests that it sets the exclusive procedures for the acceptance of foreign investments at the time. Moreover, the Tribunal considers that the evidence provided by the Parties, including the signature of the MOC by GHE, the issuance of the corresponding permits, the incorporation of a Claimant's affiliate in Egypt, and the endorsement of the project at the highest level of the State, proves that Claimant's investment was accepted by Respondent in a manner that meets the acceptance requirement of Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal also considers that, assuming for the sake of argument that the BIT referred to Law 43 expressly and that Law 43 contained exclusive procedures for the acceptance of foreign investments, the same evidence provided by the Parties demonstrates that Respondent accepted the investment and waived such acceptance procedure under Law 43. This is reinforced by the fact that Respondent did not demonstrate that the State officials in charge of accepting investments pursuant to Law 43 were of superior hierarchy and/or had greater attributions of authority than those that approved Claimant's investment.\n\n55.\n\nFurthermore, the Submittal Letter uses the term \"covered\" and not \" exclusively covered\". The following lines of the letter seem to suggest that Law 43 was discussed principally to address the question of consistency of the possible arrangements granted under the previous legislation of the US-Egypt BIT, rather than to record the need for investments made prior to the entry into force of the BIT to have been exclusively accepted by the procedures contemplated.\n\n56.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction *ratione* *temporis*.\n\n**V. RATIONE PERSONAE**\n-----------------------\n\n**A. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n57.\n\nRespondent submits that Article 1 of the BIT provides that Claimant must \"own or control\" the asset that comprises the protected investment. Respondent submits that neither of these requirements is met in the present case, and that the Tribunal, therefore, lacks jurisdiction over all of Claimant's claims in the present arbitration.\n\n**1. California Law Deprives a Suspended Corporation of all Rights, Powers & Privileges**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant was suspended under the law of its place of incorporation for failure to pay its taxes. Claimant remained suspended for the following 18 years, and was revived in 2008 solely for purposes of bringing this ICSID arbitration. On 2 April 2008, Claimant filed financial statements for the prior 18 years, and applied for a Certificate of Revivor, which the California Tax Board granted on 1 May 2008. Respondent further submits that companies suspended in the State of California, then, cannot exercise rights enjoyed by companies in good standing.\n\n**2. Claimant Did Not Control the Purported Investment**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nRespondent submits that, at the time of the alleged breach, namely in the years 1993 to 2001, Claimant, a suspended body corporate shorn of all rights, powers and privileges, could not have exercised control over the purported investment. Respondent states that if during the 18 years it remained suspended Claimant could not, under the law applicable to it, exercise corporate will, it could not exercise rights under the MOC or the Option to Buy, directly or indirectly.\n\n**3. Claimant Did Not Own the Purported Investment**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nRespondent also submits that Claimant did not \"own\" its purported investment at the time of the alleged breaches attributed to Respondent. Claimant claims that its investment is comprised of its contractual rights under the MOC and the Option to Buy. However, Respondent submits that unlike other forms of tangible assets, a contractual right does not exist independently of the right-holder's ability to tender and to exact contractual performance from its counterparty -neither of which, according to Respondent, Claimant could do, directly or otherwise, in the 18 years during which it remained suspended.\n\n**4. Mr. Alashmawy - a dual national of the contracting Parties - controlled the investment at all relevant times**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nRespondent submits that the present dispute is an appropriate case for the Tribunal to pierce the corporate veil in order to identify the true Claimant and *de facto* investor in these proceedings - Mr Alashmawy - and to find that it has no jurisdiction over the claim by reason that Mr Alshmawy, a dual citizen of both contracting parties to the BIT, does not qualify as a foreign investor for purposes of Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n62.\n\nClaimant submits that none of the criteria for jurisdiction *ratione personae* set out in the ICSID Convention justify an inquiry into control at the time of the alleged breach. Claimant also submits that the relevant time for determining Claimant's conformity with the criteria for jurisdiction *ratione personae* is the time at which it submitted the Request for Arbitration.\n\n**1. Claimant's rights did not cease to exist as a result of its tax suspension in California**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nClaimant submits that there is nothing in the Egyptian law, which is the applicable law to this case, stipulating that contracts are automatically terminated as soon as either party is unable to *\"tender or exact contractual performance\"*. Claimant further submits that the Egyptian Civil Code provides that contracts do not terminate by reason of non-performance unless the parties have reached a specific agreement to that effect. Claimant submits that in the present case the Parties did not agree that either the MOC or the Option to Buy would automatically terminate in the event that Claimant was unable to perform any of its obligations.\n\n**2. Claimant owned and controlled the investment at all times**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nClaimant submits that it has at all times wholly owned its investment in Egypt, including at all times relevant to this dispute. Claimant asserts that this is sufficient to establish that it meets the requirements for jurisdiction under the BIT, and also - to the extent relevant - demonstrates that it controlled its investments for purposes of international law.\n\n**3. There is no basis for the Tribunal to \"pierce the veil\" in this case**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nClaimant submits that the authorities upon which Respondent relies do not support the existence of a rule of veil-piercing that could be applied by the Tribunal in the manner suggested by Respondent. Claimant submits that the existence of a veil-piercing doctrine in international law is dubious, and its application in the present dispute would be unprecedented. Claimant also submits that even if such a doctrine exists and could be applied by the Tribunal as a basis to decline its jurisdiction, the circumstances of the present case do not justify its application.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant did not own or control the investment, since Claimant was suspended pursuant to the laws of the State of California.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant's suspension was revived with retroactive effect when it paid its dues in April 2008, prior to filing the present arbitration. The Tribunal also considers that even assuming this were the case, it appears that the relevant law in the State of California does not purport to apply extraterritorially and therefore would not affect the validity of transactions and performance of contracts abroad, in this case Egypt.\n\n68.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal considers that Claimant is a legal entity incorporated in the State of California, and thus fulfils the objective criteria for *ratione personae* provided for in Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article I(1)(b) of the BIT. Respondent has not provided the Tribunal with any evidence or a legal basis that would justify piercing the corporate veil or otherwise disregarding Claimant's nationality.\n\n**VI. THE CONDITIONS FOR REFERRING THE DISPUTE TO ICSID ARE NOT SATISFIED (FORK IN THE ROAD)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n69.\n\nRespondent submits that Article VII (3)(a)(ii) of the BIT has been triggered by reasons that Claimant has already brought in the present dispute before the local courts in Egypt. Respondent also submits that, with the exception of Claimant's denial of justice claim, all of Claimant's treaty claims are barred by application of the fork-in-the-road provision.\n\n**1. The Triple Identity test deprives the fork-in-the-road provision of genuine meaning and practical effect**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nRespondent submits that if strict identity of parties and cause of action are held to be essential conditions for the operation of fork-in-the-road provisions in BITs, then these provisions will be of no practical significance. Instead, in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention and the principle of *effet utile*, Respondent submits that the fork-in-the-road provision must be interpreted to give it genuine meaning and effect.\n\n**2. The fork-in-the-road provision is triggered where: (a) the treaty claim has the same fundamental basis as the claim submitted to the local courts; (b) the factual components of a treaty cause of action have already been brought before the local courts; and (c) the treaty claim does not truly have an autonomous existence outside the contract.**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nRespondent submits that the present dispute is the same as the disputes submitted to the Cairo Arbitral Tribunal and to the local courts. Respondent further submits that:\n\n(i) The factual components of the treaty cause of action claim have already been brought before the Cairo Arbitral Tribunal and to the local courts;\n\n(ii) The fundamental basis of the claims are the same - the alleged interference by GHE and Claimant's rights under the MOC and the denial of the existence of the purported Option to Buy; and\n\n(iii) The treaty claims do not have an autonomous existence outside the contract. These include:\n\n1. the Expropriation Claim.\n\n2. the Fair and Equitable Treatment Claim.\n\n3. the Full Protection and Security Claim.\n\n4. the Observation of Obligations Claim.\n\n5. the Minimum Standard of Treatment Claim.\n\n**3. The MFN Provision cannot be used to bypass a fork-in-the-road provision**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nRespondent submits that the Contracting Parties did not intend for the MFN clause in the BIT to apply to dispute resolution provision, which Respondent submits was specifically negotiated with a view of resolving disputes under the treaty. Respondent also submits that the MFN clause does not expressly refer to dispute resolution, nor does it expressly refer to \"all matters\" or \"all rights\".\n\n**B. CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. The Current Treaty Dispute has never been submitted to Egyptian Courts**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nClaimant submits that even though some of the facts underpinning these claims related to a contract between Claimant and GHE, the current dispute is nonetheless not a contract dispute, but rather a dispute relating to alleged breaches of the BIT. Claimant submits that the relevant question in the present dispute is whether the dispute over an alleged breach of the Treaty rights has ever been submitted to domestic dispute resolution. According to Claimant, Respondent has never shown, or even argued, that any Treaty claims or any rights protected by the Treaty were submitted to local dispute resolution. Claimant submits that the local proceedings related only to Claimant's attempts to enforce the MOC and the Option to Buy, and did not involve any discussion or a decision of any alleged Treaty breaches. Such matters, according to Claimant, would have been outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n**2. All of Claimant's claims are fundamentally treaty claims, therefore not barred by the fork-in-the-road clause**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nClaimant submits that because contract claims are distinct from treaty claims, a tribunal retains jurisdiction over the treaty claims even where contract claims related to the same facts have been submitted to domestic dispute resolution. Claimant submits that in this particular case, each of Claimant's claims is not only based on treaty, rather than contract law, but also involves facts not at issue in the local proceedings. Claimant further submits that Claimant's claims could not have been brought in the local proceedings, because they involve issues that fall outside the jurisdiction of the local bodies.\n\n**3. The factual basis of the current claims and the relief sought in this arbitration are distinct from those in the domestic proceedings**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nClaimant submits that the legal foundation of Claimant's claims is distinct from contract claims, and that each of the claims involves a variety of facts never put at issue in the local proceedings. Claimant further submits that the relief sought in the domestic proceedings is to enforce the MOC and the Option to Buy - *i.e.,* specific performance with interim compensation for certain breaches as a secondary aim. Whereas, in the present dispute Claimant seeks only to be compensated for Respondent's various Treaty breaches, which according to Claimant have deprived it from the expected return of its investment.\n\n**4. Claimant is entitled to more favourable provisions from treaties under the MFN Clause**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nClaimant argues that even if the fork-in-the-road clause in the BIT would preclude any of Claimant's claims in this case, the MFN clause should entitle Claimant to the more favourable provisions in other BITs concluded in Egypt, such as the Germany-Egypt BIT, which do not contain a fork-in-the-road clause.\n\n***C.*****THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n-----------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nRespondent submits that the fork-in-the-road clause was triggered when Claimant filed a counterclaim in the Cairo arbitration commenced by GHE and when it filed its case in the local courts of Egypt.\n\n78.\n\nClaimant submits that the fork-in-the-road clause has not been triggered, because Claimant's claims pursued in the local fora, on the one hand, and the claims pursued in the present arbitration on the other hand do not meet the triple identity test, that in the view of Claimant should be applied. Claimant submits that even though the local proceedings and this arbitration involve the same parties, the causes of action are not the same, as the present arbitration involves treaty claims and not contract claims. The relief sought is also different.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the allegations related to the fork-in-the-road clause are closely related to the merits of the case. The Tribunal considers that ruling on this matter requires a more thorough analysis of the claims and the merits of the dispute.\n\n80.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal decides to join its decision on the fork-in-the-road objection to the merits.\n\n**VII. EQUITABLE PRINCIPLES OF PRESCRIPTION**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**A. RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n81.\n\nRespondent submits that seven years since the last alleged breach is an unreasonable delay on the part of Claimant to present its claim. Respondent states that this delay compromises Respondent's ability to defend on an equal footing to Claimant in the present proceedings. Respondent further submits that the conditions for prescription apply in the present case. Namely, Respondent submits that (i) there has been an unreasonable delay by Claimant in presenting its claim (seven years since the last alleged breach of treaty and eighteen years from the first alleged breach of treaty), (ii) with the passage of time material facts are lost, obscured, or reasonably in doubt and potential witnesses have now retired or passed away, and inevitably, the passage of time - twenty two years since the signing of the MOC - will result in faded memories for those witnesses that may be available to testify, which causes prejudice to Respondent, and (iii) Claimant's delay in presenting its claim prejudices Respondent's ability to defend itself on equal footing to Claimant in these proceedings.\n\n82.\n\nMoreover, Respondent submits that it was only notified of the resent dispute when the present proceedings before ICSID were filed by Claimant in *\"2008* [sic] \". Respondent submits that the Cairo Arbitration (commenced by GHE in 1993) and the local court proceedings (commenced by Claimant in 1995) do not constitute notice of this present ICSID dispute, some thirteen years later. Nor can Claimant claim that Respondent has been on notice of the present proceedings for the past *\"seven years\"* since the last alleged breach of treaty (its eviction from the Resort in 2001). Respondent submits that during this time Claimant neither attempted to recover any compensation from Respondent, nor did it notify Respondent of any claim.\n\n**B. CLAIMANT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n83.\n\nClaimant submits that a delay of seven years is not sufficient to raise a presumption of negligence with claims brought against Respondent - *i.e.*, the delay is not unreasonable - given that claims based on the same facts could still be presented under Egyptian law for full further eight years.\n\n84.\n\nClaimant further submits that it had produced five comprehensive witness statements and no fewer than 257 factual exhibits in support of its claims, therefore, completely undermining Respondent's assertion that material facts were lost. Claimant also submits that the majority of Claimant's contemporaneous business records were seized by Respondent in 2001, forcing Claimant to rely on the documentary record produced during the local arbitration, which Claimant states is equally available to Respondent. In relation to the witnesses, Claimant submits that Respondent failed to identify a single example of a relevant witness that it will be unable to call for its defence in the present arbitration.\n\n85.\n\nFinally, Claimant submits that the critical inquiry for determining whether a respondent has been prejudiced by delay is not whether the respondent is unable to gather facts relevant to its defence at the time it must undertake that defense, but rather whether it had sufficient notice and opportunity to do so at the time of the underlying events.\n\n**C. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant's claims are overdue as they were filed several years after they allegedly arose.\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the burden of proof rests on Respondent to establish the existence of a prescription rule. Respondent has not demonstrated the existence of a prescription rule under the ICSID rules or the BIT. The Tribunal contends that references to other systems such as NAFTA are neither relevant nor demonstrative of a trend or so persuasive that the Tribunal should consider them.\n\n88.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal decides to reject Respondent's objection based on equitable principles of prescription.\n\n**VIII. THE DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal rules as follows:\n\n1. The Tribunal rejects Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection based on *ratione materiae* and joins the question of the validity of the option to buy to the merits.\n\n2. The Tribunal rejects Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection based on *ratione temporis.*\n\n3. The Tribunal rejects Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection based on *ratione personae.*\n\n4. The Tribunal joins Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection based on the fork-in-the-road clause to the merits.\n\n5. The Tribunal rejects Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection based on equitable prescription."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2014-05-06T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS** |\n| **Arbitration Rules** | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (2006) |\n| **BIT or US-Egypt BIT** | Treaty between the United States of America and the Arab Republic of Egypt Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragements and Protections of Investments, signed in Washington on 29 September 1982, with a Related Exchange of Letters signed 11 March 1985 and a Supplementary Protocol singed 11 March 1986; entered into force 27 June 1992 |\n| **Claimant's Memorial on the Merits** | Claimant's Memorial on the Merits, dated 15 October 2010 |\n| **Claimant's Response to Objections to Jurisdiction** | Claimant's Response to the Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction and Request for Bifurcation, dated 9 September 2011 |\n| **Claimant's Rejoinder to** **Objections to Jurisdiction** | Claimant's Rejoinder to the Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction, dated 15 May 2012 |\n| **Claimant's Reply on the Merits** | Claimant's Reply Memorial on the Merits and Rejoinder on Remaining Jurisdictional Issues, dated 1 August 2013 |\n| **Decision on Jurisdiction** | Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction, dispatched on 5 June 2011 |\n| **EGOTH** | Egyptian General Company for Tourism and Hotels |\n| **GHE** | Grand Hotels of Egypt |\n| **HOTAC** | Holding Company for Tourism, Hotels and Cinema |\n| **HT** | Transcripts of the Hearing on the Merits and Remaining Jurisdictional Issues |\n| **ICSID Convention/Convention** | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States |\n| **L.E.** | Egyptian pounds |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **MOC** | [...] Hotel Management and Operation Contract [...] |\n| **Parties** | H&H Enterprises Investments, Inc. and the Arab Republic of Egypt |\n| **POT** | Public Sector Organization for Tourism |\n| **Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction** | Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation, dated 6 June 2011 |\n| **Respondent's Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction** | Respondent's Reply to the Claimant's Response to the Objections to Jurisdiction, dated 19 January 2012 |\n| **Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits** | Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Reply on Remaining Jurisdictional Issues, dated 16 May 2013 |\n| **Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits** | Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits and Surreply on Remaining Jurisdictional Issues, 11 October 2013 |\n| **U.S.** | United States of America |\n| **USD** | United States Dollar |\n| **Vienna Convention** | Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of May 23, 1969 |\n\n**I. THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANT**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nH&H Enterprises Investments Inc. (**\"H&H\"** or **\"the Claimant\"**) is a California corporation established in 1988 by [...], a United States investor of Egyptian origin. [...] also formed an Egyptian affiliate, the Egyptian American Company for Development and Tourism - H&H Enterprises (**\"H&H Egypt\"**) which was recognized as such by the Government. Another local affiliate, [...], was created to help oversee renovations of the Resort, as described further in this Award.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT**\n---------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Arab Republic of Egypt (**\"the Respondent\"**). As a public sector company (or after 1991, a public business sector subsidiary company), Grand Hotels of Egypt (**\"GHE\"**) is owned by the Government of Egypt and at the time owned and managed certain of the country's hotels with the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism. GHE was wholly owned first by the Public Sector Organization for Tours (**\"POT\"**) and later by the Holding Company for Tourism, Hotels and Cinema (**\"HOTAC\"**), a public sector organization structured as an Egyptian joint stock holding company wholly owned by the Ministry of Tourism. In 1996, GHE merged into the Egyptian General Company for Tourism and Hotels (**\"EGOTH\"**).\n\n**II. THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION**\n------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn 17 July 2009, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (**\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\"**) received a request for arbitration (the **\"Request\"**) from the Claimant against the Respondent. The Request was made pursuant to the Treaty between the United States of America and the Arab Republic of Egypt Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments, which was signed on 11 March 1986 and entered into force on 27 June 1992 (the **\"US-Egypt BIT\"** or the **\"Treaty\"**), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (**\"ICSID Convention\"** or **\"Convention\"**).\n\n4.\n\nOn 11 August 2009, the Secretary-General of ICSID sent the Claimant and the Respondent a Notice of Registration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.\n\nOn 29 October 2009, the Parties informed the Centre that they had agreed to adopt a formula similar to the one set out in the provision of Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention as their method for constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. This letter was acknowledged by a letter from ICSID to the Parties of the same date. Accordingly, it was confirmed that: (1) the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators; (2) one arbitrator would be appointed by each Party; and (3) the third, presiding, arbitrator would be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n6.\n\nPursuant to this agreement, the Claimant appointed Dr. Veijo Heiskanen, a national of Finland, as a member of the Tribunal. Dr. Heiskanen accepted his appointment on 31 October 2009. The Respondent appointed Dr. Hamid Gharavi, a dual national of France and Iran. Dr. Gharavi accepted his appointment on 30 October 2009.\n\n7.\n\nOn 21 December 2009, the Claimant requested the appointment of the presiding arbitrator by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council as provided for in Article 38 of the Convention and Rule 4(1) of the Arbitration Rules, following the Parties' failure to reach an agreement on the person to serve as President of the Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 2 February 2010, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council had appointed Dr. Bernardo M. Cremades, a national of Spain, as the third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal was officially constituted on 2 February 2010, in accordance with the Convention and the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (**\"Arbitration Rules\"**). Ms. Milanka Kostadinova, Senior Counsel, ICSID, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n10.\n\nThe First Session of the Tribunal was held on 18 March 2010 at the World Bank Paris office. At the Session, the Tribunal heard, among other things, the Parties' proposals for addressing any objections to jurisdiction and a potential request for bifurcation of the proceeding by the Respondent. The Tribunal also approved the Parties' agreed schedule for preliminary submissions, which included a phase for the Claimant's request for document production prior to the filing of the Claimant's Memorial on the Merits and a phase for the Respondent's request for document production prior to the filing of the Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction. It was further agreed that the Claimant would file a response to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections and that a one-day procedural hearing would be held on the issue of bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n11.\n\nOn 28 March 2010, the Claimant filed a request for production of documents, which was subsequently amended on 8 April 2010. On 8 May 2010, the Respondent filed a reply to the Claimant's request. Following further exchanges between the Parties, on 2 June 2010 the Claimant requested that the Tribunal schedule an oral hearing concerning the Respondent's refusal to comply with outstanding document production requests. Having received the Respondent's comments on 11 June 2010, the Tribunal rendered its First Production Order Concerning the Claimant's Request for Production and Related Questions, dated 17 June 2010.\n\n12.\n\nOn 15 October 2010, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits.\n\n13.\n\nOn 8 November 2010, the Respondent filed a request for production of documents. On 13 December 2010, the Claimant submitted observations to the Respondent's request objecting to the production of certain documents. By letter of 30 December 2010, the Claimant wrote to draw the Tribunal's attention to the fact that the Respondent had failed to respond to the Claimant's observations by 23 December 2010, as required by the agreement for timing of the pleadings in this matter. No response was received from the Respondent and the Claimant requested that the Tribunal rule on the Claimant's objections to the Respondent's document production request. The Respondent filed its response subsequently. On 25 January 2011, the Tribunal rendered the Second Procedural Order of the Tribunal Concerning the Respondent's Request for Production of Documents.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 27 April 2011, the due date for the Respondent's submission of the Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent filed a request for a six-week extension for filing of its jurisdictional objections. By letter of 28 April 2011, the Tribunal granted a four-week extension and determined that the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction should be submitted by 26 May 2011. On the same date, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed on a further extension of one week. The Tribunal confirmed the Parties' agreement on 27 May 2011.\n\n15.\n\nOn 6 June 2011, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation.\n\n16.\n\nOn 9 September 2011, Claimant filed its Response to the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation.\n\n17.\n\nOn 13 September 2011, the Tribunal invited the Parties to indicate whether they still wished to hold a hearing on the issue of bifurcation of the proceedings, as initially contemplated at the First Session. On 20 September 2011, the Respondent confirmed that it wished for a one-day hearing on bifurcation of the proceeding. The Claimant asked the Tribunal to forgo the hearing but deferred the decision to the Tribunal.\n\n18.\n\nA hearing on the question whether to address the objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary matter was held on 15 November 2011, in Washington, D.C.\n\n19.\n\nThe Parties were represented as follows:\n\nThe Claimant\n\nMr. Arif H. Ali, Mr. Baiju Vasani, Ms. Marguerite C. Walter, and  \n Ms. Emily Alban, Crowell & Moring LLP;  \n Mr. Khaled El Shalakany, Shalakany Law Office, Cairo;\n\nThe Respondent\n\nDr. Karim Hafez, Dr. Dalia Hussein and Ms. Johanne Cox, Hafez, Cairo;   \nMs. Fatma Khalifa and Mr. Amr Arafa, Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority\n\n20.\n\nOn 22 November 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 Concerning Bifurcation of Certain Objections to Jurisdiction. The Tribunal confirmed the Parties' agreement at the hearing to bifurcate the proceedings into a preliminary jurisdictional phase to precede the merits phase. In its Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal outlined the jurisdictional objections to be decided in the preliminary jurisdictional phase. The Tribunal also fixed a calendar for the written pleadings and the hearing on the preliminary jurisdictional issues.\n\n21.\n\nPursuant to the filing calendar set forth in Procedural Order No. 3, on 19 January 2012, the Respondent filed a Reply to the Claimant's Response to the Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n22.\n\nOn 15 March, 2012, the Claimant filed a Rejoinder to the Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\n23.\n\nA hearing on preliminary jurisdictional issues was held on 23, 24 and 25 March 2012, in Washington, D.C.\n\n24.\n\nThe Parties were represented as follows:\n\nThe Claimant\n\nMr. Arif H. Ali, Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP;  \n Mr. Baiju Vasani, Ms. Marguerite C. Walter, Ms. Emily Alban, and Mr. Kassi D. Tallent, Crowell & Moring LLP;  \n Dr. Khaled El Shalakany and Mr. Adam El Shalakany. Shalakany Law Office;\n\nThe Respondent\n\nDr. Karim Hafez, Dr. Dalia Hussein and Ms. Johanne Cox, Hafez, Cairo;   \nMs. Fatma Khalifa and Mr. Amr Arafa, Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority\n\n**C. DECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nOn 5 June 2012, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on the Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction. The Tribunal dismissed the Respondent's jurisdictional objections based on the Respondent's *ratione personae*, *ratione temporis* and equitable prescription arguments. The Tribunal also rejected the Respondent's jurisdictional objections based on the lack of *ratione materiae* jurisdiction and joined the question of the validity of the Option to Buy to the merits. The jurisdictional objections based on the fork-in-the-road provision of the BIT were also joined to the merits. The Tribunal decided to reserve any decision on the allocation of costs until the conclusion of the proceedings. The Decision on Jurisdiction is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n**D. SUBMISSIONS ON THE MERITS AND THE REMAINING JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nOn 13 June 2012, the Tribunal invited the Parties to propose a procedural calendar for the remaining steps of the proceedings. By letter of 11 July 2012, the Respondent requested a two-month extension for submission of its CounterMemorial on the Merits and Reply on Remaining Jurisdictional Issues. In its letter, the Respondent suggested a revised procedural calendar. By letter of 19 July 2012, the Claimant indicated its agreement with the Respondent' proposal with a few amendments. On 25 July 2012, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties' agreed schedule which was attached to the Claimant's letter of 19 July 2012.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter of 23 August 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of Dr. Karim Hafez's withdrawal as the Respondent's counsel and requested a further extension of the time limit for submission of its Counter-Memorial on the Merits. On 27 August 2012, the Claimant indicated that it did not object to the Respondent's request for a further extension, but was of the view that any such extension should not exceed one month. On 29 August 2012, the Tribunal set out a revised procedural calendar.\n\n28.\n\nOn 22 October 2012, the Respondent requested that the time limit for filing of the Counter-Memorial on the Merits be extended until 28 March 2013. By letter of 31 October 2012, the Claimant agreed on a further modification of the procedural calendar by the Tribunal under the condition that the Respondent made an appropriate showing of its substantial effort to appoint new counsel.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter of 7 November 2012, the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority confirmed that the Respondent was in the process of retaining Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP as counsel in this proceeding. The Respondent also confirmed that, given the circumstances, it would be able to submit the CounterMemorial on the Merits by 28 March 2012.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of 15 January 2013, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties had jointly agreed and proposed to the Tribunal a revised procedural calendar.

THE DECISION**\n-------------------\n\n354.\n\nOn 5 June 2012, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on the Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction27 and decided as follows:\n\n*1. The Tribunal rejects Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on ratione materiae and joins the question of the validity of the option to buy to the merits.*\n\n*2. The Tribunal rejects Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on ratione temporis.*\n\n*3. The Tribunal rejects Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on ratione personae.*\n\n*4. The Tribunal joins Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on the fork-in-the-road clause to the merits.*\n\n*5. The Tribunal rejects Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on equitable prescription.*\n\nThe Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction, dated 5 June 2012.\n\n355.\n\nAccordingly, the present Award deals with the jurisdictional issues joined to the merits and, if and to the extent jurisdiction is found, the merits of the Claimant's claims.\n\n**A. FORK-IN-THE ROAD**\n-----------------------\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal first deals with the question of whether the fork-in-the-road clause of the US-Egypt BIT could constitute a bar to its jurisdiction, or whether the dispute resolution clause contained in the Germany-Egypt BIT, which does not contain such a requirement, could be imported through the MFN clause contained in Article II(2) of the US-Egypt BIT. Moreover, the Tribunal assumes for purposes of deciding on the issue of the application of the fork-in-the-road clause, that the acts of GHE and EGOTH are attributable to the State of Egypt on a *prima facie* basis.\n\n357.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the fork-in-the-road clause does not apply in the present case by virtue of the MFN clause contained in Article II(2) therein, by reference to the 2009 Germany-Egypt BIT, which does not contain such a requirement.28 The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's position, on the basis, *inter alia*, that MFN clauses may not be used to incorporate arbitration clauses from other investment treaties or circumvent the host State's consent to arbitrate.29\n\nClaimant's Response to Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6246-249; and Claimant's Rejoinder on Objections to Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6266-280.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits, \u00b6\u00b6342-353.\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the MFN clause contained in the US-Egypt BIT cannot be used to avoid the application of the fork-in-the-road clause contained therein. The Tribunal shares in this respect the view of the tribunal in *Plama v. Bulgaria*, which noted that dispute resolution provisions are separable from the remainder of the treaty and \"constitute an agreement on their own\"; accordingly, \" *an MFN provision in a basic treaty does not incorporate by reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in another treaty unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the Contracting Parties intended to incorporate them.* \"30 However, nothing in the wording of Article II(2) of the US-Egypt BIT indicates that the Parties intended that provisions relating to dispute resolution be included within its scope. Moreover, the Germany-Egypt BIT, on which the Claimant relies, entered into force only on 22 November 2009, that is, after the Claimant accepted the Respondent's offer to arbitrate in its Request for Arbitration filed on 17 July 2009. In these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the application of the fork-in-the-road clause of the US-Egypt BIT cannot be avoided in this case.\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005 [RA-240], \u00b6\u00b6212, 223.\n\n359.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the question whether the fork-in-the-road clause of the US-Egypt BIT constitutes a bar to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n360.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, at the outset, that the basis for the Claimant's Treaty claims and its contractual claims, which are based on the Option to Buy and the MOC as well as associated correspondence, are fundamentally the same. These claims were settled by the Cairo Arbitral Award, rendered in Cairo on 28 February 1995.\n\n361.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with the Claimant's categorization of the relation between the Treaty claims and the contractual claims as merely an \"overlap\".\n\n362.\n\nThe US-Egypt BIT contains a fork-in-the road provision (Article VII 3(a)), which provides the following:\n\n*\"In the event that the legal investment dispute is not resolved under procedures specified above, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration, if, within six (6) months of the date upon which it arose: (i) the dispute has not been settled through consultation and negotiation; or (ii) the dispute has not, for any good faith reason, been submitted for resolution in accordance with any applicable dispute-settlement procedures previously agreed to by the Parties to the dispute; or (iii) the national or company concerned has not brought the dispute before the courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of the Party that is a Party to the dispute\"*.\n\n363.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the principal claims are only barred by a fork-in-the-road clause when the claims in the domestic proceedings and the claims in the international proceedings meet the triple identity test: the same parties, the same object, and the same cause of action.\n\n364.\n\nHowever, Article VII of the US-Egypt BIT does not expressly require that the triple identity test be met before the fork-in-the-road provision can be invoked. The triple identity test raised by the Claimant in this case is based on its reading of arbitral jurisprudence as opposed to the specific language of the US-Egypt BIT and/or its interpretation.\n\n365.\n\nIn order to decide whether the fork-in-the-road provision is triggered in the present case, the Tribunal must interpret Article VII of the US-Egypt BIT. In doing so, the Tribunal relies on the general rule of treaty interpretation in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which provides that a *\"treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\"*.\n\n366.\n\nArticle VII 3(a) (ii) and (iii) provides that \"[i] *n the event that the legal investment dispute is not resolved under procedures specified above, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration, if, within six (6) months of the date upon which it arose:* [...] *(ii) the*  ***dispute has not*** *, for any good faith reason,*  ***been submitted for resolution in accordance with any applicable dispute-settlement procedures previously agreed to by the Parties to the dispute*** *; or (iii) the national or company concerned has not brought the dispute*  ***before the courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of the Party that is a Party to the dispute*** \" (emphasis added). It is quite clear from the language of Article VII that the State parties provided for an ICSID arbitration procedure only to the extent the dispute had not been submitted to dispute settlement procedures agreed to by the Parties or to the competent domestic courts. ICSID arbitration has not been intended as an appeals process. In this case the dispute has been submitted to both previously agreed dispute settlement procedures as well as to competent domestic courts, as set out below.\n\n367.\n\nAdditionally, the Tribunal is of the view that the triple identity test is not the relevant test as it would defeat the purpose of Article VII of the US-Egypt BIT, which is to ensure that the same dispute is not litigated before different fora. It would also deprive Article VII from any practical meaning. The Tribunal notes that the triple identity test originates from the doctrine of *res judicata*. However, investment arbitration proceedings and local court proceedings are often not only based on different causes of action but also involve different parties. More importantly, the language of Article VII does not require specifically that the parties be the same, but rather that the dispute at hand not be submitted to other dispute resolution procedures; what matters therefore is the subject matter of the dispute rather than whether the parties are exactly the same. Finally, and in any event, it would defeat the purpose of the Treaty and allow form to prevail over substance if the respondents were required to be strictly the same because in practice, local court proceedings are often brought against state instrumentalities having a separate legal personality and not the state itself.31 This is also the case here, and indeed both the Claimant and the Respondent consistently considered, in the course of the Cairo Arbitration and Egyptian local proceedings, GHE and EGOTH as being the competent parties to account for these claims.\n\nJan Ole Vosse, *The Impact of Investment Treaties on Contracts between Host States and Foreign Investors,* Martinus Nijhoff, 2011, p.291; the exact wording is: \" *[W]hilst the claim before local courts is usually brought by a locally established subsidiary against a regional or local administrative authority, the investment treaty claim is lodged by the foreign investor itself against the host State* \".\n\n368.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, therefore, instead of focusing on whether the causes of actions relied upon in the claims brought to the local courts and the arbitration are identical, one must assess whether the claims share the same fundamental basis.\n\n369.\n\nAccordingly, in order to decide whether the Claimant's Treaty claims in the present case are barred by the fork-in-the-road clause, the Tribunal must determine whether the Treaty claims have the same fundamental basis as the claims submitted before the local fora.\n\n370.\n\nThe \"fundamental basis of the claim\" test, first set out by the American Venezuelan Mixed Commission in the *Woodruff* case (1903), was also adopted in *Pantechniki v. The Republic of Albania*, where the Sole Arbitrator, Mr. Jan Paulsson found that:\n\n*\"\u2018Its final submission* [...] *was that it was entitled to payment of US$1,821,796 \"because the Defendant had recognised and admitted that this amount is due\". The logic is inescapable. To the extent that this prayer was accepted it would grant the Claimant exactly what it is seeking before ICSID - and on the same \"fundamental basis\". The Claimant\u2019s grievance thus arises out of the same purported entitlement that it invoked in the contractual debate it began with the General Roads Directorate. The Claimant chose to take this matter to the Albanian courts. It cannot now adopt the same fundamental basis as the foundation of a Treaty claim. Having made the election to seise the national jurisdiction the Claimant is no longer permitted to raise the same contention before ICSID\"*32.\n\n*Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award, 30 July 2009 [RA-36], \u00b667.\n\n371.\n\nIn the present arbitration, the Claimant's expropriation claim is based on the alleged interference by GHE with the Claimant's rights under the MOC. The Claimant contends that the Respondent obstructed the Claimant's ability to perform the MOC, refusing to accept the Claimant's development plans and preventing it from obtaining a permanent operating license, and finally cancelling the MOC. The Claimant's expropriation claim is also based on GHE's denial of the existence of the Option to Buy.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Cairo Arbitration33 concerned (i) the Claimant's rights under the MOC; (ii) GHE's alleged breach of the MOC by way of its failure to accept the development plans; (iii) the failure of the Ministry of Tourism to issue a permanent operating license as a result of GHE's alleged interference and instructions to the Ministry; (iv) GHE's alleged right to revoke the MOC and demand delivery of the Hotel and Land from the Claimant; and (v) the Claimant's alleged Option to Buy.\n\n*Grand Hotels of Egypt v. H&H Enterprises*, 28 February 1995, the Cairo Arbitral Award [RA-2].\n\n373.\n\nThese claims were resolved by the Cairo Arbitral Tribunal in its Award rendered on 28 February 1995, by which it decided among other things, that the Option to Buy did not exist under the applicable Egyptian law since the parties had failed to agree on the *essentialia negotti*.\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant also initiated two proceedings in the South Cairo Court of First Instance on 1 and 4 June 1995 respectively, claiming damages for breach of the MOC based, *inter alia*, on GHE's alleged refusal to accept the Claimant's development plans and interference with the licensing process, and complaining of GHE's failure to honor the alleged Option to Buy. The Cairo Court of First Instance issued a judgment on 15 June 199734, which the Claimant appealed to the Cairo Court of Appeals. The Cairo Court of Appeals in its judgment of 30 April 200135 terminated the MOC on account of the Claimant's failure to perform its obligations under the MOC and the Cairo Arbitral Award.\n\nSouth Cairo of First Instance, Civil Circuit, Claims Nos. 5451-5549/1995 & No.1963/1996 [RA-3].\n\nCairo Court of Appeal Claims Nos. 9331/2001 and 9487/2001 [RA-4].\n\n375.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant sought an order from the South Cairo Court of First Instance requesting that EGOTH be compelled to procure the Ministry of Tourism's approval of the December 1992 development plan, and the Ministry's issuance of an operating license. These claims were rejected on 27 December 1998.\n\n376.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimant's expropriation claim and its claims before the Cairo Arbitral Tribunal and the local courts share the same fundamental basis. In both proceedings the Claimant alleged that GHE directly interfered with the licensing process and instructed the Ministry of Tourism not to issue a permanent license and further alleged that it had been denied its Option to Buy. The expropriation claim is based on the alleged interference by GHE with the licensing process and the denial of its Option to Buy. As mentioned above, the Claimant's claim before the Cairo Arbitral Tribunal and the Egyptian local courts were based on GHE's alleged refusal to accept the Claimant's development plans and interference with the licensing process, and complaining of GHE's failure to honor the alleged Option to Buy. The bases of both the expropriation and the contractual claims are therefore fundamentally the same.\n\n377.\n\nIt is also important to note that the Claimant's expropriation claim does not have an autonomous existence outside the contract. The Claimant's expropriation claim is in reality based on an alleged violation of Articles 2.7, 2.1 and 3.5 of the MOC. As set out by the Sole Arbitrator in *Pantechniki v. Albania*,\n\n*\"[the] arbitration cannot proceed on a contractual basis for the simple reason that ICSID jurisdiction must be founded on the Treaty.* [...] *Yet there comes a time when it is no longer sufficient merely to assert that a claim is founded on the Treaty. The Tribunal must determine whether the claim truly does have an autonomous existence outside the contract. Otherwise the Claimant must live with the consequences of having elected to take its grievance to the national courts\".*36\n\n*Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award, 30 July 2009 [RA-36], \u00b664.\n\n378.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the fork-in-the-road clause in Article VII 3(a) of the US-Egypt BIT is triggered in the present case and bars the Claimant from pursuing its expropriation claim before the present Arbitral Tribunal. This also applies to the Claimant's expropriation claim insofar as it is based on an alleged lack of support of, and/or failure to intervene by, the Ministry of Tourism. These allegations share fundamentally the same factual basis as, and therefore cannot be considered separable from, the Claimant's claims against GHE and EGOTH.\n\n379.\n\nSimilarly, the breaches that allegedly violate the FET standard - the breach of the Option to Buy, failure to accept the development plans, failure to assist the Claimant in obtaining licenses as result of GHE's alleged interference and instructions to the Ministry of Tourism - were raised as counterclaims by the Claimant both in the Cairo Arbitration and before the Egyptian local courts. Moreover, the Claimant's complaints regarding the Respondent's purported refusal to accept the Option to Buy were also raised before the Cairo Arbitral Tribunal and the Egyptian local courts. In fact the Egyptian local courts did not decide on this issue, on the basis that it had been held by the Cairo Arbitral Tribunal that the Option to Buy did not exist.\n\n380.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to the Claimant's Observation of Obligations claim, its Arbitrary and/or Discriminatory Treatment claim as well as the Minimum Standard of Treatment claim. The Claimant claims that the Respondent systematically rejected all of the Claimant's development plans and refused to grant it a permanent operating license based on GHE's objections, which according to the Claimant constitutes a discriminatory and arbitrary measure under the US-Egypt BIT, and is also in breach of the Respondent's Observations of Obligations and the Minimum Standard of Treatment provisions of the Treaty. As it has been demonstrated throughout the proceedings by the Claimant itself, the Cairo Arbitration concerned among other things GHE's alleged breach of the MOC by its failure to accept the development plans, and the failure of the Ministry of Tourism to issue a permanent operating license on the basis of GHE's alleged interference and instructions to the Ministry. Additionally, the Egyptian local proceedings, all in which the Claimant was an active participant, were based on *inter alia*, GHE's alleged refusal to accept the Claimant's development plans and its interference with the licensing process.\n\n381.\n\nOnce again, the Tribunal observes that these treaty claims have the same fundamental basis and share the same factual components as the claims filed before the Cairo Arbitral Tribunal and the Egyptian local courts.\n\n382.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept claims which are fundamentally based on the very same facts and, contrary to what the Claimant alleges, on the very same contract relied upon by the Claimant in support of the claims submitted before the Cairo Arbitral Tribunal and Egyptian local courts. Accepting the Claimant's argument would deprive Article VII 3(a) of the Treaty of any meaning and effect.\n\n383.\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with the Respondent's argument37 that where, as in the present arbitration, jurisdiction is allegedly based on the conduct of an entity with legal personality separate from the respondent State - pursuant to a *prima facie* standard that there is a dispute with the respondent State - the same standard must apply to the tribunal's assessment of all jurisdictional conditions and limitations, including a fork-in-the-road clause. This position is reinforced by the Arbitral Tribunal in *Helnan v. Arab Republic of Egypt*38 which held that:\n\n\" [...] *it is HELNAN's position that the initiation of the Cairo arbitration proceedings is one of EGYPT's breaches of its obligations to provide fair and equitable treatment to the investors. Thus it is not without some contradiction that HELNAN relies on the own legal personality of EGOTH, distinct from the Egyptian State, for the sole purpose of denying the alleged res judicata effect of the Cairo Award\"*.\n\nThe Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, \u00b6381, p.166.\n\n*Helnan International Hotels A/S v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Award, 3 July 2008 [RA-124], \u00b6127.\n\n384.\n\nWhether or not the Respondent was *per se* a party to the local arbitration, the Claimant is not permitted to re-litigate issues that were submitted for resolution to the Cairo Arbitral Tribunal and the Egyptian Courts. Such a finding does not contradict, for the reasons set out below and those advanced by the Respondent at the Hearing,39 the Respondent's position that GHE and EGOTH are not State entities.\n\nHT, 8 November 2013, p. 987, 988.\n\n385.\n\nIn conclusion, the fork-in-the-road provision has been triggered in the present case, and as a consequence the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide on the Claimant's above-mentioned treaty claims.\n\n386.\n\nAlso, as a consequence of the operation of the fork-in-the road clause, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide on the validity of the Option to Buy.\n\n387.\n\nIn any event, with respect to Claimant's claims resulting from the acts and omissions of GHE and EGOTH, the Tribunal considers that GHE and EGOTH are commercial companies with a separate legal identity and, as such, do not constitute State organs even if they are owned by the State. In order for the Respondent to be responsible for the conduct of GHE and EGOTH, the latter must have been granted the right to exercise public powers (*puissance publique*), and the claims must have arisen out of the alleged exercise of such powers.40 The Claimant has failed to provide evidence of either in the present arbitration. The Tribunal concludes therefore that the Respondent in any event cannot be held liable for the conduct of GHE and EGOTH, which is not attributable to the State.\n\n\"Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of its Fifty Third Session\", *Yearbook of the International Law Commission*, UN Doc. A/CN.4/SER.A/2001/Add.1 (Part 2), 2001, p. 39\n\n**B. THE CORRUPTION CLAIMS**\n----------------------------\n\n388.\n\nConcerning the corruption claims, the Tribunal notes that these claims have not been brought before the Cairo Arbitral Tribunal or the Egyptian local courts, and consequently are not excluded by the fork-in-the-road provision. The Tribunal has therefore jurisdiction to decide on the corruption claims.\n\n389.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant argues that the Respondent refuses to address the issue of the unlawful solicitations made by the GHE and EGOTH officials within the fair and equitable treatment standard. But according to the Claimant, these bribery solicitations demonstrate the complete failure of the Respondent's State apparatus to protect and defend H&H's legitimate expectation of a fair legal framework for its investment. The Claimant claims that *\"exercising a State\u2019s discretion on the basis of corruption is a fundamental breach of transparency and legitimate expectations\"*.\n\n390.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the corruption allegations are a very serious matter, particularly against government officials, as they involve criminal conduct and therefore cannot be taken lightly. By the same token, because of the gravity of such allegations, the evidentiary threshold must be high.\n\n391.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed carefully the evidence presented by the Claimant which includes the statements made by [...], and which the Claimant filed to support its corruption allegations against the State of Egypt. The Claimant has argued throughout the proceedings that the Respondent failed to take any measures against the bribery solicitations made by GHE and EGOTH officials. However, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant failed to satisfy the burden of proof because the evidence presented, in the view of the Tribunal fail to support the corruption claims against the Respondent, and there is no evidence that the solicitations are attributable to the State. In any event and as concluded in paragraph 389 above, there can be no liability by the Respondent since the conduct GHE and EGOTH is not attributable to the State.\n\n392.\n\nMoreover, even if the Tribunal were to assume for the sake of argument that the corruption claims stand and it is established that the Respondent failed to take the necessary measures against the bribery solicitations, the Tribunal concludes that these corruption claims would not constitute a breach of the US-Egypt BIT. Even if the Tribunal were to accept the Claimant's allegations of corruption at face value, they do not support a claim for a breach of the Treaty.\n\n393.\n\nThe Claimant must establish that the bribe solicitations resulted in the deprivation of its investment, which in the view of the Tribunal the Claimant has failed to do.\n\n394.\n\nThe Claimant not only claims that bribery solicitations were made by GHE and EGOTH officials, but it also alleges that the Respondent did not take the necessary steps to curb the actions of these officials - which is fundamentally the basis for the Claimant's Corruption claims - and, as a consequence, the Claimant allegedly was not able to realize its investment.\n\n395.\n\nThe Claimant's Corruption claim raises the issue of whether the required causal link exists between the alleged bribery and the Claimant's loss of its investment. The evidence does not appear to establish any such link, and the Claimant does not appear to have alleged that the solicitation of bribes by GHE officials was linked with the difficulties the Claimant experienced in its attempts to obtain the operating license and to have the development plan approved. In other words, the Claimant does not appear to have alleged, and there is no evidence, that GHE and EGOTH officials intentionally created difficulties for the Claimant, in order to put themselves in a position to solicit bribes in exchange of removing those difficulties. Also, while the Claimant argues that the Ministry of Tourism, as the competent supervisory authority, failed to take effective measures to repair the damage caused, it appears that the two individuals concerned were removed from their positions, and there does not appear to be sufficient evidence of a causal link between the bribery solicitation and the Claimant's loss of its investment.\n\n396.\n\nNotwithstanding the Tribunal's finding that the fork-in-the-road provision was triggered in the present case in relation to most of the Claimant's claims, it has been demonstrated during the proceedings and through the Parties' own submissions and evidence that the Claimant was unable to realize its investment for reasons of its own inability to fulfill its obligations under the MOC, which included among other things improving the existing facilities and the Hotel to a four-star standard. One of the reasons behind the Ministry of Tourism's refusal to grant the Claimant a permanent operating license that would have permitted the Claimant to continue its investment on the Resort was that, as demonstrated by the evidence, the Claimant failed to meet the required conditions to obtain a permanent operating license.\n\n397.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimant's argument that the bribe solicitations had deprived the Claimant of its investment, since there is no proven connection between the corruption allegations and the Claimant's alleged deprivation from its investment. For this, the Claimant would have needed to demonstrate, as the Tribunal pointed out at the Hearing,41 that the bribes in question were solicited to undo wrongful acts adverse to the Claimant, as opposed to undo rightful acts adverse to the Claimant. Yet, this was not established by the Claimant.\n\nHT, 6 November 2013, pp. 497-498.\n\n398.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant alleges the solicitation of bribes by GHE and EGOTH officials, but on the Claimant's own case, the Respondent has investigated the alleged bribery attempts by GHE and EGOTH officials reported by [...], which resulted in the forced retirement of the GHE and EGOTH officials concerned. There are no allegations of damage sustained in the meantime, and thus here again no causation demonstrated.\n\n399.\n\nIn other words, assuming for the sake of argument that the conduct of GHE and EGOTH officials were attributable to the State, this would still not be sufficient to hold the Respondent liable therefor in the absence of a proven causal link between the alleged breach and the damage.\n\n**C. DENIAL OF JUSTICE AND DENIAL OF EFFECTIVE MEANS**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n400.\n\nAs to the Claimant's allegation of denial of justice and denial of effective means, the Tribunal points out that its role is not to correct procedural or substantive errors that might have been committed by the local courts in Egypt. As explained by Jan Paulsson in his book *Denial of Justice in International Law*42, the international obligation on states is not to create a perfect system of justice but a system of justice where serious errors are avoided or corrected. The Tribunal also stresses that the evidentiary threshold to establish a claim of denial of justice is high.\n\nJan Paulsson, *Denial of Justice in International Law*, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 306.\n\n401.\n\nIn the present proceedings, the Claimant claims that the Cairo Court of Appeals decided in 2001 that only the Claimant's claims were *res judicata*, but that the same principle did not apply to GHE recession claims, and on this basis the Cairo Court of Appeals held itself free to determine GHE's claim seeking the termination of the MOC.\n\n402.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to the definition of denial of justice in Article 9 of the Harvard Law School Draft Convention on the Law of the Responsibility of States for Damages Done in Their Territory to the Person or Property of Foreigners:\n\n\" A *state is responsible if an injury to an alien results from a denial of justice. Denial of justice exists when there is a denial, unwarranted delay or obstruction of access to courts, gross deficiency in the administration* *of judicial or remedial process, failure to provide those guarantees which are generally considered indispensable in the proper administration of justice, or a manifestly unjust judgment. An error of a national court which does not produce manifest injustice is not a denial of justice\"*.\n\n403.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant has failed to prove that the decision of the Cairo Court of Appeals amounted to a denial of justice. Even if the Tribunal were to assume for the sake of argument that the decision was as erroneous and defective as the Claimant claims, the Claimant has failed to prove that the decision of the Cairo Court of Appeals was \"manifestly unjust\", or that there had been a \"gross deficiency\" in the administration of the process, resulting in a denial of justice. The evidence presented by the Parties, including the Claimant's own submissions confirm, if anything, that the Claimant had the opportunity not only to participate in the local proceedings but also to present its claims and counterclaims.\n\n404.\n\nThe Tribunal finds support for its decision in the interpretation of denial of justice in the ICSID case *Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investment BV v. Republic of Kazakhstan*43, where the Tribunal concluded *\"that Respondent can only be held liable for denial of justice if Claimants are able to prove that the court system fundamentally failed. Such failure is mainly to be held established in cases of major procedural errors such as lack of due process. The substantive outcome of a case can be relevant as an indication of lack of due process and thus can be considered as an element to prove denial of justice\"*.\n\n*Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investment BV v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/14, Award, 22 June 2010 (Excerpts) [RA-224], \u00b6279.\n\n405.\n\nConcerning the delay by the Court of Cassation as a basis for a denial of justice claim, the Tribunal notes that neither the Treaty nor international law establishes fixed time limits. This position was reinforced by the arbitral tribunal in *Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A. v. Republic of Lebanon*, which was referred to by the Claimant44. The tribunal rightly stated that *\"[i]t has to be conceded that international law has no strict standards to assess whether court delays are* *a denial of justice.* [...] *In fact, whether justice is rendered within a reasonable delay depends on the circumstances and the context of the case\"*.\n\n*Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A. v. Republic of Lebanon*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 September 2009 [CLA- 87], \u00b6\u00b6155 and 163.\n\n406.\n\nIt appears in the present case that the Claimant did not actively pursue its claim before the Court of Cassation filed in 2001 until its withdrawal in 2010. The Claimant has failed to provide any evidence to the contrary, and has also failed to prove that the delay in the proceedings of the Court of Cassation had caused any of the losses claimed by the Claimant. In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that this delay does not amount to a denial of justice. The same reasoning applies to the Claimant's claim for denial of effective means.\n\n**XI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n407.\n\nBoth Parties have claimed costs in this arbitration and filed short submissions quantifying their fees and costs. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award\"*.\n\n408.\n\nThe Claimant seeks reimbursement of USD 8,301,882.51 in costs of legal representation and USD 803,988.33 in other costs, USD 571,998 in costs of experts, as well as reimbursement of its advance payment of USD 450,000 for the costs of arbitration and any further advance payments that might need to be made.\n\n409.\n\nThe Respondent claims USD 1,035,911.79 in costs of legal fees and expenses, USD $279,893.22 in expert fees and expenses and USD 40,328.15 in other costs, as well as reimbursement of its advance payment of USD 225,000 for the costs of arbitration.\n\n410.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant was partially successful in the preliminary jurisdictional phase of the proceedings on the issues of *jurisdiction ratione materiare, ratione temporis, ratione personae* and equitable prescription. On the other hand, the Claimant has failed to prove that all of its claims are not fundamentally different from claims already brought in other proceedings, and therefore not barred by the fork-in-the-road clause. The Claimant also failed to succeed on its corruption and denial of justice claims.\n\n411.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the Parties have argued their positions and filed their submissions diligently and in good faith throughout the proceedings.\n\n412.\n\nThe Tribunal decides, based on the above considerations, that each Party shall bear its own legal expenses and costs.\n\n413.\n\nIn relation to the direct costs and expenses of the arbitration, the Tribunal notes that by letter of 11 April 2012, the Centre requested each Party to make an advance payment in the amount of USD 200,000. On 28 May 2012, the Centre received the Claimant's share in the amount of USD 200,000 as payment for its share of the third request for funds. On 28 October 2013 and following several reminders, the Respondent informed the Centre that due to the current situation in Egypt the Respondent was unable to pay its share of the advance payment. In light of the Respondent's default of payment, the Centre, in accordance with Regulation 14(3)(d) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, invited either Party to proceed with the payment of the outstanding amount. On January 17, 2014, the Centre confirmed receipt of USD 200,000 from the Claimant as payment of the Respondent's share.\n\n414.\n\nIn light of the outcome of the Award and since the Respondent has been successful on all the claims on the merits, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent shall bear direct costs of this arbitration proceeding in the amount of USD 225,000. The remaining direct costs of the proceeding shall be borne by the Claimant.\n\n**XII. AWARD**\n--------------\n\n415.\n\nFor the forgoing reasons the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(a) The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims, with the exception of the Corruption claim, the Denial of Justice claim and the Denial of Effective Means claim;\n\n(b) Accordingly, all of the Claimant's claims with the exception of the Corruption claim, the Denial of Justice claim and the Denial of Effective Means claim are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction;\n\n(c) The Claimant's claim for Corruption is dismissed on the merits;\n\n(d) The Claimant's claims for Denial of Justice and Denial of Effective Means are dismissed on the merits;\n\n(e) The Claimant and the Respondent shall each bear their own costs in full, without recourse to each other; and\n\n(f) The Respondent shall bear direct costs of this arbitration proceeding in the amount of USD 225,000. The remaining direct costs of the proceeding shall be borne by the Claimant."}]}
