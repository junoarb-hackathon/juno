Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis procedural order deals with the question whether the Mosquera Submission may be admitted as an *amicus curiae* submission of a non-disputing party in the sense of Article 10.20.3 of the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (the \"**Treaty**\") and ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal will first summarize the Mosquera Submission to the extent necessary to decide on its admissibility (**B.**) and the Parties' comments in this regard (**C.**). Thereafter, the Tribunal will consider whether to admit the Mosquera Submission as *amicus curiae* submission of a non-disputing party (**D.**).\n\n**B. Summary of the Mosquera Submission**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nMr. Mosquera submits that he is a Colombian lawyer and the founder of the law firm V\u00edctor Mosquera Mar\u00edn Abogados SAS in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia.\n\n4.\n\nMr. Mosquera describes the purpose of his submission as *\"providing relevant information and necessary evidence that shows that Mr. \u00c1ngel Samuel Seda has given false testimony in this lawsuit, not only generating serious damage to* [Mr. Mosquera's] *human rights to dignity, honor, good name, and* [his] *professional work as a lawyer, but shows that the structural basis of the claim is built on false information that seeks to mislead the Arbitrators.\"*\n\n5.\n\nMr. Mosquera contends that on 30 November 2015, his law firm assumed the defense of Mr. Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Vanegas and his family for the kidnapping and disposition of their lands by a criminal organization known as \"*Oficina de Envigado*\". Mr. Mosquera claims that he represents Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas in proceedings before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Superior Court of Bogot\u00e1, the Colombian criminal courts and vis-\u00e0-vis the Attorney General's office.\n\n6.\n\nMr. Mosquera asserts that Mr. Seda has generated serious damage to Mr. Mosquera's human rights and professional reputation and mislead the Tribunal on the facts upon which his claims in this arbitration are based, namely: (i) the alleged extortion suffered by Mr. Seda; (ii) the veracity of the kidnapping of Mr. Sebasti\u00e1n L\u00f3pez; (iii) inconsistencies in Mr. Seda's story; and (iv) the human rights obligations of Mr. Seda's Royal Property Group.\n\n7.\n\nMr. Mosquera's submission is accompanied by 28 factual exhibits.\n\n**C. Summary of the Parties' comments**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**I. Claimants' comments**\n--------------------------\n\n8.\n\nClaimants request that the Tribunal disregard the Mosquera Submission as an *amicus curiae* brief. In the alternative, Claimants request that if the Tribunal were to permit Mr. Mosquera to participate as *amicus curiae* in this arbitration, he must provide an undertaking to comply with the Tribunal's decision on costs.\n\n9.\n\nClaimants submit that Mr. Mosquera's submission should be disregarded on the basis that he did not apply for leave to submit an *amicus curiae* brief and did not establish the requirements set forth in the Treaty and the ICSID Convention, as it is the applicant's burden.\n\n10.\n\nIn any event, Claimants submit that Mr. Mosquera fails to meet the criteria for *amicus curiae* submissions under the Treaty and ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).\n\n11.\n\n*First*, Claimants argue that Mr. Mosquera's views cannot assist the Tribunal as he refers to matters \u2013 or purports to provide evidence on issues \u2013 that are not within the scope of the dispute, namely (i) Mr. Seda's extortion; (ii) the veracity of the kidnapping story by Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas; and (iii) allegations that Mr. Seda failed to accord certain human rights to Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas.\n\n12.\n\nIn Claimants' view, the Mosquera Submission largely corroborates the events surrounding Mr. Seda's extortion and provides the same correspondence as already adduced by Claimants. Claimants argue that Mr. Mosquera's unsupported and unsworn assertion that he and his client did not extort Mr. Seda has little probative value without the possibility to cross-examine him.\n\n13.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants argue that the \"*veracity of the kidnapping\"* of Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' son is not in dispute in the arbitration as Respondent puts forth alternate rationales for the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.\n\n14.\n\nClaimants also reject Mr. Mosquera's allegations that Mr. Seda violated the human rights of Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas (e.g., by refusing to negotiate with him and failing to detect his relationship to the Meritage Property). In Claimants' view, these allegations fall outside the scope of the dispute.\n\n15.\n\n*Second*, Claimants contend that Mr. Mosquera has no significant interest in this arbitration as he merely attempts to \"*rehabilitate his image after his dalliance with a narco-trafficker and extortionist\"*. According to Claimants, this arbitration does not concern Mr. Mosquera's rights in any way.\n\n16.\n\n*Third*, Claimants argue that the Mosquera Submissions threatens to disrupt the proceeding and prejudice Claimants by forcing them to divert substantial time and resources to rebut Mr. Mosquera's allegations. In Claimants' view, this would create a procedural imbalance as they would have to respond to the arguments of two parties.\n\n17.\n\n*Fourth,* Claimants submit that Mr. Mosquera's failure to \"*identify any person or entity that has provided, or will provide, any financial or other assistance*\" under the Treaty, by itself, precludes the admission of his submission.\n\n18.\n\nClaimants submit that the procedurally appropriate manner for Mr. Mosquera to make his submissions would have been to appear as Respondent's witness, not as *amicus curiae.* Claimants argue that his statements \u2013 such as his account of otherwise unrecorded meetings \u2013 are *\"of no value unless he swears to them and is ready to defend them through relevant disclosures and upon cross-examination\"*.\n\n19.\n\nClaimants further argue that the circumstances of the Mosquera Submission are highly unusual. Among other things, Claimants submit that there is no plausible reason for Mr. Mosquera to support Respondent's position in this case as his client's interests are not aligned with those of Respondent. Furthermore, Claimants argue that Mr. Mosquera did not explain what materials of this arbitration he had reviewed and how he came into possession of some of the documents attached to his submission, including the recordings of interviews conducted by the Attorney General's Office in criminal investigation no. 70278 that Respondent did not produce in these proceedings.\n\n20.\n\nFinally, in reply to Respondent's additional observations of 3 November 2021, Claimants reject Respondent's assertion that they had improperly commented on the *amicus* submission. In their view, the Tribunal's request for comments was not limited and it granted the Parties an additional week to prepare their comments after the accompanying evidence to the Mosquera Submission became available. Accordingly, Claimants submit that Respondent's request to strike from the record some of Claimants' comments should be denied.\n\n**II. Respondent's comments**\n-----------------------------\n\n21.\n\nRespondent takes the view that it is within the Tribunal's discretion to admit the Mosquera Submission on the record, if the Tribunal determines that it might be of assistance in its analysis of the dispute and that Mr. Mosquera has a significant interest in intervening as *amicus curiae* in these proceedings.\n\n22.\n\nRespondent submits that it had not been contacted by Mr. Mosquera in connection with these proceedings and was unaware of his intention to make such a submission until receiving the communication of the ICSID Secretariat of 16 October 2021.\n\n23.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Tribunal may admit the submission after determining that the three conditions set forth in ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) are met and ensuring that the admission does not disrupt the proceedings or unduly or unfairly prejudice either Party.\n\n24.\n\nRespondent submits that the Mosquera Submission provides information pertaining to the investigations carried out by the Attorney General's Office regarding Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' complaint of land dispossession and offers Mr. Mosquera's own rendition of the facts regarding his and his client's communications with Mr. Seda contradicting Claimants' allegations of extortion. Respondent argues that the Mosquera Submission seems, on its face, to concern factual or legal issues related to the arbitration and address matters within the scope of this dispute.\n\n25.\n\nAs regards the required significant interest of the non-disputing party, Respondent notes that investment tribunals have required the applicant's interest to go beyond a mere general interest in the arbitration. Respondent argues that on its face, Mr. Mosquera's submission appears to meet this test but it remains to be determined by the Tribunal whether Mr. Mos-quera's interest meets the requirement of significance under the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Respondent suggests that the Tribunal should evaluate the specificity and significance of Mr. Mosquera's interests *\"in view of the circumstances of the case and the impact that the Tribunal's award might have on said interests.\"*\n\n26.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal decides to admit the Mosquera Submission, Respondent submits that such admission should be subject to two provisos: first, the admission may not unduly disrupt the arbitral proceedings; second, the admission is subject to Mr. Mosquera's identification of any person or entity that has provided, or will provide, any financial or other assistance in preparing the submission.\n\n27.\n\nIn its additional observations on Claimants' comments of 3 November 2021, Respondent rejects Claimants' suggestions that it improperly attempted to introduce Mr. Mosquera's witness testimony or the accompanying evidence in these proceedings. Respondent recalls that it had not been in contact with Mr. Mosquera in connection with these proceedings prior to the filing of his submission and that its counsel is not privy to the information contained in the file of criminal investigation no. 70278.\n\n28.\n\nFinally, Respondent requests the Tribunal to strike from the record sections 3 to 5 of Claimants' comments of 1 November 2021. In Respondent's submission, these unsolicited submissions touch upon the merits of the dispute which, in its view, undermines the equality of arms in the arbitration and places an undue burden on Respondent as it has not been in a position to address Claimants' additional submissions on the merits.\n\n**D. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Parties agree that Article 10.20.3 of the Treaty and ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) set out the applicable legal standard for the Tribunal to accept and consider an *amicus curiae* submission from a person or entity that is not a disputing party.\n\n30.\n\nArticle 10.20.3 of the Treaty reads in its relevant part:\n\n***Article 10.20: Conduct of the Arbitration***\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*3. The tribunal shall have the authority to accept and consider amicus curiae submissions from a person or entity that is not a disputing party. Each submission shall identify the author and any person or entity that has provided, or will provide, any financial or other assistance in preparing the submission.*\n\n31.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) provides:\n\n***Rule 37 Visits and Inquiries; Submissions of Non-disputing Parties***\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*(2) After consulting both parties, the Tribunal may allow a person or entity that is not a party to the dispute (in this Rule called the \"non-disputing party\") to file a written submission with the Tribunal regarding a matter within the scope of the dispute. In determining whether to allow such a filing, the Tribunal shall consider, among other things, the extent to which:*\n\n*(a) the non-disputing party submission would assist the Tribunal in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties;*\n\n*(b) the non-disputing party submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute;*\n\n*(c) the non-disputing party has a significant interest in the proceeding.*\n\n*The Tribunal shall ensure that the non-disputing party submission does not disrupt the proceeding or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either party, and that both parties are given an opportunity to present their observations on the non-disputing party submission.*\n\n32.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) requires a non-disputing party to apply for leave before submitting a written submission. Mr. Mosquera has not complied with that requirement as he filed his written submission, supported by accompanying evidence, without seeking prior leave from the Tribunal.\n\n33.\n\nIn his submission, Mr. Mosquera does not request any relief from the Tribunal. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that it is sufficiently clear both from the submission itself and the accompanying email (bearing the subject line \"*Amicus Curiae in favor of the Republic of Colombia*\") that it was Mr. Mosquera's intention to make an *amicus curiae* submission, as envisaged under the Treaty and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and to have it admitted to the record of this arbitration. While Mr. Mosquera would have been required to seek leave before filing an *amicus curiae* submission, the Tribunal considers that his submission should not be disregarded for that reason alone. Consequently, the Tribunal will assess the admissibility based on a *prima facie* review of the submission.\n\n34.\n\nIn exercising its discretion whether to admit the *amicus curiae* submission, the Tribunal will, as suggested by both Parties, consider the criteria explicitly mentioned in Article 10.20.3 of the Treaty and ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).\n\n**I. Disclosure of financial or other assistance**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nArticle 10.20.3 of the Treaty requires disclosure of \"*any person or entity that has provided, or will provide, any financial or other assistance in preparing the submission.\"* As both Parties pointed out in their comments on the Mosquera Submission, Mr. Mosquera has not complied with this Treaty requirement.\n\n36.\n\nIn particular, it remains unclear if and to what extent Mr. Mosquera's client, Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas, has authorized, funded or otherwise assisted in the preparation of the submission.\n\n37.\n\nOn the one hand*,* Mr. Mosquera appears to have filed the submission in his own name, claiming that Mr. Seda violated Mr. Mosquera's human rights and discredited his professional work as a lawyer (Mosquera Submission, p. 4, 10-11). Furthermore, Mr. Mosquera did not explicitly indicate that he acted on behalf of his client and did not produce a power of attorney.\n\n38.\n\nOn the other hand, the Mosquera Submission makes numerous references to Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' rights (see e.g., pp. 11, 19) and the actions that Mr. Mosquera took as lawyer on behalf of his client (see e.g., pp. 5 et seq.). Moreover, Mr. Mosquera submits legal arguments as to why certain persons and entities, including Mr. Seda, were allegedly obliged to \"*repair the damage caused to Mr. Iv\u00e1n Lopez and his family*\" (Mosquera Submission, p. 18).\n\n39.\n\nIn view of this, it is not clear to the Tribunal whether Mr. Mosquera acted in his own name and/or on behalf of his client and whether he received any financial or other assistance in preparing the submission. Without disclosure of these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the Mosquera Submission may not be admitted pursuant to Article 10.20.3 of the Treaty.\n\n**II. Address a matter within the scope of the dispute**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nNotwithstanding this, the Tribunal will analyze whether the criteria set forth in ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) would be fulfilled. The Tribunal will begin its analysis with the second criterion (lit. b), according to which the Tribunal shall, in exercising its discretion, consider the extent to which the non-disputing party submission would address a matter within the scope of the dispute.\n\n41.\n\nThe Mosquera Submission broadly addresses four issues: (i) the interactions between Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas, Mr. Mosquera and Mr. Seda and the alleged extortion of Mr. Seda; (ii) the alleged kidnapping of Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' son; (iii) the history of the Meritage Property and the due diligence performed by Mr. Seda; and (iv) the alleged violation of the human rights of Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas and his family by the Royal Property Group.\n\n42.\n\nBased on a preliminary review of the Mosquera Submission, the Tribunal considers that issue (iv) falls outside the scope of the present dispute. The Tribunal notes that it does not fall within its jurisdiction to address any alleged human rights violations that Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas and his family may have suffered by the actions or inactions of the Royal Property Group in their acquisition of the Meritage Project. Consequently, Mr. Mosquera's legal submissions on the existence of *\"internal mechanisms or policies that allow respecting, protecting, remedying or claiming the violation of human rights committed against Mr. Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and his family, as required by international standards\"* (Mosquera Submission, p. 19) do not fall within the scope of this dispute either.\n\n43.\n\nAs regards the remaining issues (i), (ii) and (iii), the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that they *prima facie* address matters within the scope of the dispute.\n\n**III. Assist in the determination of a factual or legal issue**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nTurning to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) lit. a, the Tribunal will now consider whether the admission of the Mosquera Submission would assist it in the determination of a factual or legal issue related to the proceeding by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from the disputing Parties.\n\n**a) Alleged extortion of Mr. Seda**\n------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both Parties have extensively addressed the interactions between Mr. Seda and Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas and the alleged extorsion of Mr. Seda in their written submissions (Memorial on the Merits and Damages, paras. 85 et seq.; Reply, paras. 48 et seq.; Counter Memorial, paras. 93 et seq.).\n\n46.\n\nWhen it comes to Mr. Mosquera's personal recollection of meetings or other facts, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that Mr. Mosquera would have to be called as a witness, with the possibility of testing the probity of his testimony by (cross-) examination in accordance with Section 18 of Procedural Order No. 1, if his testimony were to be considered in the Tribunal's assessment of the evidence. Insofar as Mr. Mosquera claims to have a hostile relationship with the then head of the Attorney General's Office and the then Deputy Attorney General, the documentary evidence provided by Mr. Mosquera is available in the public domain.\n\n**b) Alleged kidnapping of Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' son**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while Claimants argue that Respondent justified the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings against the Meritage Property with the alleged kidnapping of Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' son (Memorial on the Merits and Damages, paras. 11-12; Reply, para. 333), Respondent submits that \"[w]*hether Mr. L\u00f3pez Betancur was kidnapped or not is irrelevant for purposes of the Asset Forfeiture Process*\" (Counter Memorial, para. 141).\n\n48.\n\nBased on a review of the submissions currently before it, and without prejudice to any future decision on this issue, the Tribunal concludes that the question of whether Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' son was kidnapped is not in dispute between the Parties. Consequently, the Tribunal considers that Mr. Mosquera's submissions in this respect would not assist it in its analysis of the relevant factual and legal issues.\n\n**c) History of the Meritage Property and due diligence**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nLikewise, the Tribunal notes that the history of the Meritage Property and the due diligence performed by Claimants have already been discussed in the Parties' submissions in detail (Memorial on the Merits and Damages, paras. 56 et seq.; Reply, paras. 13 et seq.; Counter Memorial, paras. 68 et seq.). The Tribunal is of the view that these factual and legal issues can be adequately addressed by the Parties and their counsel and that the Mosquera Submission would not provide further assistance in the determination of these issues.\n\n50.\n\nInsofar as Mr. Mosquera relies on newspaper articles reporting on criminal proceedings against the alleged previous owners of the Meritage Property to support his assertion that *\"the property of 'Meritage' has a clear mafia tradition that gave the State of Colombia the right to start a case for domain extinction\"* (Mosquera Submission, p. 10), Mr. Mosquera does not provide a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from the Parties. The same applies to Mr. Mosquera's comments on a public radio interview with Mr. Seda.\n\n51.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal considers that it would not be assisted by Mr. Mosquera's comments on and production of transcripts and video recordings of selected summons and interviews conducted by the Attorney General's Office in the context of criminal investigations. Mr. Mosquera does not disclose how he obtained these documents and it remains unclear if and to what extent Mr. Mosquera was personally involved in these summons and interviews and can provide a unique perspective that is different from that of the disputing Parties.\n\n52.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that Mr. Mosquera's submission would not be of assistance in the Tribunal's determination of the factual and legal issues at stake.\n\n**IV. Significant interest in the proceeding**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal will assess whether Mr. Mosquera has established that he has a significant interest in this arbitration as required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) lit. c.\n\n54.\n\nIn their comments on the Mosquera Submission, both Parties have stressed that the nondisputing party's interest must go beyond a mere general interest in the arbitration and relied on the decision of the *Apotex v. USA* tribunal which held:1\n\n*To meet this requirement, the applicant needs to show that he has more than a \"general\" interest in the proceeding. For example, the applicant must demonstrate that the outcome of the arbitration may have a direct or indirect impact on the rights or principles the applicant represents and defends.*\n\n*Apotex Holdings Inc and Apotex Inc. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/1, Procedural Order on the Participation of the Applicant, Mr. Barry Appleton, as a Non-Disputing Party, para. 38.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of Respondent's submission that *\"it remains to be determined, in light of the specific circumstances of the case, whether Mr. Mosquera Mar\u00edn's interest meets the requirement of significance under the ICSID Rules\"* and that *\"it is within the Tribunal's discretion to evaluate the specificity and significance of the interests as provided in the NDP Submission, in view of the circumstances of the case and the impact that the Tribunal's award might have on said interest\"* (Respondent's letter of 1 November 2021, p. 4). The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the significance of an applicant's interest can only be evaluated in view of the specific circumstances of the case.\n\n56.\n\nIn the present case, Mr. Mosquera has motivated his submission in the following terms (Mosquera Submission, p. 4):\n\n*Thus, this time I am writing you with the purpose of providing relevant information and necessary evidence that shows that Mr. \u00c1ngel Samuel Seda has given false testimony in this lawsuit, not only generating serious damage to my human rights to dignity, honor, good name, and my professional work as a lawyer, but shows that the structural basis of the claim is built on false information that seeks to mislead the Arbitrators.*\n\n57.\n\nMr. Mosquera further submits that the work that he has *\"carried out in keeping with an impeccable professional ethics\"* is discredited in a proceeding in which he is not a party and therefore lacks the effective means to defend his reputation and good name (Mosquera Submission, p. 9 et seq.).\n\n58.\n\nFrom the above, it becomes apparent that Mr. Mosquera seeks to provide the Tribunal with information showing that Mr. Seda's testimony not only violates his human rights and harms his professional reputation but also seeks to mislead the Tribunal. In the Tribunal's view, these are two distinct objectives.\n\n59.\n\nAs regards Mr. Mosquera's concern that the Tribunal should not be misled by a fact witness, the Tribunal considers that that this does not go beyond a general interest that is shared by any other person following this arbitration.\n\n60.\n\nRegarding the alleged violation of Mr. Mosquera's human rights and his professional reputation, the Tribunal recognizes that Mr. Mosquera's name is frequently mentioned in the Parties' submissions and the underlying evidence and that Claimants' accusations against him are of a serious nature. The Tribunal accepts that these allegations could potentially affect Mr. Mosquera's good name and his professional reputation as a lawyer.\n\n61.\n\nYet the Tribunal considers that this possibility does not reflect a significant interest pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) lit c and does not justify admitting him as *amicus curiae*. This is for the following reasons:\n\n62.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal is not called upon passing judgment on Mr. Mosquera's work or professional conduct as a lawyer. Rather, the Tribunal must decide whether it has jurisdiction over Claimants' claims and whether Claimants are entitled to compensation for alleged violations of the Treaty. Mr. Mosquera has not sufficiently established that the Tribunal's conclusions on these questions will have any direct or indirect impact on him.\n\n63.\n\nSecond, this Tribunal is neither the competent nor the appropriate dispute resolution body to address Mr. Mosquera's grievances against Mr. Seda. The Tribunal does not consider it to be the purpose of *amicus curiae* submissions in investor-State disputes to permit individuals that are not a party to the dispute to reply to submissions of the disputing Parties in which their name is mentioned and which they consider defamatory. While the Tribunal understands Mr. Mosquera's wish to address the allegations against him, it bears noting that he would have the possibility to seek redress for the alleged violation of his rights and the alleged damage to his professional reputation in other fora, e.g., before the domestic courts in Colombia or the United States of America.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that Mr. Mosquera has not shown a significant interest in these proceedings. Mr. Mosquera's submission does not meet the conditions set out in Article 10.20.3 of the Treaty and ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2). Consequently, neither the Mosquera Submission nor its accompanying evidence shall be admitted to the record.\n\n**V. Respondent's request to strike certain parts of Claimants' comments from the record**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nAs an ancillary issue, the Tribunal still has to decide on Respondent's request to strike from the record Sections 3 to 5 of Claimants' comments dated 1 November 2021. In Respondent's view, these sections go beyond the scope of the admissibility of the Mosquera Submission and touch upon the merits of the dispute. By contrast, Claimants argue that these sections are relevant since the issues of admissibility and the veracity of Mr. Mosquera's submission are inextricably intertwined.\n\n66.\n\nBy email dated 16 October 2021, the Tribunal invited the Parties \"*to submit any comments they may have on Mr. Mosquera Mar\u00edn's communication*\". The Tribunal notes that Sections 3 to 5 of Claimants' comments *\"address Mr. Mosquera's assertions\"* in substance \"[n]*otwithstanding the inadmissibility and impropriety of the Mosquera Submission\"*.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants that given Mr. Mosquera's decision not to seek leave before filing his submission, the issue of its admissibility could not be examined in isolation from its content. Yet in light of the Tribunal's decision not to admit the Mosquera Submission (or the accompanying evidence), the Tribunal believes that these comments are no longer needed and, absent the documents referred to therein, there is no reason for them to remain on the record either.\n\n**THE TRIBUNAL HEREBY ORDERS:**\n-------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\nI.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis procedural order deals with Respondent's Request for Injunctive Relief (**B.**) and Claimants' Request to Strike the New Essential Security Defence (**C.**).\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal has already dealt with Respondent's Request for Enhanced Confidentiality Measures in its Procedural Order No. 8 (**Enhanced Confidentiality Order**).\n\n**B. Respondent's Request for Injunctive Relief**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nAs regards Respondent's request to order *that any violation of the confidentiality order or any of the confidentiality terms in place in this arbitration by any Party shall give rise to injunctive relief,* the Tribunal does not deem it necessary or appropriate to issue such a pre-emptive order.\n\n4.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Respondent has not sufficiently established that future breaches of the two confidentiality orders in place are likely to occur. Furthermore, it remains unclear what kind of injunctive relief Respondent would seek in the event of a breach of confidentiality.\n\n5.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal considers it premature to declare at this stage that it will grant injunctive relief in the event of a potential breach of confidentiality.\n\n**C. Claimants' Request to Strike the New Essential Security Defence**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that Respondent's New Essential Security Defence, set out in Section II of its Rejoinder, is presented primarily as an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and, as an alternative argument, as a defence on the merits.\n\n7.\n\nSections 14.2 and 14.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, on which Claimants rely in their Request to Strike the New Essential Security Defence, provide:\n\n***14.2.*** *In the first exchange of submissions (Memorial and Counter-Memorial), the parties shall set forth all the facts and legal arguments on which they rely including any expert opinion evidence the parties submit in support of their respective cases. Allegations of fact and legal arguments shall be presented in a detailed, specified and comprehensive manner, and shall respond to all allegations of fact and legal arguments made by the other party.*\n\n***14.3.*** *In their second exchange of submissions (Reply and Rejoinder), the parties shall limit themselves to responding to allegations of fact and legal arguments made by the other party in the first exchange of submissions, unless new facts have arisen after the first exchange of submissions which justify new allegations of fact and/or legal arguments*.\n\n8.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) and (2), which deal with objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction, provides:\n\n*(1) Any objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible. A party shall file the objection with the Secretary-General no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder\u2014unless the facts on which the objection is based are unknown to the party at that time.*\n\n*(2) The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.*\n\n9.\n\nIn addition to that, ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3), which deals with time limits and which Claimants also invoke in their Request to Strike the New Essential Security Defence, stipulates:\n\n*(3) Any step taken after expiration of the applicable time limit shall be disregarded unless the Tribunal, in special circumstances and after giving the other party an opportunity of stating its views, decides otherwise.*\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that both under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) and ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3), it enjoys discretion in considering new submissions made by a Party independent of their timing.\n\n11.\n\nGiven that the Tribunal has the duty to ascertain its jurisdiction and may do so at any time, as set forth in ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2), the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to reject the New Essential Security Defence, which Respondent has primarily framed as a jurisdictional objection, as belated.1 For the purposes of assessing its admissibility, the Tribunal accepts Respondent's characterization of the New Essential Security Defence as a jurisdictional objection. At this point, the Tribunal need not take a definite view on the legal nature of Respondent's defence.\n\nCf. *AIG Capital Partners, Inc. and CJSC Tema Real Estate Company v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/6, Award of 7 October 2003 (**Exhibit CL-033**), para. 9.2; Christoph H. Schreuer et al., The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, Cambridge University Press, 2009, Article 41, paras. 40-42 (**Annex-33** to Respondent's letter of 18 March 2022).\n\n12.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, admitting the New Essential Security Defence does not unfairly prejudice Claimants or deprive them of the opportunity to make written submissions on that issue. Yet the Tribunal is sympathetic to Claimants' concerns regarding the limited amount of time remaining until the Hearing and their ongoing hearing preparations. Therefore, the Tribunal leaves it to Claimants and their counsel to decide whether they wish to file any additional submission on the New Essential Security Defence before or after the Hearing.\n\n**THE TRIBUNAL HEREBY ORDERS:**\n-------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\nI. Respondent's request for a declaration that any violation of the Enhanced Confidentiality Order or any of the confidentiality terms in place in this arbitration by any Party shall give rise to injunctive relief is **denied**.\n\nII. Claimants' request for a declaration that the New Essential Security Defence violates Respondent's duty of good faith, the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Procedural Order No. 1 is **denied**.\n\nIII. Claimants' request to strike the New Essential Security Defence from Respondent's Rejoinder is **denied**.\n\nIV. Paragraphs 974(a)-(b) of Respondent's corrected Rejoinder are **admitted** to the record.\n\nV. Claimants are **granted leave** to address the New Essential Security Defence in an additional submission to be filed, at their choice, either prior to the Hearing by 15 April 2022 or at a date after the Hearing to be determined by the Tribunal in consultation with the Parties.\n\nVI. Claimants are **invited** to indicate by 4 April 2022 whether they intend to make an additional submission on the New Essential Security Defence and, if so, whether they will do so before or after the Hearing.\n\nVII. The Tribunal **reserves** its decision on costs until the Final Award.\n\n**Place of arbitration (legal seat):** Washington, D.C."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2024-06-27T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**Table of Selected Abbreviations**\n-----------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings 2006 |\n| C-[#] | Claimants' Exhibit |\n| CL-[#] | Claimants' Legal Authority |\n| Claimants' Memorial | Claimants' Memorial on the Merits and Damages dated 15 June 2020 |\n| Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief | Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief dated 21 July 2022 |\n| Claimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense | Claimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense dated 18 April 2022 |\n| Claimants' Rebuttal on Essential Security | Claimants' Rebuttal on Essential Security dated 13 September 2022 |\n| Claimants' Reply | Claimants' Reply on Jurisdiction and Merits dated 19 September 2021 |\n| Claimants' Reply on Costs | Claimants' Reply on Costs dated 9 August 2023 |\n| Claimants' Submission on Costs | Claimants' Submission on Costs dated 26 July 2023 |\n| Claimants' Submission on U.S. Treaties and [REDACTED] | Claimants' Submission on U.S. Treaties and [REDACTED] dated 21 December 2022 |\n| FET | Fair and Equitable Treatment |\n| FPS | Full Protection and Security |\n| ICJ | International Court of Justice |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated March 18, 1965 |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| MFN | Most Favored Nation |\n| R-[#] | Respondent's Exhibit |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Respondent's Counter-Memorial | Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits dated 16 November 2020 |\n| Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief | Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief dated 25 August 2022 |\n| Respondent's Rejoinder | Respondent's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits dated 17 February 2022 |\n| Respondent's Reply on Costs | Respondent's Reply on Costs dated 9 August 2023 |\n| Respondent's Submission on Costs | Respondent's Submission on Costs dated 26 July 2023 |\n| Respondent's Submission [REDACTED] and on the U.S. Treaty Practice on Essential Security Interests Exceptions | Respondent's Submission [REDACTED] and on the U.S. Treaty Practice on Essential Security Interests Exceptions dated 21 December 2022 |\n| RL-[#] | Respondent's Legal Authority |\n| TPA or Treaty | United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, signed 22 November 2006, entry into force 15 May 2012 |\n| Tribunal | Arbitral tribunal constituted on 25 February 2020 |\n| VCLT | Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties |\n\n**A.

SUMMARY OF THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**I. Institution of the Proceedings**\n-------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 25 January 2019, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or \"**Centre**\") received a request for arbitration from Claimants of the same date (\"**Request**\") on the basis of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, signed 22 November 2006, entry into force 15 May 2012 (the \"**TPA**\" or the \"**Treaty**\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\"). The Request was submitted by the firm representing Claimants at that time, Arent Fox LLP.\n\n15.\n\nThe Centre requested clarifications from Claimants by letter of 19 February 2019. Claimants provided clarifications on 20 March 2019.\n\n16.\n\nOn 25 March 2019, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the notice of registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n17.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n18.\n\nOn 3 May 2019, following appointment by Claimants, Ms. Lucinda Low, a national of the United States, accepted her appointment as arbitrator.\n\n19.\n\nOn 12 June 2019, Claimants informed the Centre that they were no longer represented by the firm Arent Fox LLP and that they had engaged the firm Gibson Dunn LLP as new counsel.\n\n20.\n\nOn 15 June 2019, Claimants informed the Centre that, pursuant to Rule 7 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\"), they wished to replace Ms. Lucinda Low and appoint Dr. Charles Poncet, a national of Switzerland, as arbitrator. The Centre proceeded to inform Ms. Lucinda Low of the replacement and to seek Dr. Poncet's acceptance of his appointment.\n\n21.\n\nOn 24 June 2019, Dr. Charles Poncet accepted his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n22.\n\nOn 27 June 2019, following appointment by Respondent, Prof. Hugo Perezcano D\u00edaz, a national of the United Mexican States, accepted his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n23.\n\nOn 28 July 2019, the Parties informed the Centre that they had not been able to reach an agreement on the selection of the presiding arbitrator but had reached an agreement on the method for his/her selection, according to which the Parties requested the Centre to assist them in selecting a mutually agreeable presiding arbitrator.\n\n24.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed procedure, on 7 October 2019, the Centre circulated a list of five candidates in ballot form. Each Party submitted its completed ballot on 17 October 2019.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter of 18 October 2019, the Centre informed the Parties that the ballot process had not resulted in the selection of a mutually agreeable candidate and that, pursuant to the Parties' agreement, the Centre would prepare and circulate a second list of candidates in ballot form.\n\n26.\n\nOn 1 November 2019, the Parties informed the Centre that they had agreed to modify the procedure for the second round of the selection process, according to which the Centre would prepare, instead of a new ballot, a list of seven candidates for the Parties to strike and rank.\n\n27.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed procedure, on 12 December 2019, the Centre circulated the list of seven candidates and on 17 December 2019, each Party informed the Centre of the name of the candidate they each chose to strike from the list.\n\n28.\n\nOn 18 December 2019, the Centre informed the Parties of the names of the five remaining candidates for presiding arbitrator and invited them to send their ranked lists.\n\n29.\n\nOn 26 December 2019, Respondent objected to two candidates on the list and on 6 January 2020, the Centre informed the Parties that the objected candidates had decided to withdraw.\n\n30.\n\nOn 7 February 2020, the Centre circulated a new list of five candidates for the Parties to rank. Each Party submitted its ranked lists on 15 February 2020.\n\n31.\n\nOn 17 February 2022, the Centre announced that the list procedure had resulted in the appointment of Prof. Dr. Klaus Sachs, a national of Germany, as the presiding arbitrator in this case.\n\n32.\n\nOn 25 February 2020, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Sara Marzal Yetano, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**II. Arbitral Proceedings**\n----------------------------\n\n33.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 2 April 2020 by video conference. With the consent of the Parties, the Tribunal appointed Mr. Marcus Weiler as Assistant to the Tribunal. His *curriculum vitae* and a declaration of impartiality and independence were circulated to the Parties.\n\n34.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 7 April 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO1**\") recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of the Tribunal on disputed issues. PO1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington D.C., United States. PO1 also included an agreed schedule for the jurisdictional and merits phase of the proceedings (\"**Procedural Calendar**\").\n\n35.\n\nOn 25 May 2020, Claimants requested an extension for the submission of their Memorial on the Merits and Damages. Respondent submitted its agreement on 26 May 2020. On 26 May 2020, the Tribunal issued a revised Procedural Calendar which reflected the amendments resulting from the Parties' communications of 25 and 26 May 2020.\n\n36.\n\nOn 16 June 2020, Claimants submitted their Memorial on the Merits and Damages (\"**Memorial**\"), together with Appendices A to H; Exhibits C-001 to C-302; Legal Authorities CL-001 to CL-128; Witness Statements from Mr. Angel Samuel Seda and Mr. Felipe L\u00f3pez Montoya; and Expert Reports from Dr. Wilson A. Mart\u00ednez S\u00e1nchez, Dr. Carlos E. Medell\u00edn Becerra, Ms. Daniela M. Bambaci and Mr. Santiago Dellepiane A. of Berkeley Research Group.\n\n37.\n\nBy communication of 15 July 2020, Respondent informed that it would not make use of its right to request the bifurcation of the jurisdiction and merits phases and that it would address its objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction together with the merits. The Tribunal issued a revised Procedural Calendar on 20 July 2020.\n\n38.\n\nOn 18 October 2020, Respondent requested an extension for the submission of its Counter-Memorial. Claimants confirmed their agreement by communication of 19 October 2020. The Tribunal issued a revised Procedural Calendar which reflected the amendments resulting from the Parties' communications on 19 October 2020.\n\n39.\n\nOn 2 November 2020, the Tribunal issued, with the Parties' agreement, a revised Procedural Calendar which included deadlines for the submission by the United States of written submissions on matters of interpretation of the TPA pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the TPA, and for the submission of comments to any such written submissions by the Parties.\n\n40.\n\nOn 17 November 2020, Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits (\"**Counter-Memorial**\"), together with Appendix A, Exhibits R-001 to R-063; Legal Authorities RL-001 to RL-151, Witness Statements from Dr. Jos\u00e9 Iv\u00e1n Caro G\u00f3mez and Dr. Daniel Ricardo Hern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez; Expert Reports from Dr. Nilson El\u00edas Pinilla, Dr. Yesid Reyes, and Dr. Richard Hern.\n\n41.\n\nBy letter of the same date, Respondent requested that Claimants disclose the existence and identity of any third-party funder (\"**Respondent's First TPF Disclosure Application**\").\n\n42.\n\nOn 25 November 2020, Claimants objected to Respondent's disclosure request, stating that there is no rule, either in the Arbitration Rules or the TPA, that requires the disclosure of the requested information. Claimants added that in any event \"*to avoid any tactical applications that might be brought to distract from the merits of their case, Claimants confirm that any award of adverse costs in this arbitration is insured up to an amount of $5.5 million.*\"\n\n43.\n\nOn 2 December 2020, Respondent reiterated its request that Claimants disclose the existence and identity of any third-party funder, and further requested that Claimants disclose the terms of the insurance for adverse costs in this arbitration.\n\n44.\n\nOn 7 December 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it intended to deal with any request for documents related to the existence of any third-party funder in the upcoming document production phase.\n\n45.\n\nOn 14 December 2020, the Tribunal issued a revised Procedural Calendar which reflected certain amendments concerning the document production schedule.\n\n46.\n\nOn 15 January 2021, following exchanges between the Parties, each Party filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents.\n\n47.\n\nOn 18 February 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (\"**PO2**\") deciding on the Parties' requests for production of documents. Among others, the Tribunal ordered Claimants to disclose the existence and identity of a third-party funder but denied Respondent's further request for production of \"[a]*ll Documents reflecting, containing, evidencing or relating to the conditions under which the Claimants' claims are being funded, including the funding agreement and any other relevant correspondence with the funder*.\"\n\n48.\n\nOn 26 February 2021, the United States filed its written submission pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the TPA.\n\n49.\n\nOn 16 March 2021, the Tribunal issued a revised Procedural Calendar which reflected the amendments resulting from the Parties' communications of 12 and 15 March 2021. Additional changes were made to the Procedural Calendar by agreement of the Parties on 16 April 2021.\n\n50.\n\nOn 26 May 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (\"**PO3**\") concerning additional amendments to the Procedural Calendar including the hearing dates.\n\n51.\n\nOn 28 June 2021, Claimants requested the Tribunal to order Respondent to fully comply with its obligations pursuant to PO2. At the Tribunal's invitation, Respondent submitted comments on Claimant's request on 6 July 2021. On 2 August 2021, Respondent submitted further comments.\n\n52.\n\nOn 13 August 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (\"**PO4**\"), deciding on Claimants' request of 28 June 2021.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n-------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe following is a summary of the background facts that are not disputed between the Parties, or which have otherwise been established by the evidence submitted in these proceedings to the satisfaction of the Tribunal. The following summary is intended to give general overview of the present dispute and should not be taken to be exhaustive of all facts that may be relevant. Such facts may be discussed in the Tribunal's analysis below.\n\n**I. Claimants**\n----------------\n\n175.\n\nClaimants are a group of natural or juridical persons who directly or indirectly acquired shares in Lux\u00e9 by the Charlee S.A.S. (\"**Lux\u00e9**\") and / or Newport S.A.S. (\"**Newport**\"). These companies were established by Mr. Seda to allow the development of different hospitality and property projects in Colombia.12 Mr. Seda incorporated both companies and initially held shares in Lux\u00e9 and Newport; but later transferred his shares in both of these companies to his wholly owned company Royal Realty S.A.S. (\"**Royal Realty**\"), incorporated under the laws of Colombia.13\n\nFirst Witness Statement of Mr. Angel Samuel Seda, 15 June 2020 (\"**First Seda Witness Statement**\"), \u00b6 1, \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.\n\nFirst Seda Witness Statement, \u00b6 13; Exhibit C-012, Royal Realty S.A.S. Certificate of Existence and Good Standing, 20 December 2017, p. SP-0002.\n\n176.\n\nLux\u00e9 was established by Mr. Seda under the laws of Colombia on 5 April 2009 to manage the development of the Lux\u00e9 by The Charlee, a luxury resort and a residential complex.14\n\nExhibit C-249, Lux\u00e9 by The Charlee S.A.S. Certificate of Existence and Good Standing, 28 April 2020, p. SP-0002; First Seda Witness Statement, \u00b6 21.\n\n177.\n\nMr. Seda incorporated Newport under the laws of Colombia on 23 September 2009 as the developer of and the investment vehicle for the Meritage project, a community project consisting of a luxury hotel with long-term stay hotel suites, residential apartments, single-family homes, and commercial storefronts (the \"**Meritage Project**\").15\n\nExhibit C-014, Newport S.A.S. Certificate of Existence and Good Standing, 6 October 2017; First Seda Witness Statement, \u00b6 38.\n\n178.\n\nRegarding their respective investments, Claimants can be subdivided into two groups.\n\n179.\n\nThe first group contains all Claimants who acquired shares in Lux\u00e9 or in Newport directly or through another company, *i.e.*, all Claimants (Angel Samuel Seda, JTE International Investments, Jonathan M. Foley, The Boston Enterprises Trust, Stephen J. Bobeck, Brian Hass, Monte G. Adcock, Justin T. Enbody, and Justin T. Caruso).\n\n180.\n\nThe second group only comprises Claimants who bought shares in Newport, and thereby had an interest in the Meritage Project. Members of this group are Angel Samuel Seda, JTE International Investments, Jonathan M. Foley, Justin T. Enbody, and The Boston Enterprises Trust.\n\n**II. Mr. Seda's Decision to Invest in Colombia**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nMr. Seda made his decision to develop hospitality and property projects in South America, and specifically Colombia, in the end of 2006 when he sold Royal Realty U.S.'s real estate portfolio.16\n\nFirst Seda Witness Statement, \u00b6 7.\n\n**1. Colombia's and Medell\u00edn's Development**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nMr. Seda's real estate projects in Colombia were located in Medell\u00edn.\n\n183.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, large amounts of properties and land in the region were owned and controlled by drug cartels.17\n\nClaimants' Memorial on the Merits and Damages, 15 June 2020 (\"**Claimants' Memorial**\"), \u00b6 25; Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits, 16 November 2020 (\"**Respondent's Counter-Memorial**\"), \u00b6 43.\n\n184.\n\nFrom 2000 onwards, Medell\u00edn has experienced revival due to the growth of its economy in sectors such as tourism. In 2000, Colombia amended its General Regime for Foreign Investments, creating an open market for foreign investments, including by guaranteeing equal treatment and stability for foreign investments.18 Additionally, it liberated foreign investments, *inter alia*, in the real estate and hospitality sectors from the obligation of prior government authorization.19 Colombia implemented several legal reforms and policies to encourage \"*foreign investors to invest or expand existing investments in the country.*\"20 As a consequence, Colombia entered into several investment treaties with other States providing for extensive protections for foreign investments, including the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement of 2012 (\"**TPA**\" or the \"**Treaty**\").21\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 26; Exhibit C-131, Decree No. 2080 of 2000 and Amendments, 14 July 2014, Art. 2.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 26; Exhibit C-131, Decree No. 2080 of 2000 and Amendments, 14 July 2014, Arts. 1, 7; Exhibit CL-082, Hernando Otero and Enrique G\u00f3mez-Pinz\u00f3n, Colombia, in Latin American Investment Protections (2012), p. 157.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 27; Exhibit CL-082, Hernando Otero and Enrique G\u00f3mez-Pinz\u00f3n, Colombia, in Latin American Investment Protections (2012), p. 157, referring to Law 963 of 2005 and Decree 2950 of 2005.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 27; Exhibit CL-082, Hernando Otero and Enrique G\u00f3mez-Pinz\u00f3n, Colombia, in Latin American Investment Protections (2012), pp. 165-168; Exhibit CL-001, United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, signed 22 November 2006, entry into force 15 May 2012 (\"TPA\").\n\n185.\n\nDespite these positive developments, money laundering continues to be an issue in Medell\u00edn, and Colombia in general, due to the prevalence of narcotrafficking in the past.22 Studies indicate that the amounts of money laundering between 1985 and 2013 correspond to 4.7% of Colombia's GDP or, including the funds from drug trafficking, to USD 8.7 billion per year.23\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 47.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 49; Exhibit R-023, Thomas Pietschmann et al., Estimating Illicit Financial Flows Resulting from Drug Trafficking and Other Transnational Organized Crimes, Research Report, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), October 2011; Exhibit R-034, Edgar Villa et al., Illicit Activity and Money Laundering from an Economic Growth Perspective, A Model and an Application to Colombia, World Bank Group, Development Research Group, Macroeconomics and Growth Team, February 2016.\n\n**2. Mr. Seda's Investment in The Charlee Hotel**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nMr. Seda's first hospitality and property project was the development of The Charlee Hotel, a luxury hotel.\n\n187.\n\nIn 2008, Mr. Seda found an appropriate lot of land close to Lleras Park in Medell\u00edn.24 As a next step, Mr. Seda hired the law firm Enfoque Jur\u00eddico to conduct a title study.25 After the trademark \"Charlee\" was registered in Medell\u00edn on 19 January 2009, construction of The Charlee Hotel started in 2009.26 The Charlee Hotel was financed through the pre-sale of individual suites in the hotel to third-party purchasers.27 On 19 February 2009, Mr. Seda engaged the fiduciary Acci\u00f3n Sociedad Fiduciaria S.A.

Mr. Seda's and Several Claimants' Investment in the Lux\u00e9**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nIn 2009, Mr. Seda started a new project, namely the development of the Lux\u00e9 project, a luxury resort and residential complex in Guatap\u00e9 (the \"**Lux\u00e9 Project**\").32 After finding the suitable property, title studies of the property were conducted by Royal Realty in-house and Acci\u00f3n Fiduciaria externally.33\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 43.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 48; Exhibit C-088, Letter from Mar\u00eda Isabel Villegas to Juliana Montoya, attaching Study of Ownership Titles, 18 November 2009.\n\n190.\n\nThe financing of the Lux\u00e9 Project was secured via pre-sales to third-party purchasers. Thus, Mr. Seda, as representative of the Lux\u00e9, entered into a trust agreement with two companies owning the relevant land and Acci\u00f3n Fiduciaria on 14 December 2009.34\n\nExhibit C-089, Contract with Acci\u00f3n Fiduciaria for Development of Lux\u00e9 by The Charlee, 14 December 2009.\n\n191.\n\nLux\u00e9 and Royal Realty entered into a management and operation contract on 21 March 2013, pursuant to which Lux\u00e9 would develop the project under the Charlee brand and Royal Realty would manage operations for the hotel.35\n\nExhibit C-101, Management Contract between Lux\u00e9 by The Charlee S.A.S. and Royal Realty S.A.S., 21 March 2013.\n\n192.\n\nConstruction of the project began in 2010 and was scheduled to finish in 2016, so that operations could be planned to commence in 2017.36 But by January 2017, phases 1, 2 and 5 of the Lux\u00e9 had been terminated, while construction of the 116 hotel rooms was still ongoing.37\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 51.\n\nFirst BRG Expert Report, 15 June 2020, \u00b6 61.\n\n**4. Further Projects**\n-----------------------\n\n193.\n\nIn parallel to the two Charlee brand projects, Mr. Seda was involved in three further relevant hospitality and property projects.\n\n194.\n\n*First*, Mr. Seda was involved in the Tierra Bomba project. In 2013, Mr. Seda identified Tierra Bomba, an island in Cartagena, as suitable for investment, and established RDP Cartagena S.A.S. under the laws of Colombia as a development vehicle for the Tierra Bomba project.38 The project involved the construction of a resort consisting of an 80-room hotel, a residential complex with 80 apartments, 110 cabana units, as well as several special amenities.39 Despite the construction being scheduled to commence in April 2018 or in 2020 and the operations in January 2020 or in August 2022,40 the Tierra Bomba project was delayed by seven months.

Meritage Claimants' Decision to Invest in the Meritage Project**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Meritage Project**\n-----------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe Meritage Project was planned as a large mixed-use project consisting of a luxury hotel with long-term stay hotel suites, residential apartments, single-family homes, and commercial storefronts.49\n\nFirst Seda Witness Statement, \u00b6 38; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 56.\n\n198.\n\nConception of the Meritage Project started in 2012 with the identification of the Meritage property.50\n\nExhibit C-019, Sales-Purchase Agreement Between Royal Realty and La Palma Argentina, 1 November 2012; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b6 57.\n\n**2. Identification of the Meritage Property**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nMr. Seda identified a 56-hectare lot of land in El Perico, municipality of Envigado registered under the number 001-930485 along the Las Palmas Highway connecting Medell\u00edn and the international airport (\"**Meritage Property**\"), which he considered a suitable location for this project due to its proximity to the airport and the relocation of a tollbooth further from the city so that potential residents of the Meritage Property would not have to pay the toll.51\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 57-59.\n\n200.\n\nAt that time, the Meritage Property belonged to La Palma Argentina S.A.S. (\"**La Palma**\"). On 1 November 2012, Mr. Seda, on behalf of his company, Royal Realty, entered into a Promise of Purchase Agreement pursuant to which La Palma was obliged to sell the Meritage Property to Royal Realty and Royal Realty acquired the option to purchase the Meritage Property for an overall minimum of COP 32 billion.52\n\nExhibit C-019, Sales-Purchase Agreement Between Royal Realty and La Palma Argentina, 1 November 2012\n\n**3. Meritage Claimants' Due Diligence Procedures**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Seda learned from La Palma that the Meritage Property was unencumbered.53 La Palma's representatives told Mr. Seda that, at the time of the purchase of the Meritage Property, La Palma had asked the Anti-Money Laundering and Asset Forfeiture Unit at the Attorney General's Office to confirm that the Meritage Property and its owners at the time were not part of any criminal or forfeiture proceeding or investigation. The result of this request was that the property and its sellers were not involved in any criminal investigation or action and / or forfeiture proceeding.54\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 60; Exhibit C-027, Letter from Elsa Mar\u00eda Moyano Galvis to Mar\u00eda Cecilia Uribe Quintero, 30 October 2007.\n\nExhibit C-027, Letter from Elsa Mar\u00eda Moyano Galvis to Mar\u00eda Cecilia Uribe Quintero, 30 October 2007.\n\n202.\n\nFollowing the Promise of Purchase Agreement, Royal Realty as party to the contract had to appoint a fiduciary for the Meritage Project. Royal Realty chose Fiduciaria Corficolombiana S.A. (\"**Corficolombiana**\"), a subsidiary of GRUPO AVAL. On 5 July 2013, Royal Realty accepted Corficolombiana's proposal to provide its services as administrator of a real estate trust for the development of the Meritage Project.55\n\nExhibit C-108, Letter from Mar\u00eda Clara Quintero Ochoa to Laura Marcela G\u00f3mez \u00c1lvarez, 5 July 2013.\n\n203.\n\nCorficolombiana directed Mr. Seda to conduct a title study of the Meritage Property and recommended Otero & Palacio as a law firm with significant experience in title studies.56\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 65; First Seda Witness Statement, \u00b6 49.\n\n204.\n\nThus, Otero & Palacio conducted a title study of the Meritage Property going back ten years in the property's ownership, as provided for in the Law 791 of 2002.57 On 7 March 2013, Otero & Palacio issued its report, concluding the chain of title for the Meritage Property to be \"*free of encumbrances, conditions subsequent and ownership* 58 *restrictions.*\"\n\nExhibit C-030, Otero & Palacio Title Study and Supplement, 7 March and 23 July 2013; Exhibit C-078, Law No. 791 of 2002.\n\nExhibit C-030, Otero & Palacio Title Study and Supplement, 7 March and 23 July 2013, p.

Establishment of Newport as an Investment Vehicle**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nOn 23 September 2009, Mr. Seda established Newport as an investment vehicle for the development of the Meritage Project. As it was Royal Realty that had legally acted in terms of the Meritage Project, Mr. Seda assigned Royal Realty's rights under the Promise of Purchase Agreement with La Palma to Newport on 9 May 2013.61 Newport would be the owner and developer of the Project, Royal Realty would assist in the development and run operations once construction would be finished.62 Consequently, on 3 December 2013, Newport and Royal Realty entered into a management contract.63\n\nExhibit C-103, Agreement between Royal Realty S.A.S. and La Palma Argentina Y CIA.

Beginning of the Development and Structure of the Meritage Project**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nAfter having identified the Meritage Property as a suitable land plot and having entered into shareholding agreements with the Meritage Claimants, it was necessary to establish a trust, as required by the terms of the Promise to Purchase Agreement.66\n\nExhibit C-019, Sales-Purchase Agreement Between Royal Realty and La Palma Argentina, 1 November 2012, p. SP-0006.\n\n209.\n\nBased on Royal Realty's acceptance of Corficolombiana's proposal in terms of the establishment of the required trust dated 5 July 2013, on 17 October 2013, Newport and Corficolombiana entered into a trust agreement setting up a trust structure to manage the development of the Meritage Project (\"**Meritage Trust**\").67 The Meritage Trust consisted of two Agreements: (i) the Presales Trust Agreement68 and (ii) the Administration and Payment Trust Agreement.69\n\nExhibit C-028, Administration and Payment Trust Agreement and Amendments, 17 October 2013.\n\nExhibit C-034, Presales Trust Agreement, 17 October 2013.\n\nExhibit C-028, Administration and Payment Trust Agreement and Amendments, 17 October 2013.\n\n210.\n\nThe purpose of the Meritage Trust was to manage the funds received from third-party buyers of commercial and residential units (\"**Unit Buyers**\") and the disbursement of those to Newport for the development of the Meritage Project.70 Following its purpose, funds received from Unit Buyers into the Presales Trust would be transferred on the basis of separate trust agreements between the latter and Corficolombiana, as a trustee.71 As soon as Newport met certain milestones, such funds would be managed by the Administration and Payment Trust Agreement and disbursed to Newport, as the beneficiary.72 The Administration and Payment Trust Agreement was amended four times during the development of the Meritage Project.73\n\nExhibit C-028, Administration and Payment Trust Agreement and Amendments, 17 October 2013; Exhibit C-034, Presales Trust Agreement, 17 October 2013.\n\nExhibit C-034, Presales Trust Agreement, 17 October 2013.\n\nExhibit C-028, Administration and Payment Trust Agreement and Amendments, 17 October 2013.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 82.\n\n211.\n\nAdditionally, on 25 November 2014, Newport, Corficolombiana and La Palma signed (iii) the third trust agreement to govern title to the Meritage Property (\"**Parqueo Agreement**\" or \"**Meritage La Palma Trust Agreement**\").74 According to the Parqueo Agreement, La Palma, as the owner of the Meritage Property, would transfer title to the latter in trust to Corficolombiana, as trustee, that should in the end parcel and transfer title to the Meritage Property to the beneficiary, Newport, developing the Meritage Project.75 The Meritage La Palma Trust should, upon fulfilment of certain conditions, transfer through Newport parcels of the title to the Meritage Property to the Meritage Trust.76 According to the Presales Trust Agreement, this parceled transfer of the title was a condition precedent for Corficolombiana to disburse the funds to Newport.77 The Parqueo Agreement was amended on 6 February 2015 by replacing Newport as the beneficiary of the trust through La Palma.78\n\nExhibit C-029, Parqueo Trust Agreement and Amendment, 25 November 2014.\n\nExhibit C-029, Parqueo Trust Agreement and Amendment, 25 November 2014.\n\nExhibit C-029, Parqueo Trust Agreement and Amendment, 25 November 2014, cl. 3.3.\n\nExhibit C-029, Parqueo Trust Agreement and Amendment, 25 November 2014, cl. 3.3.\n\nExhibit C-029, Parqueo Trust Agreement and Amendment, 25 November 2014, p.

Shortly after, in an unrelated action, Mr. Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Vanegas filed a criminal complaint before the Attorney General's Office that would eventually lead to a separate investigation specifically into the Meritage Property.\n\n**1. Asset Forfeiture Law**\n---------------------------\n\n219.\n\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, the Colombian National Constituent Assembly enshrined in the Colombian Constitution the courts' right to authorize forfeiture of assets acquired through illicit enrichment. This constitutional provision was later elaborated upon through a series of legislative measures culminating in Law 1708 of 2014 (\"**Asset Forfeiture Law**\"), which sets out a comprehensive regulation of the asset forfeiture process in Colombia, including definitions, applicable procedures, the grounds on which asset forfeiture may proceed and fundamental guarantees for parties.91\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 140; *see* Exhibit C-003, Law No. 1708, 20 January 2014 (\"Asset Forfeiture Law\"); Appendix E to Claimants' Memorial.\n\n220.\n\nArticle 16 of the Asset Forfeiture Law states 11 grounds for the declaration of forfeiture stemming either from unlawful origin of the asset or its unlawful disposition.92 Asset forfeitures under the Asset Forfeiture Law proceed in two phases: (i) the \"Initial Phase\" consists of the investigation and initiation of the proceedings by the Attorney General's Office; and (ii) the \"Trial Phase\" in front of a court.93 Article 7 of the Asset Forfeiture Law provides for a presumption of good faith \"*in all legal action or transaction related to the acquisition or use of the assets, as long as the titleholder proceeds in a diligent and prudent manner, without any fault.*\"94\n\nExhibit C-003, Asset Forfeiture Law, Art. 16.\n\n*See* Exhibit C-003, Asset Forfeiture Law; Appendix E to Claimants' Memorial.\n\nExhibit C-003, Asset Forfeiture Law, Art. 7.\n\n**2.

At that time, the Meritage Property was allegedly held by himself, Mr. Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Vanegas.97 Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas named Mr. Restrepo Santamar\u00eda as the one who had \"negotiated\" successive sales of the Meritage Property following L\u00f3pez Betancur's alleged kidnapping.98\n\nExhibit C-130, Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Vanegas Complaint to Prosecutor 24, 3 July 2014.\n\nExhibit C-130, Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Vanegas Complaint to Prosecutor 24, 3 July 2014, p.

SP-0001.\n\nExhibit C-039, Decision on L\u00f3pez Vanegas Tutela Action, 23 May 2016, p. SP-0001.\n\n225.\n\nOn 23 May 2016, the Bogot\u00e1 Superior Court issued its ruling regarding Mr. Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez' constitutional protection action finding that the action was inadmissible against La Palma, Corficolombiana, and Royal Realty.103 Moreover, the court found that the alleged kidnapping and further criminal conduct were to be treated separately from the asset forfeiture part of his complaint.104 As far as the asset forfeiture part is concerned, the decision states that the Attorney General's Office Asset Forfeiture Unit did not violate Mr. L\u00f3pez' fundamental rights under the Colombian Constitution, as the asset forfeiture proceedings were in an initial phase and investigations were still ongoing, and that in this stage proceedings were closed to the public by law.105 Regarding the criminal aspects of the complaint, the court ruled that it was insufficient for the Organized Crime Unit to only send copies of the complaint to the Asset Forfeiture Unit.106 As a result, the court ordered the Organized Crime Unit to determine within 15 calendar days whether to open an investigation into the alleged criminal conduct described in Mr. L\u00f3pez' complaint.107\n\nExhibit C-039, Decision on L\u00f3pez Vanegas Tutela Action, 23 May 2016, p.

Initial Phase of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe initial phase of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings formally commenced on 8 April 2016 when the Asset Forfeiture Unit of the Attorney General's Office assigned the matter to Prosecutor No. 44, Ms. Alejandra Ardila Polo, and requested her to conduct further research regarding the assets claimed by Mr. Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez.108\n\nExhibit C-153, Attorney General's Office Resolution No. 125, 18 April 2016.\n\n227.\n\nAccordingly, on 18 April 2016, the Asset Forfeiture Unit of the Attorney General's Office decreed the opening of the initial phase of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings under Articles 17 and 18 of the Asset Forfeiture Law and launched the investigation.109\n\nExhibit C-022, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Precautionary Measures Resolution, 22 July 2016.\n\n228.\n\nThe investigation conducted during the initial phase of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings comprised the retrieval of information from several private and public entities, including the Superintendence of Notary and Registry and the Chamber of Commerce of Aburr\u00e1 Sur of Medell\u00edn, regarding the ownership history of the Meritage Property.110 One element was an analysis of the Meritage Property deeds in order to spot potential irregularities of the property transfer.111 This analysis revealed a number of irregularities in terms of signatures, formalities, and legal representation.112 Another element was conducting research into the companies involved in the transfer of the Meritage Property in the past and into the *Oficina de Envigado*.113\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 155; Exhibit C-022, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Precautionary Measures Resolution, 22 July 2016.\n\nExhibit C-022, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Precautionary Measures Resolution, 22 July 2016.\n\nExhibit C-022, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Precautionary Measures Resolution, 22 July 2016.\n\nExhibit C-023, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Determination of the Claim, 25 January 2017.\n\n229.\n\nAs a result of the irregularities uncovered during the investigations, on 22 July 2016, the Asset Forfeiture Unit of the Attorney General's Office suspended, as a precautionary measure, the right to transfer the Meritage Property's title and attached and seized the property, placing it under the custody and management of the Sociedad de Activos Especiales, a State entity, thereby freezing all of the Meritage's business and investment activities.114\n\nExhibit C-022, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Precautionary Measures Resolution, 22 July 2016.\n\n**4. Precautionary Measures on the Meritage Project**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nThe above-mentioned precautionary measures authorized on 22 July 2016 formally took effect on 3 August 2016 when Ms. Ardila from the Asset Forfeiture Unit of the Attorney General's Office arrived at the Meritage Property and posted a seizure notice on the property.115\n\nExhibit C-165, Certificate of Seizure of the Meritage Property, 3 August 2016.\n\n231.\n\nThe basis for the imposition of such precautionary measures stated by the Attorney General's Office was a reasonable inference of the \"illicit origins\" of the property based on the evidence gathered during the investigation that the Meritage Property had been subject to a series of irregular property transfers; and the stated purpose was to prevent further property transfers and unrelated parties (Unit Buyers) from continuing to purchase lots.116\n\nExhibit C-022, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Precautionary Measures Resolution, 22 July 2016, pp. SP-0069 and SP-0071.\n\n**5. Challenges to the Precautionary Measures**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nOn 26 September 2016, Corficolombiana challenged the imposed precautionary measures by filing a request for legality control pursuant to Article 111 of the Asset Forfeiture Law before the First Criminal Court of the Specialized Circuit for Asset Forfeiture of Antioquia (\"**First Criminal Court**\").117 Corficolombiana substantiated its request by its alleged status of a good faith buyer of the Meritage Property, by arguing the measures to be unnecessary, unreasonable, disproportional, and not adequately tied to a compelling State interest.118\n\nExhibit C-043, Corficolombiana's Control of Legality Petition, 26 September 2016.\n\nExhibit C-043, Corficolombiana's Control of Legality Petition, 26 September 2016.\n\n233.\n\nOn 20 October 2016, the First Criminal Court rendered a decision on the challenge filed by Corficolombiana upholding the legality of the precautionary measures.119 The First Criminal Court decided that the Attorney General's Office, more specifically Prosecutor 44, had duly motivated the imposition of the precautionary measures.120\n\nExhibit C-044, Decision by Asset Forfeiture Court Corficolombiana's Control of Legality Petition, 20 October 2016.\n\nExhibit C-044, Decision by Asset Forfeiture Court on Corficolombiana's Control of Legality Petition, 20 October 2016.\n\n234.\n\nOn 26 October 2016, Corficolombiana appealed the First Criminal Court's decision before the Bogot\u00e1 Superior Court, Asset Forfeiture Chamber.121 Ultimately, on 21 February 2017, Corficolombiana's appeal was rejected as the Bogot\u00e1 Superior Court held that the Attorney General's Office duly complied with Article 250 of the Colombian Constitution and Articles 29, 34, 87, 88, 112, 158 and 159 of the Asset Forfeiture Law in imposing the precautionary measures.122\n\nExhibit C-045, Corficolombiana Appeal to First Instance Decision Corficolombiana's Control of Legality Petition, 26 October 2016.\n\nExhibit C-047, Appellate Decision on Corficolombiana's Control of Legality Petition, 21 February 2017.\n\n235.\n\nOn 7 December 2016, Newport directly requested the Asset Forfeiture Unit to recognize its status as a good faith third party without fault.123 As the request remained unanswered, Newport further supplemented it on 14 December 2016.124\n\nExhibit C-048, Newport's First Petition to Attorney General's Office Asset Forfeiture Unit, 7 December 2017. Colombian Asset Forfeiture Law distinguishes between simple good faith and good faith without fault or qualified good faith, which imposes a higher standard.\n\nExhibit C-049, Newport's Supplement to Petition to Attorney General's Office Asset Forfeiture Unit, 14 December 2016.\n\n236.\n\nOn 23 January 2017, Newport filed another request to the Attorney General's Office, this time asking the latter to set aside the precautionary measures on the grounds that more than six months had elapsed since their imposition, contrary to the six-months-limitation for the determination of the claim provided for in Article 89 of the Asset Forfeiture Law.125\n\nExhibit C-050, Newport's Third Petition to Attorney General's Office Asset Forfeiture Unit, 23 January 2017.\n\n237.\n\nSeparately, Mr. Seda met with officials of the Anticorruption Unit of the Attorney General's Office early in December 2016 and, following their advice, he filed a formal criminal complaint to the Attorney General's Office on 19 December 2016 against Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Vanegas for alleged extorsion and implicating Prosecutor 44, Ms. Ardila Polo, because of the precautionary measures imposed.126\n\nExhibit C-181, A. Seda Complaint to Fiscal\u00eda General, 19 December 2016.\n\n**6. Provisional Determination of Claim**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nPursuant to Article 126 of the Asset Forfeiture Law, on 25 January 2017 the Attorney General's Office issued a Provisional Determination of Claim.127\n\nExhibit C-023, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Determination of the Claim, 25 January 2017.\n\n239.\n\nA Provisional Determination of Claim requires the proof of (i) the existence of at least one of the grounds provided for in Article 16 of the Asset Forfeiture Law; (ii) the existence of assets to which these grounds apply; and (iii) an unjustifiable increase in wealth.128\n\nExhibit C-023, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Determination of the Claim, 25 January 2017.\n\n240.\n\nFor the case at hand, the Attorney General's Office named the following applicable grounds pursuant to Article 16 of the Asset Forfeiture Law: (i) the assets were a direct or indirect product of an illicit activity; (ii) the provenance of the assets is the legal or physical transformation or the partial or total conversion, of material products, instruments or objects of illicit activities; and (iii) those assets form part of an unjustifiable increase in wealth.129 These grounds were substantiated by the Attorney General's findings made during the course of the Asset Forfeiture Investigation up until that time.130\n\nExhibit C-023, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Determination of the Claim, 25 January 2017.\n\nExhibit C-023, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Determination of the Claim, 25 January 2017, pp. SP-0116 \u2013 SP-0130.\n\n241.\n\nOn 9 March 2017, Newport challenged the Provisional Determination of Claim by sending a letter to the Attorney General's Office. In this letter, Newport stated that it had legitimately acquired the property in good faith and that the Provisional Determination of Claim failed to adequately evaluate Newport's evidence in this respect.131\n\nExhibit C-055, Newport's Opposition to Determination of the Claim, 9 March 2017.\n\n**7. Newport's** ***Tutela*** **Action**\n----------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nOn 17 February 2017, Newport filed a *Tutela* Action before the Supreme Court of Justice, Criminal Chamber to order the Asset Forfeiture Unit to respond to Newport's petitions of 7 December 2016, 14 December 2016, and 23 January 2017 regarding its status as good faith third party and the request to lift the precautionary measures.132\n\nExhibit C-052, Newport Tutela Action, 17 February 2017, pp. SP-0014 \u2013 SP-0015.\n\n243.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, the Supreme Court of Justice ruled on Newport's *Tutela* Action finding that the Attorney General's Office Asset Forfeiture Unit had violated Newport's fundamental rights guaranteed under the Colombian Constitution, specifically the right of access to justice and due process, by failing to answer Newport's petitions.133 As a consequence, the court ordered the Attorney General's Office to provide a response to Newport's petitions.134\n\nExhibit C-053, Decision on Newport's Tutela Action, 28 February 2017, pp. SP-0018 \u2013 SP-0020.\n\nExhibit C-053, Decision on Newport's Tutela Action, 28 February 2017, pp. SP-0019 \u2013 SP-0020.\n\n244.\n\nOn 4 March 2017, the Attorney General's Office denied Newport's petitions concluding that it was not the appropriate stage of the proceedings to make that determination. The Attorney General's Office stated that the evidence gathered during the initial phase of the investigation allowed it to reasonably infer that Newport could not be considered a good faith third-party buyer, having concluded that Newport had failed to exercise the required due diligence in the acquisition of the Meritage Property, as reasoned in the Provisional Determination of Claim.135 The Attorney General's Office quoted relevant passages from the Provisional Determination of Claim regarding Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' criminal history, Mr. Restrepo Santamar\u00eda's involvement and the series of irregular property transfers.136\n\nExhibit C-054, Attorney General's Office Asset Forfeiture Unit Response to Newport's Petitions, 4 March 2017, pp. SP-0002 \u2013 SP-0003.\n\nExhibit C-054, Attorney General's Office Asset Forfeiture Unit Response to Newport's Petitions, 4 March 2017, pp. SP-0002 \u2013 SP-0003.\n\n**8. Attorney General's Formal Request for Asset Forfeiture**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nOn 5 April 2017, pursuant to Articles 131 and 132 of the Asset Forfeiture Law, the Attorney General's Office filed a formal request for asset forfeiture with the Circuit Criminal Court Specializing in Asset Forfeiture.137 In this request, the court was formally asked to commence the trial phase of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.138 At that time the case had been reassigned to Prosecutor 53, Jos\u00e9 Iv\u00e1n Caro G\u00f3mez, who filed the formal request.\n\nExhibit C-024, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Petition to Asset Forfeiture Court, 5 April 2017.\n\nExhibit C-024, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Petition to Asset Forfeiture Court, 5 April 2017, p. SP-0010.\n\n246.\n\nIn its request, the Attorney General's Office explained that Corficolombiana lacked status as good faith buyer of the property on which the Meritage Project was built. *First*, the Attorney General's Office explained the illicit background of the relevant property.139 *Second*, the Attorney General's Office stated that Corficolombiana only conducted a title study going back ten years in the title history whereas it would have had to go back to 1994.140 If Corficolombiana had done so, it would have recognized the property's illicit background and its connection to Mr. Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Vanegas.141 *Third*, Corficolombiana could not rely on the Attorney General's Office letters regarding the non-existence of criminal or asset forfeiture proceedings at one point in time.142 Furthermore, those letters could not prevent the Attorney General's Office from conducting investigations as a result of new findings in terms of the illicit background of the property concerned.143\n\nExhibit C-024, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Petition to Asset Forfeiture Court, 5 April 2017.\n\nExhibit C-024, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Petition to Asset Forfeiture Court, 5 April 2017.\n\nExhibit C-024, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Petition to Asset Forfeiture Court, 5 April 2017.\n\nExhibit C-024, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Petition to Asset Forfeiture Court, 5 April 2017.\n\nExhibit C-024, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Petition to Asset Forfeiture Court, 5 April 2017.\n\n247.\n\nOn 18 April 2018, the Second Criminal Court Specialized in Asset Forfeiture found that the Attorney General's request was defective, because it had neither properly identified nor provided the exact location of the Meritage Property, and dismissed the request. The Court gave the Attorney General's Office five days to correct the petition.144 On 7 May 2018, the Court rejected the request for asset forfeiture because the Attorney General's Office had not remedied the deficiencies in time, but it preserved its right to correct and renew the request as there is no statute of limitations on asset forfeiture actions.145\n\nExhibit C-058, Asset Forfeiture Court Decision on First Requerimiento, 7 May 2018.\n\nExhibit C-058, Asset Forfeiture Court Decision on First Requerimiento, 7 May 2018.\n\n248.\n\nOn 25 May 2018, the Attorney General's Office renewed its request for asset forfeiture.146\n\nExhibit C-059, Attorney General's Office, Amended Requerimiento, 25 May 2018.\n\n249.\n\nOn 5 October 2018, Newport submitted a petition to the Second Criminal Court Specialized in Asset Forfeiture by which it presented evidence and asked the court to admit testimonial evidence.\n\n**9. The Second Criminal Court's** ***Avocamiento*** **Order**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nOn 17 August 2017, the Second Criminal Court Specialized in Asset Forfeiture rendered an *Avocamiento* Order.147\n\nExhibit C-057, Asset Forfeiture Court *Avocamiento* Order, 17 August 2017.\n\n251.\n\nPursuant to Article 137 of the Asset Forfeiture Law, an *Avocamiento* Order must be issued by the court after it has received the formal request for asset forfeiture in order to confirm its jurisdiction over the asset forfeiture in question by the means of an order to proceed.148\n\nExhibit C-003, Asset Forfeiture Law, Art. 137.\n\n252.\n\nIn its *Avocamiento* Order, the court analyzed who has standing in the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings as an affected party under the Asset Forfeiture Law.149 Referring to Article 30 of the Asset Forfeiture Law, the court found that Newport was not an affected party. The court concluded that Newport did not hold any right over the Meritage Property since it withdrew as a party from the Parqueo Trust on 6 February 2015 and relinquished its position as the beneficiary of the trust agreement via a private document before the deed transferring the title to the Meritage Property was established.150 The court acknowledged that Newport had personal rights *vis-\u00e0-vis* La Palma, but determined that these were insufficient to confer to Newport the quality of an affected party in the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.151\n\nExhibit C-057, Asset Forfeiture Court *Avocamiento* Order, 17 August 2017.\n\nExhibit C-057, Asset Forfeiture Court *Avocamiento* Order, 17 August 2017, pp. SP-0059-SP-0060.\n\nExhibit C-057, Asset Forfeiture Court *Avocamiento* Order, 17 August 2017.\n\n253.\n\nOn 24 August 2017, Newport filed an appeal against the *Avocamiento* Order stating that it had rights as beneficiary of the Meritage Trust and that the relevant lots had already been transferred to Meritage Trust by the time of the court's decision.152 On 11 September 2017, Newport supplemented its appeal with further details.153 Newport's appeal became moot when the Second Criminal Court Specialized in Asset Forfeiture dismissed the Attorney General's request for asset forfeiture on 17 May 2018.\n\nExhibit C-195, Newport's Appeal Against the *Avocamiento* Order, 24 August 2017.\n\nExhibit C-196, Newport's Memorial complementing Its Appeal, 11 September 2017.\n\n**10. Commencement of the Asset Forfeiture Trial**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nOn 12 December 2018, the amended request for asset forfeiture was rejected by the Second Criminal Court Specialized in Asset Forfeiture, due to, again, the lack of precise description and identification of the relevant property.154\n\nExhibit C-060, Asset Forfeiture Court Decision on Amended Requerimiento, 12 December 2018.\n\n255.\n\nOn 19 December 2018, the Attorney General's Office filed a second amended request for asset forfeiture.155\n\nExhibit C-056, Second Amended Requerimiento, 19 December 2018.\n\n256.\n\nFinally, on 14 June 2019, the Second Criminal Court Specialized in Asset Forfeiture accepted the second amended request for asset forfeiture and, thus, declared the formal beginning of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.156 In that same decision, the Court again denied Newport standing in the trial proceedings.157 As a result, Newport filed an appeal against this decision.158\n\nExhibit C-236, Specialized Asset Forfeiture Court's Decision on Amended Requerimiento, 14 June 2019.\n\nExhibit C-236, Specialized Asset Forfeiture Court's Decision on Amended Requerimiento, 14 June 2019, p. SP-0328.\n\nExhibit C-237, Newport's Appeal Against Decision to Accept Corrected Requerimiento, 20 June 2019.\n\n257.\n\nOn 22 April 2022, the Special Chamber for Asset Forfeiture of the Superior Tribunal issued an order by which, *inter alia*, it upheld Newport's appeal, allowing full participation in the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.159\n\nParties' Email to the Tribunal of 5 May 2023.\n\n258.\n\nOn 19 May 2022, Prosecutor Caro requested leave to file supervening evidence. The Court granted this request by its Order of 27 May 2022.160\n\nParties' Email to the Tribunal of 5 May 2023.\n\n259.\n\nOn 3 June 2022, Newport filed a writ of reconsideration and, in the alternative, an appeal of the Court's Order of 27 May 2022. Newport also requested the annulment of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings, as of the provisional determination of claim issued by Prosecutor Ardila on 25 January 2017, on the basis that Newport should have had the opportunity to defend itself from the beginning of the proceedings as an affected party. Newport requested that the Court suspend the Proceedings pending the appeal, since \"*the burden that moving forward with the proceedings would cause should be avoided, given that it is possible that the proceedings be declared null and other judicial steps of particular importance may be thus invalidated, such as the collection of evidence.*\" Newport's request to suspend the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings pending its appeal was rejected.161\n\nParties' Email to the Tribunal of 5 May 2023.\n\n260.\n\nBy Order of 7 July 2022, the Court upheld its Order of 27 May 2022 admitting Prosecutor Caro's evidence. Accordingly, on 15 July 2022, Newport's appeal was remanded to the Superior Tribunal of Bogot\u00e1 for further action (without staying the proceedings), pursuant to Articles 65(3) and 66 of the Asset Forfeiture Law.162\n\nParties' Email to the Tribunal of 5 May 2023.\n\n261.\n\nAs of May 2023, Newport's appeal proceedings are ongoing before the Superior Tribunal of Bogot\u00e1, while the evidentiary phase in the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings before the Second Specialized Court continues in parallel.163 Between February and March 2024, an evidentiary hearing was held by the Second Specialized Court in the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.164\n\nParties' Email to the Tribunal of 5 May 2023.\n\nRespondent's Letter of 19 January 2024.\n\n**E. PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------\n\n262.\n\nIn the following, the positions of the Parties as argued in their written submissions and during the Hearings will be summarized.\n\n**I. Summary of Claimants' Position and Relief Sought**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nClaimants submit that the essential security exception is not applicable in the present case (**1.**), that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute (**2.**) and that Respondent committed several breaches of the TPA entitling Claimants to compensation and moral damages (**3.**).\n\n**1. Essential Security Exception**\n-----------------------------------\n\na) Invocation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA by Respondent\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n264.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent's belated invocation of the essential security interest exception under Article 22.2(b) of the TPA (\"**Essential Security Exception**\", \"**ESI Provision**\", or, as Claimants refer to it, \"**New Defense**\") violated Sections 14.2 and 14.3 of the PO1 and Arbitration Rule 26(3) and should therefore be dismissed on procedural grounds.165 Claimants submit that Respondent was precluded from raising the New Defense with the Rejoinder since no \"*new facts have arisen after the first exchange of submissions which justify new allegations of fact and/or legal arguments*\" or \"*special circumstances*\" apply.166 Moreover, the belated introduction of the New Defense compromises the principles of fairness and equality of arms between the Parties.167\n\nClaimants' Application of 7 March 2022, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 13-16.\n\nClaimants' Application of 7 March 2022, \u00b6\u00b6 17-22; Claimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, 18 April 2022 (\"**Claimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense**\"), \u00b6\u00b6 37-44.\n\nClaimants' Application of 7 March 2022, \u00b6\u00b6 23-26.\n\n265.\n\nClaimants submit that PO9 only permitted the Essential Security Exception as a jurisdictional objection \u2013 and its belated introduction by Respondent merits a dismissal.168\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, 21 July 2022 (\"**Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief**\"), \u00b6 319.\n\n266.\n\nIn any case, Claimants argue that the Essential Security Exception must be raised to protect an essential security interest at the time the measure is enacted, and the \"*new*\" facts cannot support invoking the exception since they did not exist (or the relevant Colombian authorities were not aware of them) at the time Respondent initiated the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.169\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 45-72.\n\n267.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent has not identified an essential security interest at the time of the application of the measures in question \u2013 but rather initiated the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings on different grounds \u2013 and now should not be allowed to retrospectively invoke Article 22.2(b) of the TPA.170 In support of that, Claimants rely on the language of this article, which provides that a State cannot be precluded from imposing measures \"*that it consider**s** necessary*\" (emphasis added) for the protection of the essential security interest.171 Claimants submit that the U.S. treaty practice supports this conclusion.172\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 46-48.\n\nClaimants' Rebuttal on Essential Security, 13 September 2022 (\"**Claimants' Rebuttal on Essential Security**\"), \u00b6 9.\n\nClaimants' Submission on U.S. Treaties and [REDACTED], 21 December 2022 (\"**Claimants' Submission on U.S. Treaties and [REDACTED]**\"), \u00b6\u00b6 11-23.\n\nb) Effect of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA\n---------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nClaimants cite the ordinary meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA to argue that nothing in this provision prohibits the Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction over the dispute or limits Respondent's liability.173\n\nClaimants' Application of 7 March 2022, \u00b6\u00b6 27-30; Claimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6 5.\n\n269.\n\nClaimants note that Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\") should be applied to Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, which requires the Tribunal to interpret the TPA \"*in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose*.\"174\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 301; Claimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6 7.\n\n270.\n\nClaimants argue that the ordinary meaning of the Article 22.2(b) of the TPA provides that the Tribunal merely cannot \"*preclude*\" Respondent from taking any measures it deems necessary to protect its essential security interests.175 Referencing definitions from several English language dictionaries, Claimants submit that the plain meaning of \"*preclude*\" is defined as \"*prevent from happening*\" or to \"*make impossible.*\"176 This language entails no effect on the Tribunal's jurisdiction or Respondent's liability and merely excludes restitution or withdrawal of the measures from the scope of the available remedies.177 Claimants submit that the footnote to Article 22 of the TPA does not change the scope of the provision.178\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 8-11; Claimants' Rebuttal on Essential Security, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 301(a).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 16-17;

Colombia*, in which the tribunal held that where a State cannot be prohibited from enacting a measure, it does not mean \"*payment of compensation is not required*.\"179 Claimants further reject the case law cited by Respondent as inapposite.180\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 301(a); Claimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6 11; Exhibit CL-175, *Eco Oro Minerals Corp. v. The Republic of Colombia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/41, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum, 9 September 2021.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32.\n\n272.\n\nClaimants argue that the ordinary meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA is supported by its context as well as the TPA's object and purpose:181\n\n\u2212 Where the TPA intends to exclude or limit admissibility, jurisdiction, or liability, it does so explicitly, which is not the case in Article 22.2(b).182 Citing Annex 5 to the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, Claimants submit that \"[t]*reaties that have excised the justiciability of disputes from arbitral tribunals' authority on the basis of essential security do so in an express manner.*\"183\n\n\u2212 In the present case, in contrast, the provision is only \"*designed to ensure that the State is allowed to continue applying the measures in question.*\"184 Claimants rely on the fact that Article 22(b) of the TPA applies to the disputes under Chapters 10 and 21, the latter covering primarily inter-State disputes, in which withdrawal of the breaching measure is the primary remedy.185\n\n\u2212 Claimants submit that this interpretation, namely, giving the Tribunal jurisdiction to examine Respondent's invocation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, is consistent with the purpose of the TPA to \"*promote economic development through free trade and increased foreign investment.*\" According to Claimants, this necessitates a predictable legal and commercial framework for business and investment.186 It is Claimants' submission that Mr. Seda's investments served as a \"*rejuvenation*\" of Medell\u00edn's economy and were an \"*alternative to* [the] *drug-crop production*\" \u2013 something Respondent sought to attract through the TPA.187\n\n\u2212 Claimants reject Respondent's argument that the security exception restricts the Tribunal's jurisdiction because it is contained under the \"*General Exceptions*\" Chapter of the TPA. Claimants submit that Article 22.2(b) of the TPA serves as an exception to the general remedy of restitution, and that nothing in the \"*General Exceptions*\" Chapter or its title suggests a restriction on jurisdiction or liability.188\n\n\u2212 Claimants further reject Respondent's submission that Article 10.2 of the TPA is applicable to the dispute in question. Article 10.2 provides that \"[i]*n the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter, the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.*\" Claimants argue that there is no inconsistency between Article 22.2(b) and Chapter 10 of the TPA.189\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 12-26; Claimants' Submission on U.S. Treaties and [REDACTED], \u00b6\u00b6 35-43.\n\nClaimants' Rebuttal on Essential Security, \u00b6 21.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6 21.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 301(b).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 13-15.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n\nClaimants Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 301(c); Claimants' Rebuttal on Essential Security, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.\n\nClaimants Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 301(b)(ii).\n\nClaimants Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 301(b)(iii); Claimants' Rebuttal on Essential Security, \u00b6 22.\n\n273.\n\nClaimants accept Respondent's claim that Article 22.2(b) of the TPA is a self-judging provision. However, Claimants argue that the self-judging nature of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA only extends to Respondent's right to decide which measures it deems necessary to protect its essential security interests.190 It does not automatically exempt Respondent from the liability to compensate Claimants if the measures taken nevertheless violated the protections given to investors under Chapter 10 of the TPA.191\n\nClaimants' Rebuttal on Essential Security, \u00b6 17.\n\nClaimants Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 303.\n\n274.\n\nClaimants object to Respondent's reliance on the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*, which purportedly showed an intention of the U.S. and Colombia to restrict a tribunal's jurisdiction after Article 22.2(b) of the TPA has been invoked. Claimants submit that reference to the *travaux* and the drafters' intentions is a supplementary means of interpretation under the VCLT and can only be applied where the ordinary meaning of the provision is either ambiguous or leads to unreasonable results.192 As neither is the case for Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, Claimants argue that the *travaux* cannot be invoked, especially not to alter the ordinary meaning of the provision.193 In any event, Claimants maintain that the *travaux* do not show any clear intention by the State parties to the TPA to absolve themselves of liability or preclude a tribunal's jurisdiction once Article 22.2(b) of the TPA is raised.194\n\nClaimants' Rebuttal on Essential Security, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.\n\nClaimants Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 305-307.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 308; Claimants' Rebuttal on Essential Security, \u00b6\u00b6 27-29; Claimants' Submission on U.S. Treaties and [REDACTED] \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.\n\n275.\n\nClaimants further reject Respondent's submission that there has been a subsequent agreement by virtue of Article 31(3) of the VCLT between the State parties to the TPA on the interpretation of Article 22.2(b).195 Claimants view such an agreement between Respondent, a Party to the present dispute, and the U.S., a non-party to the present dispute, as a violation of Claimants' due process rights. The *Infinito Gold v. Costa Rica* tribunal held that concurrent positions of parties and non-parties to the dispute are legal arguments and do not constitute a subsequent agreement in the sense of Article 31(3) of the VCLT.196\n\nClaimants' Rebuttal on Essential Security, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31; Claimants' Submission on U.S. Treaties and [REDACTED], \u00b6\u00b6 46-49.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 310; Exhibit RL-207, *Infinito Gold Ltd. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICISD Case No. ARB/14/5, Award, 3 June 2021.\n\n276.\n\nClaimants further argue that the TPA provides for a proper mechanism to render binding interpretations on its provisions through the Free Trade Commission. Thus far, the Free Trade Commission has not provided interpretations on Chapters 10 or 22, and any oral or written submissions by a non-disputing treaty party would not be binding on this Tribunal.197\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 312.\n\n277.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to accept the interpretation as a subsequent agreement, Claimants submit that such agreement cannot be used to modify or amend the meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA. Referencing the *Magyar v. Hungary*, *Eskosol v. Italy*, and *Muszynianka v. Slovakia* tribunals, Claimants argue that a subsequent agreement offers but one interpretation which should be considered alongside the ordinary meaning of the provision, its context, as well as its object and purpose \u2013 rather than as a \"*trump card.*\"198\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 313-315; Exhibit CL-168, *Magyar Farming Company Ltd, Kintyre Kft and Inicia Zrt v.

Claimants submit that Swiss investors are owed similar protections under the Colombia-Swiss bilateral investment treaty (\"**BIT**\") as American investors under the TPA. However, Claimants provide that under the Colombia-Swiss BIT, Respondent \"*does not have discretion to evade such protections on the basis of essential security interests.*\"213\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 350; Claimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 74-76.\n\n284.\n\nClaimants submit that application of Article 10.4 of the TPA does not concern dispute resolution and is instead a general exception to substantive obligations under the TPA.214\n\nClaimants' Rebuttal on Essential Security, \u00b6 52.\n\n**2. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n285.\n\nClaimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute as the requirements of the TPA and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention are met.\n\na) Requirements of the TPA\n--------------------------\n\n286.\n\nThe TPA requires Claimants to qualify as \"*investor*[s]\" and to have made a protected \"*investment*\" in Colombia.\n\n287.\n\n*First*, Claimants contend that Angel Samuel Seda, Jonathan M. Foley, Justin T. Caruso, Stephen J. Bobeck, Brian Hass, Monte G. Adcock, and Justin T. Enbody qualify as investors pursuant to Article 10.28 of the TPA as they are all citizens of the United States who have made an \"*investment*\", which comprised a \"*bundle of rights*\" including: (i) shares in Newport, Lux\u00e9, and Royal Realty; (ii) management contracts between Royal Realty and Newport, and Royal Realty and Lux\u00e9; and (iii) the enterprises set up by Mr. Seda to serve as investment vehicles for the development projects, including RDP Interpalmas S.A.S., RDP Cartagena S.A.S., and Revmarketing S.A.S.215\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 339; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 162, 164; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 286.\n\n288.\n\nSpecifically, Claimants submit that:\n\n\u2212 Mr. Seda is sole owner of Royal Realty216 and holds 53,348,700 shares in Lux\u00e9 through the latter as of 9 March 2018.217 Royal Realty holds 914,282 shares in Newport as of 6 November 2018.218\n\n\u2212 Jonathan M.

Respondent's Breach of Its Obligations under the TPA**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Colombia has breached several of its fundamental obligations under the TPA.\n\na) Unlawful Expropriation of Claimants' Investment\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nClaimants allege that Colombia breached Article 10.7 of the TPA by expropriating Claimants' investment.\n\naa) Legal Standard\n------------------\n\n297.\n\nThe legal expropriation standard Claimants apply is Article 10.7 of the TPA prohibiting any expropriation or nationalization of a covered investment unless certain conditions are met.238 In addition, Claimants refer to Annex 10-B of the TPA recognizing both direct and indirect expropriation having an equivalent effect to direct expropriation as relevant expropriation standards under the TPA.239 Therefore, a State is deemed to have expropriated an investment when the effect of the measure taken by the State has been to deprive the owner of title, possession, or access to the benefit and economic use of his property.240\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 359.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 360.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 363.\n\n298.\n\nTo substantiate this conclusion, Claimants cite two decisions, namely *Starret Housing Corp. v. Iran*241 and *Middle East Cement v. Egypt.*242 In the *Starret Housing*, the tribunal accepted the deprivation of effective use, control, and benefits of property rights to be an indirect expropriation. In the *Middle East Cement*, the banning of importing cement \u2013 even if the respective license had not been revoked \u2013 met the standard.243\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 364; Exhibit CL-011, *Starrett Housing Corporation, et. al. and The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, et al*., Case No. 24, Interlocutory Award, Iran-U.S. C.T.R., 20 December 1983, 23(5) I.L.M. 1090.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 366; Exhibit CL-029, *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co.

These measures hindered any further development of the Project.246\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 372.\n\n303.\n\nThen, on 25 January 2017, the Attorney General's Office issued the Determination of Claim formally instituting the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings against the Meritage Project even though Claimants highlighted the falsity of Mr. L\u00f3pez' story.247\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 373.\n\n304.\n\nFinally, on 5 April 2017, the Attorney General's Office formally requested the court to commence the Asset Forfeiture Trial, and Newport was denied an important opportunity to defend itself.248\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 373; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 217-218.\n\n305.\n\nOn these grounds, Claimants conclude that Respondent indirectly and blatantly expropriated the Meritage Claimants' investment pursuant to Article 3 of Annex 10-B.249 In this regard, Claimants contend that the imposition of Asset Forfeiture Proceedings has had \"*an effect equivalent to direct expropriation*\" as \"*the suspension of the power of disposition, attachment and seizure*\" has (i) deprived Claimants' investment of all economic value, (ii) interfered with Claimants' distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and (iii) had the character of the government action.250\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 374.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 374.\n\n306.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's argument that Claimants' investments cannot be expropriated because Claimants did not have property rights. They argue that at the time of the measure taken by Respondent, they had a \"*bundle of rights*\" associated with their ownership of Newport and Royal Realty, namely \"*(i) Newport had rights under the Sales Purchase and trusts agreements to develop the Meritage Project; and (ii) Royal Realty had rights to operate the aparta-hotel* [sic] *on the Project*.\"251 Claimants submit that it is well-settled that contractual rights can be subject to expropriation.252 Moreover, a real estate development project, such as Claimants', is inextricably bound to the land, therefore the seizure of the land also necessarily results in the seizure of the associated investments.253\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 221-222.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 222.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 222.\n\n307.\n\nClaimants' investment is deprived of all economic value as Newport's only source of expected revenue \u2013 the Meritage Project \u2013 was seized, which made any further development impossible.254 To substantiate this, Claimants cite the decision *ADC v. Hungary* in which the tribunal held that an act of State can mean the end for an investment and thus a case of expropriation, particularly when there is no compensation.255 Moreover, Claimants argue that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings have made it impossible for Mr. Seda to seek financing for his projects due to \"*a permanent scar on his reputation*\" left by the proceedings and the surrounding press.256\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 375; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 226; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 22.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 375; Exhibit CL-044, *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 24.\n\n308.\n\nClaimants also reject Respondent's proposition that the measures only had limited and temporary adverse impact, since the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings continue to this day and continue to inhibit the development of the Meritage Property.257\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 227; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 23.\n\n309.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent interfered with their distinct reasonable investment-backed expectations. Claimants reasonably expected the Meritage Project to be completed and become profitable, unfettered by wrongful measures of the Colombian government.258 Claimants allege that the Colombian Attorney General's Office itself had twice certified in writing that the prior title holders of the Meritage Property were not involved in any criminal activity.259\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 377; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 228; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 26.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 377.\n\n310.\n\nMoreover, only renowned fiduciaries as Corficolombiana as well as law firms like Otero & Palacio were hired to conduct title studies regarding the Meritage Property. All of this made Claimants' expectation reasonable.260 Therefore, by conducting due diligence to ensure that the Property was not encumbered by prior criminality, Claimants formed \"*distinct, reasonable investment-backed*\" expectations that the Property would not be seized on the basis of an alleged criminal history.261\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 377.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 232.\n\n311.\n\nThe Asset Forfeiture Proceedings initiated against the Meritage Project are a government action in the sense of the TPA, as it was the Attorney General's Office that initiated them and the Colombian courts processing them now.262 Claimants also submit that such government action was not a legitimate exercise of regulatory powers.263\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 379; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 233; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 27.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 234-239; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 33.\n\ncc) Unlawful Character of this Expropriation\n--------------------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nAccording to Article 10.7 of the TPA, in order to be lawful, an expropriation must be conducted (i) with payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation, (ii) under due process of law, (iii) in a non-discriminatory manner and (iv) for a public purpose. According to Claimants, Respondent did not comply with these conditions, which made the expropriation of Claimants' investment unlawful.264\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 381.\n\n313.\n\nClaimants state that Respondent failed to pay any compensation for the expropriation of the Meritage Claimants' investment, which alone renders the expropriation unlawful under the TPA.265\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 382; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 273; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 31.\n\n314.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent ignored due process of law, including substantive and procedural protections, when expropriating Claimants' investment.266 This is true both under the international law legal standard and under Colombian procedural guarantees.267\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 383.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 384.\n\n315.\n\n*First*, Claimants argue that Respondent arbitrarily initiated Asset Forfeiture Proceedings and disregarded its own Asset Forfeiture Law by failing to \"*safeguard*\" good faith third parties.268 The Attorney General's Office based the institution of Asset Forfeiture Proceedings against the Meritage Project on \"*the gossip of a drug trafficker*\" without questioning his credibility despite the fact that doubts in this regard were raised.269 Further, Claimants submit that the Attorney General's Office ignored the rights of good faith third parties when the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings formally commenced, since Respondent did not conduct any investigation or assessment in this regard.270\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 385-386.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 385; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 279.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 386; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 280.\n\n316.\n\nAs a result, Respondent ignored the Meritage Claimants \u2013 and particularly Newport \u2013 as good faith third parties and, thus, failed to consider and safeguard their rights throughout the proceedings, including those in the First Criminal Court of the Specialized Circuit for Asset Forfeiture of Antioquia.271 Claimants perceive this to be inadequate because they purportedly complied with the relevant standard of due diligence through commissioning *inter alia* Corficolombiana with the production of title studies.272\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 387; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 281-283.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 387.\n\n317.\n\n*Second*, Claimants state that there are \"*glaring red flags*\" to indicate that Respondent seized the Meritage Project on the grounds of a corruption scheme in which Colombian government officials collaborated with a known drug dealer to extort Mr. Seda.273 According to Claimants, on the one hand, the timing of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings suspiciously coincides with Mr. L\u00f3pez' extortion attempts against Mr. Seda and, on the other hand, the Colombian government officials pursuing the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings against the Meritage Project are subject of anti-corruption investigations themselves.274\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 389; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 285; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 99.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 390; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 285, 289-294; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 100-104.\n\n318.\n\nIn that regard, Claimants explain that Ms. Malag\u00f3n's handing over of the case to Ms. Ardila took place two days after Mr. L\u00f3pez and his attorney reinitiated their extortion attempts against Mr. Seda.275 Soon after Mr. Seda had ultimately declined to comply with Mr. L\u00f3pez' extortion demands, Ms. Ardila allegedly seized the Meritage Property.276 Further, Claimants contend that Mr. L\u00f3pez' attorney declared the window for negotiations closed on the day the precautionary measures resolution was signed.277 On top of that, Ms. Malag\u00f3n and Ms. Ardila, were accused of abusing their authority, extortion, and corruption schemes, according to Claimants.278\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 390.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 390; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 295-297.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 390; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 285.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 391-392; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 298-300; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 105-109.\n\n319.\n\nRelying on *Glencore International A.G. v. Colombia*, Claimants agree that they bear a *prima facie* burden to prove corruption for the Tribunal to be able to \"*connect the dots*\" in the indicia of corruption.279 Claimants argue that the above establishes *prima facie* corruption so that the burden of proof shall shift to Respondent, who is in possession of the relevant documents proving the corruption scheme.280 Claimants submit that Respondent has failed to produce rebuttal evidence or testimonies to debunk the red flags of corruption.281 Moreover, neither the review conducted by Mr. Caro of the Attorney General's Office Asset Forfeiture Unit for the Determination of the Claim nor the Colombian courts' approval of Colombia's actions cure the lack of due process in the initiation of the proceedings.282\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 286; Exhibit CL-125, *Glencore International A.G. and C.I.

Claimants argue that this was the only thing the Attorney General's Office did in the end \u2013 without addressing any substantive argument.284 Consequently, the competent court did not recognize Newport as an \"affected party\" in the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings, ignoring its evidence regarding the status of a good faith third party.285\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 394.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 394.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 395.\n\n321.\n\nClaimants state that Respondent's conduct throughout the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings was discriminatory, since it was selective.286 Specifically, the Attorney General's Office is stated to have found 47 properties associated with Mr. L\u00f3pez \u2013 but only one was seized, namely the Meritage Property.287 This appears to be most suspicious to Claimants as Respondent even refrained from seizing a parcel of land having been carved from the same parent property as the Meritage Property, thus sharing the same history in terms of ownership by narcotraffickers.288\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 397-398; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 37-40.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 398; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 274-275; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 41, 59-72.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 398; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 42-58.\n\n322.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants note that Respondent failed to treat Mr. Seda's criminal complaints concerning Mr. L\u00f3pez' extortion attempts adequately, while it immediately acted on Mr. L\u00f3pez' criminal complaint accusing Mr. Seda of defamation.289\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 400.\n\n323.\n\nClaimants believe that Respondent did not expropriate Claimants for a public purpose as they submit that there is no reasonable nexus between the public purpose declared in Colombia's Asset Forfeiture Law and Colombia's actual application of the asset forfeiture measures against the Meritage Project.290\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 403.\n\n324.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's position that the measures pursued a \"*legitimate public welfare objective*\", since the objectives of the Asset Forfeiture Law are to fight organized crime \u2013 and, at the same time, protect good faith third parties.291 Instead, Claimants argue, \"*Asset Forfeiture Proceedings were a gross misuse of the powers of the State that targeted the property of good faith third party buyers and left untouched the proceeds of illegal activity identified by Colombia itself*\", which is contradictory to the goals of the Law.292\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 240-247; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 34.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 248.\n\n325.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent based its Asset Forfeiture Proceedings on an unsubstantiated complaint regarding the criminal history of the Meritage Property filed by a former drug trafficker Mr. L\u00f3pez.293 Claimants are further convinced that Respondent's authorities understood that his story was false. They therefore shifted the basis of the proceedings to the fact that other individuals associated with criminal activity were part of the ownership history of the Meritage Property, while totally ignoring Respondent's own letters to Claimants stating the opposite.294\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 404.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 404.\n\n326.\n\nRelying on the report of the Former Deputy Attorney General Mart\u00ednez, Claimants argue that the public purpose of the measures is discredited by the fact that Respondent never pursued the proceeds of crime in the possession of the suspected criminals or taken any action to seize or disgorge profits made from transfers of the Meritage Property, which would have been a proper course of action.295\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 255-259.\n\n327.\n\nMoreover, Claimants contend that even if there was a deficiency in the ownership history, Colombian Asset Forfeiture Laws provide for protection of third parties who acquired an interest in or the affected assets themselves.296 In this case, this is what Respondent refused to do, instead ignoring Newport's potential status as good faith third party.297 Claimants rely on the due diligence steps they have undertaken *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Meritage Property.298\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 407.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 405.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 260-269.\n\n328.\n\nTaking into account the alleged corruption, Claimants conclude that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings initiated by corrupt prosecutors, in any case, cannot be for a public[299 purpose.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 408; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 249-252.\n\nb) Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nClaimants refer to Article 10.5(1) of the TPA stating that \"[e]*ach Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.*\"300\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 411.\n\n330.\n\nThe fair and equitable treatment standard (\"**FET standard**\") is interpreted by Claimants as an investor's protection, *inter alia*, from conduct that is (i) unreasonable, discriminatory, and arbitrary, (ii) not transparent and lacking in due process, and (iii) in frustration of an investor's legitimate expectations.301 Claimants claim that Respondent did not respect these aspects of fair and equitable treatment in relation to Claimants.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 414.\n\naa) Legal Standard\n------------------\n\n331.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's position that there is a distinction between the minimum standard of treatment investors are entitled to under customary international law and the FET standard.302 Instead, claimants submit that \"*the treatment under customary international law is a progressive standard that has converged with the autonomous FET standard to provide the same level of protection.*\"303 Claimants equally dismiss the proposition that Article 10.5(1) of the TPA only protects Claimants' investments in the State, and does not provide protection to Claimants themselves. A similar position was argued in a non-disputing party submission filed by the U.S. in *Bridgestone v. Panama*, which Claimants submit is irrelevant and non-binding.304\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 309.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 309.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 311-314; Exhibit RL-112,\u00a0*Bridgestone Licensing Services, Inc. and Bridgestone Americas, Inc. v.

However, Respondent initiated such proceedings only against the Meritage Project.326\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 438; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 338.\n\n346.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent lacked transparency when it suddenly shifted the basis for the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings from the transfer of property as a result of duress to Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' background as a drug trafficker.327\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 440; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 339-342.\n\n347.\n\nClaimants' due process rights were further violated by Respondent as follows.\n\n348.\n\n*First*, Claimants were unlawfully precluded from effective defense during the Asset Forfeiture Trial, as Newport's petitions were ignored.328 In this spirit, Claimants contend it to be unlawful that Colombian courts found that Newport had not been affected by the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings so that it does not have the ability to plead its good faith argument.329 This decision purportedly conflicts with the common definition of an \"affected\" party.330\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 442.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 442.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 442.\n\n349.\n\nTherefore, according to Claimants, Newport was denied its basic process right to be heard.331 Relying on the experts Dr. Medell\u00edn and Dr. Martinez, as well as the *Glencore* decision, Claimants submit that Newport should have had the opportunity to plead its good faith status as an affected party.332\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 348.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 443.\n\n350.\n\n*Second*, Claimants purport that Respondent failed to respect and protect the rights of Newport as a good faith third party in relation to the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.333 Newport had no opportunity to be heard prior to the seizure of the Meritage Property and initiation of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.334\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 445; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 343-345.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 117.\n\n351.\n\nClaimants argue that Colombia's Asset Forfeiture Law expressly guarantees the protection of rights of third parties acting in good faith.335 Moreover, due process rights pursuant to international law are independent of any rights Claimants may or may not have under domestic law.336\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 446; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 118.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 345.\n\n352.\n\nIn this spirit, Claimants contend that the Attorney General's Office has an obligation to \"*search for and collect proof*\" to ensure that no good faith third parties are affected by the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings and, if such evidence is found, it is obliged to cease the proceedings.337\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 446.\n\n353.\n\nAccording to Claimants, in this case, the Attorney General's Office breached the above principles as it did not initiate any investigation regarding the good faith status of the affected parties, including Newport.338\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 447; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 120-123.\n\n354.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the Attorney General's Office ignored multiple pleas brought by Newport concerning its good faith status.339 According to Claimants, even Newport's *Tutela* Action could not force the Attorney General's Office to engage with the substantive arguments presented by Newport.340\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 447; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 125.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 447.\n\n355.\n\nClaimants submit that Newport would have had to be awarded the status of a good faith third party if it had been regarded as an affected party in the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.341 Claimants explain Newport's good faith with the commissioning of Corficolombiana as a fiduciary and of an experienced law firm for carrying out a title study and, finally, with the obtention of a letter confirming no criminal record.342\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 448; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 129.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 448.\n\n356.\n\nThe only good faith third party the Attorney General's Office considered was Corficolombiana, and the Attorney General's Office unlawfully held the conducted due diligence to be insufficient.343 According to Claimants, the relevant SARLAFT due diligence required investigations only against the clients of the auditing financial entity pursuant to Article 102 of Decree 633 of 1993, and not against all prior title holders as the Attorney General's Office purports.344 Claimants summarize this subsequent claim of insufficiency as a \"*post hoc imposition of a legally unsupported standard*\", referring to the decisions in *Karkey v. Pakistan* and *Crystallex v. Venezuela*.345\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 448.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 448.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 452-454; Exhibit CL-114, *Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim A.S. v.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, 4 April 2016.\n\n357.\n\nClaimants submit that even if they had conducted due diligence against all prior title holders, they would not have been able to find Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas.346 In this regard, Claimants allege that his name did not appear on the property's chain of title as Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas had never been its direct owner.347 At most, he had been during several periods its indirect owner through several companies, *e.g.*, Inversiones Nueve represented by his son Mr. L\u00f3pez Betancur.348 Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' name only came up as a result of his criminal complaint and not before.349\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 449.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 449.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 449.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 449.\n\n358.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants substantiate the adequacy of Corficolombiana's due diligence with the negative results of other large national banks that also conducted title studies regarding the criminal record of the property and did not find any.350\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 450.\n\n359.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n360.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings did not only cease the development of the Meritage Project but also of all other projects associated with Mr. Seda.353 Those other projects include the Lux\u00e9, where construction had to be stalled as the financing bank stopped disbursing funds for the project.354 Therefore, Claimants claim that they have lost the value of their investments in this project. Other affected projects were Tierra Bomba, 450 Heights, and Santa F\u00e9.355\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 456; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 363-366; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 214-220.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 456; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 365.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 456.\n\n361.\n\nTo support the relevance of the measures' effect on other projects, Claimants cite the decision in *Rompetrol v. Romania* in which the tribunal held that it if a state does not take any steps to avoid, minimize, or mitigate a possibility of harm regarding a locally incorporated subsidiary, it could result in a breach of the FET standard.356\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 457; Exhibit CL-089, *The Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Award, 6 May 2013.\n\n362.\n\nIn that sense, Claimants submit that Respondent must have been aware of the possibility of the other projects being affected by the initiation of the proceedings, so that Respondent had to take steps against the possibility of harm but refrained from doing so.357 As a result, \"*by wantonly dragging* [Mr. Seda's] *name through the mud by instituting the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings, Colombia knowingly and foreseeably destroyed the value of* [other Claimants'] *investments as well.*\"358\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 458-459.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 366.\n\nLegitimate Expectations\n-----------------------\n\n363.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent violated a legitimate expectation held by Claimants that the Meritage Property's chain of title was unencumbered by illegality, and any subsequent purchasers would be considered good faith third parties.359 Claimants cite specific representations made by the Asset Forfeiture Unit of the Attorney General's Office to this effect.360 In reasonable reliance upon this specific representation, Claimants invested in the Meritage Project.361\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 350.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 350; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 203-204.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 354-357; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 205-208.\n\n364.\n\nLater, Claimants' legitimate expectations were frustrated when the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings were initiated against the Meritage Property due to an alleged illegality in the chain of title, and Claimants were not recognized as affected good faith third parties.362 Additionally, Respondent frustrated Claimants' legitimate expectation by refusing to recognize Newport as an affected good faith third party in the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.363\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 351.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 209-213.\n\nc) Breach of the National Treatment Standard\n--------------------------------------------\n\n365.\n\nApplying the National Treatment Standard of the TPA, Claimants draw the conclusion that Respondent breached the latter by \"*singl*[ing] *out the Meritage Project for Asset Forfeiture Proceedings while leaving intact other properties involving Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas in the chain of title*.\"364\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 193.\n\naa) Legal Standard\n------------------\n\n366.\n\nClaimants cite Article 10.3 of the TPA establishing that each party shall accord to investors as well as to covered investments treatment no less favorable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors and investments of its own investors.365\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 460.\n\n367.\n\nTo establish this standard, Claimants contend that it is sufficient to present a *prima facie* case of a different and less favorable treatment.366\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 461.\n\n368.\n\nClaimants explain that the question of investors being in like circumstances can regularly be affirmed if they are competing entities in the same business or economic sector.367\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 462.\n\n369.\n\nRelevant criteria to assess the character of the protected investor are, according to Claimants, (i) whether the measure on its face appears to favor the host state's nationals over non-nationals or, (ii) whether the practical effect of the measure creates a disproportionate benefit for nationals over non-nationals.368\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 463.\n\n370.\n\nRegarding the burden of proof, Claimants contend that it shifts to the host State as soon as an investor presents *prima facie* evidence of discriminatory treatment. The host State then must justify its treatment by showing a reasonable nexus to rational government policies.369\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 464.\n\nbb) Respondent's Less Favorable Treatment of the Meritage Claimants and Their Investment\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n371.\n\nClaimants allege that the Meritage Project was singled out for seizure under Asset Forfeiture Proceedings while other properties involving Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas in their chain of title were not.370 More specifically, Respondent did not take any action against the other parcel of land which has formerly been part of the same parent property as the Meritage Property and now belongs to Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' half-brother (to which Claimants refer to as the \"**Sister Property**\") or any other L\u00f3pez Vanegas Property.371\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 465.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 465; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 193; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 42-47. With respect to the other properties, *see* Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 59 *et seq*.\n\n372.\n\n*First*, according to Claimants, these facts constitute \"*like circumstances*\" under Article 10.3 of the TPA between the Meritage Claimants and Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' half-brother, as Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas appears in both property's chain of title.372 Claimants submit that ownership by Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas is \"*the most salient circumstance in this case for the purpose of comparison*\", since the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings against the Meritage Project were initiated on the basis of its association with Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas.373 Additionally, these properties were subject to the same legal and regulatory regime and are in the same economic sector.374\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 465; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 198.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 199.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 202-203.\n\n373.\n\n*Second*, Claimants argue that Respondent's differential treatment of the Meritage Project compared to other L\u00f3pez Vanegas Properties has no rational justification.375\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 204-210; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 48-58.\n\n374.\n\nClaimants submit that \"[t]*he only difference between the Meritage Property and the other L\u00f3pez Vanegas Properties is that the former was to house a multi-million dollar project backed largely by U.S. investors whereas the latter is owned by a Colombian national*.\"376\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 193.\n\n375.\n\n*Finally*, while denying that it is a separate requirement, Claimants submit that Respondent's measures negatively impacted Claimants' investments, since Claimants lost their investment in the Meritage Project and the associated stigma resulted in the loss of Claimants' investment in its other development projects.377\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 211-214.\n\nd) Breach of the Full Protection and Security Standard\n------------------------------------------------------\n\naa) Legal Standard\n------------------\n\n376.\n\nClaimants summarize that Article 10.5(1) of the TPA requires Respondent to provide full protection and security (\"**FPS**\") to Claimants' investments, including a level of police protection required under customary international law pursuant to Article 10.5(2)(b) of the TPA.378 Claimants reject Respondent's argument that a distinction exists between protection granted to investments and protection granted to investors under the TPA.379 Instead, Claimants submit that investor who makes the investment is implicitly incorporated in the meaning of \"*investment.*\"380\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 466.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 370.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 370.\n\n377.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants purport that the \"*FPS extends beyond the obligation to ensure the physical security of an investment, and includes the guarantee of commercial and legal security.*\"381 Claimants explain that to satisfy this standard the host State is required to exercise vigilance and due diligence towards investors and their investments.382 This allegedly includes taking all measures necessary to ensure the full enjoyment and protection and security of the investment and to take reasonable, precautionary and preventive action against harm to the protected investment.383 The inquiry is fact-specific.384\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 467; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 371.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 467.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 467.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 374.\n\n378.\n\nClaimants also submit that there is a distinction between \"*general insecurity*\" and \"*specific instances of harassment*\", with the latter requiring a heightened degree of diligence.385\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 373.\n\n379.\n\nClaimants cite Prof. Christoph Schreuer emphasizing the relevance of a secure factual and legal framework, and the taking of measures against adverse actions of private persons and State organs as well as the creation of legal remedies against such actions.386\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 468.\n\nbb) Respondent's Actions Breaching the FPS Standard\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nIn Claimants' opinion, Respondent failed to comply with the FPS standard as the Meritage Claimants' investment had been subject to a corrupt extortion scheme by officials from the Attorney General's Office and Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas for two years, which Respondent failed to properly investigate and prosecute.387 Consequently, Claimants allege that Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas and his representatives harassed Mr. Seda with the launch of Asset Forfeiture Proceedings against the Meritage Project if he did not pay them.388\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 469; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 376-377.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 469.\n\n381.\n\nClaimants contend that Respondent was obliged to lift the precautionary measures against the Meritage Project as it acknowledged Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' story to be a hoax.389 Furthermore, Respondent failed to identify and protect good faith third parties such as Newport even if it was obliged to do so under international and domestic law.390\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 470.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 470.\n\n382.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent purportedly failed to protect Claimants' investments from unlawful actions of third parties despite express requests for assistance.391 For example, Mr. Seda's official complaint against Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas with the Attorney General's Office was left without consideration.392 This request was dismissed without a detailed assessment just a month later.393 Other examples of threats of violence against Mr. Seda include a police report filed by Mr. Seda as a result of an assassination attempt against himself and threats to his daughter, which forced Mr. Seda to leave Colombia.394\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 223.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 471.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 471.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 473; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 378.\n\n383.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n384.\n\nCiting *Pezold v.

Claimants' Entitlement to Full Reparation**\n------------------------------------------------\n\na) Legal Standard\n-----------------\n\n385.\n\nTo establish their claim for damages, Claimants rely on Article 10.26(1) of TPA, which gives the Tribunal the power to \"*make a final award against*\" Respondent, in which it may award \"*monetary damages and any applicable interest*\", including \"*in lieu of restitution*.\" Claimants argue that they are entitled to reparation in accordance with the applicable principles of international law for the breaches of the TPA committed by Respondent, as described above.398\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 476.\n\n386.\n\nClaimants submit that the TPA does not establish the applicable measure of damages for the State's unlawful expropriation or breaches of the National Treatment and FET standards, therefore applicable principles of international law govern.399 Citing *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* and Article 31(1) of the International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility (\"**ILC Articles**\"), Claimants refer to the principle of \"*full reparation*\", which requires that Claimants be placed in the same economic position they would have been in had Respondent not committed the breaches, *i.e.*, the \"but-for\" scenario.400\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 477-478.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 478-481.\n\n387.\n\nAccording to Claimants, \"*the starting point for assessing damages for unlawful conduct is often the fair market value ('**FMV**') of an investment immediately before the breach.*\"401 Claimants argue that such fair market value must be unaffected by the State's measures and constitute \"*the floor of compensation*\" due to Claimants.402\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 482-483.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 483; Claimants' Reply, \u00b6 405.\n\n388.\n\nClaimants submit that, in contrast, Respondent's expert does not calculate the FMV of Claimants' investment.403 Instead, Respondent's expert attempts to calculate the sum of the historical costs incurred by Claimants for the development of the Projects, *i.e.*, sunk- cost approach which makes his calculation irrelevant for the assessment of damages.404 Claimants submit that Respondent eventually accepted the income-based approach during the Hearing.405\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 406.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 406;

Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 231.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 385-386.\n\n390.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's argument that any losses attributed to Claimants' project other than Meritage Project lack connection to Respondent's measures.409 Instead, Claimants submit that it was not only the Meritage Project that lost value as a result of Respondent's actions, but other assets owned by Claimants in Colombia.410 Claimants submit as a result of precautionary measures, \"*construction came to a halt, sales were stopped, Banco de Bogot\u00e1 accelerated the loan it had just granted to the Project, Unit Buyers refused to make further payments on the units they had purchased, and later even brought an arbitration claim against Newport and Corficolombiana.*\"411 Further, as Claimants submit, Colpatria halted loans disbursement to the Lux\u00e9 Project, expressly citing the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings, and other investors stepped down from the Lux\u00e9 Project.412\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 388-389.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 388-389;

Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 233-235.\n\n392.\n\nClaimants also reject Respondent's contention that other factors, such as delays in construction and actions of Claimants' counteragents, contributed to the failures in Claimants' portfolio, arguing that Respondent has cherry-picked evidence and ignored established causation.414\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 236-241.\n\nc) Appropriate Valuation Date\n-----------------------------\n\n393.\n\nClaimants submit that the appropriate valuation date for Claimants' damages in the present case is 25 January 2017, the date when the Colombian Attorney General's Office issued a Determination of the Claim, formally instituting Asset Forfeiture Proceedings against the Meritage Project and triggering an indefinite seizure of the latter.415 This is when the date, on which \"*Colombia's treaty breaches led to an irreversible and substantial deprivation of the value of Claimants' investments.*\"416\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 484-489.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 484.\n\n394.\n\nFor the breaches other than unlawful expropriation, Claimants argue that the appropriate valuation date is the date of irreversible deprivation of value or crystallization of loss.417 Claimants argue that the measures had a negative impact on other development projects as well.418\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 486.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 393-395.\n\n395.\n\nClaimants argue that in cases of unlawful expropriation, claimants are entitled to choose between a valuation as of the date of the State's unlawful expropriation and a valuation as of the date of the tribunal's award.419\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 485.\n\nd) Application of Income- and Market-Based Valuation Methodology\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n396.\n\nClaimants contend that the Tribunal has discretion in applying one of the following methodologies to assess the FMV of an investment: income-, market-, or asset-based, with the last one being disfavored by the tribunals on account of its poor reflection of future potential of the investment.420 According to Claimants, income-based approach, calculating the present value of a business based on its anticipated cash flows using a discounted cash flow (\"**DCF**\") analysis, is \"*theoretically the strongest*\" and by far the most commonly used method to determine the FMV.421 The DCF analysis is \"*reasonable and reliable*\" and any uncertainties of this method can be accounted for by applying through various controls, including by appropriately discounting the cash flows, as well as performing cross-checks.422\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 491.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 410, 412-420.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 410, 422-440.\n\n397.\n\nClaimants submit that BRG's assumptions underlying the income-based approach are \"*based on contemporaneous business models from the Claimants and validated by JLL's market research*\" and therefore \"*provide a reasonable and* 'middle of the road' *basis to value Claimants' investments.*\"423\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 245-247, 256-278.\n\n398.\n\nClaimants describe Mr. Seda's successful track record and reputation, citing the average daily occupancy rates of Charlee Hotel, sale of all the units in Lux\u00e9 within three months of the sales launch, as well as sale of nearly all phase 1 units of Meritage Project as of August 2016.424 This allowed Mr. Seda \"*to build a robust pipeline of additional projects*\", including Cartagena resort Tierra Bomba, other planned mixed-use developments in Medell\u00edn's suburbs, 450 Heights and Santa F\u00e9 de Antioquia; and a planned condominium project with three hotels in the outskirts of Bogot\u00e1, Prado Tolima.425 According to Claimants, this demonstrates that FMV of Claimants' investments must include the future potential value of Claimants' projects.426\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 492.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 493.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 494.\n\ne) Damages Calculation\n----------------------\n\n399.\n\nIn order to calculate damages under the income- and market-based approach, Claimants' experts, BRG, used the DCF methodology.427 BRG also used market data sourced from Jones Lang LaSalle (\"**JLL**\"), a real estate and hospitality consultancy, to complement and validate the data used in Claimants' contemporaneous business plans and internal documents.428\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 495.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 495.\n\n400.\n\nThe damages were calculated as the difference between the value, as of the date of valuation, of each of Claimants' projects in the \"actual\" and \"but-for\" scenarios.429 The cash flows for the \"but-for\" scenario comprised \"*expected revenue for each of Claimants' Projects from (i) unit sales, based on the number of units, timing of sales, equilibrium point and projected prices; and (ii) fees from hotel operations, based on the number of rooms, forecasted average daily occupancy rates, food and beverage revenues, management and incentive fees, etc.*\"430 The cost components of the cash flows, in turn, included \"*pre-development expenses, land purchase costs, construction costs, sales and marketing costs, fees for developer, contractor, architect and fiduciary, among others, and taxes.*\"431\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 496.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 497.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 497.\n\n401.\n\nThe forecasted cash flows were then converted into USD and discounted using the weighted average cost of capital (\"**WACC**\") to calculate the present value as of the date of valuation for each of the projects.432 Lastly, the value of any long-term financial debt held by the Project as of the date of valuation was deducted.433\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 498.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 498.\n\n402.\n\nClaimants submit that in the \"actual\" scenario, Respondent's measures suspended all of Claimants' projects, therefore actual value of Claimants' projects is \"*only the residual value of the land held by Claimants as of the date of valuation.*\"434 The latter was therefore subtracted from the \"but-for\" value of Claimants' projects and the equity damages were then divided among Mr. Seda and the rest of Claimants according to their respective interests.435\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 499.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 500.\n\n403.\n\nBRG then compared the income-approach derived values with independent valuations under a market-based approach, using data from JLL.436 Claimants submit that the market generated values were consistent with the values generated under the income-based DCF approach using Claimants' internal business planning documents.437\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 501.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 501.\n\n404.\n\nMoreover, BRG estimated the \"*value of Claimants' brand by estimating the future value of Claimants' business beyond the value of the projects under construction and in development*\" by developing an estimate of the value of additional projects later in time based on cash flows from Claimants' existing projects, accounting for risk.438\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 502.\n\n405.\n\nFinally, BRG accounted for the probability of failure of the projects in development by applying a haircut of 23%, derived from data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, to the intrinsic value of Tierra Bomba, 450 Heights, and Santa F\u00e9, as well as to the value of Claimants' brand.439\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 503.\n\n406.\n\nAccordingly, for the Memorial, Claimants' experts calculated that the damages due to Mr. Seda are USD 290.6 million and damages due to other Claimants are USD 18.6 million.440 In the Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants submitted that they were seeking USD 203.6 million in damages.441\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 504-505.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 282.\n\n407.\n\nIn addition to economic damages, Claimants submit that Respondent must pay moral damages to Mr. Seda for \"*the personal and reputational harm*\" he suffered as a result of Respondent's actions.442 Claimants rely on Article 31(2) of the ILC Articles that defines \"*injury*\" as \"*any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State*\" as well as investment arbitration tribunals that concluded that \"*an injury to an investor's credit, reputation and prestige is compensable in the form of moral damages.*\"443\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 510; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 280-281.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 510-511.\n\n408.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's contention that awarding moral damages would lead to double-dipping and argue that the personal harm to Mr. Seda extends beyond the economic harm to his real estate projects.444\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 454.\n\n409.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent has tarnished Mr. Seda's reputation by refusal to assess or grant Newport a status of a good faith party, thereby implying that Mr. Seda was associated with criminal activity \u2013 an implication \"*fatal to one's reputation.*\"445 Describing the incidents of what they describe as \"[t]*he extortion campaign, threat of and actual physical violence against Mr. Seda, threats against Mr. Seda's family, and continued harassment by Colombian authorities*\", Claimants also submit that Respondent's actions have impacted Mr. Seda's physical and mental well-being.446\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 512;

Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 279.\n\n413.\n\nBRG calculates the \"*commercially reasonable rate*\" as 5.23% for the real estate and 4.83% for the hospitality businesses, based on the 5-year trailing average of JP Morgan's Emerging Bond Index and corporate bond yields for real estate development and hotel operations.451 Consequently, as of 15 June 2020 (using the filing date as a proxy for the date of the Award), Claimants submit that the pre- and post-award interest owed to Mr. Seda comprises USD 44.5 million and that owed to the remaining Claimants USD 2.8 million.452 In contrast, Claimants argue, the U.S. risk free rate suggested by Colombia is not \"*commercially reasonable*\" and ignores the commercial enterprise in which Claimants were invested.453\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 508.\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 508.\n\nClaimants' Reply, \u00b6 449.\n\n414.\n\nClaimants also submit that corporate taxes that Claimants would have paid in Colombia had their Projects been allowed to develop were accounted for by BRG, and therefore, the Award should not be subjected to any further taxes by Respondent.454\n\nClaimants' Memorial, \u00b6 509;

Relief Sought by Claimants**\n---------------------------------\n\n416.\n\nIn the Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants sought the following relief from the Tribunal:\n\n\"*(a) DECLARE that Colombia has breached its obligations to Claimants under the TPA;*\n\n*(b) ORDER Colombia to pay Claimants in excess of USD 255.8 million to be updated as of the date of the Award;*\n\n*(c) ORDER Colombia to pay Mr. Seda 10 percent of the total damages owed to him in moral damages;*\n\n*(d) ORDER Colombia to pay the Award net of taxes;*\n\n*(e) ORDER Colombia to pay all of the costs and expenses of the Arbitration, including Claimants' legal fees, the fees and expenses of any experts, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and ICSID's other costs;*\n\n*(f) REJECT the new items for relief at paragraphs 974(a)-(b) added by Respondent to the Rejoinder; and*\n\n*(g) AWARD such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate.*\"456\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief, Section VII.\n\n**II. Summary of Respondent's Position and Relief Sought**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nIt is Respondent's position that Article 22.2 of the TPA applies, and the case should be dismissed (**1.**). Alternatively, Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction (**2.**). Should the Tribunal acknowledge jurisdiction, Respondent submits to have fully complied with the provisions of the TPA, so that the Tribunal should dismiss the entirety of the claims on the merits (**3.**) and that, in the alternative, Claimants are not entitled to any damages (**4.**). Respondent also claims all the costs incurred in connection with this arbitration (**4.f)**).\n\n**1. Essential Security Interest**\n----------------------------------\n\na) Essential Security Exception\n-------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nRespondent submits that it invoked the Essential Security Exception not belatedly, as Claimants argues, but \"*in good faith, only after new developments coupled with new information came to light, making it patent that what is at stake in these proceedings is Colombia's ability to exercise its sovereign criminal power to fight the activities of a criminal organization whose members, including those of the highest rank, have successively held the Meritage Lot and have engaged in money laundering operations that permeate its transfers up to the present.*\"457\n\nRespondent's Reply to Claimants' Application of 7 March 2022, 18 March 2022 (\"**Respondent's Reply to Claimants' Application of 7 March 2022**\"), p. 5.\n\n419.\n\nRespondent argues that the applicable rule is Arbitration Rule 41(2), which reflects the duty of the Tribunal to satisfy itself that all jurisdictional requirements are fulfilled before it proceeds to the examination of the merits of the case.458 According to Respondent, this applies *a fortiori* given that Article 22.2 (b) of the TPA excludes from the scope of arbitration the invocation of essential security exceptions.459 Respondent submits that there is no time limit that would circumscribe this power and duty of the Tribunal.460\n\nRespondent's Reply to Claimants' Application of 7 March 2022, p. 7.\n\nRespondent's Reply to Claimants' Application of 7 March 2022, p. 7.\n\nRespondent's Reply to Claimants' Application of 7 March 2022, p. 7.\n\n420.\n\nAlternatively, Respondent argues that the Essential Security Exception \u2013 if it would be considered a merits defense \u2013 was invoked in compliance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules and the PO1, and that the principles of procedural fairness and equality of arms are not impacted.461\n\nRespondent's Reply to Claimants' Application of 7 March 2022, pp. 8-14.\n\nb) Effect of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA\n---------------------------------------\n\n421.\n\nRespondent first raised the Essential Security Exception in February 2022 with its Rejoinder and made two submissions in this regard.\n\n422.\n\n*First*, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the dispute on the basis of the ordinary language of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA:\n\n\"[T]*he Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the legality of measures that the State considers necessary for the protection of its own essential security interests. On this ground, the Tribunal must decline jurisdiction over the present dispute.*\"462\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Merits, 17 February 2022 (\"**Respondent's Rejoinder**\"), \u00b6 29.\n\n423.\n\nRespondent submits that \"*Article 22.2 (b) of the Treaty, read together with its interpretative footnote, establish that arbitral tribunals are bound to apply Article 22.2 (b) whenever it is invoked in an arbitration initiated under Chapter 10 of the Treaty*\", since the State parties to the TPA carved out the Tribunal's power to assess whether the conditions of Article 22.2(b) are met.463\n\nRespondent's Reply to Claimants' Application of 7 March 2022, pp. 15-16.\n\n424.\n\n*Second*, Respondent provides that, in the alternative, should the Tribunal find it has jurisdiction over the dispute, the security exception must be found to apply and must result in a finding that Respondent has not breached any TPA obligations. Respondent submits that it:\n\n\"*enjoys full discretion to define what constitutes its essential security interests, to the extent that such definition is done in good faith**.** Here, the Respondent identifies its 'essential security interests' as being those related to the 'quintessential functions of the* [Colombian State]*, namely, the protection of its territory and its population* [\u2026]*, and the maintenance of law and public order internally.' The position of the Republic of Colombia in this arbitration is that it seeks, through Asset Forfeiture Proceedings, to fight against organized crime, money laundering, and drug trafficking, thus ultimately protecting its population from the threats of paramilitary and marginalized groups that have been ravaging the country for years.*\"464\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 55.\n\n425.\n\nRespondent submits that the characterization of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA as providing a ground for preclusion from wrongfulness is incorrect, and *LG&E v. Argentina* should be distinguished.465 In contrast to the circumstances precluding wrongfulness of a State's conduct listed in Chapter V of the ILC Articles, treaty exceptions \"*operate as a derogation from the obligations undertaken by the parties to the treaty.*\"466 Respondent submits that these are \"*non-precluded measures*\" to which the State can resort.467\n\nRespondent's Reply to Claimants' Application of 7 March 2022, p. 19; Exhibit CL-045, *LG&E and others v Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006.\n\nRespondent's Reply to Claimants' Application of 7 March 2022, p. 20.\n\nRespondent's Reply to Claimants' Application of 7 March 2022, p. 20.\n\n426.\n\nRespondent argues that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings are the measure enacted for the purpose of the stated security exception.468\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52, 56.\n\n427.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Submissions, Respondent submitted another distinct level of argument in interpreting Article 22.2(b) of the TPA. According to Respondent's new primary case, under Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, the Tribunal lacks justiciability over the dispute, that is the \"*ability to subject such invocation to any legal assessment*.\"469 According to Respondent, the Tribunal is bound to the conclusion that the exception in Article 22.2(b) of the TPA applies without making \"*any legal assessment at all.*\"470 This is because, Respondent argues, the language of the provision and the nature of essential security form part of Respondent's sovereignty. Respondent maintains that, for these reasons, the dispute is non-justiciable.471 Respondent submits that the long-standing U.S. treaty practice confirms this conclusion.472\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, 25 August 2022 (\"**Respondent's Post-Hearing Submission**\"), \u00b6 20.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 22.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 23.\n\nRespondent's Submission on [REDACTED] and on the U.S. Treaty Practice on Essential Security Interests Exceptions, 21 December 2022 (\"**Respondent's Submission on** [REDACTED] **and on the U.S. Treaty Practice on Essential Security Interests Exceptions**\"), \u00b6\u00b6 22-31.\n\n428.\n\nShould the Tribunal reject Respondent's primary submission on non-justiciability, Respondent, in the alternative, argues a lack of jurisdiction.\n\n429.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the language of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA confirms that the State parties to the TPA intended to exclude matters of essential security from the jurisdiction of any tribunal. Respondent argues that this is confirmed by the submissions of the U.S. during the Hearing and the *travaux*.473 Respondent advances five arguments in support of this position.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 25.\n\n430.\n\n*First*, Respondent interprets Article 22.2(b) of the TPA in line with the rules of treaty interpretation under the VCLT.\n\n431.\n\nRespondent submits that, following the ordinary meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA under Article 31(1) of the VCLT, it is evident that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction once the Essential Security Exception is invoked because the provision is self-judging. The State parties to the TPA have purposefully excluded any \"*objective*\" or \"*non-self-judging elements*\" from Article 22.2(b) of the TPA to restrict the scope of a tribunal's jurisdiction over Chapter 10, according to Respondent.474\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\n432.\n\nRespondent provides several references to the drafting history of the TPA to show an intention to remove the Essential Security Exception from the remit of an external review.475 Respondent further submits that Article 10.2 of the TPA provides that the Essential Security Exception should prevail in case of inconsistencies between Chapter 10 (on dispute resolution) and Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, evidencing that when the exception is raised, the dispute resolution mechanism is disabled.476 Respondent argues that such interpretation is consistent with the object and purpose of the TPA which is to combat narco-trafficking.477\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 31.\n\nRespondent's Reply to Claimants' Application of 7 March 2022, p. 16; Respondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 41.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 42.\n\n433.\n\n*Second*, Respondent maintains that the wording of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA is purposeful when compared to the other investment agreements concluded by Respondent and the self-judging nature of the Essential Security Exception is to be recognized through the *effect utile* principle.478\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 44.\n\n434.\n\n*Third*, Respondent relies on case law dealing with essential security exceptions. Respondent submits that decisions by the ICJ, the World Trade Organization (\"**WTO**\"), and investment tribunals show that where phrases such as \"*it considers*\" are used in a provision and no \"*limitative qualifying clauses*\" are included, that provision is self-judging.479\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 46.\n\n435.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants' interpretation of the decision of the *Eco Oro* tribunal to the effect that Article 22.2(b) of the TPA does not limit the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Respondent argues that the present dispute is substantially different from the facts of the *Eco Oro* case and no analogy can be drawn. According to Claimants, the relevant provision in the *Eco Oro* case, Article 2201(3) of the Canada-Colombia free trade agreement (\"**FTA**\"), did not include the same self-judging elements as Article 22.2(b) of the TPA. Respondent maintains that while Article 22.2(b) of the TPA applies to the entire Treaty, Article 2201(3) of the Canada-Colombia FTA is limited to the investment chapter only. Furthermore, Respondent claims that the U.S. have rejected Claimants' analogy to the *Eco Oro* case, proving that it is not possible to use the findings of that tribunal in the present case.480\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 48.\n\n436.\n\n*Fourth*, Respondent's interpretation purportedly reflects the authentic interpretation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA. Respondent argues that because both State parties to the TPA have provided identical interpretations of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA during the Hearing, this interpretation should be binding on the Tribunal under Article 31(3) of the VCLT. This is, Respondent claims, because the common interpretation between Respondent and the U.S. represents \"*objective evidence of the understanding of the parties as to the meaning of the Treaty.*\"481\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 50.\n\n437.\n\n*Finally*, Respondent relies on the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* to confirm its position. Respondent submits that the drafting history of the TPA clearly evidences that Article 22.2(b) of the TPA was intended by the Contracting Parties to be self-judging and that a tribunal is not empowered to exercise jurisdiction after the Essential Security Exception has been invoked. Respondent disagrees with Claimants' argument that the *travaux* are irrelevant because the ordinary meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA is unambiguous. Respondent maintains that arbitral tribunals have turned to the drafting history to ascertain the intention of the contracting parties even where a provision was not unclear.482\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 56.\n\nc) Scope of the Tribunal's Review\n---------------------------------\n\n438.\n\nIn case the Tribunal decides it has jurisdiction over the dispute, which Respondent submits it does not, Respondent maintains that Claimants' case should be dismissed on the merits because Asset Forfeiture Proceedings fall within the remit of the Essential Security Exception.\n\n439.\n\nInitially, in the Rejoinder, Respondent argued that the standard of review should be that of good faith:\n\n\"*It is the Respondent's submission that the Tribunal's scope for review of Colombia's invocation of the exception is strictly circumscribed to an examination of whether the exception of essential security of Article 22.2.b has been invoked in good faith by Colombia.*\"483\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 43.\n\n440.\n\nLater, Respondent argues that the Tribunal is merely permitted to carry out a *prima facie* review which includes the following four elements:\n\n\"*that the host State (i) adopts measures (ii) that it considers necessary, and (iii) that such measures be adopted for the protection of the (iv) essential security interests of the State invoking the exception.*\"484\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 66.\n\n441.\n\nRespondent submits that it is undisputed between Claimants and Respondent that elements (ii) and (iv) fall outside the Tribunal's scope of review. Respondent further maintains that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings constitute a \"measure\" in the sense of element (i). Respondent claims that the Tribunal therefore should only review if \"*the measures adopted by Colombia could plausibly be expected to protect its Essential Security interests.*\"485\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 69.\n\n442.\n\nRespondent submits that the correct test to determine the link between the measure and the essential security interest is \"*plausibility*\", and maintains that it is not implausible that the Asset Forfeiture Law, the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings, and the parallel criminal proceedings are connected to Respondent's interest to combat narco-trafficking.486 Respondent disputes that the Tribunal is permitted to carry out any further review, including whether Article 22.2(b) of the TPA has been invoked in good faith or arbitrarily.487\n\nRespondent's Reply to Claimants' Application of 7 March 2022, p. 22; Respondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 70.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 71.\n\n443.\n\nRespondent submits that once the Essential Security Exception is raised, Claimants are not entitled to any form of compensation, as Article 22.2(b) of the TPA absolves Respondent from liability.488 Respondent argues that an invocation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA precludes an internationally wrongful act \u2013 and absent such, no compensation is owed to Claimants.489\n\nRespondent's Reply to Claimants' Application of 7 March 2022, pp. 23-24.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 80.\n\n444.\n\nRespondent disputes Claimants' argument that Article 22.2(b) of the TPA prohibits the Tribunal from ordering reversal of measures taken in protection of essential security interests \u2013 but still allows for compensation in monetary damages. Respondent denies that there is a hierarchy within public international law regarding the forms of reparations and argues that the TPA cannot be read in a way that prohibits one form \u2013 restitution \u2013 but allows another \u2013 compensation.490 Respondent further objects to Claimants being awarded compensation as the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings are ongoing and the Meritage Lot has not yet been forfeited.491\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 83.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 84.\n\n445.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants' submission that Respondent can only invoke Article 22.2(b) of the TPA over an essential security interest identified at the time the measures where first enacted because the relevant provision is drafted in the present tense. Respondent argues that there is no time limit set out in the TPA within which the Essential Security Exception is to be raised. The language of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, Respondent maintains, merely dictates that the Tribunal put itself \"*at the time of the invocation of the exception*\" to decide if Respondent considered the adopted measures necessary for the protection of an essential security interest.492\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 91.\n\nd) MFN Clause\n-------------\n\n446.\n\nRespondent opposes Claimants' argument that they are entitled to the same protection as Swiss investors under the Colombia-Swiss BIT via the MFN standard. *First*, Respondent submits that Article 10.4 of the TPA \"*expressly bars the importation of investor-State dispute settlement mechanisms through its MFN clause.*\"493 *Second*, Respondent argues that Claimants' request to be granted more favorable treatment under the Colombia-Swiss BIT does not meet the requirements of the MFN clause. *Third*, Respondent maintains that Article 10.4 of the TPA cannot be used to \"*import third treaty provisions to bypass the express exclusions provided in the treaty.*\"494\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 95.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Submission, \u00b6 95.\n\n**2. Jurisdictional Objections**\n--------------------------------\n\n447.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants failed to prove that they have made an \"investment\" under the TPA and the ICSID Convention (**a**), that the vast majority of Claimants' claims does not concern the Meritage Project (**b**), and that Claimants have failed to show that The Boston Enterprises Trust and Mr. Brian Hass are entitled to bring investment claims before the Tribunal (**c**) and (**d**).\n\na) No Investment under the TPA and the ICSID Convention\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n448.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants' investment does not have the \"*characteristics of an investment*\" and, therefore, does not qualify for protection under the TPA and the ICSID Convention.495 Respondent submits that Claimants have failed to prove that they made an economic contribution or commitment of capital or resources qualifying for treaty protection, and that there was an assumption of risk.496\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 512; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 113.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 247; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 509.\n\n449.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants ought to have examined jurisdiction following a dual test considering not only Chapter 10 of the TPA but also the ICSID Convention standard set forth in its Article 25(1), which imposes an autonomous definition of \"*investment.*\"497 More specifically, Respondent highlights that Claimants failed to prove the commitment of capital, a certain duration, as well as the assumption of an investment risk, which are prerequisites for jurisdiction according to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.498\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 249; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 513.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 254, 259; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 513.\n\n450.\n\nAccording to Respondent, even if the ICSID Convention does not impose any additional requirements to define investment, the purported investment must still have \"*the characteristics of an investment*\" under the TPA, including the commitment of capital, the expectation of gain or profit, and the assumption of risk.499 Relying on *Seo v. Korea*, where the tribunal adopted a \"*global assessment*\" test to determine whether claimants made an investment, Respondent submits that the tribunal assessed the additional characteristics contained in the base treaty and left the opportunity open for further characteristics, such as duration.500\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 515.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 518; Exhibit CL\u2010134, *Seo v. The Government of the Republic of Korea*, HKIAC Case No. 18117, Final Award, 27 September 2019.\n\n451.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants' investment fails the \"*global assessment*\" test.501\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 521; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 114.\n\n452.\n\nAs regards commitment of capital, Respondent submits that Claimants have failed to provide evidence of significant contribution of capital or other own resources into the Meritage Project.502Respondent bases its argument on Newport's audited financial statements between 2013 and 2017, which record less than USD 2 million contributed by the shareholders between 2013 and 2017, but do not specify which shareholders.503 Respondent argues that even assuming that all of Claimants provided the contributions, it would still be insignificant, with contribution of other resources beyond capital injection being negligible.504\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 522.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 256; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 522.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 523-524.\n\n453.\n\nIn addition, according to Respondent, Claimants failed to show a commitment of capital as they did not prove their rights *in rem* over the Meritage Property.505\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 257.\n\n454.\n\nAs regards investment risk, Respondent argues that general risks do not suffice, and an investment risk must be \"*qualified and strictly related to the investment*\", which Claimants did not undertake.506 Furthermore, due to their close connection, an investment risk cannot exist in the absence of a contribution of capital.507\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 525.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 262.\n\n455.\n\nAs regards expectation of gain, Respondent argues that in the absence of any commitment of capital or other resources and assumption of risk, a mere expectation of gain or profit cannot be sufficient to establish an investment.508\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 528.\n\n456.\n\nFinally, Respondent contends that Claimants have failed to demonstrate that they have unencumbered rights over the shares in Royal Realty, Newport, and Lux\u00e9.509 As of the filing of the Request for Arbitration, most of Claimants' shares in Newport and Lux\u00e9 had been pledged as a collateral in favor of Downie North LLC, as were Mr. Seda's shares in Royal Realty.510 Respondent argues that absent any evidence as to the rights of Downie North LLC over Claimants' investment, the extent of Claimants' control over their shares in Royal Realty, Newport, and Lux\u00e9 remains unclear.511\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 529; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 115.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 530.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 531.\n\nb) Connection between the Meritage Project and Claimants' Claims\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n457.\n\nRespondent contends that only 25% of Claimants' damages claims concern damages in connection with the Meritage Project and the remainder fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction.512 Particularly, Brian Hass, Stephen J. Bobeck, Monte G. Adcock, Justin T. Enbody, and Justin T. Caruso only hold shares in Lux\u00e9.513 Moreover, Respondent states that some of the claims brought by The Boston Enterprises Trust and many of the damages claimed by Mr. Seda concern alleged losses in Lux\u00e9 and other projects, such as Cartagena Tierra Bomba, 450 Heights, and Santa F\u00e9 de Antioquia.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 263; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 533.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 264.\n\n458.\n\nRelying on Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 10.1.1 of the TPA, Respondent argues that for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction, the claims must \"*directly*\" arise out of or be \"*related to*\" the investments, which requires a legally significant connection between them.514 Claimants have failed to show such legally significant connection between the measures against the Meritage Project and claims related to other projects.515\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 536-537; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 116.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 540; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 117.\n\nc) Lack of Standing of The Boston Enterprises Trust\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nRespondent submits that The Boston Enterprises Trust is barred from seeking investment protection before the Tribunal since it does not qualify as a \"*national of another Contracting State*\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and, additionally, the circumstances of its establishment and acquisition of shares in Newport and Lux\u00e9 prevent it from invoking the said protection.516\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 267.\n\n460.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Respondent argued that The Boston Enterprises Trust lacks legal personality as it is an unincorporated consortium being nothing more than a contractual relationship between different entities without legal personality so that it cannot qualify as a \"*juridical person*\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention.517\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 268; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 558-563; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 121-122.\n\n461.\n\nFollowing disclosure of the identity of the settlor, trustee, and beneficiary of The Boston Enterprises Trust, [REDACTED] , Respondent maintained its objection to The Boston Enterprises Trust's standing in the present dispute. In the Rejoinder, Respondent contested the reasons which Claimants cited for [REDACTED] transferring his shares in Newport and Lux\u00e9 to The Boston Enterprises Trust a few weeks before filing the Request for Arbitration, *i.e.*, fear of retaliation.518\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 555; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 124.\n\n462.\n\nFurther, Respondent relies on Article 10.16 of the TPA, which requires that in order to submit an investment claim to arbitration, a claimant must own or control the investment at the time of the purported breach, a requirement lacking for The Boston Enterprises Trust.519\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 556-557.\n\nd) Lack of Standing of Mr. Brian Hass\n-------------------------------------\n\n463.\n\nRespondent submits that Mr. Brian Hass has no standing in this dispute as he is not listed in the Share Ledger of Lux\u00e9, which is Claimants' only evidence for Brian Hass' investment in Lux\u00e9.520 In the Counter-Memorial, Respondent points to the fact that only Haystacks Holding LLC is listed in the Share Ledger of Lux\u00e9 and that no evidence exists concerning its sole owner, the Hass Family Investment Trust, specifically regarding its establishment and structure.521\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 275.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 276.\n\n464.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, Respondent argues that the documents submitted by Claimants show that the Hass Family Investment Trust had been constituted as a discretionary trust, meaning that the rights of Mr. Hass as a discretionary beneficiary are subject to the decisions of a third party, the trustee, and Mr. Hass himself does not have any direct right or interest over the trust assets, but a mere expectation.522 Relying on *Agarwal v. Uruguay*, Respondent submits that this disqualifies Mr. Hass from having made a protected investment.523\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 546-547.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 549-551; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 118-119; Exhibit RL\u2010202, *Prenay Agarwal, Vinita Agarwal and Ritika Mehta v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, PCA Case No. 2018\u2010 04, Award, 6 August 2020.\n\n**3. Respondent's Compliance with the TPA**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n465.\n\nAssuming the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the dispute, Respondent claims full compliance with its obligations under the TPA *vis-\u00e0-vis* Claimants.524\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 278; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 564.\n\na) No Expropriation of Claimants' Investment\n--------------------------------------------\n\n466.\n\nRespondent submits that it did not expropriate Claimants' investment either directly or indirectly pursuant to Article 10.7 of the TPA, since the measures in question were a legitimate exercise of its regulatory powers, and, in any case, the acts of Respondent are[525 not expropriatory in nature.525\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 300; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 567.\n\naa) Legal Standard\n------------------\n\n467.\n\nRespondent rejects both claims of direct and indirect expropriation, with only the latter being a disputed legal standard.526\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 284.\n\n468.\n\n*First*, according to Respondent, it is a well-established principle in international law explicitly enshrined in Annex 10-B para. 3(b) of the TPA that non-discriminatory actions being designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives do not constitute expropriation.527 Respondent cites decisions in *Saluka*, *Suez v. Argentina*, and *LG&E* to substantiate a State's right to adopt measures having an expropriatory effect in order to regulate in the public interest.528\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 287-288.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 289-291; Exhibit CL-042, *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, Partial Award; Exhibit RL-044, *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and InterAgua Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v.

Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006.\n\n469.\n\n*Second*, Respondent states that the measures in dispute cannot constitute an expropriation, as they did not interfere with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment, which is a condition for an expropriation pursuant to Annex 10-B para. 1 of the TPA.529 Citing Prof. Douglas, Respondent notes that a business activity or the activity of making profit cannot be characterized as property interests and thus be the object of an expropriation.530\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 292; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 127.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 293.\n\n470.\n\n*Third*, Respondent states that three non-exhaustive factors should be considered when assessing whether a government action constitutes an indirect expropriation: (i) economic impact of the government action, referring to \u2013 at least \u2013 a strong decrease of the economic value of an investment, (ii) interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations, requiring an objective inquiry as to the regulatory climate existing at the time the property was acquired, (iii) and the character of the government action.531\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 293-294; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 572.\n\n471.\n\n*Finally*, citing decisions in *Busta v. Czech Republic*, *A.M.F. v. Czech Republic*, and *Plama v. Bulgaria*, Respondent states that it is well-established that only total and permanent deprivation of property rights constitutes an expropriation and triggers a compensation requirement.532 Therefore, Respondent concludes, temporary measures in compliance with legitimate police powers are not, in their nature, expropriatory.533\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 295-297; Exhibit RL-092, *Ivan Peter Busta and James Peter Busta v. Czech Republic*, SCC Case No. V 2015/014, Award, 10 March 2017; Exhibit RL-119, *A.M.F. Aircraftleasing Meier & Fischer GmbH & Co. KG v.

Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 297.\n\nbb) Asset Forfeiture Proceedings Are Not Expropriatory in Nature\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n472.\n\nRespondent recalls that Asset Forfeiture Proceedings are related to the concept of private property, enshrined in the 1991 Colombian Constitution, and aim at the pursuit of assets acquired through illicit enrichment.534 Consequently, they could not be expropriatory by nature.535 Respondent also submits that \"*asset forfeiture is widely recognized and adopted in 'several leading States'*\", and that Colombian Asset Forfeiture Law was drafted in adherence to international standards.536\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 301.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 301; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 569.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 569.\n\n473.\n\n*First*, citing the decision in *Vestey v. Venezuela*, Respondent claims that Claimants did not have any property right or right *in rem* in the Meritage Property.537 Respondent admits that Newport had entered into a sale-purchase-agreement regarding the Meritage Property, but objects to Newport having any right *in rem*.538 According to Respondent, even to the extent that Claimants may have had any rights in connection with the Meritage Project, none of these have been affected by the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.539\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 349-350; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 574; Exhibit CL-106, *Vestey Group Limited v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 351.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 576.\n\n474.\n\n*Second*, none of the measures, and in particular the precautionary measures and the ongoing Asset Forfeiture Proceedings, resulted in the total and permanent deprivation of Claimants' property rights.540 Respondent submits that the Meritage Lot has not been sold, is not being treated by Claimants as \"dead\", and the Project may continue if the seizure is lifted.541\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 577.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 578-581.\n\n475.\n\n*Third*, Claimants have not met any of the non-exhaustive requirements listed in Annex 10-B of the TPA to determine whether indirect expropriation exists.542\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 352.\n\n476.\n\nWith respect to the first factor, Respondent claims that Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings destroyed the economic value of their alleged investment and that this was caused by the adopted measures.543\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 353; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 583-585; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 129.\n\n477.\n\nConcerning the second factor, Respondent states that Claimants could not have had reasonable investment-backed expectations that the Colombian authorities would not initiate Asset Forfeiture Proceedings against the Meritage Property, as they are not subject to any limitations.544 Rather, Respondent explains that the Attorney General's Office is obliged to pursue such proceedings as soon as it finds that an asset has an illicit origin.545 Respondent submits that none of the certificates brought by Claimants contain specific commitments by the Colombian government that it would refrain from adopting asset forfeiture measures.546 Furthermore, Respondent submits that Claimants' reliance on due diligence conducted before acquiring the lot is misplaced due to this due diligence's shortcomings.547 Respondent states that Claimants, particularly Mr. Seda, must have been aware of Mr. L\u00f3pez' claims and his links to the Meritage Property since 2014.548\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 355; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 131.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 355; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 586.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 356.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 586.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 357.\n\n478.\n\nRegarding the third factor, Respondent emphasizes that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings were a governmental action adopted in application of general legislation that was known, or should have been known, to Claimants.549 Moreover, Respondent submits that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings are still pending before the Colombian courts and are not final yet.550\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 358; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 588; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 134.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 360; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 589.\n\n479.\n\nInstead, Respondent contends that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings against the Meritage Project were a legitimate exercise of Colombia's regulatory powers as they were designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, *i.e.*, to fight organized crime and protect good faith third parties without fault. The proceedings were non-discriminatory and in compliance with due process of law.551\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 302; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 568.\n\n(i) Protection of Legitimate Public Welfare Objectives\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n480.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Asset Forfeiture Law was enacted to protect a legitimate public welfare objective, namely, \"*to 'fight organized crime through the rejection of wealth originating in illicit activities, such as drug trafficking' with the purpose of ultimately '*obtain*[ing]* social and economic stability in the country.'\"552\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 304; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 597; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 141.\n\n481.\n\nAlthough the maintenance of social and economic stability in the host State is not part of the non-exhaustive list of Annex 10-B of the TPA, Respondent deems it to be in line with this provision. Citing the decision in *Vestey*, Respondent contends that tribunals should accept the policies determined by the State to be useful or necessary for the public good, except in situations of blatant misuse of powers.553 The maintenance of public security and social and economic stability is legitimate welfare objectives since the State Parties to the TPA included safety or security therein.554\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 305.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 307.\n\n482.\n\nRecalling the relevant procedural steps, Respondent submits that Asset Forfeiture Proceedings were initiated and conducted \"*with strict adherence to the Asset Forfeiture Law and in accordance with its legitimate public welfare objectives.*\"555 They were also proportionate to the pursued public welfare objective, which was confirmed by the Asset Forfeiture Court.556\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 598-602, 604-619.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 603.\n\n(ii) Absence of Discrimination against Claimants\n------------------------------------------------\n\n483.\n\nRespondent states that one cannot assume discrimination where there is different treatment towards different parties.557 According to *Saluka*, discriminatory treatment requires (i) similar cases (ii) treated differently and (iii) without reasonable justification.558\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 308.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 309; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 631; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 231; Exhibit CL-042, *Saluka v.

Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/17, Award, 26 February 2014.\n\n485.\n\nThe Meritage Lot is not in like circumstances with the other lots allegedly belonging (or having belonged) to Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas, including what Claimants refer to as \"Sister Property\" \u2013 as several \"red flags\" were unique to the Meritage Lot.560 The Attorney General's Office initiated Asset Forfeiture Proceedings only against the Meritage Property, as the formal complaint filed by Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas exclusively concerned the latter.561 Moreover, the irregularities found in the chain of domain of the Meritage Lot gave the Colombian authorities strong indications that the lot was closely related to the *Oficina de Envigado*.562 Finally, given that money was being collected through the pre-sales of units, Respondent deemed it necessary to protect prospective buyers and the general public.563\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 634; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 234-242.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 314.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 634.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 634.\n\n486.\n\nRegarding the second element of different treatment, Respondent submits that it treated Meritage Property as it treated other assets in \"*like circumstances*\", *i.e.*, those tainted by wrongful conduct.564\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 635-637; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 247-254.\n\n487.\n\nRegarding the third element, according to Respondent, an investor must demonstrate that it had been subject to unequal treatment in circumstances where there appears to be no reasonable basis for such differentiation.565 Respondent submits that the measures taken against Claimants had a reasonable basis as they were adopted out of urgency to protect third parties.566\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 317.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 318; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 638.\n\n(iii) Compliance with Due Process of Law\n----------------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nCiting the decision in *ADC*, Respondent submits that due process of law \"*demands an actual and substantive legal procedure for a foreign investor to raise its claims against the depriving actions already taken or about to be taken against it*.\"567 Respondent purports that it did not breach this standard regarding the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.568\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 321.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 322-323; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 147-148.\n\n489.\n\nRespondent submits that the due process was followed in these main aspects:569\n\n\u2212 Commencement of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings was based on the existence of \"*serious and reasonable*\" evidence to infer the probable existence of one of the grounds regarding the illegal origin of the Meritage Lot.570\n\n\u2212 The imposition of the precautionary measures was in accordance with the law and the applicable standard of proof \u2013 the measures were based on the illegal origin of the asset and the evidence of money laundering operations including the *Oficina de Envigado*, and *Fiscal\u00eda* was not under an obligation to confirm the existence of good faith third parties at that stage. Furthermore, the imposition was twice reviewed and confirmed by the competent Colombian courts as regards formal and material legality.571\n\n\u2212 To the extent that there are \"*serious grounds for considering their imposition indispensable and necessary*\", the Attorney General's Office may adopt precautionary measures before the issuance of a provisional determination of the claim, which in the present case was done due to the matter's urgency to prevent transfer of the assets.572\n\n\u2212 The Attorney General's Office treated Newport as an *afectado* and the Superior Tribunal of Bogot\u00e1 included Newport as a participant in the Trial Phase of the Proceedings, meaning that Newport's status of good faith third party would be assessed by the competent court.573\n\n\u2212 The final court decision requires fulfillment of one of the grounds established by Article 16 of the Asset Forfeiture Law and will entail a finding on the good faith parties.574 Therefore, \"*firm evidence of the merits of the forfeiture action is only required for the rendering of the final decision on the merits.*\"575\n\n\u2212 The duration of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings is not unreasonable, considering the average duration of such proceedings, the complexity of the case, and the COVID-19 pandemic.576\n\n\u2212 Claimants' allegations as to the existence of an \"*extortion scheme*\" to explain the initiation of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings, Claimants' arguments relating to Respondent's alleged failure to disgorge profits, and [REDACTED] are baseless.577\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 144-146.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 157-166.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 324; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 167-181.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 151.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 201-212.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 153.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 154.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 213-219.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 220-231.\n\n490.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Newport's position and the relevant evidence were analyzed by the Second Criminal Court; the same is true for Newport's appeal of the *Avocamiento* order.578 As explained by Respondent's expert, Dr. Reyes, Newport's due process rights cannot be deemed to have been breached.579\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 326.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 622-626.\n\n491.\n\nTherefore, Respondent states that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings were a reasonable measure in compliance with Colombian law and due process of law so that the Tribunal to this arbitration should not be treated as a court of appeal.580 According to Respondent, Claimants \"*had more than* 'a reasonable chance' *to be heard by independent judges, in accordance with the procedural opportunities offered in the Asset Forfeiture Law and the Colombian Constitution and have used such chances extensively.*\"581\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 327-328.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 630.\n\n492.\n\nIn addition to Newport's direct exercise of its procedural rights, Corficolombiana, in its capacity of fiduciary of the Meritage Lot, also initiated the legality control proceedings under Article 111 of the Asset Forfeiture Law with respect to the precautionary measures, which was confirmed.582\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 628-629.\n\n(iv) No Misuse of Power\n-----------------------\n\n493.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants' claim that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings were a gross misuse of the powers of the State.583 Instead, these proceedings were a *bona fide* application of the law and the \"red flags\" identified by Claimants carry no relevance.584\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 639.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 256-275.\n\n494.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants have brought no evidence to substantiate their accusations of a corruption theory, even though Claimants bear the burden of proof under international law.585 In particular, Respondent cites the decisions in *Glencore* and *ECE v. Czech Republic* to show that \"red flags\" based on a chronological sequence are unreliable, that the fact of not reporting extortion attempts to official authorities can lead to the rejection of a corruption claim, and that \"*everyone knows' arguments*\" cannot suffice as proof of corruption.586 Respondent further submits that, \"*in light of the seriousness of the Claimants' corruption allegations, and considering what is at stake in this arbitration*\", the relevant standard of proof is \"clear and convincing\" evidence of corruption.587\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 329-333; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 641-642.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 336-339; Exhibit CL-125, *Glencore International A.G. and C.I.

Malag\u00f3n and Ardila was based on objective evidence from their preliminary analysis, which cannot be rebutted by the mere indicia brought by Claimants.588\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 341; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 621.\n\n496.\n\nWith regard to the purported coincidences in timing, Respondent submits that there is no link whatsoever between the launch of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings and the extorsions of which Mr. Seda claims to be a victim.589 Claimants have failed to prove that there was any connection between Ms. Ardila, Ms. Malag\u00f3n, and Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas or provide evidence of corruption.590 In support of this, Respondent produced the entire case files of relevant criminal and administrative investigations.591\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 644-645.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 646-650.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 651-653.\n\nb) Respondent's Compliance with the Fair and Equal Treatment Standard\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nRespondent states that it complied with the FET standard pursuant to Article 10.5 of the TPA.\n\naa) Legal Standard\n------------------\n\n498.\n\n*First*, citing *Micula v. Romania*, Respondent states that a fact-specific assessment is required to assess the compliance with the FET standard by the host State.592\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 365; Exhibit CL-093, *Ioan Micula, et al. v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, 11 December 2013.\n\n499.\n\nInvestment tribunals have also assessed an investor's diligence both at the time of entering into the investment, as well as in the course of managing the investment.593 In particular, an investor's due diligence before an investment must contain an assessment of the applicable law, especially when investing in a \"*risky business environment.*\"594\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 367.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 367.\n\n500.\n\n*Second*, Respondent claims that the protection in Article 10.5 of the TPA is limited to \"*the customary international minimum standard of treatment of aliens.*\"595 Claimants bear the burden of proof concerning existence and applicability of a relevant obligation under customary international law; and arbitral decisions interpreting legal standards in other treaties do not constitute evidence of the content of the customary international law standard under the TPA.596 Moreover, Respondent alleges that the minimum standard of treatment under Article 10.5 of the TPA extends only to cover investments and not to cover investors.597\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 368; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 723-732.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 368.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 370.\n\n501.\n\n*Third*, the threshold for finding a breach of the FET standard is high, especially where the impugned conduct concerns actions of the state to protect legitimate public welfare objectives.598 Respondent concludes that the conduct of a host state must be \"*gross, manifest, complete or such as to offend judicial propriety.*\"599\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 371-372; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 744.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 374.\n\n502.\n\n*Fourth*, Respondent points out that the assessment of whether certain conduct constitutes a breach of the FET standard must be made in the light of the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders, especially when it is in connection with the protection of the state's legitimate public welfare objectives.600 A violation of the standard is found only if the state's conduct is manifestly unfair or unreasonable.601\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 376.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 377.\n\n503.\n\n*Fifth*, citing the decisions in *MTD v. Chile* and *Unglaube v. Costa Rica*, Respondent emphasizes that tribunals have repeatedly held that investment treaties are not insurance policies against business risk or poor business decisions.602\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 378-380; Exhibit CL-035, *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Award, 25 May 2004; Exhibit RL-054, *Marion Unglaube and Reinhard Unglaube v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/08/1 and ARB/09/20, Award, 16 May 2012.\n\n504.\n\n*Sixth*, Respondent notes that a causal link between the state's conduct and the harm allegedly suffered by the investor must be established.603\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 382.\n\n505.\n\n*Finally*, Respondent alleges that the conduct must be unreasonable, discriminatory, and arbitrary, not transparent, lacking in due process and in frustration of the investor's legitimate expectations in order to constitute a violation of the FET standard.604\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 383.\n\n(i) Unreasonable, Discriminatory and Arbitrary Treatment\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n506.\n\n*First*, Respondent refers to the definition of arbitrariness under international law developed in the *ELSI* case, where the ICJ defined the term as \"*not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law, or a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety*.605\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 385-386; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 749.\n\n507.\n\n*Second*, Respondent purports that the threshold to find that a conduct is unreasonable is similarly high.606 Therefore, a State's conduct is held to be unreasonable if the conduct is not linked to a rational government policy, or unreasonable in view of the pursuit of a rational government policy; it is reasonable only when there is an appropriate correlation between the State's public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it.607\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 388; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 749.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 389.\n\n508.\n\n*Third*, Respondent states that the threshold for finding a breach of the prohibition against discrimination is also high, as tribunals have already held that discrimination requires a \"*capricious, irrational or absurd differentiation.*\"608 Specifically, Respondent describes the assessment whether a certain measure is discriminatory as a three-pronged analysis consisting of whether (i) the investment was in like circumstances with the identified comparator, (ii) the investment/investor was treated differently to the identified comparator and (iii) there is a reasonable justification for the measure.609\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 390.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 391.\n\n509.\n\n*Fourth*, according to Respondent, tribunals have often held that a State is not liable in the absence of manifest impropriety.610 On the other hand, Respondent explains that measures adopted in pursuit of rational policy objectives, have been deemed not to be unreasonable or discriminatory as *e.g.* in *Electrabel v. Hungary*.611\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 392.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 395; Exhibit RL-081, *Electrabel S.A. v. The Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Award, 25 November 2015.\n\n(ii) Transparency and Due Process\n---------------------------------\n\n510.\n\n*First*, according to Respondent, the concept of transparency is not included within the minimum standard of treatment, as it has already been confirmed by the U.S.612 Nonetheless, Respondent states that there is a high threshold to establish a violation of the transparency obligation in a sense that it requires that all legal requirements concerning investments should be capable of being readily known to all affected investors.613\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 398; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 764.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 400; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 765.\n\n511.\n\n*Second*, citing *Aven v. Costa Rica*, Respondent claims that a breach of due process of law under the TPA only amounts to a breach of the FET standard when it results in a denial of justice.614 For the latter, Respondent claims, a very high threshold is required, so that investment tribunals have held that the denial of justice involves a \"*systemic failure of the State's justice system.*\"615 Respondent relies on the language of the TPA to argue that only denial of justice is included in the FET standard.616 Regarding the violation of due process, Respondent notes that only a severe violation thereof \u2013 and not just any procedural irregularity \u2013 can constitute a breach of the FET standard.617\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 401; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 771; Exhibit RL-105, *David Aven et al. v. The Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/15/3, Award, 18 September 2018.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 402; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 772.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 773.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 403; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 774.\n\n512.\n\n*Third*, Respondent states that there cannot be a violation of the FET standard as long as an investor is given the opportunity to challenge the impugned measures before the local courts of the host State.618 Moreover, the standards of transparency and due process do not require the host State's administrative and judicial authorities to decide in favor of the investment.619\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 409.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 411.\n\n(iii) Legitimate Expectations\n-----------------------------\n\n513.\n\n*First*, Respondent alleges that legitimate expectations are not a part of the FET standard.620 Further, a frustration of the investor's legitimate expectations cannot, alone, amount to a breach of the FET standard.621\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 413; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 785; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 290.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 786.\n\n514.\n\n*Second*, even assuming legitimate expectations were part of the FET standard, they could only give rise to a protection obligation if the expectations were objectively reasonable.622 According to *Invesmart v. Czech Republic* and *Saluka*, an investor's subjective motivations and considerations are not protected.623\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 414; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 788.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 414-415; Exhibit RL-035, *Invesmart, B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award, 26 June 2009; Exhibit CL-042, *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, Partial Award.\n\n515.\n\n*Third*, Respondent claims that legitimate expectations can only be protected and, in a second step, breached if a state has made a specific promise or commitment to the investor.624\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 416; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 788.\n\n516.\n\n*Fourth*, Respondent asserts that legitimate expectations must be assessed in light of \"*an objective understanding of the legal framework within which the investor has made its investment.*\"625\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 420.\n\n517.\n\n*Fifth*, Respondent argues that an assessment of the reasonableness and legitimacy of an investor's expectations must take into account the overall conditions in the host State at the time of the investment, such as a state's level of development and the economic, social and political situation.626 Citing several decisions, Respondent emphasizes that an investor carries the responsibility to evaluate the risk of an investment in a specific environment and finally bears the risk of the investment decision.627\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 421.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 422.\n\n518.\n\n*Finally*, according to Respondent, the question of a breach of the FET standard should be assessed by weighing the legitimate and reasonable expectations of an investor against the legitimate regulatory interests of a host State.628\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 425.\n\nbb) Respondent's Compliance with the FET Standard Regarding the Meritage Project\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(i) Initiation of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n519.\n\n*First*, according to Respondent, the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings were initiated and carried out in accordance with Colombian law.629 Consequently, Respondent claims that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings were commenced based on the reasonable grounds for the imposition of precautionary measures.630 These were the result of exhaustive investigations concerning the alleged irregularities affecting the Meritage Property and the precautionary measures were, thus, not based on the kidnapping story.631 Therefore, the measures were the consequence of a reasonable and proportional application of the legal framework known to Claimants.632\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 433; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 751.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 433.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 433; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 752.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 434.\n\n520.\n\n*Second*, the imposition of precautionary measures was subject to a legality control in accordance with Colombian law by the First Criminal Court of Asset Forfeiture on 20 October 2016 and the Bogot\u00e1 Superior Court on 21 February 2017.633\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 435; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 754.\n\n521.\n\n*Third*, Respondent emphasizes that there is no evidence of the purported extortion scheme or other corrupt motives even if investigations against Mses. Malag\u00f3n and Ardila are ongoing.634 According to Respondent, mere suggestions of illegitimate conduct, general allegations of corruption ,and shortcomings of a judicial system do not constitute evidence of a treaty breach.635 Respondent states that even the investigations against Mses. Malag\u00f3n and Ardila are no proof of corruption in the underlying case, as it was the prosecutor Mr. Caro who independently and on the basis of the evidence gathered during the investigations decided to further pursue the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.636\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 436; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 753.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 436.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 438.\n\n522.\n\nRespondent further argues that its measures were fully transparent, and the precautionary measures could not be imposed with a prior notice due to their confidential and urgent nature.637 Furthermore, Respondent claims that it has given Claimants every opportunity to challenge the measures in accordance with Colombian law, and that Mr. Seda even had the opportunity to discuss the irregularities with representatives of the Anti-Corruption Unit of the Attorney General's Office.638\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 439.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 440-441.\n\n(ii) Non-Discriminatory Nature of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n523.\n\nRespondent argues that the minimum standard of treatment in Article 10.5 of the TPA does not incorporate a general prohibition against discrimination, and even assuming it does \u2013 the threshold for finding a breach of the prohibition against discrimination is high and requires, for example, a \"*capricious, irrational or absurd differentiation.*\"639\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 758-759.\n\n524.\n\nRespondent submits that even if the three-pronged analysis was the relevant legal standard, the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings against the Meritage Property were not discriminatory in comparison to Respondent's treatment of the neighboring lot.640 Conducting a fact-specific analysis of the three elements of the test, Respondent concludes that (i) the circumstances of the Meritage Lot and the neighboring lot were significantly different, (ii) Claimants did not suffer any negative impact as a result of having been treated differently and (iii) the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings were fully justified under and conducted in accordance with Colombian law.641\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 442-444.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 444; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 760.\n\n(iii) Transparency\n------------------\n\n525.\n\nRespondent states that it did not intransparently shift the bases for the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings \u2013 but rather based them on the Judicial Police's and Attorney General's Office findings regarding the illicit origin of the Meritage Property.642\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 447; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 767.\n\n526.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent reiterates that it has always granted Claimants, and especially Mr. Seda, the opportunity to challenge the measures and created the \"*climate of cooperation.*\"643\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 448; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 768.\n\n527.\n\nRespondent further claims that the non-recognition of Newport as an affected party in the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings could be and, in fact, was challenged repeatedly so that this can also not show Respondent's lack of transparency.644\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 449.\n\n(iv) Claimants' Due Process Rights\n----------------------------------\n\n528.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants cannot prevail with their allegation of denial of justice as they are far from reaching the very high threshold required.645 Respondent even holds this allegation to be *prima facie* unjustified as the case does not involve a systematic failure of the State's justice system and as the Colombian Supreme Court has not rendered any decision in connection with the case.646\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 452.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 452.\n\n529.\n\nRespondent submits that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings have been conducted in accordance with the Asset Forfeiture Law, Colombian law, and the due process of law.647 In that sense, Newport received multiple \"*fair opportunities to present its case and to marshal appropriate evidence*\", as well duly reasoned decisions that were subject to appeal.648\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 779.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 453-455; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 769.\n\n530.\n\nRespondent submits that its actions met even a higher standard set by Claimants, *i.e.*, \"*to facilitate 'an actual and substantive legal procedure' 'within a reasonable time' that allows an injured foreign investor to 'raise its claims against the depriving actions'*\" and granted Claimants \"*the right to be heard, the right to present evidence, the right to equality of arms, and the right to receive a reasoned decision.*\"649\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 782.\n\n(v) Claimants' Legitimate Expectations\n--------------------------------------\n\n531.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings could not have frustrated Claimants' legitimate expectations as the Colombian authorities never gave the required specific promise or commitment to Claimants.650\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 465; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 790.\n\n532.\n\nSpecifically, the Certification of No Criminal Activity and Corficolombiana's petition letter to the Attorney General's Office cannot have given rise to legitimate expectations.651 In this sense, the letters provided by the Anti-Money Laundering and Asset Forfeiture Unit are only a response pursuant to the right to petition provided in Article 23 of the Colombian Constitution. As such, they could not be understood as specific commitment and were limited to the information existing in the database.652 Furthermore, Respondent claims that Corficolombiana's letter was produced by a third party independent from the Colombian State and that the request was very specific and limited in scope so that no legitimate expectations could arise from it.653 On the basis of this request, Claimants could not expect any specific commitment that the Colombian Government would not initiate any asset forfeiture proceedings.654\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 466; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 790-792.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 466; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 323-330.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 466.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 466.\n\n533.\n\nMoreover, Respondent states that any subjective expectation Claimants may have derived from these documents is not protected under international law.655 Referring to the decision in *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine*, Respondent notes that an investor's expectation should be assessed against the background of potential prospects and pitfalls of the investment.656 Thus, according to Respondent, (i) Claimants should have been aware of Antioquia's turbulent past related to drug dealing activities, (ii) Claimants negotiated with Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas despite being aware of his claims over the Meritage Property, and, (iii) Claimants created a high-risk company structure by the installation of trusts so that, finally, Claimants cannot claim legitimate expectations that no asset forfeiture procedure would take place.657 In particular, Respondent places an emphasis on the \"patently insufficient\" due diligence that Claimants have conducted.658\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 468.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 468; Exhibit RL-013, *Generation Ukraine, Inc. v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9, Award, 16 September 2003.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 468; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 794, 796; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 314-322.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 292-313.\n\n534.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that Claimants could only expect that the Colombian authorities would apply the legislative and regulatory framework in force at the time of the investment.659 Respondent stresses that Article 16 of the Asset Forfeiture Law is part of that framework and that it allows the initiation of Asset Forfeiture Proceedings, if assets are a \"*direct or indirect product of illicit activity.*\"660 Claimants could, according to Respondent, not have expected that they would be exempted from the application of this law.661\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 469; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 795.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 469; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 795.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 469; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 795; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 291.\n\n(vi) Newport as a Good Faith Third Party\n----------------------------------------\n\n535.\n\nRespondent states that the non-recognition of Newport as a good-faith third party does not constitute a breach of the FET standard because it was neither arbitrary, unreasonable, nor in breach of Claimants' legitimate expectations, and Claimants' due process rights were respected.662\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 457.\n\n536.\n\n*First*, Respondent claims that Colombian authorities have acted in accordance with Colombian Asset Forfeiture Law. The Attorney General's Office in its *Requerimiento* addressed Newport`s allegations and provided sound reasons why Newport would not qualify as a good faith third party.663 On top of that, the Second Criminal Court conducted an in-depth analysis of the alleged rights of Newport *vis-\u00e0-vis* the Meritage Property, explaining why under the Asset Forfeiture Law, Newport would not be considered an affected party as it does not hold *in rem* rights over the property.664\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 459.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 460.\n\n537.\n\nRegardless of this, Respondent states that there cannot be any breach of the FET standard because Article 10.5 of the TPA does not apply to Claimants, as it is only applicable to \"*covered investments.*\"665\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 464.\n\n(vii) Impact of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings on Claimants' Other Projects\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n538.\n\n*First*, Respondent argues that Colombian authorities did not launch a \"*systemic assault*\" targeting Mr. Seda or his investments in Colombia. Rather, Respondent states that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings represent the mere and correct application of law and only target assets having an illicit origin \u2013 not their owners.666 Respondent states that it has not adopted any other measure targeting Mr. Seda or any of his other projects.667\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 471; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 802; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 335.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 471; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 802.\n\n539.\n\n*Second*, Respondent claims that even assuming any impact of the adopted measures on any other project, this could not be deemed to be a breach of the FET standard as Claimants have failed to produce sufficient evidence of a causal link between the other projects and the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.668\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 473; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 803-804; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 336.\n\n540.\n\n*Third*, according to Respondent, Respondent did not have to and could not take any steps to minimize or mitigate the possibility of harm. Respondent claims that it only applied its laws and that it rather was Mr. Seda who attracted the attention of the media by discussing details of Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' extortion and threats.669\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 476; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 334.\n\nc) Respondent's Compliance with the National Treatment Standard\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n541.\n\nRespondent submits that it complied with Article 10.3 of the TPA by according Claimants' alleged investments treatment in accordance with the national treatment standard.670\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 479.\n\naa) Legal Standard\n------------------\n\n542.\n\n*First*, according to Respondent, the national treatment standard should be applied pursuant to its purpose to ensure a level playing field between domestic and international investors.671\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 482-483; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 672.\n\n543.\n\n*Second*, Respondent submits that Claimants must show that (i) a foreign investor, (ii) has received treatment less favorable (iii) than other investors in \"*like circumstances*\", and (iv) the different treatment is not justified.672 The assessment of \"*like circumstances*\" is fact-specific, requires the determination of whether the \"*competing entities*\" are in the same business or economic sector, and an \"*examination of the surrounding situation in its entirety.*\"673\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 484; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 673.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 485-486.\n\nbb) Respondent's Compliance with the National Treatment Standard\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n544.\n\n*First*, Respondent states that the Meritage Property and the other lots belonging to Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' half-brother cannot be deemed to be in \"*like circumstances*\", as Claimants did not show that those two lots are \"*competing entities*\" in the same sector thriving for a similar development goal, and as the \"*surrounding situation*\" does not prove that the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings have been initiated due to Claimants' nationality.674 Respondent submits that \"*several irregularities found during the investigations conducted by the Attorney General's Office were unique to the Meritage Lot.*\"675 Moreover, Newport and Corficolombiana were selling units in the Meritage Project to third parties and collecting money through the pre-sales of units, which made Meritage Property different and called for protection of the prospective buyers.676\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 490-491; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 690.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 679-688; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 279-281.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 689.\n\n545.\n\n*Second*, Respondent submits that it treated the Meritage Lot as it treated other lots which may be considered in \"*like circumstances*\", *i.e.*, assets linked to organized crime in the municipality of Envigado.677 In this regard, Respondent submits that the Attorney General's Office confirmed that between 1997 and 2015, at least 16 Asset Forfeiture Proceedings were initiated against lots in the Envigado region, and, as of 2015, at least 20 Asset Forfeiture Proceedings have been initiated against hundreds of lots and other assets that were related to the *Oficina de Envigado*.678\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 694-702.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 695.\n\n546.\n\n*Third*, assuming any different treatment which Respondent denies, Respondent submits that such treatment is justified by the different circumstances.679\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 494; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 703-708; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 282.\n\n547.\n\n*Fourth*, Respondent claims that Claimants did not suffer any significant practical negative impact because of the alleged different treatment.680 The Meritage Property was subject to Asset Forfeiture Proceedings as a result of its illicit origin so that, regardless of the initiation of similar proceedings against other properties, the Meritage Property would still be subject to Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.681\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 709-716.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 495.\n\nd) Respondent's Compliance with the Full Protection and Security Standard\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n548.\n\nRespondent states that it has at all times accorded Claimants' alleged investments treatment in accordance with the FPS standard pursuant to Article 10.5 of the TPA.682\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 497.\n\naa) Legal Standard\n------------------\n\n549.\n\n*First*, Respondent notes that following the plain language of Article 10.5 of the TPA, the application of the FPS standard is limited to covered investments and not applicable to[683 investors.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 501; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 812-813; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 337.\n\n550.\n\n*Second*, Respondent purports that Article 10.5 of the TPA requires the host Sate to protect against physical damage or interference only \u2013 not against any other kind of impairment of an investor's investment.684 As the TPA confines the FPS standard to physical protection, it cannot be extended to legal security.685\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 503; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 814-817.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 505.\n\n551.\n\n*Third*, Respondent claims that the FPS standard is one of due diligence reasonable under the circumstances.686\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 818-819; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 508-510.\n\n552.\n\n*Fourth*, Respondent stresses that the threshold for finding a breach of the FPS standard is extremely high, which was confirmed by Claimants' authorities.687 According to Respondent, the FPS standard may only be breached when the host State fails to accord \"*the level of police protection required under customary international law.*\"688\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 511; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 820.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 816-817.\n\n553.\n\n*Finally*, Respondent submits that Claimants may only be awarded damages in connection with an alleged breach of the FPS standard if they show that they suffered damage as a result of such breach.689\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 821.\n\nbb) Respondent's Guarantee of FPS to Claimants\n----------------------------------------------\n\nIn response to Claimants' allegations, Respondent states that none of them comes close to furnishing the basis for an FPS claim under Article 10.5 of the TPA.690\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 513.\n\n(i) State's Alleged Inaction in the Face of Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas' Extortion\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n554.\n\n*First*, Respondent submits that despite the purported threats by Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas received in 2014, Mr. Seda had only reported them in December 2016, four months after the seizure of the Meritage Property, and allegedly had been meeting with Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas and his legal representatives until then.691 Thus, Respondent concludes that Mr. Seda did not consider that any (immediate) action was required from the Colombian Government to address the alleged threats during this three-year period.692 Furthermore, there is no evidence that the alleged threats continued after Mr. Seda put an end to the negotiations with Mr. L\u00f3pez Vanegas in November 2016.693\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 517.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 522.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 526.\n\n555.\n\n*Second*, Respondent explains that there is no evidence that the authorities \"*have dismissed the complaint just a month later and took no steps to protect Mr. Seda's and the Claimants' investments.*\"694 Respondent does not deem the purported declarations of Mr. Seda as well as two documents issued by the Attorney General's Office in January and April 2017 marking a report by Mr. Seda \"*inactive*\" to suffice.695\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 523.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 524.\n\n556.\n\n*Third*, the Attorney General's Office did act upon Mr. Seda's report and launched investigations into the purported extortion scheme involving Mses. Ardila and Malag\u00f3n.696\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 525.\n\n(ii) State's Alleged Inaction in the Face of Unlawful Conduct by State Officials\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n557.\n\n*First*, Respondent notes that there is no factual evidence of \"*collusion*\" or a \"*corrupt extortion racket*\" by state officials, as none of Mr. Seda's allegations concerning the alleged extortion scheme were even reported to the Colombian authorities in his official complaint.697 Further, the mere allegation of \"*coincidences in timing*\" as well as the production of press articles could not suffice as evidence.698\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 531; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 826.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 531.\n\n558.\n\nRespondent stresses that straight after Mr. Seda's complaint in December 2016, exhaustive investigations were commenced into the purported extortion scheme involving Mses. Ardila and Malag\u00f3n, and that until now, allegedly no evidence of criminal conduct has been found.699 According to Respondent, this and the fact that Mr. Seda and the Attorney General's Office had been in touch regarding the allegations show that Respondent did not fail to act.700\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 532; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 827-830; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 338.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 534.\n\n559.\n\n*Second*, Respondent explains that it is neither under the obligation to lift the precautionary measures nor to identify and protect Newport as a good faith third party.701 The decision to impose precautionary measures was made on the basis of objective evidence, so the Colombian authorities were obligated by law to continue the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.702 Similarly, Respondent does not have to identify and protect Newport as a good faith third party as Colombian courts are currently reviewing this question.703\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 535.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 535.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 536.\n\n560.\n\n*Third*, Respondent reiterates that the FPS standard is only meant to protect the physical integrity of an investor's investment.704\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 537; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 824-826.\n\n(iii) State's Alleged Inaction in the Face of Threats against Mr. Seda and His Family\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n561.\n\n*First*, Respondent recalls that on 26 September 2017, Mr. Seda filed a police complaint concerning a purported shooting attack by two motorcyclists. Despite the police not being able to identify the origin of the damage to the car, it had launched investigations to find the alleged attackers, which could not be identified.705 Nevertheless, Respondent alleges that it had not been inactive.706\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 541.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 543; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 832-834.\n\n562.\n\nAfter Mr. Seda and his daughter had allegedly been attacked again and Mr. Seda had requested that measures be adopted to protect his family and himself, the Attorney General's Office issued an order to adopt the necessary measures to protect Mr. Seda and his family.707\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 542; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 339.\n\n563.\n\nRespondent notes that despite the fact that Mr. Seda's request to armor his car with level three armor was rejected by the Security Superintendence, it offered Mr. Seda to appeal the decision. There is no evidence of such appeal filed by Claimants.708\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 544.\n\n564.\n\n*Second*, Respondent rejects Mr. Seda's statements that due to Respondent's alleged breach of the FPS standard, he was unable to conduct business in Colombia. Respondent submits that this is contradicted by the evidence in the record, including Mr. Seda's own statements to members of the Attorney General's Office.709\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 837-842.\n\n565.\n\n*Third*, citing relevant evidence, Respondent rejects Claimants' accusations that Respondent manufactured evidence for the purposes of this arbitration, including by [REDACTED]\n\n566.\n\n*Finally*, Respondent states that, in any case, Respondent's behavior could not constitute a breach of the FPS standard because the allegations do not involve any attack or threat against the alleged investments, but rather against the purported investors.711\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 545; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 831.\n\n**4. Claimants' Damages Claims Are Unfounded**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n567.\n\nRelying on an expert opinion of Richard Seymour Hern of NERA UK Ltd, Respondent submits that \u2013 even if the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction to hear Claimants' claims and finds that Respondent had violated its obligations under the TPA \u2013 Claimants are not entitled to receive the amount of compensation that they claim.\n\na) Legal Standard\n-----------------\n\n568.\n\nRespondent argues that there is a generally agreed principle that the party alleging to have suffered loss bears the burden to prove both the fact of such loss and its amount, as reflected in Article 36(2) of the ILC Articles and applied by investment arbitration tribunals.712\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 550-555; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 851.\n\n569.\n\nMoreover, Claimants must establish a direct causal link between their alleged loss and a purported violation by Respondent, a \"*well-established rule of customary international law*\" incorporated in Article 31 of the ILC Articles and in Article 10.16.1 of the TPA.713 Respondent cites, *inter alia*, decisions in *Biwater v. Tanzania* and *S.D. Myers v. Canada* for the requirement of the direct causal link between the breach and the loss.714 According to the decision in *El Jaouni v. Lebanon*, claimant bears the burden of proof of establishing factual and legal causation between the breach and the incurred losses.715\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 556; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 854-855; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 351-352.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 559-560; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 856; Exhibit RL-029, *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008; Exhibit RL-010, *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, NAFTA, Second Partial Award, 21 October 2002.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 851; Exhibit RL\u2010205, *Abed El Jaouni and Imperial Holding SAL v. Lebanese Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/3, Award, 14 January 2021.\n\n570.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the analysis is that of a \"*proximate causation*\", and foreseeability is only one of the elements to assess whether a loss is compensable.716\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 855-857.\n\nb) Claimants' Lack of Proof of Their Losses\n-------------------------------------------\n\naa) Other Projects\n------------------\n\n571.\n\nWith regard to the damages claimed by Claimants in connection with the projects other than the Meritage Project, Respondent argues that these are not compensable, as only the losses resulting directly from the wrongful act of the host State are compensable.717 Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to discharge their burden of proof in this respect and demonstrate the \"*proximate causation*\" between the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings against the Meritage Lot and damages to Claimants' other projects.718\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 564.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 564; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 853, 858.\n\n572.\n\n*First*, as acknowledged by Claimants, Respondent did not directly interfere with the projects or accuse Mr. Seda of wrongdoing. Respondent further submits that Claimants have failed to show that the press that allegedly caused harm to Mr. Seda's reputation was in any way attributable to Respondent.719 To the contrary, Respondent submits that it was Mr. Seda who provided the relevant information to the media more than once, as in August 2014, August 2016, April and July 2020.720 [REDACTED]\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 565.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 565.\n\n573.\n\nTherefore, Respondent submits that Claimants have failed to demonstrate a causal link between the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings, which concerned exclusively the Meritage Lot, and the damages claimed with respect to other projects.722 As an example, Respondent demonstrates how, in its view, there is no causal link between Asset Forfeiture Proceedings and Claimants' decision to discontinue the Lux\u00e9 project due to the decision of Banco Colpatria to stop financing the latter.723 Similarly, no evidence exists regarding any hypothetical future projects.724\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 567.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 568-571; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 859-866; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 353-357. Regarding other projects, *see* Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 867-872; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 358-360.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 361-362.\n\n574.\n\nMoreover, Respondent submits that damages to Claimants' other projects \"*could objectively not have been foreseen to ensue from the*\" Asset Forfeiture Proceedings.725\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 873-876.\n\nbb) Violations of Obligations *Vis-\u00e0-Vis* Covered Investments\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n575.\n\nRelying on the U.S. position and citing the language of the TPA, Respondent submits that an arbitral tribunal cannot award damages to a claimant with respect to violations of obligations that only extend to covered investments (and not the investors), such as obligations to accord national treatment, to treat an investment fairly and equitably, and to accord an investment full protection and security.726\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 878-884.\n\ncc) Amount of Losses\n--------------------\n\n576.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants have not discharged their burden of proving the amount of their alleged losses, which are based on speculative and unreliable methodologies and are vastly overstated.727\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 574.\n\n577.\n\n*First*, Respondent argues that Claimants applied the wrong standard of compensation.728 Respondent agrees with Claimants that the Tribunal must determine any compensation due to Claimants based on the Treaty standard set forth in Article 10.7.2(b), which is \"*the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place*.\"729 Respondent draws a distinction between this standard and the \"*full compensation standard*\" proposed by Claimants, and argues that only the FMV standard is applicable as *lex specialis*.730 According to Respondent, \"*is true irrespective of whether the alleged expropriation was 'lawful' or 'unlawful.'*\"731\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 576.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 577.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 578-579.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 580.\n\n578.\n\n*Second*, Respondent submits that the same standard applies to the non-expropriation claims, based on the fact that the TPA does not set forth a standard for compensation of non expropriation claims.732 Respondent concludes that the maximum compensation for any non expropriatory claim should be the same as that for an expropriation claim, *i.e.*, FMV compensation.733\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 583.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 583.\n\ndd) Valuation Methodology\n-------------------------\n\n579.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants' valuation is based upon a flawed methodology, which should be disregarded by the Tribunal.734\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 585.\n\n580.\n\n*First*, Respondent submits that the DCF method, while generally accepted, cannot be used to assess the value of Claimants' projects, since it is inappropriate for early-stage start-up projects.735 Respondent cites *Metalclad v. Mexico* to demonstrate that investment tribunals have rejected DCF as a basis for calculating damages where a company does not have an established record of profitability.736 Exceptionally, the DCF method may be applied to investments that are not going concerns, if certain factors are present that allow for a reliable estimation of the investment's future profits (*e.g.* track record of successful commercial operations, certainty around future revenues or cash-flows, no uncertainty about specific timing or availability of financing), which are not present with Claimants' projects.737\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 596-599; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 891-892; 896; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 366.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 597; Exhibit CL-021, *Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award, 30 August 2000.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 893-894; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 366-380.\n\n581.\n\nMoreover, Respondent argues that and there is no reliable and objective data on Claimants' projects, meaning that there are no reliable estimates of key DCF inputs (*e.g.*, failure rate, cash flows, time of completion of the different projects).738\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 600-605.\n\n582.\n\n*Second*, Respondent argues that Claimants' valuation is \"*grossly exaggerated because BRG has overstated the cash flow forecasts, assumed unrealistic low discount rates and ignored the risk of failure for each of the Claimants' projects*\" in relation to both hotel and real-estate related activities.739 Moreover, Respondent argues that BRG's DCF model was based on unverified assumptions provided by Claimants.740 Respondent submits that aligning the assumptions of Claimants' experts with the available evidence would reduce damages related to (i) Claimants' hotel operations to USD -12 to -2 million, and (ii) Claimants' real-estate operations to USD -3 to 3 million.741\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 606-615; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 899-900, 907-908, 911; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 393-421.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 901-906.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 909, 912.\n\n583.\n\nRespondent further submits that Claimants' inclusion of lost fees for hotel and real estate services that Royal Realty would have provided to the projects are similarly exaggerated by the incorrect assumptions of the BRG's DCF model.742\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 914-916; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 422-425.\n\n584.\n\n*Third*, Respondent argues against the losses associated with hypothetical real estate projects which Mr. Seda would have allegedly developed in the future as in theory these are not recoverable as a matter of law and fact.743\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 917-921; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 426-429.\n\n585.\n\n*Fourth*, Respondent contends that BRG's market cross-checks of the DCF valuation are wholly unsuitable, since (i) the comparators used are not comparable to Claimants' hotels, and (ii) for Claimants' real-estate business, the sale prices and costs do not reflect the key elements of a DCF valuation.744\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 616-620; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 923-929.\n\n586.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the most appropriate market cross-check is one based on the same assets being appraised by the DCF method, which, in the present case, would be the acquisition by investors of the shares in Claimants' projects.745 A market cross-check performed by Respondent's experts confirms, according to Respondent, that BRG's DCF valuation is exaggerated and must be rejected.746\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 621-626; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 431-448.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 626.\n\n587.\n\n*Finally*, according to Respondent, the most appropriate method of valuating Claimant's projects based on objective data is cost-based approach relied on by investment tribunals.747 The valuation performed by Respondent's experts demonstrates that the total value of Claimants' projects under the cost approach as of 25 January 2017 was USD 2,680,892.748 In the Rejoinder, Respondent submitted that applying the cost-based approach results in maximum damages of USD 7,609,776.749 Respondent submits that a DCF valuation on the basis of the reliable data produces results which are consistent with those resulting from a cost approach.750\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 627-629; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 931-942; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 381-385.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 630.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 937.\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 386-392.\n\nc) Award on Moral Damages Is Not Justified\n------------------------------------------\n\n588.\n\n*First*, Respondent submits that for the reasons described in connection with other damages, Claimants have failed to establish any connection between any harm done to Mr. Seda's reputation and Respondent's actions. The claim for moral damages must therefore also be dismissed for the lack of evidence.751\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 632; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 959-962.\n\n589.\n\n*Second*, according to Respondent, \"*the request for moral damages is, in any event, nothing but an impermissible attempt at double-dipping*\" since the damages in connection with Mr. Seda's alleged loss of reputation are claimed by Claimants separately.752\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 635; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 965.\n\n590.\n\n*Third*, Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to show exceptional circumstances where the State's conduct and the harm are grave and substantial, which would warrant an award on moral damages, as in other investment cases.753 In the present case, there are no allegations of physical duress by State officials, and Mr. Seda has only filed an official complaint regarding an alleged instance of extortion racket two years after it had happened \u2013 and in the meantime continued working and developing projects in Colombia.754 In Respondent's view, that discredits any claim for moral damages.755\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 636-639; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 963-964; Respondent's Post- Hearing Brief, \u00b6 450.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 640.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 640.\n\n591.\n\nIn any case, Respondent submits that the amount of claimed moral damages is exaggerated.756\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 641; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 966-969; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 451.\n\nd) Claim for Interest Is Not Justified\n--------------------------------------\n\n592.\n\n*First*, Respondent submits that Claimants are not entitled to pre-award interest and that interest, if any, should not accrue before the lapse of a grace period of 60 days from Respondent's receipt of this Award or declaration of the Tribunal of any breach of Respondent's obligations.757\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 644-648; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 947.\n\n593.\n\n*Second*, in any case, the interest rate should not be the rate based on Claimants' cost of debt but the rolling yield on a 1-year US treasury bill.758 According to Respondent, the US risk-free rate is the \"*commercially reasonable rate*\" in this case.759\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 649.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 649; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 948-950; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 453-454.\n\ne) The Award as Object of Taxation\n----------------------------------\n\n594.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants' request that any amounts awarded to Claimants not be subjected to taxes in Colombia is speculative and premature.760 To the extent that this Award is subject to taxes in the same amount as the corporate taxes, and that these corporate taxes would have been accounted for in the damages calculation, Respondent agrees that Claimants' request could be acceptable.761 However, Respondent's experts submit that BRG has not accounted for the applicable corporate tax in several instances.762\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 651-652.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 653; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 951-954.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 654.\n\nf) Costs Claims\n---------------\n\n595.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants are not entitled to any costs or expenses and, instead, should be ordered to bear the entirety of Respondent's costs and the costs of the arbitration.763\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 656; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 970-973.\n\n**5. Relief Sought by Respondent**\n----------------------------------\n\n596.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief,764 Respondent requests the Tribunal to:\n\n\"*a) Declare that, pursuant to Article 22.2(b) of the US-Colombia TPA, it manifestly lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute;*\n\n*b) In the alternative, declare that the exception of essential security set forth in Article 22.2(b) of the US-Colombia TPA applies and the Republic of Colombia has not breached its Treaty obligations;*\n\n*c) In the alternative, declare that it lacks jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims for the reasons set forth in Section IV of this Rejoinder;*\n\n*d) In the alternative, dismiss the entirety of the Claimants claims on the merits;*\n\n*e) In the alternative, declare that the Claimants are not entitled to the damages they seek or to any damages;*\n\n*f) Order the Claimants to separately and together pay to the Republic of Colombia all costs incurred in connection with this arbitration, including without limitation the costs of the arbitrators and ICSID, as well as the legal and other expenses incurred by the Respondent including the fees of its legal counsel, experts and consultants on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at a reasonable rate; and*\n\n*g) Grant such relief against the Claimants as the Tribunal deems fit and proper.*\"\n\nRespondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 455.\n\n**III. United States' Position as a Non-Disputing Party**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n597.\n\nTo the extent the Parties have discussed the U.S. position as a Non-Disputing Party, it is reflected above.\n\n**1. Essential Security Exception**\n-----------------------------------\n\na) Effect of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA on the Tribunal's Jurisdiction\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n598.\n\nIn her oral submission during the Third Hearing, the U.S. Representative raised two points regarding the essential security interest exception's effect on the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n599.\n\n*First*, the U.S. maintains that the language of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, which is also contained in exception clauses in other U.S. treaties, is clearly self-judging and therefore the \"*tribunal must find that the Exception applies.*\"765\n\nThird Hearing, p. 12:15.\n\n600.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the ordinary meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA (\"*it considers*\") and Footnote 2 (\"*the Tribunal or panel hearing the matter shall find that the Exception applies*\"). The U.S. submits that the invocation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA is, accordingly, non-justiciable.\n\n601.\n\n*Second*, the U.S. rejects Claimants' submission that \"*U.S. treaty practice on Essential Security Interest Exceptions supports the conclusion that Article 22.2(b) merely allows a State to apply or continue to apply measures that it considers necessary for the protection of its own Essential Security Interest, but that Article 22.2(b) does not address the question of liability or compensation.*\"766 The U.S. submits that Article 22.2(b) of the TPA intends to exclude any and all measures invoked under this provision from the scope of the obligations under the TPA.\n\nThird Hearing, p. 13:8-15.\n\n602.\n\nIn connection with this argument, the U.S. provides that without an injury caused by an internationally wrongful act, a State is under no obligation to make reparation or restitution. Claimants are therefore not entitled to compensation for any loss or damage resulting from measures covered by Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, as these acts cannot be viewed as a breach of an international obligation.\n\n603.\n\nThe U.S. further rejects Claimants' argument that the U.S. and Colombia should have used clearer language, such as the one contained in the Singapore-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, if the State Parties to the TPA wished to prevent a tribunal from making findings of liability. According to the U.S., that Singapore-India Agreement has \"*no bearing whatsoever on the U.S. treaty practice*\" as the U.S. is not a party to it.767\n\nThird Hearing, p. 15:17-18.\n\nb) Scope of the Tribunal's Review\n---------------------------------\n\n604.\n\nThe third submission of the U.S. during the Third Hearing concerned the extent to which the invocation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA is subject to a good faith review.\n\n605.\n\nWhile the U.S. claims it expects all its treaty partners to implement the treaty obligations in good faith, the U.S. argues that this is not the same as authorizing a tribunal to assess whether a treaty party has done so. The U.S. submits that the deliberate wording of \"*it considers*\" in Article 22.2(b) of the TPA in connection with Footnote 2 bars a tribunal from carrying out a good faith review, and that it is for the State parties to the TPA alone to \"*ensure that the provision is invoked in good faith.*\"768\n\nThird Hearing, p. 16:13.\n\n606.\n\nThe U.S. Representative, when asked about what options an investor would have if an essential security clause invocation is arbitrary and a tribunal would not be competent to carry out a good faith review, submitted that it does not \"*have a specific process or avenue in mind*\" \u2013 but that the investor could turn to their home State for a State to State resolution or the home State may raise the bad faith invocation \"sua sponte *directly with its treaty partner.*\"769 The U.S. maintains that the decision whether a State invoked the essential security exception in bad faith lies with the concerned State Parties and \"*the Investor has limited avenues in terms of how it could pursue its interests.*\"770\n\nThird Hearing, p. 19:6-15.\n\nThird Hearing, p. 21:2-3.\n\n607.\n\nAccording to the U.S., this position remains the same regarding the good faith obligation under the VCLT and a tribunal is not competent to review the invocation of an essential security exception in connection with Article 26 of the VCLT.\n\n608.\n\nThe U.S. further provides that a State Party cannot waive the essential security exception, either implicitly or explicitly, as there is no provision in the TPA to that effect.\n\n**F. THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONING**\n-------------------------------\n\n609.\n\nBy way of introduction, the Tribunal wishes to emphasize that it has carefully reviewed all the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties in the course of these proceedings. Although the Tribunal may not address all such arguments and evidence in full detail in its reasoning below, the Tribunal has nevertheless taken them into account in arriving at its decision.\n\n610.\n\nThe Tribunal will first deal with the essential security interest exception under Article 22.2(b) of the TPA raised by Respondent and supported by the United States as a Non-Disputing Party (**I**). Should the Tribunal find that the essential security interest exception is not applicable in the present case, the Tribunal will proceed to address the matters of its jurisdiction and merits of Claimants' claims (**II**).\n\n**I. Essential Security Interest Exception under Article 22.2(b) of the TPA**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n611.\n\nFor the first time with its Rejoinder, Respondent invoked the essential security interest exception enshrined in Article 22.2(b) of the TPA (the \u201cESI Provision\u201d), which reads as follows:\n\n*\u201cArticle 22.2: Essential Security*   \n*Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed:*   \n*(a) to require a Party to furnish or allow access to any information the disclosure of which it determines to be contrary to its essential security interests; or*   \n*(b) to preclude a Party from applying measures that it considers necessary for the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests. [Footnote 2: For**greater certainty, if a Party invokes Article 22.2 in an arbitral proceeding initiated under Chapter Ten (Investment) or Chapter Twenty-One (Dispute Settlement), the tribunal or panel hearing the**matter shall find that the exception applies.].\u201d771*\n\nAccording to Article 23.1 of the TPA, *\u201cThe Annexes, Appendices and footnotes to this Agreement constitute**an integral part of this Agreement.\u201d* (emphasis added), Exhibit CL-230.\n\n612 .\n\nBefore the Tribunal proceeds to the analysis of the ESI Provision, it must address Claimants\u2019 procedural objection: namely, that Article 22.2(b) of the TPA was invoked by Respondent belatedly and must, therefore, be dismissed.\n\n1.\u00a0Timing of the Invocation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA by Respondent\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n613.\n\nAs elaborated above, shortly after Respondent invoked the ESI Provision in its Rejoinder, Claimants objected to what they described as a \u201cNew Defence\u201d and requested that it be struck from the record.772 Claimants argued that the invocation was belated, and Respondent should have identified its essential security concern at the time when the contested measures were implemented, since \u201cit is impossible for a State to consider a course of action to be necessary to protect an essential security interest that it has not yet identified.\u201d773 According to Claimants, such belated invocation prejudiced Claimants and violated their due process rights.774\n\n*See supra* at Section E.I.1.a)\n\nClaimants\u2019 Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46 (emphasis omitted); Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 327-333.\n\n*See supra* at Section E.I.1.a).\n\n614.\n\nRespondent does not dispute that it had identified the essential security concern that it considered sufficient to trigger the ESI Provision only before the submission of its Rejoinder \u2013 but maintains that the TPA imposed no time limitation for invoking Article 22.2(b).775\n\nThird Hearing, p. 239:11-21.\n\n615.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot conclude that Respondent's invocation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA was untimely for three reasons.\n\n616.\n\n*First*, the Tribunal finds that Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, indeed, does not contain any reference to a point in time at which it must be invoked. Most telling in this relation is Footnote 2, in which the present tense of the verb \u201cinvokes\u201d is combined with the only temporal qualifier of *\u201cin an arbitral proceeding.\u201d* The plain reading of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA does not align with Claimants\u2019 suggestion that Respondent ought to have identified its essential security interest as such in connection with implementing the measures against Claimants.\n\n617.\n\nIn that sense, Claimants\u2019 reference to the prospective invocation of the denial of benefits clauses by respondent States is inapposite.776 The denial of benefits clauses are, by\u00a0definition, forward-looking, in that they allow a State to prevent abuses of substantive treaty protections and forum shopping. An essential security exception is, on the other hand, necessarily invoked in a specific case and only after an essential security concern is implicated.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 329, fn. 769; Exhibit CL-118, *Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/1, Award, 16 May 2018; Exhibit CL-094, *Anatolie Stati, Gabriel Stati, Ascom Group S.A. and Terra Raf Trans Trading Ltd v. The Republic of Kazakhstan*,\u00a0 SCC Case No. V116/2010, Award, 19 December 2013; Exhibit CL-215, Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investment BV v. Republic of Kazakhstan, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/14, Award, 22 June 2010; Exhibit CL-188, *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. The Russian Federation,* PCA Case No. 2005-04/AA227,\u00a0Final Award, 18 July 2014; Exhibit CL-038, *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005. The Tribunal notes that all the cases cited by Claimants arose under the Energy Charter Treaty and, consequently, discuss one specific provision in one specific treaty.\n\n618.\n\n*Second*, as the Tribunal noted in its PO9, \u201c*both under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) and**ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3), it enjoys discretion in considering new submissions made**by a Party independent of their timing*.\u201d777 Moreover, the Tribunal is entitled to consider its jurisdiction \u2013 which is what Respondent challenges in its first alternative case \u2013 at any time during the proceedings.778\n\nProcedural Order No. 9, 28 March 2022, \u00b6 10.\n\nRule 41(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n619.\n\n*Third*, the Tribunal considers that with several rounds of submissions and a separate Third Hearing held in April 2023, both Parties\u2019 right to be heard was preserved.\n\n620.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent\u2019s invocation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA was not belated and will proceed with its interpretation and application.\n\n**2. Article 22.2(b) of the TPA**\n---------------------------------\n\n621.\n\nAs acknowledged by Respondent, Respondent\u2019s case on the ESI Provision has evolved since its invocation in the Rejoinder. As it stands following the Third Hearing, Respondent offers three alternative cases regarding Article 22.2(b) of the TPA with three distinct legal outcomes.779\n\nThird Hearing, pp. 240:22-241:19: \u201c[MS. BANIFATEMI]: *Now, one point that Mr. Moloo made is that is somehow a merits defense. This is not a merits defense. This is a defense that goes to the power of the Tribunal. \u2018Non-justiciable\u2019 means that there is no legal review by anyone, a tribunal for that matter, of the circumstances in which the Exception is invoked. So, that is not a merits defense; that is a power defense. You do not have the power. That's the first layer. In the alternative, you don't have the jurisdiction. In the third layer, it's even before merits. In the third alternative, it\u2019s--if you would like to determine the good faith, you have ample evidence to show that this is, indeed, has been raised in good faith, and the timeline and everything else that we said today shows that, and then you go to the merits, and on the merits this doesn't apply.* [\u2026]\u201d (emphases added).\n\n622.\n\nRespondent\u2019s primary case is that the ESI Provision is non-justiciable, i.e., as soon as it is invoked, the Tribunal cannot conduct any further inquiry into its invocation or the effects thereof and must dismiss the case.780 This approach would require the Tribunal to stop short of assessing its jurisdiction to hear the case, let alone the merits of Claimants\u2019 claims and associated damages. The Tribunal notes that this is a line of argumentation that Respondent did not pursue initially.781\n\n*See supra* at Section E.II.1.\n\n*See* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, Section II.A.\n\n623.\n\nIn the alternative, Respondent\u2019s argument rests on the proposition that the ESI Provision deprives the Tribunal of its jurisdiction to hear the claims stemming out of the measures covered by ESI Provision.782\n\n*See supra* at Section E.II.1.b).\n\n624.\n\nRespondent\u2019s third alternative case is that the Tribunal may review the invocation of the ESI Provision by Respondent, but that review must be limited in scope, given that the elements of the exception are self-judging. The Parties have presented different arguments on what the standard of review should be in this case, and the Tribunal will address those in detail below.783\n\n*See supra* at Section E.II.1.c).\n\n625.\n\nIn contrast, Claimants\u2019 primary case has been that Article 22.2(b) of the TPA has no effect on either Tribunal\u2019s power or jurisdiction, or Respondent's liability. According to Claimants, the ESI Provision\u2019s effect is limited to excluding the remedies of restitution or withdrawal of measures (for the trade disputes) from the Tribunal\u2019s toolkit. The basis for this line of argument is that the ESI Provision only allows the States to maintain the measure introduced for the protection of their essential security interests. By extension, Claimants argue, the Tribunal may proceed with the case on the merits and award compensation to Claimants for Respondent\u2019s breaches of the TPA, if any.784\n\n*See supra* at Section E.I.1.b) and c).\n\n626.\n\nThe starting point for the Tribunal\u2019s own analysis is the interpretation of   \nArticle 22.2(b) of the TPA. [Redacted]\n\n627.\n\nOn that note, the Tribunal disagrees with Respondent that \u201cno room for interpretation if [sic] left for the Tribunal.\u201d787 Even if the ESI Provision is non-justiciable, the Tribunal can only determine that through interpreting Article 22.2(b) of the TPA.788\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n\nRespondent itself seems to recognize as much, stating: *\u201cIt is trite that it falls on arbitral tribunals to make sure, under the appropriate test, whether any preliminary objections to their jurisdiction are well-founded before they can determine whether or not they have jurisdiction to adjudicate a dispute. In other words, for this Tribunal to refrain from adjudicating disputes under Article 22.2 (b), it must first satisfy itself that the invocation of the Article as a jurisdictional objection has been made in good faith.\u201d* See Respondent\u2019s Reply to Claimants\u2019 Application of 7 March 2022, p. 18.\n\n628.\n\nThe rules of international treaty interpretation under the VCLT as such are not disputed between the Parties. Instructive in this regard are the rules of international treaty interpretation which render the TPA operable.789 The Tribunal will base its analysis primarily on Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 26; Claimants\u2019 Preliminary Response to Colombia\u2019s New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6 7.\n\n629.\n\nArticle 31(1) of the VCLT entitled \u201cGeneral rule of interpretation\u201d (emphasis added) provides that:\n\n*\u201cA treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the**ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context**and in the light of its object and purpose.\u201d790*\n\nExhibit CL-187, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331, open for signature 23 May 1969; entry into force 27 January 1980) (\u201c**VCLT**\u201d), Art. 31(1).\n\n630.\n\nArticle 32 of the VCLT further provides that:\n\n*\u201cRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation,**including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of**its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the**application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the**interpretation according to article 31: (a) leaves the meaning**ambiguous or obscure; or (b) leads to a result which is manifestly**absurd or unreasonable.\u201d*791 (Emphasis added)\n\nExhibit CL-187, VCLT, Art. 32.\n\n631.\n\nThis Tribunal\u2019s mandate is not to alter or supplement the terms of the TPA \u2013 but merely to interpret their meaning using the general rule of interpretation of Article 31 of the\u00a0VCLT\u00a0and the supplementary means of interpretation of Article 32 of the VCLT to the extent necessary. It is an approach that is generally accepted and uncontroversial.\n\n632.\n\nTherefore, in order to assess all four alternative cases raised by the Parties, the Tribunal will first interpret the ordinary meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA under the VCLT (**3.**), examine the provision\u2019s history and other supplementary means of interpretation to the extent necessary (**4.**), and then apply it to the circumstances of the present case (**5.**).\n\n**3.\u00a0Interpretation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**3.1. Interpretation according to Article 31 of the VCLT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\na) Ordinary meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n633.\n\nThe Tribunal will proceed to analyze the ordinary meaning of the following individual components of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA:\n\n* \u201cNothing in [the TPA] shall be construed [\u2026] to preclude a Party from   \n  applying measures that it considers necessary for\u201d\n* \u201cthe protection of its own essential security interests\u201d, and\n* Footnote 2.\n\n(i) *\u201cNothing in* [the TPA] *shall be construed [\u2026] to preclude a Party from applying measures that it considers necessary\u201d*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n634.\n\nThe linguistic element has instigated much discussion in the present case and in the interpretation of the (dis)similarly worded essential security clauses in other international treaties. In short, the questions are whether and to what extent the exception is self-judging\n\n635.\n\nAs will be discussed in detail below at Section F.I.3.2., the formulation of the essential security clause in Article 22.2(b) of the TPA seems to trace back to the ICJ judgements in *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America) and Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America).* These cases prompted the U.S. Government to include language limiting external review of State measures taken under the umbrella of an essential security clause in the investment protection treaties concluded since then.\n\n636.\n\nIn interpreting essential security clauses, investment tribunals generally have called for clear indications of the self-judging character of the provisions in question \u2013 a proposition which is undisputed between the Parties.792\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 37 and fns. 28-29, quoting Exhibit RL-163, CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, 12 May 2005 (\u201c**CMS v. Argentina**\u201d), \u00b6 370: \"*The Tribunal is convinced that when States intend to create for themselves a right to determine unilaterally the legitimacy of extraordinary measures importing non-compliance with obligations assumed in a treaty, they do so expressly*.\"; Claimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security   \nDefense, \u00b6 30.\n\n637.\n\nFor example, the tribunal in the Deutsche Telekom v. India interpreted Article 12 of the Germany-India BIT, which reads as follows: *\u201cNothing in this Agreement shall prevent either Contracting Party from applying prohibitions or restrictions to the extent necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.\u201d* The tribunal succinctly held that:\n\n*\u201cIndia does not argue that Article 12 is a self-judging clause, and**rightly so. Clear indications in the text of the treaty would be required**in order to infer that a provision is self-judging. Such indications are**absent from Article 12.\u201d793*\n\nExhibit RL-188, *Deutsche Telekom AG v. The Republic of India*, PCA Case No. 2014-10, Interim Award, 13 December 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 225, 231. A similar interpretation was given by investment tribunals to Article XI of the U.S.-Argentina BIT. See e.g., Exhibit CL-062, *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008, \u00b6 188; Exhibit CL-049, Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly *Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Award, 22 May 2007 (\u201c***Enron v. Argentina***\u201d), \u00b6 335.\n\n638.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with this line of thinking. The power of a State to unilaterally determine the scope of a carveout to the otherwise binding obligations under international law, given its scope and potential for abuse, must be reserved in explicit terms. And in the present case, it is: Article 22.2(b) of the TPA explicitly states that \u201cit\u201d, i.e., the Contracting State applying the measures, *\u201cconsiders\u201d* necessary, leaving no doubt that this provision is self-judging.\n\n639.\n\nIn an excerpt partially cited by Respondent, the Deutsche Telekom tribunal went on to discuss the level of deference the *non-self-judging* essential security exception affords to a State\u2019s determination of the necessity of the measures:\n\n*\u201cIn that review, the Tribunal will undoubtedly recognize a margin of**deference to the host state\u2019s determination of necessity, given the state\u2019s\u00a0proximity to the situation, expertise and competence. Thus, the Tribunal would not review de novo the state\u2019s determination nor adopt a standard of necessity requiring the state to prove that the measure was the \u2018only way\u2019 to achieve the stated purpose. On the other hand, the deference owed to the state cannot be unlimited, as otherwise unreasonable invocations of Article 12 would render the substantive protections contained in the Treaty wholly nugatory.\u201d794*\n\nExhibit RL-188, *Deutsche Telekom AG v. The Republic of India*, PCA Case No. 2014-10, Interim Award, 13 December 2017, \u00b6 238. See Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 52.\n\n640.\n\nIn this Tribunal\u2019s view, a margin of deference should be afforded a *fortiori* to a State invoking a *self-judging* essential security exception, such as Article 22.2(b) of the TPA.\n\n(ii) *\u201c[T]he protection of its own essential security interests\u201d*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n641.\n\nThe main body of the ESI Provision contains a reference to the two alternative end goals pursued by a Contracting State implementing the measures: (i) the fulfilment of that State's obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, and (ii) the protection of that State's own essential security interests. Given that the peace and security obligations were not invoked by Respondent in the present case, the Tribunal will focus on the essential security interests.\n\n642.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the TPA itself does not define the Contracting State\u2019s \u201c*own essential security interests*\u201d. The Tribunal will, therefore, start by examining the ordinary meaning of these terms, which suggest that the essential security interest must carry at least two defining qualities: it must be of higher importance than just *any* interest \u2013 vital and going to the core of the State\u2019s main functions, and it must be related to the matters of security, i.e., protection from threats.\n\n643.\n\nThis interpretation is in line with the understanding of the essential security interests by other international law bodies.795 The examples of what can be considered an essential security interest include \u201c*political or economic survival, the maintenance of conditions\u00a0in which its essential services can function, the keeping of its internal peace, the survival of part of its population [\u2026]\u201d796,* protection of the environment797, and economic security and stability798. What is clear is that a State\u2019s essential security interests are no longer understood to be limited to the sphere of military threats and territorial integrity. In any case, it is the State itself which can best identify the scope of its own essential security interests.\n\n*See* Exhibit R-251, OECD, Essential Security Interests under International Investment Law in International Investment Perspectives: Freedom of Investment in a Changing World, 2007 Edition, p 100. The report by Professor Crawford notes that no *a priori* definition of an essential interest can be offered, and it must depend on the specific facts of each case. See J.

In the Commentaries to the 2001 Draft Articles on State Responsibility, the examples cited by the Commission include *\"safeguarding the environment, preserving the very existence of the State and its people in time of public emergency, or ensuring the safety of a civilian population.\"* See Exhibit CL-025, International Law Commission Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentaries, 2001, p. 83, \u00b6 14.\n\n*See e.g. Gab\u010d\u00edkovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary v.

Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008, \u00b6 175: *\u201cAs to 'essential security interests,' it is necessary to recall that international law is not blind to the requirement that States should be able to exercise their sovereignty in the interest of their population free from internal as well as external threats to their security and the maintenance of a peaceful domestic order. It is well known that the concept of international security of**States in the Post World War II international order was intended to cover not only political and military security but also the economic security of States and of their population.\u201d; Exhibit RL-163, CMS v. Argentina*, \u00b6 360; Exhibit CL-045, *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International**Inc. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006, \u00b6 238: \u201c*The Tribunal rejects the notion that Article XI is only applicable in circumstances amounting to military action and war. Certainly, the conditions in Argentina in December 2001 called for immediate, decisive action to restore civil order and stop the economic decline. To conclude that such a severe economic crisis could not constitute an essential security interest is to diminish the havoc that the economy can wreak on the lives of**an entire population and the ability of the Government to lead. When a State\u2019s economic foundation is under siege, the severity of the problem can equal that of any military invasion.\u201d*\n\n644.\n\nAlmost by definition, the essential security interests of a State are an expression of its sovereignty, so the Tribunal is especially conscious of the associated limitations to its mandate and scope of inquiry.799\n\n*See e.g.,* Exhibit CL-196, *CC/Devas (Mauritius) Ltd., Devas Employees Mauritius Private Limited, and Telcom Devas Mauritius Limited v. Republic of India*, PCA Case No. 2013-09, Award on Jurisdiction and Merits, 25 July 2016, \u00b6 245: *\u201cAn arbitral tribunal may not sit in judgment on national security matters as on any other factual dispute arising between an investor and a State. National security issues relate to the existential core of a State. An investor who wishes to challenge a State decision in that respect faces a**heavy burden of proof, such as bad faith, absence of authority or application to measures that do not relate to essential security interests.\u201d* See also Exhibit RL-216, Stephan Schill and Robyn Briese, \u201c*\u2018If the state Considers\u2019: Self-Judging Clauses in International Dispute Settlement,\u201d*13 Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law, 2009, pp. 77-78.\n\n645.\n\nMoreover, in *contrast* with the TPA, some international treaties take a more restrictive approach in defining essential security interest. For example, the list of essential security interests under Article XXI of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the \u201c**GATT**\u201d) is exhaustive and encompasses only *\u201cessential security interests (i) relating to fissionable materials or the materials from which they are derived; (ii) relating to the**traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic in other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military establishment; (iii) taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations.\u201d*800\n\nExhibit RL-222, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, 1994 (\u201c**GATT**\u201d), Art. XXI(b). These have been described in the *Russia \u2013 Measures concerning traffic in transit case as \u201climitative qualifying clauses; in other words, they qualify and limit the exercise of the discretion accorded to Members under the chapeau to these circumstances.\u201d* See Exhibit RL-192, Russia \u2014 Measures Concerning Traffic in Transit, WT/DS512, Report of the Panel, 5 April 2019, \u00b6 7.65.\n\n646.\n\nWhile the absence of limitative qualifying clauses does not necessarily mean that the term can encompass everything, the Tribunal considers that such open-ended approach taken by the State parties to the TPA \u2013 once again \u2013 underscores a broad margin of appreciation a Contracting State enjoys in identifying its essential security interest.\n\n647.\n\nFinally, given the clear self-judging nature of the other element of the ESI Provision, namely the necessity of the measures applied by the Contracting State, the Tribunal must establish whether the determination of what constitutes an essential security interest is also reserved solely to the invoking State, as argued by Respondent801.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 12: *\u201cThe language of Article 22.2.b establishes that the Tribunal must grant a large margin of appreciation for the State in both the determination of its essential security interests and**the choice of measures the State considers necessary for the protection of such interests.\u201d*\n\n648.\n\nCiting a WTO Panel Russia \u2013 *Measures concerning traffic in transit case, Respondent submits that: \u201cit is generally accepted that it is entirely for a State to define what it deems to constitute its \u2018essential security interests.\u2019 The Respondent thus enjoys full discretion to define what constitutes its essential security interests, to the extent that such definition is done in good faith.\u201d*802\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 55 (footnotes omitted).\n\n649.\n\nThe WTO Panel does not go as far and elaborates as follows:\n\n*\u201cThe specific interests that are considered directly relevant to the*   \n*protection of a state from such external or internal threats will depend*   \n*on the particular situation and perceptions of the state in question, and*   \n*can be expected to vary with changing circumstances. For these*   \n*reasons, it is left, in general, to every Member to define what it*   \n*considers to be its essential security interests.*   \n*However, this does not mean that a Member is free to elevate any*   \n*concern to that of an 'essential security interest'. Rather, the discretion*   \n*of a Member to designate particular concerns as 'essential security*   \n*interests' is limited by its obligation to interpret and apply**Article XXI(b)(iii) of the GATT 1994 in good faith. The Panel recalls**that the obligation of good faith is a general principle of law and a**principle of general international law which underlies all treaties, as**codified in Article 31(1) ('[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith**\u2026') and Article 26 ('[e]very treaty \u2026 must be performed [by the parties]**in good faith') of the Vienna Convention.\u201d803*\n\nExhibit RL-192, Russia \u2014 *Measures Concerning Traffic in Transit*, WT/DS512, Report of the Panel, 5 April 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 7.131-132 (emphases added, footnote omitted)\n\n650.\n\nTherefore, the ordinary meaning of the ESI Provision suggests that it is for the State to determine the scope of its \u201c*own essential security interests*\u201d \u2013 but, as the above quoted WTO Panel has held in similar circumstances, such determination may be restrained by the good faith obligations.\n\n(iii) Nexus between the measures and the ESI\n--------------------------------------------\n\n651.\n\nThe other key element of the ESI Provision is *\u201cfor\u201d, i.e*., the nexus between the measures the State considers necessary and the goal it pursues. The ordinary meaning of the wording merely suggests that the measures must be connected in some form to the underlying essential security interest.\n\n652.\n\nThe Parties have both referred to the plausibility test for establishing nexus under   \nArticle 22.2(b) of the TPA.\n\n653.\n\n*In Russia* \u2013 *Measures concerning traffic in transit case*, the WTO Panel opined that the good faith obligation extends to the nexus element of the Article XXI of the GATT (which bears close textual resemblance to Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, as will be discussed below at Section F.I.4c)):\n\n*\u201cThe obligation of good faith, referred to [\u2026] above, applies not only**to the Member\u2019s definition of the essential security interests said to**arise from the particular emergency in international relations, but also,**and most importantly, to their connection with the measures at issue.**Thus, as concerns the application of Article XXI(b)(iii), this obligation*   \n*is crystallized in demanding that the measures at issue meet a minimum**requirement of plausibility in relation to the proffered essential security**interests, i.e. that they are not implausible as measures protective of**these interests.*   \n*The Panel must therefore review whether the measures are so remote**from, or unrelated to, the 2014 emergency that it is implausible that**Russia implemented the measures for the protection of its essential**security interests arising out of the emergency.\u201d804*\n\nExhibit RL-192, *Russia \u2014 Measures Concerning Traffic in Transit*, WT/DS512, Report of the Panel, 5 April 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 7.138-7.139 (emphases added). See also Exhibit RL-201, *Saudi Arabia \u2013 Measures concerning the protection of intellectual property rights*, Report of the Panel, 16 June 2020, \u00b6 7.293. See Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57; Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 336-337.\n\n654.\n\nAdditionally, citing investment tribunals\u2019 application of taxation carve-outs under the Energy Charter Treaty and BITs, Claimants argue that \u201ca bona fide connection\u201d or a \u201crational connection\u201d between the measures and the relevant sovereign interest must be established.805 At the Third Hearing, Respondent also accepted the prima facie standard for establishing the nexus.806\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6 58, fns. 93-95; Claimants\u2019 Rebuttal on Essential Security, \u00b6 4.\n\nThird Hearing, p. 249:8-9.\n\n655.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the plausibility standard an appropriate benchmark against which to evaluate the nexus between the measures adopted by the State and the essential security interest sought to be protected under Article 22.2(b) of the TPA. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it carries an implication of a 'light-touch' good faith review \u2013 not too restrictive as to\u00a0infringe on the explicit self-judging language of the ESI Provision. The Tribunal also considers that the other tests invoked by the Parties (i.e. bona fide connection, rational connection, prima facie standard) would lead to a very similar, if not identical, scope of review.\n\n(iv) Footnote 2\n---------------\n\n656.\n\nThe Parties have attributed much weight to Footnote 2 to Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, which reads as follows:\n\n*\u201cFor greater certainty, if a Party invokes Article 22.2 in an arbitral**proceeding initiated under Chapter Ten (Investment) or Chapter**Twenty-One (Dispute Settlement), the tribunal or panel hearing the**matter shall find that the exception applies.\u201d*807\n\nExhibit CL-230, US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, Art. 22.2.\n\n657.\n\nThe introductory phrase \u201c[f]*or greater certainty*\u201d implies that the footnote does not add additional elements to the ESI Provision, but merely explains the meaning the Contracting States attributed to it.\n\n658.\n\nThe two main \u2018actors\u2019 of the Footnote are (i) a State \u201c*invok*[ing]\u201d the ESI Provision in an arbitral proceeding under Chapters Ten or Twenty-One, and (ii) a tribunal that *\u201cshall find that the exception applies.\u201d*\n\n659.\n\nOn one hand, the formulation of these elements suggests certain actions both on the side of the State invoking the ESI Provision and of the tribunal that makes its finding. This construction implies a certain role by a party *other than the Contracting State applying the measures* in making a finding on the invoked essential security interest.\n\n660.\n\nOn the other hand, the term \u201c*shall find*\u201d suggests that a tribunal only has limited discretion as to its course of action. In other words, the ordinary meaning of Footnote 2 would suggest that, upon the invocation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, the tribunal is empowered to make a finding \u2013 but that finding has a defined outcome.\n\n661.\n\nFootnote 2 leaves an important matter open: what is the standard of review a tribunal should apply in its findings, a matter which the Tribunal will address below at Section F.I.3.3.d).\n\nPreliminary Conclusion\n----------------------\n\n662.\n\nOn the basis of the interpretation of the ordinary meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, it can be concluded that the ESI Provision is a self-judging exception to the TPA, which allows a Contracting State to invoke an interest that it judges to be critical for its security as a justification for the measures \u2013 which may otherwise be in violation of the substantive provisions of the TPA \u2013 that it considers necessary to further that interest, with some connection between the former and the latter. Once the ESI Provision is invoked, the tribunal is directed towards a finding that it applies.\n\n663.\n\nHowever, the interpretation of the ordinary meaning does leave certain questions open, such as the standard of review that a tribunal is to apply in reviewing the invocation of the ESI Provision, so the Tribunal will next turn to the object and purpose, as well as the context of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA.\n\nb) Object and purpose of the TPA\n--------------------------------\n\n664.\n\nArticle 31 of the VCLT invites the Tribunal to take account of the object and purpose of the Treaty to shed light on the ordinary meaning of the ESI Provision.\n\n665.\n\nIn that context, the Tribunal appreciates the emphasis that Respondent placed on the fight against narco-trafficking as one of the objects of the TPA. It is, indeed, true that the second recital in the Preamble to the TPA refers to the promotion of *\u201cbroad-based economic development in order to reduce poverty and generate opportunities for sustainable economic alternatives to drug-crop production.\u201d* Of note is also one further recital \u2013 preservation of the Contracting States\u2019 *\u201cability to safeguard the public welfare.\u201d*\n\n666.\n\nHowever, further down in the Preamble, another declared goal of the Contracting States is stipulated, namely, to ensure *\u201ca predictable legal and commercial framework for business and investment.\u201d* Given the significant heft of the investor protection provisions in the overall structure of the TPA, the Tribunal also considers it as one of the purposes of the Treaty.\n\n667.\n\nIn that sense, the object and purpose of the TPA do not shed further light on the interpretation of the ordinary meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, but rather serve as a reflection of the balanced approach between the sovereign interests of the Contracting States and the protection of investors\u2019 rights that the TPA \u2013 and, consequently, this Tribunal \u2013 seeks to strike.\n\nc) Context of Article 22.2(b) within the TPA\n--------------------------------------------\n\n668.\n\nThe Parties have submitted several arguments on the context of the Treaty in which Article 22.2(b) is placed.\n\n669.\n\n*First*, divergent interpretations of the Chapter Twenty-Two\u2019s heading \u201cExceptions\u201d have been proposed, with Respondent arguing that it reflects the intended exception of measures taken under Article 22.2(b) from the scope of the TPA, and Claimants suggesting that *\u201cArticle 22.2(b) serves as an \u2018[e]xception\u2019 to the TPA\u2019s allowance of restitution or withdrawal of measures as a remedy.\u201d*808\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on [Exgurgado] and on the U.S. Treaty Practice on   \nEssential Security Interests Exceptions, \u00b6 19; Claimants\u2019 Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6 17.\n\n670.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no support for Claimant\u2019s limited interpretation of the word   \n\u201cExceptions\u201d in the context of the TPA. Given that the other exceptions contained in this Chapter constitute exceptions to the matters covered by the Treaty, it would be counter-intuitive to assume that the essential security \u201c[e]*xception*\u201d is aimed at a different \u2013 implicit and narrow \u2013 outcome.\n\n671.\n\n*Second*, of note in the context of the present case is Article 10.2(1) of the TPA which provides for subordination of Chapter 10 \u201cInvestment\u201d to other chapters of the TPA, including Chapter 22 \u201cExceptions.\u201d809 That is, the ESI Provision must take precedence over the substantive and procedural rights of the investors contained in the TPA.\n\n*See* Exhibit CL-001, TPA, Art. 10.2: *\u201c1. In the event of any inconsistency between this Chapter and another Chapter, the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.\u201d*\n\n672.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal considers that the ESI Provision, placed in the context of the TPA, should be understood as an exception to the coverage of the Treaty which is placed hierarchically above the provisions regulating investors\u2019 substantive rights and dispute resolution provisions of Chapter 10 of the TPA.\n\nd) Relevant Rules of International Law\n--------------------------------------\n\n673.\n\nAside from particularities of the TPA drafting history, the Tribunal considers it important to place Article 22.2(b) of the TPA in the larger context of public international law \u2013 whether that context provides guidance or contrast. *First*, Article 31(3) of the VCLT directs the Tribunal to take into account, *\u201ctogether with the context*: [\u2026] *c.* [a]*ny relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\u201d*810 *Second*, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that \u201c[t]*he Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State\u00a0party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable\u201d (emphasis added)811.*\n\nExhibit CL-187, VCLT, Art. 31(3).\n\nICSID Convention, Art. 42(1).\n\n(i) Plea of Necessity\n---------------------\n\n674.\n\nTraditionally, the 'first port of call' for the notion of essential security interests was the plea of necessity under customary international law, often understood to be reflected in Article 25 of the ILC Articles as follows:\n\n*\u201cArticle 25 Necessity*   \n*1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding**the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international**obligation of that State unless the act:*   \n*(a) is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest*   \n*against a grave and imminent peril; and*   \n*(b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States**towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community**as a whole.*   \n*2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for**precluding wrongfulness if:*   \n*(a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of*   \n*invoking necessity; or*   \n*(b) the State has contributed to the situation of necessity.\u201d812*\n\nExhibit CL-025, International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentaries, 2001, Art. 25.\n\n675.\n\nClaimants, in fact, invoke Article 25 of the ILC Articles to illustrate a point about the limited effects of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA.813\n\nClaimants\u2019 Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6 16.\n\n676.\n\nIn the string of investment arbitration cases of the early 2000s against Argentina, investment tribunals were faced with an essential security clause in the Argentina-U.S. BIT drafted as a non-self-judging essential security exception.814 These tribunals incorporated the stringent requirements of the plea of necessity under customary\u00a0international law into the BIT\u2019s essential security exception \u2013 in effect conflating two distinct legal norms despite the *lex specialis* nature of the treaty-based provision.815\n\nArticle XI of the 1991 Argentina - United States of America BIT: *\u201cThis Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests.\u201d*\n\n*See e.g.,* Exhibit CL-049, *Enron v. Argentina*, \u00b6 333 (emphasis added): *\u201cThe Tribunal notes that the Treaty does not define what is to be understood by essential security interest [\u2026]. The specific meaning of these concepts and the conditions for their application must be searched for elsewhere. [\u2026] The situation is more complex in respect of security interests because there is no specific guidance to this effect under the Treaty.*   \n*This is what makes necessary to rely on the requirements of state of necessity under customary international law, as outlined above in connection with their expression in Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, so as to evaluate whether such requirements have been met in this case.\u201d See also Exhibit**RL-163, CMS v. Argentina, \u00b6 373; Exhibit CL-054, Sempra Energy International v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award, 28 September 2007, \u00b6 375.\n\n677.\n\n*CMS v. Argentina, Enron v. Argentina, and Sempra v. Argentina* were subsequently annulled by the ICSID ad hoc committees on the basis of, inter alia, the convergence of the legal standards.816 These ad hoc committees\u2019 decisions are illustrative as to the nature of the essential security exceptions in the BITs \u2013 whether self-judging or not.\n\nExhibit RL-168, *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision of the *Ad hoc* Committee on Argentina's Application for Annulment, 25 September 2007; Exhibit RL-237, *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Application for Annulment of the Award, 29 June 2010; *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, 30 July 2010.\n\n678.\n\nIn CMS v. Argentina, the ad hoc committee consisting of Mr. Nabil Elaraby, Judge James Crawford817, and Judge Gilbert Guillaume as chair, elaborated on the difference between the pleas of necessity under customary international law and a treaty-based essential security exception:\n\n*\u201c[\u2026] Article XI specifies the conditions under which the Treaty may be*   \n*applied, whereas Article 25 [of the ILC\u2019s Articles on State**Responsibility] is drafted in a negative way: it excludes the application**of the state of necessity on the merits, unless certain stringent**conditions are met. Moreover, Article XI is a threshold requirement: if**it applies, the substantive obligations under the Treaty do not apply. By**contrast, Article 25 is an excuse which is only relevant once it has been**decided that there has otherwise been a breach of those substantive**obligations.*\n\n*[\u2026] In other terms the requirements under Article XI are not the same   \nas those under customary international law* *as codified by Article 25*  *[\u2026]*.\u201d818\n\nJudge Crawford was a Special Rapporteur for the draft Articles on State Responsibility.\n\nExhibit RL-168, CMS *Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision of the Ad hoc Committee on Argentina's Application for Annulment, 25 September 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130 (emphases added).\n\n679.\n\nThis analysis is further supported by the ad hoc committee in Sempra, which also placed its focus on the different operation of the essential security interest exception and the defense of necessity:\n\n*\u201cMore importantly, Article 25 is concerned with the invocation by a**State Party of necessity 'as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of**an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State'.**Article 25 presupposes that an act has been committed that is**incompatible with the State's international obligations and is therefore*   \n*'wrongful'. Article XI, on the other hand, provides that 'This Treaty shall**not preclude' certain measures so that, where Article XI applies, the**taking of such measures is not incompatible with the State's**international obligations and is not therefore 'wrongful'.\u201d819*\n\nExhibit RL-237, *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Application for Annulment of the Award, 29 June 2010, \u00b6 200 (emphasis added).\n\n680.\n\nIn line with these findings, the tribunal in *Continental v. Argentina* \u2013 citing Prof. Vandevelde, who had advised on U.S. BIT negotiations in the 1980s and submitted an expert opinion in that case \u2013 noted that Article XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT \u201c*has been defined as a safeguard clause; it has been said that it recognizes 'reserved rights,' or that it contemplates 'non-precluded' measures to which a contracting state party can resort.*\u201d820\n\nExhibit CL-062, *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008, \u00b6 164.\n\n681.\n\nEven though the language of Article XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT and Article 22.2(b) of the TPA are not identical, some parallels can be drawn to the present case. The Tribunal concurs with the ad hoc committees\u2019 views in CMS v. *Argentina and Sempra v. Argentina*, which interpreted a BIT-based essential security exception to operate as a derogation from the BIT-based obligations of a State, essentially an exception to the scope of the treaty.\n\n682.\n\nBased on the above, the Tribunal rejects Claimants\u2019 contention that the ESI Provision constitutes an \u201c*affirmative defense against liability.*\u201d821 Unlike Article 25 of the ILC Articles, it does not *\u201cpresuppose*[] *that an act has been committed that is incompatible with the State's international obligations and is therefore 'wrongful'.\u201d*822 Instead, it precludes the measures from being incompatible with the Treaty in the first place.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application of 7 March 2022, \u00b6 28; Claimants\u2019 Preliminary Response to Colombia\u2019s New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6 16.\n\nExhibit RL-237, *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Application for Annulment of the Award, 29 June 2010, \u00b6 200.\n\n(ii) Article XXI of the GATT\n----------------------------\n\n683.\n\nThe other similarly worded clause that the Parties drew on to interpret the meaning and operation of the ESI Provision is Article XXI of the GATT, a WTO agreement, which reads as follows:\n\n*\u201cArticle XXI Security Exceptions*  \n*Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed*  \n*(a) to require any contracting party to furnish any information the*   \n*disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security*   \n*interests; or*  \n*(b) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action which it*   \n*considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests*\n\n*(i) relating to fissionable materials or the materials from which*   \n*they are derived;*  \n*(ii) relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of*   \n*war and to such traffic in other goods and materials as is carried*   \n*on directly or indirectly for the purpose of supplying a military*   \n*establishment;*  \n*(iii) taken in time of war or other emergency in international*   \n*relations; or*\n\n*(c) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action in*   \n*pursuance of its obligations under the United Nations Charter for the*   \n*maintenance of international peace and security.\u201d*823\n\nExhibit RL-222, GATT, Art. XXI. Similarly drafted is Article 24 of the Energy Charter Treaty, which reads in relevant part:\n\n*\u201cThe provisions of this Treaty other than those referred to in paragraph (1) shall not be construed to prevent any Contracting Party from taking any measure which it considers necessary:*\n\n*a. for the protection of its essential security interests including those   \ni. relating to the supply of Energy Materials and Products to a military establishment; or  \nii. taken in time of war, armed conflict or other emergency in international relations;  \nb. relating to the implementation of national policies respecting the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or needed to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Nuclear Suppliers Guidelines, and other international nuclear non-proliferation obligations or understandings; or  \nc. for the maintenance of public order.\u201d*\n\n684.\n\nIt is apparent why Article XXI of the GATT is frequently used as a comparator for the essential security exception provisions in the investor-State context, including by the Parties. The wording \u201c*taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests*\u201d is, indeed, semantically almost identical to the relevant part of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA.\n\n685.\n\nMoreover, unlike Article 25 of the ILC Articles, Article XXI of the GATT operates in the same manner, *i.e.,* without establishing the \u2018wrongful\u2019 nature of the underlying State measure but rather treating such measures as not *incompatible* with the State\u2019s international obligations in the first place.\n\n686.\n\nFinally, it is of note that the Preamble of the TPA specifically refers to the Contracting States\u2019 *\u201crespective rights and obligations under the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization and agreements to which they are both parties\u201d*, and Article 1.2 of the TPA affirms these rights and obligations, drawing the GATT \u2018into the orbit\u2019 of the TPA. However, unlike Article XX of the GATT and its interpretative notes (*see* Article 22.1.1), Article XXI of the GATT was not explicitly incorporated into the Treaty.\n\n687.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal recognizes that the specific context of the international trade law is not directly applicable to the context of international investment law. Moreover, and most importantly, the qualifiers (i) to (iii) of Article XXI(b) of the GATT distinguish it from the present case, as will be addressed in detail below.\n\n688.\n\nHowever, given the linguistic proximity of the provisions, the Tribunal considers it prudent to take the provision itself as well as the considerable body of case law interpreting and applying Article XXI of the GATT as a helpful, albeit inconclusive, supplementary means of interpretation, on which both Parties have extensively relied, as will be discussed in relevant sections below.\n\ne) Subsequent Agreement and Subsequent Practice\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n689.\n\nRespondent and the U.S. invited the Tribunal to consider, in the interpretation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, the \u201c*authentic interpretation*\u201d of the Treaty by its Contracting States through the instruments envisaged in Article 31(3) of the VCLT824:\n\n*\u201cThere shall be taken into account, together with the context:*  \n*a. any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the**interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;*  \n*b. any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which**establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;*  \n*c. any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations**between the parties.\u201d825*\n\nThird Hearing, pp. 11:8-12:5; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 50.\n\nExhibit CL-187, VCLT, Art. 31(3).\n\n690.\n\nSpecifically, Respondent and the U.S. argue that the congruence of their positions in this arbitration *vis-\u00e0-vis* the nature and the effects of the ESI Provision should be decisive for this Tribunal\u2019s interpretation.\n\n691.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the current positions taken by the Contracting Parties regarding Article 22.2(b) of the TPA in this arbitration.\n\n692.\n\nSpecifically, as discussed in Section E.II.1 above, Respondent\u2019s initial position did not entail the primary case that Article 22.2(b) of the TPA is non-justiciable. However, by the time of the Third Hearing, it was Respondent\u2019s primary case, coherent with the U.S. position on the matter. Respondent nevertheless maintained a more detailed position, arguing that, in the alternative, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear the claims and that Respondent invoked the ESI Provision in good faith.826\n\nExhibit CL-187, VCLT, Art. 31(3).\n\n693.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced, however, that the congruence of the Contracting Parties\u2019 positions in this arbitration, taken individually or together, can override the ordinary meaning of the ESI Provision. This is for three reasons.\n\n694.\n\n*First*, Article 31(3) of the VCLT merely instructs the Tribunal to take any subsequent agreement or subsequent practice \u201c*into account*\u201d together with the context of the provision. What the VCLT does not do is designate a subsequent agreement of the\u00a0contracting parties to a treaty as a conclusive tool of that treaty\u2019s interpretation.827 It is not disputed between the Parties that any subsequent agreement or practice cannot amend the language of the TPA.828\n\n*See* Exhibit CL-243, International Law Commission, Draft conclusions on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice in relation to the interpretation of treaties, with commentaries, 2018, A/73/10, pp. 24-25: \u201c*The characterization of subsequent agreements and subsequent practice of the parties under article 31, paragraph 3 (a) and (b), as \u2018authentic means of interpretation\u2019 does not, however, imply that these**means necessarily possess a conclusive effect.* [\u2026] [S]*ubsequent agreements and subsequent practice that establish the agreement of the parties regarding the interpretation of a treaty are not necessarily legally*   \n*binding. This is confirmed in draft conclusion 10, paragraph 1. Thus, when the Commission characterized a \u2018subsequent agreement\u2019 as representing \u2018an authentic interpretation by the parties which must be read into the treaty for purposes of its interpretation\u2019, it did not go quite as far as saying that such an interpretation is necessarily conclusive in the sense that it overrides all other means of interpretation.\u201d* (Footnotes omitted).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 54; Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 313.\n\n695.\n\n*Second*, while undoubtedly \u201c*subsequent*\u201d to the conclusion of the TPA, whether the positions of Respondent and the U.S. can be characterized as an \u201c*agreement*\u201d is doubtful. In principle, a subsequent agreement must not be as formal as the underlying treaty and may take different forms. However, by definition, there must be an *agreement, i.e.*, a joint manifestation of consent, between the contracting parties. In the present arbitration, Respondent\u2019s position on the ESI Provision and its interpretation evolved, as Respondent itself admitted, and gradually aligned with the U.S. position. Even now, these positions are congruent, but not identical, which makes designating them as *\u201cagreement\u201d* a rather tall order.\n\n696.\n\nThe same is true for the *\u201cpractice.\u201d* Again, the Tribunal accepts that a subsequent practice may take various forms, as long as it reflects contracting parties\u2019 conduct *\u201cin the application of the treaty.\u201d*829 Leaving aside the question of whether one instance of congruent interpretation in the context of one dispute may establish \u201c*practice*\u201d, the Tribunal is faced with the problem of deducing which \u201cagreement of the parties regarding [the provision\u2019s] interpretation\u201d such practice would establish.\n\n*See* Exhibit CL-243, International Law Commission, Draft conclusions on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice in relation to the interpretation of treaties, with commentaries, 2018, A/73/10, p. 32.\n\n697.\n\n*Third*, the Tribunal is mindful of the concerns raised by the *Infinito Gold* tribunal, namely that accepting that the Contracting States\u2019 submissions as an interpretative agreement post-dating the commencement of the arbitration may put Claimants\u2019 due process rights\u00a0in jeopardy.830 In that sense, the Tribunal cannot accept Respondent\u2019s claim that \u201c*the meaning that Colombia and the United States attributed to Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, as is clear from the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires, has remained unchanged as of the date they launched the TPA\u2019s negotiations*\u201d831, as Respondent\u2019s own case on the ESI Provision has changed in the course of this arbitration.\n\nExhibit RL-207, *Infinito Gold Ltd. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5, Award, 3 June 2021, \u00b6 339.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 52.\n\n698.\n\nFor these reasons, while evaluating both Respondent\u2019s and the U.S.\u2019 submissions with all diligence, the Tribunal cannot treat them as a subsequent agreement or subsequent practice of the Contracting Parties under Article 31(3) of the VCLT.\n\n**3.2\u00a0Interpretation according to Article 32 of the VCLT**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n699.\n\nHaving interpreted the ordinary meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, the Tribunal considers that it would be helpful to turn to the supplementary means of treaty interpretation as per Article 32 of the VCLT, such as history of the ESI Provision and *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the TPA, to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31 of the VCLT.\n\n700.\n\nAs alluded above and as not disputed between the Parties, the wording of the ESI Provision in the TPA builds upon the U.S. treaty practice which has evolved following the ICJ judgements in Nicaragua and Oil Platforms cases. The previous generation of international trade and investment treaties concluded by the U.S. contained essential security exception clauses that differed from Article 22.2(b) of the TPA in one critical aspect: they allowed a Contracting State to apply measures \u201cnecessary\u201d for the protection of its essential security interests \u2013 as opposed to the measures that \u201cit considers necessary.\u201d\n\n701.\n\nA provision drafted in that fashion, namely, Article XXI of the 1956 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the U.S. and Nicaragua, was the one that the ICJ interpreted in the Nicaragua case. There, the ICJ drew on the lack of a defined subject in the sentence to establish that it had jurisdiction to determine whether the measures applied by the U.S. were \u201c*necessary*\u201d within the meaning of the treaty.832 In other words, the ICJ rejected the U.S.\u2019 claim that the essential security exception was a self-judging provision.\n\nExhibit RL-152, *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America)*, International Court of Justice, Judgment - Merits, 27 June 1986, \u00b6 222: *\u201cThat the Court has**jurisdiction to determine whether measures taken by one of the Parties fall within such an exception, is also\u00a0clear a contrario from the fact that the text of Article XXI of the Treaty does not employ the wording which was already to be found in Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This provision of GATT, contemplating exceptions to the normal implementation of the General Agreement, stipulates that the Agreement is not to be construed to prevent any contracting party from taking any action which it 'considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests', in such fields as nuclear fission, arms, etc. The 1956 Treaty on the contrary, speaks simply of 'necessary' measures, not of those considered by a party to be such.\u201d*\n\n702.\n\nThe ICJ upheld this interpretation in relation to a similarly worded treaty in the later Oil Platforms case.833 Investment tribunals and scholars have since followed suit.\n\nExhibit RL-156, *Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America)*, International Court of Justice, Judgment - Preliminary Objection, 12 December 1996, \u00b6 20.\n\n703.\n\nFollowing this ICJ jurisprudence, the U.S. adopted a new formulation for the next generation of its international treaties and Model BITs to include the \u201c*it considers necessary*\u201d clause \u2013 with a view to eliminate any doubt as to the role of the Contracting State in determining the necessity of the measures adopted under the auspices of an essential security exception provision. As evidenced by the U.S. submission of the relevant excerpts of investment treaties that contained essentials security interest exceptions, Article 22.2(b) of the TPA \u2013 a treaty negotiated between 2004 and 2006 \u2013 is a rather typical provision within U.S. treaty practice subsequent to the *Nicaragua / Oil Platforms* paradigm shift.834\n\nLetter from the United States Department of State to the Tribunal dated 20 October 2022. *See also* Third Hearing, p. 12:11-15.\n\n704.\n\nThat is, Article 22.2(b) of the TPA stands in contrast with the language of essential security exception interpreted by the ICJ in Nicaragua and should be interpreted a *contrario* as a self-judging provision.\n\n705.\n\nThe intention of the U.S. is also clear from the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to the TPA that were submitted into the record. The minutes of the Round IV of the TPA negotiations reflect the statement of the U.S. representative to the effect that \u201c[t]*his is a strong exception in cases of matters that have to do with national security. The invocation of that exception is not subject to court review*.\u201d835\n\nExhibit RL-254, Minutes of negotiation rounds of the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, pp. 9-10 of the PDF.\n\n706.\n\nRespondent claims that its position has also been clearly expressed during the  \nnegotiations and was \u201c*identical*\u201d to that of the U.S.836 In support of this proposition, Respondent cites its representative discussing *the GATT* in the following terms:\n\n*\u201cCOL: it is very useful to know what are the elements included in the*  \n*definition of essential security, that is the problem, that essential*  \n*security is not defined in the chapter of general exceptions of the GATT,*  \n*but, as it is used it is a self-judging exception, no panel is going to say*  \n*anything, nobody is going to let that happen, but we must be cautious,*  \n*I will see how we can list it, essential security is what it is, I think that*  \n*no one in GATT wants to define it.\u201d837*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 32 (emphasis omitted).\n\nExhibit RL-254, Minutes of negotiation rounds of the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, p. 14 of the PDF\n\n707.\n\nThe Tribunal is hard-pressed to read this statement as conclusively expressing  \nRespondent\u2019s intent *vis-\u00e0-vis* the present Article 22.2(b) of the TPA. At best, it reflects Respondent\u2019s reading of a similarly worded provision in the GATT, discussed in detail below. The use of the word *\u201cpanel\u201d* (likely, a WTO panel) speaks to that conclusion. The rest of the statements cited by Respondent do not provide conclusive evidence as to Respondent\u2019s understanding of the ESI Provision at the time of the conclusion of the TPA.838\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 59-60.\n\n708.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal considers the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the TPA together with the U.S. treaty practice conclusive as to the position of one of the two Contracting States at best.\n\n709.\n\nThis analysis supports the interpretation of the ESI Provision under Article 31 of the VCLT, as elaborated above at Section F.I.3.1.\n\n**3.3 Practical Effect of the Interpretation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n710.\n\nOn the basis of the interpretation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA according to Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT above, the Tribunal will, *first*, address whether the ESI Provision is non-justiciable (**a**). *Second*, the Tribunal will consider whether the invocation of the ESI Provision deprives it of jurisdiction to review the merits of the dispute (**b**). *Third*, the Tribunal will consider whether the ESI Provision merely limits the remedies available to\u00a0investors to compensation (**c**). Finally, the Tribunal will assess the standard of review of the invocation of the ESI Provision (if any) (**d**).\n\na) Non-justiciable provision\n----------------------------\n\n711.\n\nUnder Respondent\u2019s primary case, the effect of the ESI Provision is such that a Contracting State may choose not to uphold its otherwise binding obligations under the TPA based on a determination entirely immune to scrutiny.\n\n712 .\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree that the ESI Provision is non-justiciable, i.e., \u201c[its] *invocation by a Contracting State deprives the tribunal seized of the matter of the ability to subject such invocation to any legal assessment.*\u201d839\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 20.\n\n713.\n\n*First*, Article 22.2(b) of the TPA or Footnote 2 thereto simply do not contain \u2018nonjusticiable\u2019 language.\n\n714.\n\nAs Claimants have pointed out, there are examples of treaty language that explicitly convey the non-justiciable nature of an essential security exception. For instance, the Singapore-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement provides in its Article 6.12(4):\n\n*\u201cThis Article shall be interpreted in accordance with the understanding*  \n*of the Parties on non-justiciability of security exceptions as set out in*  \n*their exchange of letters, which shall form an integral part of this*  \n*Agreement.\u201d*840\n\nExhibit CL-210, Singapore-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement, signed 29 June 2005, entry into force 1 August 2005, Art. 6.12(4) (emphasis added).\n\n715.\n\nAnnex 5 to the Exchange of Letters contemplated by this article provides, in turn:\n\n*\u201c[I]n respect of disputes submitted to arbitration pursuant to**paragraph 3(b) and/or paragraph 3(c) of Article 6.21 of the Agreement,**where the disputing Party asserts as a defence that the measure alleged**to be a breach is within the scope of a security exception as set out in**Article 6.12 of the Agreement, any decision of the disputing Party taken**on such security considerations shall be non-justiciable in that it shall**not be open to any arbitral tribunal to review the merits of any such**decision, even where the arbitral proceedings concern an assessment\u00a0of any claim for damages and/or compensation, or an adjudication of**any other issues referred to the tribunal.\u201d*841\n\nAnnex 5 to the Exchange of Letters under Article 6.12(4) of the Singapore-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (emphasis added).\n\n716.\n\nMoreover, in 2009, Respondent itself signed a Joint Interpretative Declaration with the Republic of India regarding the Agreement for Promotion and Protection of Investments Between India and Colombia, where it explicitly agreed to Note 9 along the same lines:\n\n*\u201cWhere the Contracting Party asserts as a defence that the measure**alleged to be a breach of its obligations under this Agreement is for the**protection of its 'essential security interests' [\u2026] as set out in Article 13,**any decision of such Contracting Party taken on such security**considerations shall be non-justiciable in that it shall not be open to**any arbitral tribunal to review the merits of any such decision, even**where the arbitral proceedings concern an assessment of any claim for**damages and/or compensation, or an adjudication of any other issues**referred to the tribunal.\u201d*842\n\nNote 9 to the Joint Interpretative Declaration with the Republic of India regarding the Agreement for Promotion and Protection of Investments Between India and Colombia (emphasis added).\n\n717.\n\nNotably, the India-Colombia BIT is among 13 international investment agreements Respondent itself submitted to substantiate its argument that the *\u201clanguage of Article 22.2.b is unique and purposeful.\u201d*843 While the U.S. Representative submitted during the Third Hearing that the language of the Singapore-India Agreement has no bearing on the U.S. treaty practice,844 Colombia's own treaty practice points to diverging formulations regarding the (non-)justiciable nature of essential security exceptions.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 33. *See* Exhibit RL-149, Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments Between the Republic of Colombia and the Republic of India, 10 November 2009\n\nThird Hearing, p. 15:10-18.\n\n718.\n\nThis is all the more so in light of the history of the ESI Provision and similar provisions in U.S. treaty practice. The change of wording in U.S. treaty practice was induced by the ICJ\u2019s\u00a0*Nicaragua* decision and must be taken into account by the Tribunal.\n\n719.\n\n*Second*, based on the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA and Footnote 2 analyzed in detail above, the Tribunal considers that the process of invocation of the ESI Provision entails a *finding* of applicability *by a tribunal*, meaning that the provision does not apply automatically.\n\n720.\n\n*Third*, it does not take much to recognize that an ESI Provision interpreted as a nonjusticiable exception would be an omnipotent tool at a State\u2019s disposal, which could potentially undermine legal certainty and predictability for the investors, who are not a Contracting Party to the TPA but are sought to be protected thereunder.\n\n721.\n\nAs the tribunal in *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentina* (an Argentina award spared by an ad hoc committee) noted:\n\n\u201c*Although a provision such as Art. XI, as earlier indicated, involves naturally a margin of appreciation by a party invoking it, caution must be exercised in allowing a party unilaterally to escape from its treaty obligations in the absence of clear textual or contextual indications. This is especially so if the party invoking the allegedly self judging nature of the exemption can thereby remove the issue, and hence the claim of a treaty breach by the investor against the host state, from arbitral review. This would conflict in principle with the agreement of the parties to have disputes under the BIT settled compulsorily by arbitration, both between an investor and the host State or between the Contracting Parties, as the case may be.*\u201d845\n\nExhibit CL-062, *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008, \u00b6 187.\n\n722.\n\nThis Tribunal is not venturing to \u2013 and could not \u2013 deny the Contracting States their sovereign power to define the scope of an exception to an international law obligation in the treaty they conclude, unless such obligation is a jus cogens norm. However, the Tribunal is convinced that the Contracting States must do so explicitly and unambiguously. Otherwise, an essential security exception may turn into what the OECD Investment Committee described as an *\u201cescape clause.*\u201d846\n\n*See* Public Order and Essential Security Interests under the OECD National Treatment Instrument, Investment committee\u2019s clarification reproduced in national treatment of foreign controlled enterprises, OECD, 2005: *\u201cThe Declaration excludes from the scope of the National Treatment instrument those**measures necessary to maintain public order and essential security interests. Interpretation of these concepts depends on the specific context in which they are applied and may evolve over time as circumstances warrant. However,\u00a0these provisions should be applied with caution, bearing in mind the objectives of the instrument, and should not be a general escape clause from adhering governments\u2019 commitments. Public order and security can, in certain circumstances, be interpreted to include public health. In addition, measures taken for economic, cultural or other reasons should be identified as such**and should not be shielded by an excessively broad interpretation of public order and essential security interests.*\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n723.\n\nIn the absence of clear and unequivocal language to that effect, the Tribunal is unable to place the otherwise binding international law obligations of the Contracting States in a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s box of uncertainty.\n\n724.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal considers that Article 22.2(b) of the TPA as well as Footnote 2 thereto fall short of the express language exempting the measures taken under the ESI Provision from any review by a tribunal upon invocation. Given the far-reaching consequences of allowing a State to avoid its international law obligations, the Tribunal is cautious not to read more State discretion into the ESI Provision than the Parties expressly agreed upon at the time of the TPA conclusion.\n\n725.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that Article 22.2(b) is not a non-justiciable provision.\n\nb) Lack of jurisdiction\n-----------------------\n\n726.\n\nWhile at times intertwined with Respondent\u2019s primary case on non-justiciability, in the alternative, Respondent argued that the ESI Provision deprived the Tribunal of its jurisdiction relying on the ordinary meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA \u2013 as a selfjudging provision \u2013 and the TPA\u2019s travaux pr\u00e9paratoires.847\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 29: *\u201cAll the terms of the provision expressly reflect the self-judging nature of the exception, leaving no doubt that the State invoking the exception is the sole judge of whether the conditions for the Essential Security Exception to apply are met\u201d*; Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n\n727.\n\nLargely for the same reasons as discussed above, the Tribunal is not convinced that Article 22.2(b) operates to exclude a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n728.\n\n*First*, the ordinary meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA and, specifically, of Footnote 2 suggests that there is place for certain findings to be made by a tribunal. As discussed above, the Tribunal recognizes the self-judging nature of some of the elements of the ESI Provision \u2013 but is not convinced that that translates into depriving the Tribunal of its *Kompetenz Kompetenz* entirely. The Tribunal may defer to the State for establishing whether the measures enacted are \u201c*necessary*\u201d to further the declared security interest, but that is not the end of the inquiry.\n\n729.\n\n*Second*, as elaborated above at Section F.I.3.2., the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires cited by Respondent remain inconclusive as regards the intended effect of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA.\n\n730.\n\n*Finally*, depriving this Tribunal of jurisdiction would achieve the same effect as declaring the ESI Provision non-justiciable in terms of the risks to legal certainty and predictability for the investors under the TPA.\n\nc) Limitation of available remedies\n-----------------------------------\n\n731.\n\nSince Respondent\u2019s invocation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, Claimants maintained that Respondent\u2019s \u201c*invocation of the Essential Security Provision has no practical effect on this Tribunal\u2019s role*\u201d given that \u201c[n]*either Article 22.2(b) nor its footnote even mention, much less restrict, jurisdiction or liability and therefore the provision impacts neither*.\u201d848\n\nClaimants\u2019 Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10\n\n732.\n\nInstead, Claimants argue, the function of the ESI Provision is to merely exclude restitution from the scope of the remedies available to the Tribunal, i.e. it is \u201can \u2018exception\u2019 to the general rule that allows investment tribunals to award restitution.\u201d849 In other words, even if Respondent can invoke the ESI Provision, it does not absolve it of an obligation to provide compensation to Claimants for a violation of the investment chapter of the TPA.850\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on U.S. Treaties and [Redacted], \u00b6 37.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 303.\n\n733.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by the arguments presented by Claimants for four reasons.\n\n734.\n\n*First*, this reading of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA does not reflect what is generally understood to be the operation of an essential security exception.851 The wording\u00a0*\u201cNothing in this Agreement shall be construed [\u2026] to preclude\u201d* \u2013 as opposed to, for example, \u201cA tribunal constituted under Chapter 10 cannot preclude\u201d \u2013 points to an exception to the overall scope of the TPA, not just Article 10.26 of the TPA, which provides the remedies capable of being awarded by a tribunal. In this Tribunal\u2019s view, it would require clear contractual language to limit this provision to a targeted exclusion of one specific remedy. Also, there is nothing in Chapter 22 of the TPA that would suggest\u00a0the very narrow interpretation of the Chapter heading \u201cExceptions\u201d that Claimants put forward.\n\n*See* e.g., Exhibit RL-216, Stephan Schill and Robyn Briese, *\u201c\u2018If the state Considers\u2019: Self Judging Clauses in International Dispute Settlement\u201d* 13 Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law 2009, p. 67: \u201c*At the most general level, self-judging clauses have the function of allowing a state to enter into internationalcooperation on the basis of binding international obligations, while at th e same time retaining the power to escape from such obligations in certain circumstances, most frequently if the state determines that it would harm its sovereignty, security, public policy, or more generally, its essential interests. It constitutes a safety valve for reconciling international cooperation and for state\u2019s occasional preference for unilateralism within cooperative regimes.\u201d*\n\n735.\n\n*Second*, this does not square with the history of the ESI Provision \u2013 and similarly worded provisions in U.S. treaty practice, as discussed above at Section F.I.3.2. It seems highly implausible that the intention of the Contracting States to craft such a specific exception to the remedies\u2019 regime would have left no trace in any of the discussions surrounding the TPA.\n\n736.\n\n*Third*, in the Tribunal\u2019s view and as elaborated above, the operation of the ESI Provision is such that it precludes the wrongfulness of the underlying measures. In that sense, it is not a \u201c*get-out-of-jail-free card*\u201d852, as Claimants describe it \u2013 in case of an effective invocation, the Tribunal is not mandated to make the underlying finding of wrongfulness, from which Respondent would then be \u201cfreed\u201d.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 297.\n\n737.\n\nThe compensation Claimants are requesting must follow a finding of wrongfulness, as reflected in Article 31(1) of the ILC Articles:\n\n*\u201cThe responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation**for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\u201d853*\n\nExhibit CL-025, International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentaries, 2001, Art. 31\n\n738.\n\nSimilarly, Article 10.26(1) of the TPA conditions an award of monetary damages and any applicable interest and/or restitution of property on finding *\u201cagainst a respondent.\u201d*\n\n739.\n\nIn that regard, the Tribunal finds the comparison with the compensation stemming out of an expropriation inapposite, as compensation is one of the explicit conditions of a lawful expropriation.854\n\nClaimants\u2019 Preliminary Response to Colombia\u2019s New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6 16.\n\n740.\n\n*Finally*, the Tribunal finds that the effet utile of Article 22.2(b) would be close to nonexistent if a State could continue to apply the measures in violation of the TPA but would still be required to pay compensation for applying them. Specifically in case of an unlawful expropriation, the claim Claimants have pursued in this arbitration, the Tribunal would not order the expropriated property to be returned to Claimants \u2013 it would order compensation. Taking Claimants\u2019 interpretation of Article 22.2(b) at its highest, the effect of invoking and not invoking the ESI Provision would be identical.\n\n741.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that Article 22.2(b) of the TPA is not merely an exception to the remedies regime under the TPA. If invoked properly, it excepts the measures taken by Respondent from the scope of the TPA, and the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry stops short of establishing wrongfulness of Respondent\u2019s actions (if any) \u2013 let alone awarding any compensation.\n\nd) Limited Review\n-----------------\n\n742.\n\nNotably, unlike the three \u2018primary\u2019 interpretation theories proposed by the Parties and analyzed by the Tribunal above, both Parties seem to agree on the \u2018fallback\u2019 interpretation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA: namely, that it allows a limited form of review by an investment tribunal.855 Both Parties have extensively discussed the standard and the implications of such review.\n\n*See e.g*., Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 57; Claimants\u2019 Preliminary Response to Colombia\u2019s New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6 49.\n\n743.\n\nNotwithstanding its finding that Article 22.2(b) of the TPA is not \u201c*immune from scrutiny by arbitral tribunals*\u201d, as Respondent suggests856, the Tribunal is mindful of its limited mandate in light of the self-judging nature of the ESI Provision. It will, therefore, first consider the appropriate standard of review of Respondent\u2019s invocation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 24.\n\n744.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that the standard of review for essential security exceptions is an issue that is far from settled in international investment law.\n\n745.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent\u2019s alternative case \u2013 with reference to CMS v. Argentina award \u2013 was that the Tribunal should limit itself to a good faith review:\n\n*\u201cThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to take proper note of the clear**intention of the State parties to the US-Colombia TPA in this regard,**and refrain from adjudicating this dispute by virtue of Article 22.2.b of**the US-Colombia TPA. It is the Respondent\u2019s submission that the**Tribunal\u2019s scope for review of Colombia\u2019s invocation of the exception**is strictly circumscribed to an examination of whether the exception of**essential security of Article 22.2.b has been invoked in good faith by**Colombia.\u201d857*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 43 (emphasis added, footnote omitted). *See also* Claimants\u2019 Letter of 7 March 2022, \u00b6 29.\n\n746.\n\nRespondent has later employed different ways to describe the standard of review that the Tribunal should follow, namely that *\u201cthe Asset Forfeiture Proceedings fall squarely within the scope of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, such that the initiation of Asset Forfeiture Proceedings in the present case does not constitute a breach of the Respondent\u2019s international obligations under the TPA\u201d* or \u201ca prima facie *test*.\u201d858 At the same time, Respondent still maintained that the ESI Provision had been invoked in good faith.859\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 63.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 98.\n\n747.\n\nClaimants have generally accepted a good faith review as the relevant legal standard.860\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on U.S. Treaties and [Redacted] , Section I.D.\n\n748.\n\nIn any case, the Tribunal notes that the depth and the breadth of inquiry suggested by both Parties seem to be on a limited spectrum, implying some form of a cursory review. For the ease of reference and without aiming to provide a conclusive definition thereof, the Tribunal considers a good faith review \u2013 a standard supported by jurisprudence and legal scholars \u2013 sufficiently balanced to ensure proper application of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA without infringing on its self-judging nature.\n\n749.\n\nThe good faith review has been most notably developed by the ICJ in a line of jurisprudence dealing with States exercising their treaty-based discretionary powers, which includes the Nicaragua and Oil Platforms judgements discussed above. In Equatorial Guinea v. France, as a part of an unrelated legal test under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the ICJ accentuated this principle:\n\n*\u201cThe Court has repeatedly stated that, where a State possesses a**discretionary power under a treaty, such a power must be exercised**reasonably and in good faith (see Rights of Nationals of the United**States of America in Morocco (France v. United States of America),**Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1952, p. 212; Certain Questions of Mutual**Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France), Judgment, I.C.J.**Reports 2008, p. 229, para. 145).\u201d861*\n\nExhibit CL-225, *Immunities and Criminal Proceedings (Equatorial Guinea v. France)*, Judgment, 11 December 2020, \u00b6 73 (emphasis added).\n\n750.\n\nSimilarly, in *Djibouti v. France*, the ICJ subjected to a good faith review France\u2019s  \ndiscretionary power to refuse to provide mutual assistance in criminal matters under the corresponding convention, if it considers that execution of the request is likely to prejudice its essential interests:\n\n*\u201cThe Court begins its examination of Article 2 of the [Convention on**Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between France and Djibouti of**27 September 1986] by observing that, while it is correct, as France**claims, that the terms of Article 2 provide a State to which a request for**assistance has been made with a very considerable discretion, this**exercise of discretion is still subject to the obligation of good faith**codified in Article 26 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of**Treaties (see Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia, Merits,**Judgment No. 7, 1926, P.C.I.J., Series A, p. 30, and Free Zones of**Upper Savoy and the District of Gex, Judgment, 1932, P.C.I.J., Series**A/B, No. 46, p. 167 ; for the competence of the Court in the face of**provisions giving wide discretion, see Military and Paramilitary**Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of**America), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1986, p. 116, para. 222, and**Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America),**Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2003, p. 183, para. 43).\u201d*862\n\n*Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France)*, Judgment, 4 June 2008, \u00b6 145 (emphasis added).\n\n751.\n\nIn doing so, the ICJ places reliance on a norm\u00a0*external* to the treaties under its review,\u00a0namely Article 26 of the VCLT, which serves as a basic \u201csanity check\u201d on the States\u2019 performance of their international law obligations:\n\n*\u201cArticle 26 'Pacta sunt servanda'*   \n*Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.\u201d*863\n\nExhibit CL-187, VCLT, Art. 26.\n\n752.\n\nInvestment arbitration tribunals are also familiar with good faith review of State\u2019s discretionary powers.\n\n753.\n\nWith its finding that the U.S.-Argentina BIT provision in question was not self-judging, the tribunal in LG&E v. Argentina remarked, in obiter, that:\n\n*\u201cWere the Tribunal to conclude that the provision is self-judging, Argentina's determination would be subject to a good faith review anyway [\u2026].*\u201d864\n\nExhibit CL-045, *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006, \u00b6 214.\n\n754.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in Continental v. Argentina, referred to a good faith review in a hypothetical:\n\n*\u201cIf Art. XI granted unfettered discretion to a party to invoke it, in good faith, in order to exempt a particular measure which the investor claims has breached its treaty rights from any scrutiny by a tribunal, then that tribunal would be prevented from entering further into the merits, after having recognized that an economic crisis such as the one experienced**by Argentina in 2001-2002 qualified under Art. XI.\u201d865*\n\nExhibit CL-062, *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008, \u00b6 182\n\n755.\n\nAlthough the ESI Provision is self-judging, the Tribunal does not agree with the proposition that it is solely for the State parties to the TPA to ensure that the provision is invoked in good faith and, ultimately, that the other State Party is the judge of the proper invocation of the ESI Provision, as argued by the U.S.866 This interpretation finds no support in the language of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA and, taken at its highest, leads to the same risks to the legal certainty at foreign investors\u2019 expense, as described above.\n\nThird Hearing, pp. 16:8-13, 19:16-20:3.\n\n756.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal will conduct a limited review as to whether Respondent invoked the ESI Provision in good faith.\n\n4. Application of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA\n--------------------------------------------\n\n757.\n\nHaving considered the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA in light of the object and purpose of the Treaty, supplemented by external interpretative tools when appropriate, the Tribunal will proceed to apply its understanding of the ESI Provision to the circumstances of the present case.\n\n758.\n\nClaimants raise two main arguments to demonstrate that Article 22.2(b) was not, in fact, raised by Respondent in good faith: (i) Respondent\u2019s articulation of its essential security interest did not meet the standard, as Respondent had previously invoked \u201c*precisely the**same interest as one to protect public welfare, not essential security*\u201d; and (ii) Respondent\u2019s stated essential security interest \u201c*has no plausible connection to the Asset**Forfeiture Proceedings*\u201d, as the latter have not targeted the proceeds of the alleged crime or criminals \u2013 and have instead only targeted Claimants\u2019 investment.867\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 298.\n\n759.\n\nBelow, the Tribunal will analyze the prongs of the ESI Provision.\n\na) Measures\n-----------\n\n760.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that the measures adopted by Respondent, *i.e.,* the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings commenced in 2016, constitute a *\u201cmeasure\u201d* within the meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA.\n\n761.\n\nFurther, as demonstrated above, the interpretation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA leads to the conclusion that the State has a wide discretion in enacting measures *\u201cit considers\u201d*necessary.\n\n762.\n\nIn the present case, the measures enacted against Claimants were implemented by the law enforcement authorities under the Asset Forfeiture Law. These measures are now subject to review of the Columbian courts.\n\n763.\n\nRespondent stated plainly that it *\u201cconsiders the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings to be a**necessary measure.* [\u2026] *The necessity of Asset Forfeiture Proceedingsin the fight against**criminal organizations, drug-trafficking and money laundering in Colombia can hardly**be denied, particularly when the Colombian State launches Asset Forfeiture Proceedings**to bar a transnational criminal organization such as the Oficina de Envigado from**continuing to operate in the country.\u201d*868 In its Rejoinder, Respondent describes the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings as *\u201cone of the most important measures available under**Colombian law to fight against organized crime, drug-trafficking and money laundering**in Colombia\u201d* and a *\u201cquintessential tool in the investigation and further sanction of one**of the major criminal organizations that has been a risk for the essential security interests**of the Colombian State for decades.\u201d*869\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53 (emphasis added).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 10.\n\nb) Essentiel Security Interest\n------------------------------\n\n(i) Definition of the Essential Security Interest\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n764.\n\nAs demonstrated above at Section F.I.3.1.a)(ii), an essential security interest can refer to sovereign interests outside the realm of territorial integrity or military security, like environmental safety and economic stability.\n\n765.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal is convinced that the interests invoked by Respondent \u201c*to fight against organized crime, money laundering, and drug trafficking, thus ultimately protecting its population from the threats of paramilitary and marginalized groups that\u00a0have been ravaging the country for years*\u201d870\u2013 directly relate to public safety, national security, and socio-economic stability of Columbia and therefore constitute essential security interests.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 55. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Reply to Claimants\u2019 Application of 7 March 2022, p.5: \u201c[Respondent] *raised the Exception, in good faith, only after new developments coupled with new information came to light, making it patent that what is at stake in these proceedings is Colombia\u2019s ability to exercise its sovereign criminal power to fight the activities of a criminal organization whose members, including those of the highest rank, have successively held the Meritage Lot and have engaged in money laundering operations that permeate its transfers up to the present.\u201d*\n\n766.\n\nThis Tribunal appreciates how seriously the policies aimed at combating organized crime and drug-trafficking are and should be taken by Respondent. The Tribunal consequently does not consider that there is any doubt that those can \u2013 in principle \u2013 be invoked in good faith as essential security interests of Respondent. In and of itself, this is not disputed by Claimants \u2013 it is only the relevance of these objectives to this specific case that is disputed.\n\n767.\n\nOne of Claimants\u2019 two main arguments against Respondent\u2019s invocation of the ESI Provision is that Respondent \u201c*failed to articulate the essential security interest in good faith*.\u201d871 According to Claimants, Respondent merely \u201crelabelled\u201d the interest in fighting organized crime as essential security interest after initially characterizing it as a \u201c*legitimate public welfare objective.*\u201d872\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 335.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 298, 335.\n\n768.\n\nRespondent does not dispute that it had initiated the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings due to the \u201cexisting suspicions regarding the owners of the Meritage Lot, and the manner in which the lot was transferred over the years\u201d \u2013 and only designated them as taken for protection of an essential security interest after [REDACTED].873 However, Respondent maintains that the relevant point in time to assess the essential security interest is the invocation of the ESI Provision.874\n\n[Redacted]\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 91.\n\n769.\n\nHaving dealt with the timing of the invocation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA above at Section F.I.1., the Tribunal will now consider whether Respondent\u2019s designation of its\u00a0efforts to fight organized crime and drug-trafficking as its essential security interest within the meaning of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA for the purposes of this arbitration withstands a good faith review. The Tribunal finds that it does.\n\n770.\n\nTo recall, Respondent referred to its legislative framework and law enforcement efforts to combat organized crime since the beginning of this arbitration.875\u00a0In fact, the Asset Forfeiture Law, which is at the core of the contested measures, has a purpose of targeting the proceeds of drug-trafficking activities and preventing the transfer of assets acquired with these proceeds to third parties.876 That is, Respondent\u2019s interest to fight organized crime \u2013 by targeting its proceeds \u2013 is ingrained in the Asset Forfeiture Law and has been present since the introduction of the asset forfeiture measures against Claimants.\n\n*See e.g.,* Respondent\u2019s Counter Memorial, Section IV.A.2(i)(a).\n\nExhibit C-003, Asset Forfeiture Law, Art. 15. See e.g., Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 17.\n\n771.\n\nWhether Respondent has waived its right to designate this interest as essential security interest in the meaning of the TPA by not doing so earlier is a different question. Respondent argues that it invoked the ESI Provision in good faith after having accumulated enough evidence that the chain of title of the Meritage Project was allegedly connected to the members of *Oficina de Envigado*.877 Claimants dismiss these rationale as \u201c*nothing more than a tactical revision*\u201d or merely a pretext.878\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Counter Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 153-155, 159-160, 164-165, 167, 193, 632; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 57, 88, 101-104, 113, 118, 123 et seq., 370-371, 408, 594.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 335; Claimants\u2019 Submission on U.S. Treaties and [Redacted] \u00b6 55.\n\n772.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot speak to the tactical considerations of Respondent in this arbitration. However, the Tribunal considers it necessary to consider the course of the proceedings and the context in which Respondent invoked the ESI Provision. Based on the record submitted by the Parties \u2013 and without going into the merits of the case, \u2013 the Tribunal notes that there is a clear line between the commencement of the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings regarding the Meritage Project and the invocation of the ESI Provision on the basis of further criminal investigations into the same project and individuals involved.\n\n773.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Respondent\u2019s argument that complex criminal investigations are *\u201cevolutionary by definition\u201d*, with certain facts and circumstances coming to light at later stages than the initial measures are taken.879 That these new facts may trigger new heightened concerns *vis-\u00e0-vis* essential security interests is not unlikely. In the present case, [Redacted] were subsequent to \u2013 but not unconnected with \u2013 the initial measures taken against Claimants.\u00a0Moreover, both the [REDACTED] and the related court proceedings challenging the measures are still ongoing.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n(ii) Scope of the Essential Security Interest\n---------------------------------------------\n\n774.\n\nAs to the scope of the essential security interest, the Parties have discussed whether the good faith carve-out under the Asset Forfeiture Law may factor into the definition of the essential security interest in the present case. In other words, whether the Asset Forfeiture Law provides for an exception to the exception under the TPA.\n\n775.\n\nClaimants submitted that Respondent has concretized its essential security interest in the field of fighting narco-trafficking by the means of the Asset Forfeiture Law, and, in doing so, provided for a bona fide acquisition exception. As explained by Claimants:\n\n\u201c*[I]n defining their Essential Security Interests, it must be the case that, in dealing with narco-trafficking, you must also acknowledge the Exception that is contained within domestic law. Otherwise, it would not be a good-faith definition of the Essential Security Interest, and that is one of the prongs of the good-faith analysis. [\u2026]. [I]n doing a good-faith analysis [\u2026] the Tribunal, should accept that, in articulating that Essential Security Interest, protection of narco-trafficking, the law itself acknowledges the Exception of good-faith third parties, so the Tribunal can and should assess whether or not Mr. Seda and the Investors were good-faith third parties* [\u2026].\u201d880\n\nThird Hearing, pp. 216:11-217:7; 229:20-230:21.\n\n776.\n\nOn the other hand, Respondent submits that the Tribunal should not assess the exception within the exception for two reasons.\n\n777.\n\n*First*, Respondent clarifies that it is not invoking the Asset Forfeiture Law itself as an essential security exception, since the law has a much broader scope and does not apply exclusively to the matters of narco-trafficking. According to Respondent, \u201c*the Essential Security is not the law itself. [\u2026] It\u2019s in concreto invocation of that specific proceeding affecting the money-laundering to the benefit of narco-trafficking.*\u201d881\n\nThird Hearing, pp. 244:22-247:11.\n\n778.\n\n*Second*, Respondent submits that the Asset Forfeiture Law and the ESI Provision operate on two different planes: the domestic and the international one respectively. Respondent argues that it is the Colombian courts \u2013 to which Claimants have turned \u2013 that have the power to determine whether the rights of bona fide third parties should be preserved under\u00a0the Asset Forfeiture Law. In contrast, this Tribunal\u2019s mandate \u2013 for the good faith review \u2013 is to determine \u201cwhether the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings, as they are ongoing and invocation by Colombia is indeed for the protection of Essential Security Interests in the form of fight against money-laundering and narco-traffic [\u2026].\u201d882\n\nThird Hearing, pp. 246:11-249:18.\n\n779.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the fact that even if the Asset Forfeiture Law has a broader scope, to the extent it concerns narco-trafficking and organized crime, there is an overlap between the substance of the law and the substance of the essential security interest that Respondent is invoking. However, the Tribunal follows Respondent\u2019s argument and agrees that the ESI Provision is an instrument of public international law that is not necessarily defined or limited by Respondent\u2019s national Asset Forfeiture Law.\n\n780.\n\nThe good faith that is the focus of this Tribunal\u2019s inquiry is that of Respondent in invoking the ESI Provision under the TPA. Theoretically, if it were undisputed that Claimants acquired the Meritage Lot in good faith under the Asset Forfeiture Law, this could raise the question of whether Respondent could invoke the ESI Provision in good faith, considering that its national legislation in the field of fighting narco-trafficking exempts forfeiture of real property acquired in good faith. At a minimum, in such a case Respondent could be required to specify why that exception would not apply to the ESI Provision.\n\n781.\n\nHowever, the question as to whether Claimants acquired the property in good faith under the Asset Forfeiture Law is part of the merits and is disputed in the present proceedings. Importantly, this precise question is currently pending before the Colombian courts in order to determine Claimants\u2019 compliance with the provisions of Colombian national law.\n\n782.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Tribunal finds no basis to conclude that Respondent identified its essential security interest for the purposes of the present proceedings in bad faith.\n\nc) Nexus\n--------\n\n784.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, Respondent briefly argued that it had satisfied the plausibility connection in good faith.883 Later, Respondent elaborated on the connection between the measures undertaken against Claimants and the essential security interest sought protected:\n\n*\u201cTo recall, the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings over the Meritage Lot were**commenced, inter alia, on the grounds of the illicit origin as the**property was initially owned by Ivan L\u00f3pez Vanegas, a drug trafficker,**the spurious transfers of the property through front men, the multiple**irregularities in the sale-purchase deeds and physical and legal**transformations of the lot that exhibited the hallmarks of money**laundering. In addition, there were allegations of involvement in the**successive transfers of the property of members of the* Oficina de   \nEnvigado.  \n*In the course of these proceedings, the manner in which the illegal**transfers took place, the mechanism used by the drug traffickers and**front men involved in the transfers to attempt to shield the product of**illicit activities from the action of the State and the identity of the very**owners of the Meritage Lot with whom Mr. Seda entered into a sale-purchase agreement, and who are the trustors of the Meritage, have**been fully revealed.\u201d*884\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply to Claimants\u2019 Application of 7 March 2022, p. 21 (footnote omitted).\n\n785.\n\nClaimants disagree and argue that it is precisely the lack of \u201c*rational nexus*\u201d or \u201c*plausible connection*\u201d between the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings and the essential security interest identified that are fatal to Respondent\u2019s invocation of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA.885 According to Claimants, the lack of criminal allegation against Claimants, which would lend credence to the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings, juxtaposed against the lack of action against the proceeds of alleged criminal wrongdoings of the alleged members of the *Oficina de Envigado* discredits the connection between the measures taken against them and the stated objective of protecting the population from organized crime.886\n\n*See* Claimants' Preliminary Response to Colombia's New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 64, 57 *et seq*; Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 298, 336.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 336; Claimants\u2019 Rebuttal on Essential Security, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 34.\n\n786.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the nexus between the measures enacted against Claimants and the essential security interest invoked by Respondent in the present case satisfies the plausibility threshold for three reasons.\n\n787.\n\n*First*, the Tribunal emphasizes that the standard of review accepted in different formulations by both Parties is low. Plausible \u2013 or, for that matter, prima facie or rational \u2013 connection does not require the Tribunal to establish that the measures enacted by Respondent were the main avenue to combatting organized crime, let alone a sole instrument. It suffices that the measures could serve such purpose on their face, *i.e.,* are not \u201c*so remote from, or unrelated to*\u201d the stated objective as to render the connection implausible. The fact that a different measure taken or not taken by a State could be more plausibly connected with the declared essential security interest is not a relevant consideration.\n\n788.\n\nIn that, the Tribunal cannot follow Claimants\u2019 argument on the applicable legal standards.887 Although interconnected in the present case, the legal standards for (i) applying forfeiture measures under the Asset Forfeiture Law, (ii) initiating a criminal investigation under Colombian law, and (iii) establishing a plausible nexus between the asset forfeiture measures and the essential security interest identified by Respondent for the purposes of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA are distinct.888\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 336: \u201c*And, in any event, a discriminatory measure where the primary perpetrators are left scot free cannot be a good faith invocation of a measure to purportedly protect a State\u2019s essential security interest*.\u201d\n\nAsset forfeiture proceedings are autonomous and independent from criminal or other proceedings or from any declaration of liability. See Exhibit C-003, Asset Forfeiture Law, Art. 18.\n\n789.\n\n[Redacted]\n\n790.\n\nTo reiterate, this Tribunal is not a criminal court \u2013 and in case it finds that the ESI Provision applies, it will not even venture to review the case on the merits. The only finding it is currently making is whether or not Respondent invoked Article 22.2(b) of the TPA in good faith.\n\n791.\n\n*Second*, the purpose of a self-judging ESI Provision is precisely to afford a State a measure of discretion in identifying essential security concerns and addressing them,\u00a0including by the means of law enforcement. As elaborated above, the Tribunal appreciates that the nature of a large-scale criminal investigation is an evolving one. The Tribunal\u2019s mandate is not to instruct Respondent how to conduct criminal investigations, as Claimants invite it to do891, \u2013 that should be achieved by the system of checks and balances in Colombian national law.\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Breif,\u00a0\u00a0\u00b6345.\n\n792.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal finds it plausible that Asset Forfeiture Proceedings under the Asset   \nForfeiture Law involving Claimants\u2019 assets \u2013 related to other asset forfeiture and criminal   \nproceedings \u2013 are connected to the interest of combating drug-trafficking. In other words,   \nto establish a plausible nexus between the Asset Forfeiture Proceedings and the essential   \nsecurity interest of fighting organized crime, this Tribunal need not conclusively establish  \nthat \u201c[Redacted] *were owners of La Palma Argentina*.\u201d Instead, it needs to satisfy itself that it is plausible that Asset Forfeiture Proceedings could be connected to the criminal investigations against them, as submitted by Respondent. Had the contested measures been entirely disconnected from the law enforcement actions in fighting organized crime \u2013 geographically, temporarily, and in scope of people involved \u2013 the Tribunal would be hard pressed to see the nexus. However, having been briefed extensively on the status of the criminal investigations, the Tribunal finds it plausible that the measures Respondent took are connected to its stated essential security interest.892\n\n[Redacted]\n\n793.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that the Meritage Lot had traces of criminal origin in its chain of title. Up until September 2004, the Meritage Lot was owned by Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Vanegas, who is a convicted drug trafficker, through his company Inversiones Nueve (previously, Sierralta L\u00f3pez y C\u00eda.).893 Between 2004 and 2007, the Meritage Lot was the subject of at least ten real estate transactions involving eight different owners who held property title of the Meritage Lot in varying proportions.894 An additional transaction\u00a0between Inversiones Aler and La Palma took place in 2012.895 In 2014, the Meritage Lot was included in a property forfeiture investigation into properties linked to Mr. Restrepo Santamar\u00eda, a member of the criminal organization Oficina de Envigado.896\n\n*See* Exhibit C-022, Attorney General\u2019s Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Precautionary Measures Resolution, 22 July 2016; Exhibit C-031, Petition for Information from Corficolombiana to Attorney General Office of Asset Forfeiture and Anti-Asset Laundering, 22 August 2013; Exhibit C-036, *United States v.* *Lopez-Vanegas*, 493 F.3d 1305 (11th Cir. 2007), 26 July 2007; Exhibit C-130, Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Vanegas Complaint to Prosecutor 24, 3 July 2014; Exhibit C-173, Legal Opinion by Wilson Alejandro Mart\u00ednez S\u00e1nchez, 13 September 2016; Exhibit R-003, Deed No. 2589, 5 December 1989; Exhibit R-008, Deed No. 1554, 12 August 1994.\n\nSee Exhibit C-022, Attorney General\u2019s Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Precautionary Measures Resolution, 22 July 2016; Exhibit \u0421-023, Attorney General's Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Determination of the Claim, 25 January 2017; Exhibit \u0421-030, Otero & Palacio Title Study and Supplement, 7 March 2013, 23 July 2013; Exhibit C-031, Petition for Information from Corficolombiana to Attorney General Office of Asset\u00a0Forfeiture and Anti-Asset Laundering, 22 August 2013; Exhibit \u0421-037, L\u00f3pez Vanegas Tutela Action, 6 May 2016; Exhibit \u0421-067, Letter from Michael J. Burdick to Aimer Fredy Alonso Triana, 21 November 2016; Exhibit \u0421-080, Deed No. 1762, 16 September 2004; Exhibit \u0421-081, Deed No. 738, 29 April 2005; Exhibit C-130, Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Vanegas Complaint to Prosecutor 24, 3 July 2014; Exhibit R-018, Deed No. 2834, 7 September 2006; Exhibit R-019, Deed No. 3338, 4 October 2006; Exhibit R-020, Deed No. 1992, 4 September 2007.\n\n*See* Exhibit \u0421-023, Attorney General\u2019s Office, Asset Forfeiture Unit, Determination of the Claim, 25 January 2017; Exhibit \u0421-030, Otero & Palacio Title Study and Supplement, 7 March 2013, 23 July 2013; Exhibit C-031, Petition for Information from Corficolombiana to Attorney General Office of Asset Forfeiture and Anti-Asset Laundering, 22 August 2013; C 130, Iv\u00e1n L\u00f3pez Vanegas Complaint to Prosecutor 24, 3 July 2014.\n\n*See* Exhibit R-047, Decision C-235/19 of the Colombian Constitutional Court, 29 May 2019; Exhibit R-206, Asset Forfeiture Proceedings File No. 13641, Annex Folder No. 3; Exhibit R-207, Asset Forfeiture Proceedings File No. 13641, Annex Folder No. 4.\n\n794.\n\n[Redacted]. Nevertheless, the Tribunal observes that the submitted evidence, together with   \nthe undisputed facts as to the chain of title of the Meritage Lot, constitutes a sufficiently   \nplausible nexus between the measures taken by Respondent against Meritage Property   \nand the stated essential security interest of fighting drug trafficking.897\n\n[Redacted]\n\n795.\n\nTherefore, on the evidence presented by the Parties, the Tribunal considers that there are no indications in the case record that the ESI Provision was not invoked by Respondent in good faith. In light of the nature of the ESI Provision, this means that the measures taken by Respondent are excluded from the scope of the TPA coverage and Tribunal\u2019s inquiry must stop here.\n\n**5. MFN Clause**\n-----------------\n\n796.\n\nIn the alternative, Claimants have argued that the TPA\u2019s MFN clause, contained in Article 10.4, can serve to import a more favorable treatment of the investors under the Colombia-Swiss BIT, which does not contain an essential security exception similar to that of theTPA.898\n\nClaimants\u2019 Preliminary Response to Colombia\u2019s New Essential Security Defense, \u00b6\u00b6 74-76.\n\n797.\n\nIt is undisputed that the MFN protections of Article 10.4 do not extend to dispute resolution by virtue of its footnote 2.899 Claimants argue that the suggested model of MFN import does not impact dispute resolution, since Article 22.2(b) of the TPA \u201ccreates a general exception to the substantive obligations owed under the TPA, and is unconnected to any specific dispute resolution mechanism.\u201d900\n\nExhibit CL-001, TPA. Footnote 2 to Article 10.4 of the TPA reads as follows: \u201c*For greater certainty, treatment \u2018with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments\u2019 referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 10.4 does not encompass dispute resolution mechanisms, such as those in Section B, that are provided for in international investment treaties or trade agreements.*\u201d\n\nClaimants' Post-Hearing Brief,\u00a0\u00b6 351.\n\n798.\n\nThis is, however, an artificial argument since the purpose of Claimants\u2019 attempted import   \n(or, rather, export in this case) is precisely to safeguard the dispute resolution provisions   \nof Chapter 10 of the TPA: power and jurisdiction of the Tribunal and available remedies.\n\n799.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that Article 10.4 of the TPA cannot operate to   \nexclude the effects of Article 22.2(b) of the TPA.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n800.\n\nAs a general rule, protection of investors\u2019 rights in an international forum is a creature of state sovereignty and is limited by it. More specifically, this Tribunal\u2019s mandate deriving from the TPA is likewise limited by the Treaty itself.\n\n801.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent invoked the ESI Provision in line with the requirements of the TPA, and therefore the measures enacted by Respondent against Claimants are placed outside of the scope of the Treaty. That effectively means that the Tribunal has no mandate to review further objections to its jurisdiction and the merits of the case.\n\n802.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it was briefed by the Parties on the status of the national court proceedings in Columbia, where Claimants appeal the measures that are at the core of this\u00a0arbitration. In light of the above, the Tribunal notes that its findings \u2013 which are not based on the Tribunal\u2019s review of the case on the merits \u2013 are without prejudice to Claimants\u2019 rights in that appropriate forum, including a right to compensation, if any. Specifically, the Tribunal reiterates that it does not purport to make any finding on the legality of Claimants\u2019 actions or their alleged involvement with organized crime.\n\n**II. Jurisdiction and Merits**\n-------------------------------\n\n803.\n\nIn light of the findings above, the Tribunal need not consider further objections to its jurisdiction raised by Respondent or the merits of Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n**G. DECISION ON COSTS**\n------------------------\n\n**I. Claimants' Costs Submission**\n----------------------------------\n\n804.\n\nIn their Submission on Costs, Claimants argue that Respondent should bear the total arbitration costs incurred by Claimants, including legal fees and expenses, totaling USD 21,258,661.74, broken down as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Amount** |\n| ArentFox Schiff LLP Fees | USD 4,649,896.79 |\n| Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP Fees | USD 13,125,980.10901 |\n| Disbursements902 | USD 2,432,784.85 |\n| Advance Payments made to ICSID | USD 1,050,000 |\n| **Total** | **USD 21,258,661.74** |\n\nClaimants note that, out of this amount of fees, approximately USD 1,087,226.10 were incurred to respond to Respondent\u2019s Essential Security Defense.

Claimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, \u00b6 18.\n\n805.\n\nClaimants note that investment tribunals have confirmed that in the event a claimant   \nsucceeds on the merits of its claim, the *Chorz\u00f3w* principle requires that a claimant be   \nawarded reasonable costs incurred as a result of brining the dispute to arbitration.903 On   \nthis basis, Claimants argue that if the Tribunal finds that Claimants prevail in part or in   \nall of their claims on the merits, they should be reimbursed for the costs they have incurred   \nfor the entirety of this arbitration to be made whole.904\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, \u00b6 7.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, \u00b6 9. *See also* Claimants\u2019 Reply on Costs, 9 August 2023 (\u201c**Claimants\u2019 Reply on Costs**\u201d), \u00b6\u00b6 2-6.\n\n807.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent\u2019s belated Essential Security Defense put Claimants at   \na \u201csevere disadvantage because the document disclosure phase of the Arbitration was already over,\u201d906 and forced them to make additional submissions and numerous applications to assert their procedural rights, prolonging this Arbitration by over a year.907\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 12.\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs, \u00b6 12.\n\n808.\n\nClaimants also argue that, beyond belatedly raising the Essential Security Defense,\u00a0 Respondent\u2019s conduct throughout this arbitration was \u201c*riddled with procedural gamesmanship and misconduct*\u201d and such behavior must be taken into account by the Tribunal in the allocation of costs.908 As examples, Claimants submit that Respondent refused to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s document production orders in PO2; that Respondent \u201crepeatedly made vague and unfounded allegations throughout the Arbitration that Mr. Seda and counsel have leaked confidential information;\u201d and \u201cr*epeatedly sought to re-litigate issues already decided by the Tribunal*.\u201d909\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, \u00b6 16.\n\n809.\n\nFinally, Claimants contend that, by contrast, Respondent\u2019s accusations of abusive   \nprocedural conduct against Claimants \u201c*cannot be taken seriously given that, as usual, its*   \n*allegations are without citations or references to actual facts*.\u201d910\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply on Costs, \u00b6 7.

Respondent's Costs Submission\n---------------------------------\n\n810.\n\nIn its Submission on Costs, Respondent submits that Claimants should bear all the costs   \nand expenses of these proceedings, including Respondent\u2019s legal fees and expenses, totaling USD 5,099,605.96, broken down as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | **Amount** |\n| Gaillard Banifatemi Shelbaya Disputes (and previously, Sherman & Sterling LLP) Fees | USD 3,045,450.50 |\n| Experts\u2019 Fees and Expenses | USD 670,648.16 |\n| Other Costs and Expenses911 | USD 333,507.30 |\n| Advance Payments made to ICSID | USD 1,050,000 |\n| **Total** | **USD 5,099,605.96** |\n\nThis category includes costs and expenses of ANDJE lawyers, expenses in connection with witnesses\u2019 attendance to the hearings and external consultants. Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, 26 July 2023 (\u201c**Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs**\u201d), \u00b6 5.\n\n811.\n\nRespondent argues that if Respondent is successful in the present arbitration and prevails   \non the preliminary issues, the merits or on the damages claim, the Tribunal should order   \nClaimants to reimburse Respondent for its costs.912\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 11.\n\n812.\n\nRespondent further maintains that, in allocating the costs of the arbitration, the Tribunal   \nshould consider that Claimants, through their \u201c*highly abusive procedural conduct,*   \n*imposed an exceptional burden on the Respondent and forced it to invest exorbitant*   \n*human and material resources to defend its interests*.\u201d913 In this regard, Respondent   \nsubmits, inter alia, that Claimants \u201c*prematurely initiated the arbitral proceedings*,\u201d 914  \n\u201c*sought to leverage the different proceedings by sharing confidential information across*   \n*the different fora*;\u201d915 made \u201c*unsubstantiated allegations against the Respondent, unduly*   \n*prolonging the proceedings \u2013 including by filing irrelevant evidence late in the\u00a0proceedings \u2013;\u201d916 made \u201cinconclusive or irrelevant document requests,\u201d917 and failed to \u201cengage with the evidence in the record of the Arbitration.\u201d918*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 23. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 13.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 15.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 15.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 16.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 16. Respondent provides examples of this alleged conduct in \u00b6\u00b6 17-22 of Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, \u00b6 16.\n\n813.\n\nIn response to Claimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, Respondent notes, inter alia, that, as   \nacknowledged by Claimants themselves, only reasonable costs may be reimbursed.919 For   \nRespondent, Claimants\u2019 costs are \u201cby any measure unreasonable and excessive,\u201d pointing   \nout to the disproportion between Claimants\u2019 costs when compared with (i) Respondent\u2019s   \ncosts,920 (ii) Claimants\u2019 alleged investment in the Meritage Project and the damages they   \nclaim;921 and (iii) the mean costs for investors in investment arbitration proceedings.922\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Costs, 9 August 2023 (\u201c**Respondent\u2019s Reply on Costs**\u201d), \u00b6 3.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Costs, \u00b6 5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Costs, \u00b6 6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Costs, \u00b6 7.\n\n814.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent contends that, contrary to Claimants\u2019 allegations, Respondent\u2019s   \ninvocation of the Essential Security Defense \u201ccannot justify an award of costs against the   \nState.\u201d923 In this regard, Respondent notes that such a defense is \u201can entitlement under   \nthe TPA for any of the Contracting States, and the exercise of that entitlement cannot   \npossibly give rise to cost liability,\u201d924 and that the TPA does not provide for any time limit   \nfor the State to raise the defense.925\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Costs, \u00b6 9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Costs, \u00b6 9.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Costs, \u00b6 9.\n\n815.\n\nRespondent further argues that, in any event, the Essential Security Defense was not raised belatedly.926 Moreover, Respondent states that, as acknowledged by Claimants, only around USD 1 million of Claimants\u2019 legal fees were incurred responding to the Essential Security Defense, i.e., \u201c*only 6% of the total legal fees claimed.*\u201d Therefore, Claimants\u2019 request for an award of costs \u201c*on account of the alleged \u2018belated invocation\u2019**of the Essential Security Exception is wholly unwarranted.*\u201d927\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Costs, \u00b6 10.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Costs, \u00b6 11.\n\n816.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that Claimants\u2019 remaining allegations regarding the alleged   \nconduct of Respondent that would warrant an award of costs are also baseless.928\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\n**III. The Tribunal's Decision on Costs**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n817.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*\u201cIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the**parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in**connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom**those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal**and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.**Such decision shall form part of the award.\u201d*\n\n818.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n819.\n\nIn its decision on costs, the Tribunal primarily takes into account two circumstances. On one hand, Respondent was successful in invoking Article 22.2(b) of the TPA, as established by the Tribunal above. On the other hand, the Tribunal is mindful of the fact Respondent invoked the ESI Provision in its Rejoinder, when the Parties had already made extensive submissions on jurisdiction and merits of the case. While the Tribunal ultimately did not consider such invocation untimely (see above at Section F.I.1.), it appreciates that the associated costs could have potentially been avoided, at least in part.\n\n820.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal considers that the costs of the arbitration should be borne by each Party in equal shares. Furthermore, each Party should bear its own legal costs.\n\n821.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the   \nTribunal\u2019s Assistant, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitrators' fees and expenses |  |\n| Klaus Sachs | 719,596.81 |\n| Charles Poncet | 150,901.34 |\n| Hugo Perezcano Diaz | 448,979.90 |\n| Marcus Weiler's expenses | 11,399.52 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 262,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | 341,561.07 |\n| **Total** | **1,934,438.64**929 |\n\nThis amount does not reflect any costs derived from the finalization of the Spanish translation of the Award and/or arising out of the redaction process of the Award, which will be borne by both Parties in equal parts.\n\n822.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.930  \nAs a result, each Party\u2019s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 967,219.32.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n823.\n\nFor the reasons referred to above, the Tribunal:\n\n1. **FINDS that Respondent invoked the essential security interest exception under Article 22.2(b) of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement in accordance with this Treaty and, therefore, said exception applies;**\n2. **DISMISSES Claimants' claims (a) through (d);**\n3. **ORDERS the Parties to bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares;**\n4. **ORDERS each Party to bear its own legal expenses and other costs incurred in this arbitration;**\n5. **DISMISSES all other claims and requests raised by the Parties.**"}]}
