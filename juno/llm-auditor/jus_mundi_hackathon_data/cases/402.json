PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn December 29, 2010, the Claimant served its Notice of Intent to Commence Arbitration.\n\n6.\n\nOn 4 April 2011, the Claimant served its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, which it subsequently amended on August 9, 2011.\n\n7.\n\nBy a communication dated February 5, 2013, the Parties informed ICSID that the Claimant had appointed The Honorable L. Yves Fortier, CC, QC, a Canadian national, as its party-appointed arbitrator and that the Respondent had appointed Mr. Toby T. Landau, QC, a British national, as its party-appointed arbitrator in these proceedings. The Parties further requested the Secretary-General of ICSID to carry out the role of Appointing Authority for the appointment of the Presiding Arbitrator pursuant to Article 10.19.4 of the Treaty and the procedure jointly agreed by the Parties.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated February 6, 2013, the Secretary-General accepted the Parties' request and invited the Parties to provide \"a copy of the Notice of Intent to commence arbitration or other such document.\" On the same date the Centre received a copy of the Claimant's Amended Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated August 9, 2011.\n\n9.\n\nOn April 3, 2013, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that according to the procedure jointly agreed by the Parties, the Parties concurred to the designation of Dr. Michael J. Moser, an Austrian national, as the Presiding Arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nOn April 8, 2013, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that Dr. Michael J. Moser had accepted his appointment.\n\n11.\n\nOn April 23, 2013, ICSID received a request from the Parties to act as Administering Authority in this proceeding.\n\n12.\n\nOn May 8, 2013, the Centre informed the Parties that the reference number of the proceeding would be UNCT/13/1 and invited the Parties to submit copies of any communications that were exchanged between the Parties prior to the appointment of ICSID as the Administering Authority and that should be transmitted to the Tribunal as part of the case record.\n\n13.\n\nOn May 10, 2013, the Claimant informed the Centre that the Parties considered that it was not necessary to provide the Tribunal with any correspondence exchanged between counsel to date and that both Parties reserved their right to produce any such correspondence at a future date.\n\n14.\n\nOn the same date, the Respondent submitted its Response to the Claimant's Amended Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated August 9, 2011.\n\n15.\n\nOn May 13, 2013, the Centre circulated the statements of independence duly signed by the three members of the Tribunal pursuant to Article 11 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n16.\n\nThe first procedural session of the Tribunal and the Parties was held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre (IDRC) in London on July 18, 2013 (the \"First Session\"). Present at the First Session were:\n\nMembers of the Tribunal :\n\nDr. Michael J. Moser, Presiding Arbitrator\n\nThe Honorable Mr. L. Yves Fortier, CC, QC, Arbitrator\n\nMr. Toby T. Landau, QC, Arbitrator\n\nICSID Secretariat :\n\nMs. Natal\u00ed Sequeira, Tribunal Secretary\n\nAssistant to The Honorable Mr. L. Yves Fortier CC, QC :\n\nMs. Annie Lesp\u00e9rance1\n\nAttending on behalf of the Claimant :\n\nMr. Dennis A. Sadlowski, The Renco Group, Inc.\n\nMr. Edward G. Kehoe, King & Spalding LLP Mr. Henry G. Burnett, King & Spalding LLP\n\nAttending on behalf of the Respondent :\n\nMr. Carlos Jos\u00e9 Valderrama, Ministry of Economy and Finance of the Republic of Peru\n\nMr. Jonathan C. Hamilton, White & Case LLP\n\nMs. Andrea J. Menaker, White & Case LLP\n\nMr. Maricarmen Tovar Gil, Estudio Echecopar\n\nMr. Jacob S. Stoehr, White & Case LLP\n\nMr. Alejandro Manrique, Embassy of Peru in the United Kingdom\n\nAttending as an observer.\n\n17.\n\nDuring the First Session the Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that the Parties had no objections to the appointment of any member of the Tribunal. It was agreed, inter alia, that the proceedings are to be conducted in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as revised in 2010, except as modified by Chapter Ten of the Treaty and the provisions of Procedural Order No.1. The Parties further agreed that the procedural languages of the arbitration shall be English and Spanish; that the place of the arbitration shall be Paris, France; and that the location of hearings shall be Washington, D.C., but that the Tribunal may designate alternate locations for hearings (in the Americas, Paris or otherwise) upon further consultation with the Parties. During the First Session, the Parties further agreed on a procedural schedule (\"Procedural Schedule\").\n\n18.\n\nThe agreements of the Parties reached during the First Session were embodied in Procedural Order No. 1, signed by the three Members of the Tribunal and circulated to the Parties on August 22, 2013.\n\n19.\n\nOn February 20, 2014, the Claimant submitted its Memorial on Liability, including Witness Statements and Expert Reports.\n\n20.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, the Respondent submitted a Notice of its intention to make a submission on preliminary objections pursuant to Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty.\n\n21.\n\nOn April 3, 2014, the Claimant filed a submission challenging the scope of the Respondent's preliminary objections.\n\n22.\n\nOn April 8, 2014, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to provide further submissions regarding the scope of Article 10.20.4 by April 23, 2014 and invited the Claimant to reply by May 7, 2014.\n\n23.\n\nOn April 23, 2014, Peru filed a submission on the scope of the preliminary objections.\n\n24.\n\nOn May 7, 2014, the Claimant filed a reply on the scope of the Respondent's Article 10.20.4 Preliminary Objections.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter dated May 27, 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had benefited from the extensive written submissions and appended materials provided by the Parties on the meaning and ambit of Article 10.20.4 and that the Tribunal was comfortable to proceed to deliberations and render a preliminary decision as to the scope of the Respondent's preliminary objections on the basis of the materials as they stood. The Tribunal requested the Parties to confirm whether oral submissions were necessary.\n\n26.\n\nOn the same date the Claimant advised the Tribunal that it did not request any further argument.\n\n27.\n\nOn May 30, 2014, the Respondent indicated that \"[w]hile not calling for a hearing, Peru remains available to address at a hearing or otherwise any issues of particular concern should they be identified by the Tribunal, if of assistance.\"\n\n28.\n\nOn June 6, 2014, the Tribunal noted that as neither Party had requested a hearing to make oral submissions, the Tribunal would \"proceed to deliberations based on the materials in hand.\"\n\n29.\n\nBy letter dated July 8, 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, in accordance with Article 10.20.2, it proposed to invite the Government of the United States of America (the \"USG\"), as a non-disputing Party, to comment on the issues of interpretation in dispute between the Parties in relation to the Article 10.20.4 proceedings, and thereafter to request the Parties to comment on the submissions of the USG. The Tribunal also attached to its letter an article by Bernardo M. Cremades, entitled \" *The Use of Preliminary Objections in ICSID Annulment Proceedings,* \"2 and invited the Parties' comments thereon.\n\nBernardo M. Cremades, \"The Use of Preliminary Objections in ICSID Annulment Proceedings\", Kluwer Arbitration Blog, www.kluwerarbitrationblog.com, September 4, 2013 (\"Cremades Article\").\n\n30.\n\nOn July 31, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 providing that \"[i]n accordance with Article 10.20.2 of the Peru-United States Trade Promotion Agreement (the \"Treaty\") [it considered it] appropriate to invite the Government of the United States of America (the \u2018USG'), as the \u2018non-disputing Party,' to comment on issues of Treaty interpretation in dispute between the Parties in relation to Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty.\"\n\n31.\n\nProcedural Order No. 2 also indicated (i) that the USG shall be invited to indicate, together with its written submission, whether it wished to make oral submissions to the Tribunal; and (ii) that the Parties shall be invited to provide comments on the nondisputing Party submission filed by the USG within three weeks from the date of receipt of said submission.\n\n32.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, on August 5, 2014, the Parties sent a joint letter to the USG inviting it to comment on the interpretation of Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty within twenty-one (21) calendar days, and requesting the USG to confirm whether it wished to make oral submissions.\n\n33.\n\nOn August 21, 2014, the USG requested an extension to file its comments.\n\n34.\n\nOn August 26, 2014, the Tribunal informed the USG and the Parties that it granted the extension requested by the USG for filing its non-disputing Party submission.\n\n35.\n\nOn September 10, 2014, the USG filed a written submission as a non-disputing Party regarding the interpretation of Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty and informing that it did not wish \"to exercise its right to make an oral submission at this time.\"\n\n36.\n\nOn September 30, 2014, the Parties requested the Tribunal to grant an extension for the submission of their comments on the USG's non-disputing Party submission. On October 1, 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it granted the extension.\n\n37.\n\nOn October 3, 2014, the Claimant filed comments on the USG's non-disputing Party submission. The Respondent filed its comments on October 4, 2014. Both submissions were simultaneously circulated by the Centre to the Members of the Tribunal on October 4, 2014. The Respondent filed a revised version of its submission on October 6, 2014.\n\n**III. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal has had the benefit of extensive written submissions by both Parties in this case, as well as on behalf of the USG, a summary of which is set out by the Tribunal in this section. The Parties have however raised a number of ancillary issues and arguments in their written submissions. For the avoidance of doubt, even if not specifically noted in the summary below, all of these issues and arguments have been carefully considered by the Tribunal in reaching its decisions.\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal's own analysis of the issues is reserved to Section IV below.\n\n**B. Peru's Notification of Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nArticle 10.20.4 of the \"Treaty\" provides, inter alia, that:\n\n*Without prejudice to a tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.1.*\n\n41.\n\nBy letter dated March 21, 2014, Peru notified its intention to make three preliminary objections under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty relating to (1) Renco's violation of the Treaty's waiver provisions; (2) the lack of jurisdiction *ratione temporis* ; and (3) the failure of claims under the plain language of the contract. Peru contends that, in each instance, Renco's claims fail as a matter of law.\n\n42.\n\nFor the purposes of making its Article 10.20.4 preliminary objections, Peru states that it assumes Renco's factual allegations to be true, despite considering them inaccurate and incomplete. Peru does however specifically indicate that it does not otherwise accept the truth of any of Renco's allegations and expressly reserves all of its rights.\n\n43.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, even a cursory examination of its three preliminary objections \"confirms that no further factual development or adjudication is needed to decide them as a matter of law\" and that \"they concern threshold issues that may extinguish, or alternatively, narrow or clarify the scope of the claims once decided.\"3\n\nRespondent's Submission commenting on the Submission of the United States of America, submitted on October 4, 2014 (as amended) (the \"Respondent's Submission, October 4, 2014 (as amended)\"), at \u00b6 28.\n\n44.\n\nThe bases of each of Peru's preliminary objections under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty are set out below.\n\n**(1) Violation of the Treaty's Waiver Provisions**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nIt is Peru's position that, according to the Treaty, its consent to arbitrate, and therefore the Tribunal's jurisdiction, is subject to the submission of valid waivers, as set forth in Article 10.18 of the Treaty.4\n\n\"No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless [...] the notice of arbitration is accompanied for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), by the claimant's written waiver, and for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(b), by the claimant's and the enterprise's written waivers of any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.\" Article 10.18 of the Treaty.\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the submission of such valid waivers has not taken place as (i) Renco presented an invalid waiver which does not conform with the language required by the Treaty, and (ii) Doe Run Peru S.R. Ltda. (\"Doe Run Peru\"), which was also required to submit a waiver, improperly purported to withdraw the waiver submitted with the Claimants' Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim of April 4, 2011.\n\n47.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that both Renco and Doe Run Peru have violated the waiver requirement through their initiation and continuation of certain proceedings with respect to measures alleged to constitute a breach by Renco.\n\n**(2) Lack of Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Temporis***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over certain claims made in this arbitration for three reasons.\n\n49.\n\nFirst, Renco has submitted claims that arose before the entry into force of the Treaty in 2009.\n\n50.\n\nSecond, Renco has submitted claims based on facts that pre-date the entry into force of the Treaty.\n\n51.\n\nThird, Renco has submitted claims relating to alleged breaches that occurred more than three years after Renco first acquired knowledge, or should have first acquired knowledge, of the alleged breach.\n\n**(3) Failure of Claims under the Plain Language of the Contract**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nIt is Peru's position that, even assuming that the facts alleged by Renco are true, as a matter of law, Peru could not have breached the Stock Transfer Agreement (the \"Contract\").\n\n53.\n\nAccording to Peru, it is Renco's case that \"Peru's refusal to assume liability for the claims in the St. Louis Lawsuits violates the Treaty because it breaches the Guarantee Agreement and the Contract, which together constitute an Investment Agreement.\"5 Further, Renco argues, the Guarantee Agreement makes Peru liable for the contractual obligations undertaken by Centromin in the Contract.\n\nClaimant's Memorial \u00a7 IV(A)-(B). 1. Renco describes the St. Louis Lawsuits as follows: \"Plaintiffs seek damages for alleged personal injuries and punitive damages, and name as defendants Renco and Doe Run Resources, as well as their affiliated companies DR Acquisition Corp. and Renco Holdings, Inc., and directors and officers Marvin K. Kaiser, Albert Bruce Neil, Jeffery L. Zelms, Theodore P. Fox III, Daniel L. Vornberg, and Ira L. Rennert (collectively, the \u2018Renco Defendants'). The plaintiffs did not bring claims against Centromin's successor, Activos Mineros, nor against the Republic of Peru, or Doe Run Peru, and instead chose to sue Doe Run Peru's U.S.-based affiliates in the courts of the United States.\" Claimant's Memorial at \u00b6 78.\n\n54.\n\nIt is Peru's case that the plain language of Clauses 6.5 and 8.14 of the Contract concern third-party claims relating to Doe Run Peru, the entity referred to in those clauses. However, because Doe Run Peru is not a party to the St. Louis Lawsuits, even assuming that the facts alleged by Renco are true, Peru, as a matter of law, could not have breached the Contract.\n\n55.\n\nPeru further contends that given that neither Renco nor Doe Run Peru has followed the procedure mandated by the Contract for the referral of matters to decision by a technical expert, as a matter of law, Peru cannot be deemed to have breached any contractual obligation with respect to the St. Louis Lawsuits.\n\n56.\n\nIn this respect Peru relies on Clauses 5.3 and 5.4 of the Contract which provide that \"any controversy on the determination of whether. the standards or practices used by the Company were or were not less protective of the environment or of the public health than those that were applied by Centromin\", or \"in those cases in which no consensus was reached between Centromin and the Company with regard to the causes of the presumed damage that is the subject of the claim or with regard to the manner in which liability will be shared amongst them.\", the matter is to be submitted to the decision of a technical expert.\n\n**C. Peru's Position Regarding its Entitlement to Notify Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nIn its letter dated March 21, 2014, notifying three preliminary objections under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty, and in its further observations on the scope of those preliminary objections (including a letter from Professor W. Michael Reisman to Mr. Jonathan Hamilton)6 Peru outlined its position regarding its entitlement to notify and the permissible scope of preliminary objections under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty.\n\nLetter from Professor W. Michael Reisman to Mr. Jonathan Hamilton dated April 22, 2014, Annex A to Respondent's Submission of April 23, 2014 (\"Professor Reisman's Letter\").\n\n58.\n\nPeru further supplemented this position when it filed its comments on the Submission of the USG regarding the interpretation of Article 10.20.4 on October 4, 2014 and in the subsequently filed revised version on October 6, 2014. The Respondent's comments on the submission of the USG were accompanied by a letter from Mr. Carlos Herrera Perret, Executive Director of PROINVERSI\u00d3N, Peru's Private Investment Promotion Agency.7\n\nLetter from Mr. Carlos Herrera Perret, Executive Director of PROINVERSI\u00d3N, Peru's Private Investment Promotion Agency (\"Herrera Letter\").\n\n**(1) The Treaty Provides a Procedure for Preliminary Objections**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nIt is the Respondent's case that Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty was designed to provide respondent States with a mechanism to avoid the time and expense of an evidentiary phase if the claims presented would fail as a matter of law.\n\n60.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, pursuant to the Vienna Convention, Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty must be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.\"8\n\nArticle 31(1) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n61.\n\nOn its case, which in its view is supported by the Submission of the USG as a nondisputing Party, the object and purpose of Article 10.20.4 is to provide a respondent State the means to efficiently and quickly dispose of, or curtail, at an early stage in the proceedings claims that cannot prevail as a matter of law - and thus avoid unnecessary burden in terms of time and cost.9\n\nThe Respondent states that the origins of the provision may be traced back to the NAFTA case *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, (\" *Methanex Corp. v USA* \" or \" *Methanex* \"), where the United States argued at an early stage that the claims were inadmissible because the claims were without legal merit. The tribunal ruled that it could not address this issue in a preliminary phase and eventually, after years of costly proceedings, the tribunal determined that it did not have jurisdiction and the claims had no legal merit. The United States began incorporating language similar to Article 10.20.4 in free trade agreements in 2002-2003, and in its Model Bilateral Investment Treaty in 2004. *See*, *e.g.*, US-Singapore FTA, June 26, 2002, Article 15.19.4; US-Chile FTA, June 6, 2003, Article 10.19.4; U.S. 2004 Model BIT, Article 28.4.\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent also relies on the Submission of the USG and the letter of Mr. Carlos Herrera submitted therewith as confirmation of the critical function of preliminary objections in the provision of such mechanism for the efficient disposal of claims. It states that, by tracing back the preliminary objections provision in the Treaty (and in other investment treaties to which the USG is a party), the USG's submission highlights the importance of preliminary treaty mechanisms for the prompt and efficient resolution of claims and demonstrates that both the United States and Peru had had experiences that motivated them to provide procedures in their treaties to ensure that preliminary objections would be heard at an early phase of the proceedings.\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the argument that Article 10.20.4 should be considered to be an equivalent of a preliminary motion under U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on the basis that the text and negotiating history of the Treaty demonstrate that Article 10.20.4 is not limited to \"frivolous\" claims, and instead does contemplate competence objections. In support of this argument, the Respondent cites the *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* case.10\n\nThere is \"no reason to equate such common law court procedures to provisions in [the Treaty] agreed by Contracting Parties with different legal traditions and national court procedures.\" *Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. The Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12 (\" *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* \" or \" *Pac Rim* \"), Decision on the Respondent's Preliminary Objections under CAFTA Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 of August 2, 2010 (\" *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections\") at \u00b6 117.\n\n64.\n\nThus, according to the Respondent, consistent with the principles of treaty interpretation, Article 10.20.4 broadly establishes Peru's right to make \" ***any*** objection\" as a preliminary matter, provided it meets two basic conditions:\n\n(1) the objection provides a basis for dismissal of a claim as a matter of law, such that no award in favor Renco could be made on that claim; and\n\n(2) the objection assumes the facts as alleged by Renco to be true, or otherwise involves facts not in dispute, per Article 10.20.4(c).\n\n65.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, its conclusion that a respondent may raise competence objections under Article 10.20.4 and that such objections can be decided as a preliminary question, is supported by (1) the use of the word \"competence\" in Article 10.20.4; (2) certain documents from Peruvian negotiators of the Treaty which demonstrate that both the United States of America and Peru intended that the Article 10.20.4 procedure must include competence objections,11 and (3) the opinion of Professor Reisman.12 In relation to its second point, Peru argues that no evidence has been introduced by Renco or otherwise, to counter the contemporaneous documents provided by Peru.\n\nPeru's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism (\"MINCETUR\"), 6th Round of Negotiations in Tucson, Arizona, United States, November 29 - December 5, 2004 (unofficial translation)(\"Unofficial Translation of the MINCETUR 6th Round Negotiations\"); MINCETUR, 7th Round of Negotiations in Cartagena, Colombia, February 7-11, 2005 (unofficial translation) (\"Unofficial Translation of the MINCETUR 7th Round Negotiations\") and MINCETUR, 8th Round of Negotiations in Washington, United States, March 14-18, 2005 (unofficial translation) (\"Unofficial Translation of the MINCETUR 8th Round Negotiations\"). For Peru's argument that the negotiating history makes clear that the Treaty includes express reference to \"competence\" objections in Article 10.20.4 *see* Respondent's Submission, April 23, 2014, at \u00b6\u00b6 6-23; Letter from Peru to the Tribunal, July 29, 2013, at 2-4; Professor Reisman's Letter, Note 6 at 4-5. In this respect, in the Respondent's Submission, October 4, 2014 (as amended) at 5-6, Peru takes issue with the USG's non-disputing Party submission on the basis that, while it links the experience of the United States in the *Methanex* case to the negotiation of subsequent investment agreements, the USG failed to address the negotiations that gave rise to the Treaty relevant in this case and, in particular, Article 10.20.4 thereof. *See Methanex Corp. v. USA*, Note 9.\n\nProfessor Reisman's Letter, Note 6.\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's reliance on the first phrase of Article 10.20.413 to exclude competence objections from its scope. For the Respondent, the \"without prejudice\" language simply confirms that a tribunal may address other objections, such as competence objections, in a separate phase prior to the merits. Thus, Article 10.20.4 objections are \"without prejudice\" to such \"authority.\" Peru states that it relied on this right in choosing to forego the possibility of bifurcation with respect to issues of competence later in the proceeding.\n\nThis first sentence states that objections are \"[w] *ithout prejudice* to a tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence,\" Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty. [emphasis added].\n\n67.\n\nAlthough the USG also suggests that Article 10.20.4 provides \"a further ground for dismissal\", separate and apart from objections to a tribunal's competence,14 according to the Respondent, (1) this is not supported by the text of the Treaty or the negotiating history and (2) the decision on the scope of preliminary objections rests solely with the Tribunal.\n\nUSG's Submission, September 10, 2014, at \u00b6 6.\n\n68.\n\nIn relation to the first point the Respondent argues that if competence objections were excluded from Article 10.20.4, the Treaty would not offer a solution to the issue that arose in *Methanex*15 - which all parties agree, the preliminary objections mechanism in Article 10.20.4 was intended to do.16\n\n*See Methanex Corp. v. USA*, Note 9.\n\nIt is the USG's position - and the Respondent agrees - that it was this ruling that prompted the United States to include the preliminary objections mechanism in Article 10.20.4 in subsequent treaties. According to the Respondent, if \"competence\" objections were excluded from Article 10.20.4, this objective - on which both State Parties to the Treaty agree - would not be met. The Respondent argues that this is because competence is generally understood to include concepts including both jurisdiction and admissibility. Indeed, competence and admissibility have been described as \"two sides of one and the same conceptual coin.\" *See* Respondent's Submission, October 4, 2014 (as amended), at \u00b6 20 n. 42, citing Veijo Heiskanen, *M\u00e9nage A Trois? Jurisdiction, Admissibility and Competence In Investment Treaty Arbitration*, ICSID Review (2013), at 13.\n\n69.\n\nIn relation to the second point the Respondent highlights Article 10.20.2 of the Treaty which provides that a non-disputing Party submission may address matters of Treaty interpretation, but is not intended to \"go beyond interpretation and become a fact specific exercise.\" Thus, numerous tribunals have considered submissions by nondisputing Parties, and reached different conclusions with respect to matters of Treaty interpretation.17 It is the Respondent's position that the Tribunal should do the same here.\n\nRespondent's Submission, October 4, 2014 (as amended), at \u00b6 35, citing *GAMI Investments, Inc. v. Government of the United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Final Award of November 15, 2004, at \u00b6\u00b6 29-30; *The Loewen Group,* *Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Decision on Jurisdiction of January 5, 2001, at \u00b6 52; *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Interim Decision on Preliminary Jurisdictional Issues of December 6, 2000, at \u00b6 44.\n\n70.\n\nFurther, the Respondent argues that if all competence objections were excluded from the scope of Article 10.20.4, as Renco contends, it would be superfluous for the Treaty to provide, as it does in sub-paragraph (d) of Article 10.20.4, that a \"respondent does not waive any objection as to competence. merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph.\" The Respondent relies on Professor Reisman's Letter to support its position in this respect.18 According to the Respondent the purpose of this language is to ensure that, whether or not a respondent raises competence objections pursuant to Article 10.20.4 (when it may not rely on disputed facts), it may still raise them later in the proceeding (including when factual issues are in dispute).\n\nProfessor Reisman's Letter, Note 6.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent argues that if a tribunal lacks jurisdiction over a claim or if a claim is inadmissible, then, *as a matter of law*, it is not a claim for which an award in favor the claimant may be made as provided for in Article 10.20.4.\n\n72.\n\nFinally, according to the Respondent, when looked at in the context of other Treaty provisions, the broad scope of permissible objections under Article 10.20.4 is confirmed. In the Respondent's view, Article 10.20.5 offers a respondent the choice to pursue an expedited procedure for Article 10.20.4 objections so as to seek faster resolution of preliminary objections, but it does not curtail the scope of available objections as provided under other provisions. Not only would this view be contrary to the object and purpose of the right to make preliminary objections if the scope of objections for Article 10.20.5's expedited procedure is broader than that of Article 10.20.4, which does not contain a fast-track procedure, it would also raise serious issues of interpretation and practical problems. In particular, the Respondent asserts that if the Article 10.20.5 procedure is not limited to accepting the facts as stated in the Notice of Arbitration, the expedited procedure would include objections to competence that also involved disputes about facts which would hardly be consistent with an expedited procedure. Additionally, this interpretation would compel a respondent to always rely on the expedited procedure for objections as to competence, as this would be its only opportunity to do so.\n\n73.\n\nThus, it is the Respondent's case that, by its own terms, the scope of the Treaty is clear:\n\n\u25a0 It grants Peru the right to make any objection under Article 10.20.4, including jurisdictional and other objections;\n\n\u25a0 Article 10.20.4 is drafted in mandatory terms and these objections *shall* be decided as a preliminary matter; and\n\n\u25a0 In determining Peru's objections, facts alleged by Renco in support of claims in its notice of arbitration, as amended, and statement of claim are presumed to be true.\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent claims that, as long as an objection, including any jurisdictional objection, assumes the facts as pleaded by a claimant (without the need to consider or weigh disputed evidence) thus providing a basis for outright dismissal as a matter of law, the objection should be considered as properly within the scope of Article 10.20.4.\n\n**(2) Investment Treaty Jurisprudence Confirms that Peru's Objections are within the Scope of Article 10.20.4**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent notes that while this is the first investment arbitration brought under the Treaty, Article 10.20.4 is analogous to the preliminary objection provision contained in the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (\"DR-CAFTA\") which has been considered by at least three arbitral tribunals, each of which has confirmed that the proper scope of Article 10.20.4 does encompasses competence objections - including, the type of objections that Peru has raised in this case.19\n\n*See Pac Rim v.

All available at icsid.worldbank.org. The Respondent also relies on the review of ICSID annulment decisions in the Cremades Article, to support its interpretation of the scope of preliminary objections available under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty, as, according to the Respondent, in that article Mr. Cremades concludes that patently unmeritorious claims warranting early dismissal include claims where the tribunal lacks competence. *See* the Cremades Article, Note 2.\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to the 2006 modification to the ICSID Arbitration Rules which added a preliminary objections phase under Rule 41(5), providing that \"a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit.\" The Respondent notes that Rule 41(5) also provides that the preliminary objections are without prejudice to other jurisdictional objections or merits arguments that a party may raise later in the proceeding.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that this provision is roughly analogous to the standard applicable under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty and notes that a number of ICSID tribunals have ruled that the language of Rule 41(5) encompasses objections as to both jurisdiction and merits.20\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Brandes Investment Partners, LP v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/3.\n\n78.\n\nFinally the Respondent argues that, beyond the text of the Treaty itself, the DR-CAFTA and ICSID precedents construing the meaning of \"manifestly without legal merit\" further confirm that the Claimant's interpretation of Article 10.20.4 is unfounded as tribunals have refused to limit preliminary objections to \"frivolous\" claims or \"failure to state a claim\" type objections.\n\n**(3) Peru's Exercise of Its Treaty Rights Cannot be Circumscribed**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nIt is also the Respondent's case that the Procedural Schedule adopted by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 1 established an organized procedure for Peru's Article 10.20.4 objections, duly reflecting the procedural concerns and due process rights of both Parties. The Respondent considers that to modify such structure would curtail Peru's Treaty rights in plain violation of those rights and the process already implemented to protect both Parties' rights.\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimant has raised several procedural concerns with respect to the Respondent's right to submit Article 10.20.4 objections. In particular, the Claimant has stated that (1) there is \"a very short period of time to deal with jurisdictional issues\" in this Phase; and (2) Peru may \"receive two bites at the apple on the issue of the Tribunal's competence, with no risk of loss at the preliminary stage.\" In reply, the Respondent states as follows.\n\n81.\n\nFirst, the Respondent states that, given the discrete nature of the objections that it has raised, all of its preliminary objections can be addressed within the timeframe fixed for the Article 10.20.4 Phase as provided in Procedural Order No. 1. The Respondent further notes that the Claimant's concern as to the time periods has already been addressed in the Procedural Schedule, which includes a mechanism for scheduling adjustments, should they be required.\n\n82.\n\nSecond, the Respondent points out that the Claimant chose to pursue its claims under the Treaty, and it cannot now unilaterally circumscribe the rights that the Treaty affords the Respondent. The so-called \"two bites at the apple\" is a mechanism expressly provided under the Treaty as part of the protections offered to respondent States. If any claims remain after the preliminary objections phase, Peru may raise, together, any competence and merits defenses that turn on disputed factual issues. Thus, the Respondent contends that there would be no \"two bites at the apple\" for the competence issues decided under Article 10.20.4.\n\n**(4) The Non-Disputing Party Submission of the USG Underscores that the Tribunal Can, and Should, Decide All Preliminary Objections at this Juncture**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent submits that even if its preliminary objections do not fall within the mandatory scope of Article 10.20.4, the objections still can and should be decided at this point of the proceedings to safeguard due process and to ensure efficiency.\n\n84.\n\nRespondent points to the non-disputing Party Submission of the USG and, in particular, the statement made therein that \"reasons of economy and efficiency will often weigh in favor of competence objections being decided preliminarily and at the same time as objections made under paragraph 4\",21 to suggest that Article 10.20.4 supplements, rather than displaces or limits, the Tribunal's authority to decide preliminary objections. Thus, according to the Respondent and, on its submission, as supported by the USG, the Tribunal retains the authority to decide competence objections as a preliminary matter, whether or not they fall within the scope of mandatory objections under Article 10.20.4.\n\nUSG's Submission, September 10, 2014, at \u00b6 11.\n\n85.\n\nIn light of this, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal determine all of its preliminary objections under the authority granted to it by Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty or, alternatively, pursuant to Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. It is Peru's case that reasons of economy and efficiency favor hearing all of its objections during the preliminary phase, as determining these objections now may serve to resolve certain claims outright or to clarify the scope of issues to be decided at a later stage.\n\n**(5) Request for Relief**\n--------------------------\n\n86.\n\nPeru requests that the Tribunal rule that the case should proceed to a full briefing of each of its preliminary objections pursuant to the Treaty.\n\n**D. Renco's Submissions Challenging the Scope of Peru's Preliminary Objections**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nOn April 3, 2014, the Claimant submitted a letter challenging the scope of the Respondent's preliminary objections raised in Peru's letter dated March 21, 2014. On May 7, 2014, the Claimant submitted its Reply on the Scope of the Respondent's Preliminary Objections.\n\n88.\n\nThe Claimant further supplemented its position when it filed its comments on the Submission of the USG regarding the interpretation of Article 10.20.4 on October 3, 2014 and the accompanying letter to the Tribunal from Mr. Bernardo Cremades, submitted by the Claimant in response to the Tribunal's invitation of July 8, 2014.22\n\nLetter to the Tribunal from Mr. Bernardo M. Cremades dated September 16, 2014 (\"Cremades Letter\").\n\n89.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent's submissions comprise the following six preliminary objections (1) presentation of an invalid waiver; (2) violation of the waiver; (3) lack of jurisdiction *ratione temporis* ; (4) violation of the Treaty's three-year limitation period; (5) failure to state a claim for breach of the investment agreement; and (6) failure to submit two factual issues for determination by a technical expert prior to commencement of the arbitration.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimant characterizes objections (1) through (4) as relating to the Tribunal's competence, or jurisdiction over the dispute, while it characterizes objections (5) and (6) as objections for \"failure of claims under the plain language of the Contract.\" However, it is the Claimant's position that Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty does not give the Respondent the right to bring objections (1) through (4) and (6) as preliminary objections.\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimant argues that by reading Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 together, rather than in isolation, as the Respondent chooses to, it is clear that the preliminary objections that a respondent may bring for failure to state a viable legal claim are different from preliminary objections that a respondent may raise as to the competence of the tribunal, and that these types of preliminary questions are to be treated differently.\n\n92.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, there is a significant difference between objecting to the viability of a claim as a matter of law (assuming all facts asserted by a claimant to be true), and objecting to a tribunal's competence to hear and decide a claim. The question under Article 10.20.4 is whether the facts as alleged by the Claimant are capable of constituting a breach of a legal right protected by the Treaty, whereas an objection to the Tribunal's competence is concerned with the question whether the Tribunal is competent to hear the claim, irrespective of the claim's legal merit. It is the Claimant's position that preliminary objections as to the Tribunal's competence must therefore be brought under Article 10.20.5, not Article 10.20.4.\n\n93.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, to allow the Respondent to bring preliminary objections as to the Tribunal's alleged lack of competence under Article 10.20.4 would be inconsistent with the terms of the Treaty, would prejudice the Claimant unfairly, and the Respondent's attempt to improperly \"shoehorn\" what the Respondent itself describes as jurisdictional objections into an Article 10.20.4 application, would effectively allow it to receive \"two bites at the apple on the issue of the Tribunal's competence, with no risk of loss at the preliminary stage.\"\n\n94.\n\nFurther, the Claimant argues that, if the Respondent truly wished to receive a preliminary decision on issues of the Tribunal's competence, the Respondent should have brought a timely application under Article 10.20.5, and the Tribunal could then have decided the disputed legal and factual issues. However, the Claimant notes the Respondent chose not to pursue that course.\n\n95.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the question now before the Tribunal is whether Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty requires the Tribunal to entertain, at this preliminary stage, the five competence objections that the Respondent has raised as preliminary objections. This is clear from the Procedural Order No. 1 and it is common ground between the Parties. The question is not whether the Tribunal has the discretion to hear competence objections as a preliminary matter outside the mandatory scope of Article 10.20.4.\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Parties have agreed, and the Tribunal has endorsed through Procedural Order No. 1 that, to the extent one or more of the Respondent's proposed Article 10.20.4 objections fall outside the mandatory scope of Article 10.20.4, the Tribunal will not hear such objection(s) in this preliminary phase. Instead, the Respondent, should it wish to bring objections outside the scope of Article 10.20.4, would have to pursue them later in these proceedings pursuant to the schedule established by Annex A of Procedural Order No. 1. The Claimant states that it would not have agreed to the Procedural Schedule adopted in Procedural Order No. 1 if the Respondent were to be permitted to bring preliminary objections outside the mandatory scope of Article 10.20.4, during the 10.20.4 Phase of the proceedings.\n\n97.\n\nTherefore, for the reasons set out below, in Claimant's view, objections (1) through (4) and (6) fall outside the scope of the Article 10.20.4 Phase established in Procedural Order No. 1 and objection (5) is the only \"proper objection\" under Article 10.20.4.\n\n98.\n\nThe Claimant supports its view with the following arguments.\n\n**(1) The Respondent's Interpretation of Article 10.20.4 Lacks Any Merit**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe Claimant states that Article 10.20.4 does not authorize the Respondent to raise \"any\" objection as a preliminary question. Rather, it only allows the Respondent to raise as a preliminary question \"any objection... that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.\" [Emphasis added] The Claimant points out that, according to the Respondent's interpretation, the underlined language would be superfluous. It is the Claimant's case that the Respondent's reading of Article 10.20.4 thus violates the *effet utile* principle and must be rejected by the Tribunal.\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the Respondent would not waive its jurisdictional objections under the Treaty by bringing an Article 10.20.4 objection. According to the Claimant, the clarifying language in paragraph (d)23 avoids that potential confusion, and it in no way converts a preliminary objection for failure to state a claim into a preliminary objection to competence, as it is alleged by the Respondent.\n\nArticle 10.20.4(d) of the Treaty states that: \"The respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph.\"\n\n**(a) Peru Dismisses as Irrelevant Critical Text of the Treaty, Thereby Confusing the Mandatory Aspects of Article 10.20.4 with the Tribunal's Discretionary Authority to Decide Competence Objections as Preliminary Questions**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimant claims that the fundamental flaw in the Respondent's analysis is to allege that the text of Article 10.20.4 treats objections to a tribunal's competence to hear a dispute *differently* than objections as to the legal sufficiency of claims.\n\n102.\n\nAccording to the Claimant's reading, Article 10.20.5 requires a tribunal to decide an objection to its competence on an expedited basis if the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted. If a tribunal's competence is not challenged under Article 10.20.5 in this way, a tribunal thereafter *may*, but is *not required* to decide competence objections as a preliminary question, but not as part of a 10.20.4 proceeding.\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimant further states that a tribunal's discretionary authority to decide competence objections, either as a preliminary question, or later in the Procedural Schedule, derives in this case from Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules. This Article provides that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal may rule on a plea referred to in paragraph 2 [objecting to the tribunal's jurisdiction] either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits.\"\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent errs by not distinguishing between the Tribunal's authority to decide competence as a preliminary question in its discretion under, for example, Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, and the limited scope of objections that the Tribunal is compelled by Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty to decide as a preliminary question.\n\n**(b) The Text and Context of Article 10.20.4**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nFor the Claimant it is clear that when Article 10.20.4 refers to \"an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence\" as an \"other\" objection, it means that a competence objection is not included within, and is not the same as, \"an objection that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.\"\n\n106.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent pretends that the Treaty makes no distinction between an objection to a tribunal's competence to hear a dispute and objections for failure to state a viable legal claim upon which an ultimate award may be rendered under Treaty Article 10.26.\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimant suggests that the USG, in its non-disputing Party Submission, followed the same approach as the Claimant with respect to the interpretation of Article 10.20.4. In particular, the Claimant points to the USG's approval of the proposition that the second clause of Article 10.20.4 should be read together, both with Article 10.20.5 and with the \"without prejudice\" clause of Article 10.20.4, which refers to an \"objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence,\" as an \"other\" objection.24 According to the Claimant, the USG's position is in agreement with the Claimant's to the effect that an objection to the tribunal's competence \"fall[s] outside [the] scope\"25 of Article 10.20.4.\n\nUSG's Submission, September 10, 2014, at \u00b6 6 n.4.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimant further states that the language of Article 10.20.4 makes it clear that the Treaty is not divesting a tribunal of its discretionary \"authority\" to address \"other\" objections (such as objections to a tribunal's competence over a dispute) either as a preliminary question, or later in the process such as during the merits phase, as Article 23 of the UNCITRAL Rules allows, but that they should not be addressed under Article 10.20.4.\n\n109.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that if one accepts that Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty does treat objections to competence and objections for failure to state a viable legal claim differently, the Tribunal cannot have the \"discretionary authority\" to either address competence objections as a preliminary question, or defer the question until later (as Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides and the first clause of Article 10.20.4 recognizes), while concurrently being \"required\" by the second clause Article 10.20.4 to address competence objections as a preliminary question.\n\n110.\n\nThe Claimant notes that an objection to a tribunal's competence to decide a dispute is fundamentally different than an objection for failure to state a viable legal claim - and Article 10.20.4 \"requires\" only that a tribunal decide the latter type of objection as a preliminary question.\n\n111.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Article 10.20.4 only constrains the Tribunal's authority in that it requires the Tribunal to address, as a preliminary question, any objection that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26. Because objections to a tribunal's competence are different, Article 10.20.4 does not require the Tribunal to address and decide an objection to the Tribunal's competence under Article 10.20.4.26 Thus, according to the Claimant, the Respondent may bring any competence objections in the merits phase of the case, as reflected in the Procedural Schedule.\n\nThe Claimant also relies on the USG's statement at \u00b6 9 of its non-disputing Party submission where the US states that the \"evidentiary standard\" set forth in Article 10.20.4(c) \"facilitates an efficient and expeditious process for eliminating claims that lack legal merit\", and that the sub-paragraph \"does not address, and does not govern, other objections, such as an objection to competence, which the tribunal may already have authority to consider\" in support of its argument.\n\n112.\n\nThe Claimant also considers that the Respondent's criticism with respect to the Claimant's reliance on jurisprudence from the United States is not well founded. In this respect the Claimant asserts that Article 10.20.4 was inspired by and based upon the \"motion to dismiss\" procedure of Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and that it is common ground between the Parties that Article 10.20.4 \"is similar to the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"\n\n113.\n\nThe Claimant recalls that during the First Session in London, it expressed its consent to a schedule by which the Tribunal could decide on \"jurisdiction and failure to state a claim\" at the same time on the same schedule that the Tribunal also would be deciding any claim objections under Article 10.20.4. However, according to the Claimant, in this scenario the Respondent's two types of objections would have proceeded under two entirely different legal bases. The competence objections would have proceeded as a preliminary question under the Tribunal's discretionary authority (*e.g.*, Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules), and the claim objections would have proceeded (during the same timeframe) pursuant to Article 10.20.4, which \"requires\" the Tribunal to decide claim objections as a preliminary question.\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the distinction is quite meaningful, because the Respondent's efforts to \"shoehorn\" only some of its competence objections into an Article 10.20.4 application would ensure that the Respondent cannot lose the application (because all facts are assumed to be true under 10.20.4). It would also guarantee that the Respondent would have two opportunities to bring its competence objections, first it could bring the claims improperly under 10.20.4 and then again later with the merits.\n\n115.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, during the First Session the Respondent rejected its invitation to have the Tribunal decide all competence objections as a preliminary question. Instead, the Parties agreed (as reflected in the Procedural Schedule attached to Procedural Order No. 1), that the Tribunal would address competence objections during the merits phase, except, and only to the extent that, the Treaty requires the Tribunal to decide on its competence as a preliminary question under Article 10.20.4. The Claimant contends that because Article 10.20.4 does not require the Tribunal to decide competence as a preliminary question, all of the Respondent's competence objections should be addressed in the merits phase.\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimant further states that when, at the First Session and in correspondence, it acknowledged that jurisdictional objections could be brought with a 10.20.4 application, it was referring to the schedule that the Parties and the Tribunal were discussing and not to the substantive right of Peru to bring these objections under Article 10.20.4, which the Claimant has rejected from the outset.\n\n**(c) The Text and Context of Article 10.20.5**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe Claimant also relies on the first sentence of Article 10.20.5 which provides that \"an objection under paragraph 4 *and* any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence\" [emphasis added]. This is an additional confirmation that an objection under Article 10.20.4 regarding the substantive viability of a legal claim is different than an objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence.\n\n118.\n\nThe Claimant explains that its argument is not that Article 10.20.5 somehow \"limits\" the Respondent's rights under Article 10.20.4 or that it \"curtails\" the scope of the objections that a respondent may raise under the Treaty. Rather, the Claimant contends that the language of Article 10.20.5 provides additional evidence that the Respondent simply does not have the right to bring a competence objection under Article 10.20.4.\n\n119.\n\nArticle 10.20.5 provides that a tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence in the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted. Thus, according to the Claimant's interpretation, if a respondent seeks expedited resolution of a claim objection that arises substantively under Article 10.20.4, the respondent may bring the objection under the expedited procedure provided for in Article 10.20.5. In such case, all facts will be assumed to be true pursuant to Article 10.20.4(c). However, if a respondent brings a competence objection under Article 10.20.5, the facts are not assumed to be true because Article 10.20.4 is not applicable in that scenario and Article 10.20.5 does not provide so.\n\n120.\n\nIn addressing the arguments raised by Professor Reisman that, if objections to competence are not included in paragraph 4 of Article 10.20, the expedited procedure (pursuant to paragraph 5) would perforce include objections involving disputed facts \"which would hardly lend themselves to an expedited procedure\",27 the Claimant points to the possibility that a tribunal may resolve simple factual issues in an Article 10.20.5 proceeding, while deferring complex factual disputes until a later phase of the proceeding. Moreover, according to the Claimant, a tribunal could decide competence objections under Article 10.20.5 and still exercise its authority pursuant to Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules to determine competence as a preliminary question.\n\nProfessor Reisman's Letter, Note 6, at 6.\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimant also takes issue with Professor Reisman's opinion that Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 \"would compel a respondent to always use the expedited procedure for any objection to competence, as this would be its only opportunity to do so.\"28 The Claimant argues that this view is incorrect, and that the expedited procedure under Article 10.20.5 is not in fact the Respondent's \"only opportunity\" to raise competence objections as a preliminary question, as a respondent could make an application to a tribunal to hear any and all competence objections as a preliminary question under Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules.29\n\n*Ibid*\n\nThe Claimant requests the Tribunal, when weighing the probative value of Professor Reisman's Letter, to treat the opinion as a submission by the Respondent itself, and not as an independent \"expert opinion.\" The Claimant does not seek to strike Professor Reisman's opinion, but it requests that it be given weight equal to that of the arguments advanced by the Respondent itself. *See* the Claimant's Submission, May 7, 2014, at 5.\n\n122.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that while in a claim objection brought by a respondent under Article 10.20.4, all facts are assumed to be true, the same does not apply to competence objections that a respondent brings under Article 10.20.5. The text supporting this position is Article 10.20.4(c) which provides that in deciding an objection under Article 10.20.4, the tribunal shall assume to be true the claimant's factual allegations. No equivalent text appears with respect to Article 10.20.5.\n\n**(d) The No Waiver Provision in Article 10.20.4(d)**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nArticle 10.20.4(d) of the Treaty provides that \"[t]he respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 5.\"\n\n124.\n\nFor the Claimant, the reason for this \"without prejudice\" language, heavily relied on by the Respondent, is easily understood when one recognizes the similarities between Article 10.20.4 and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n125.\n\nThe Claimant explains that if a defendant in a United States federal court litigation chooses to bring a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss a claim for its alleged legal insufficiency, the defendant also must simultaneously bring a motion objecting to the court's jurisdiction, and failure to do so will result in a waiver of such jurisdictional objections. Thus, the Claimant contends that the language in Article 10.20.4(d) was included to confirm that there will be no similar waiver under the Treaty, notwithstanding its similarity to Rule 12(b)(6).\n\n**(2) The Cases the Respondent Cites Do Not Support the Respondent's Argument**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nWhile the Claimant agrees with the Respondent that the language in Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty is nearly identical to Article 10.20.4 of the DR-CAFTA, the Claimant does not agree that the three tribunals that have dealt with this provision (*Pac Rim v. El Salvador,*30*Commerce Group v. El Salvador*31 and *RDC v. Guatemala*32), support the Respondent's position. Nor, on the Claimant's case, do prior tribunals' interpretations of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) have any relevance for the purpose of interpreting Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty.\n\n*See Pac Rim v. El Salvador* Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, Note 10.\n\n*See Commerce Group v. El Salvador* Award, Note 19.\n\n*See RDC v. Guatemala*, Note 19.\n\n127.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* and *Commerce Group v. El Salvador* cases support the Claimant's interpretation of the Treaty, and not the Respondent's, while the tribunal in *RDC v. Guatemala* \"clearly misapplied\" Article 10.20.4 of the DR-CAFTA treaty by considering competence objections under Article 10.20.4 and reviewing and adjudicating disputed facts, meaning the decision in that case should not be given any weight in these proceedings.\n\n128.\n\nFor the Claimant, the central distinction between the *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* and *Commerce Group v. El Salvador* cases and these proceedings is that the respondents in those cases brought preliminary objections to the tribunal's competence under Article 10.20.5. The Respondent has not done that here and the Claimant considers it \"unlikely\" that the Respondent's decision to proceed only under Article 10.20.4, foregoing Article 10.20.5 altogether, was an oversight.\n\n129.\n\nFirst, counsel for the Claimant repeatedly objected to the Respondent's proposal to reach an \"agreement\" that it would bring jurisdictional objections under Article 10.20.4, noting that the Treaty did not allow it.\n\n130.\n\nSecond, counsel for the Respondent referred to the DR-CAFTA cases prior to the First Session in London, and in its subsequent letter dated March 21, 2014, and, as mentioned above, all of these cases involved Article 10.20.5.\n\n131.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* tribunal's analysis of Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 supports Renco's interpretation of the scope of these provisions. In particular, the *Pac Rim* tribunal noted that \"[a]s regards the expedited procedure under Article 10.20.5, it is twinned with the procedure under Article 10.20.4 with an additional ground of objection as to competence.\"33 [Emphasis added] The *Pac Rim* tribunal thus recognized that competence is an additional ground for preliminary objections afforded by Article 10.20.5, not found in Article 10.20.4.\n\n*Pac Rim v. El Salvador* Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, at \u00b6 106, Note 10.\n\n132.\n\nIn *Commerce Group v. El Salvador*, the respondent only raised objections related to the waiver under Article 10.20.5 of the DR-CAFTA. Thus, the tribunal in *Commerce Group* did not address the scope of these provisions because it dismissed the entire dispute for lack of jurisdiction in the Article 10.20.5 phase.34\n\n*See Commerce Group v. El Salvador* Award, Note 19.\n\n133.\n\nIn *RDC v. Guatemala*, the respondent first raised a competence objection predicated on waiver under Article 10.20.5 of the DR-CAFTA. After the tribunal rejected this objection, the respondent raised two further preliminary competence objections (*ratione temporis* and *ratione materiae*) under Article 10.20.4. The claimant apparently failed to point out that these objections fell outside the scope of Article 10.20.4. In any event, the *RDC* tribunal did not address the scope of Article 10.20.4 objections in its decision.35\n\n*See RDC v. Guatemala*, Note 19.\n\n134.\n\nFurther, it is the Claimant's case that, contrary to the Respondent's assertions, prior tribunals' interpretations of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) are irrelevant for purposes of Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty.\n\n135.\n\nFor the Claimant, while Article 10.20.4 distinguishes between preliminary objections to competence and preliminary objections for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, ICSID Rule 41(5) provides simply that \"a party may... file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit\", without any reference to competence or jurisdiction.\n\n136.\n\nTo support its position the Claimant, in response to the Tribunal's letter of July 8, 2014, invited Mr. Bernardo Cremades to comment on his article regarding the application of Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Rules. Mr. Cremades states in his letter to the Tribunal of September 16, 2014 that ICSID Rule 41(5) is irrelevant for the purposes of this dispute and indicates that he agrees with the Claimant's interpretation of Treaty Article 10.20.4.36\n\n*See* the Cremades Letter, Note 22.\n\n137.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, if the Tribunal entertains under Article 10.20.4 the Respondent's preliminary objections as to competence, this will only add an inefficient and iniquitous process into these proceedings that would allow the Respondent to advance competence objections with no risk of an adverse ruling (because all of the Claimant's facts are assumed to be true). The Respondent's strategy is inconsistent with the Treaty language and with the schedule to which the Parties agreed and the Tribunal ordered in Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n**(3) Excerpts of Summaries of Negotiation Sessions Held Four to Five Years Prior to Enactment Do Not Support the Respondent's Reading of Article10.20.4**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nIn response to Respondent's argument that certain documents from Peruvian negotiators of the Treaty demonstrate that both the United States of America and Peru intended that the Article 10.20.4 procedure must include competence objections, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent is relying on incomplete portions of the documents, concerning early negotiations that occurred between 2004 and 2005, *i.e.*, almost five years prior to the enactment of the Treaty.\n\n139.\n\nFurther, according to the Claimant, the comments are not in conflict with the final version of the Treaty because the Respondents' argument seems to be based on what appears to be a faulty premise that the statements made during these early negotiations regarding preliminary objections, relate only to Article 10.20.4 in the final version of the Treaty. According to the Claimant, the summaries of negotiations provided by the Respondent simply make clear that a respondent may bring a preliminary objection to the tribunal's competence under the Treaty. However, the Claimant contends that the question before the Tribunal is not whether the Treaty permits a respondent to raise a preliminary objection to the tribunal's competence, but instead whether a tribunal is *required* to hear a preliminary objection of competence pursuant to Article 10.20.4.\n\n**(4) Disputed Factual Issues Permeate the Respondent's Competence Objections**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe Claimant considers that merely grouping six objections under three headings, as indicated by the Respondent in paragraphs 25 to 27 of its submission of April 23, 2014, does not suffice to alter the real number of objections submitted by the Respondent.\n\n141.\n\nThe Claimant reiterates that five of these six objections fall outside the scope of Article 10.20.4 because they relate only to the Tribunal's competence and have nothing to do with a cognizable \"claim\" as required by Article 10.20.4.\n\n142.\n\nMoreover, each of these five competence objections involves an abundance of disputed facts. Thus it would be virtually impossible for the Tribunal to determine the Respondent's competence objections without a factual inquiry. In the Claimant's opinion this shows that the Respondent simply wishes to secure two opportunities to bring exactly the same competence objections in two different phases of the case.\n\n**(5) The Non-Disputing Party Submission of the USG Confirms that All Competence Objections Fall Outside the Scope of Article 10.20.4**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nFor the Claimant, the USG's Submission confirms its interpretation of Article 20.10.4 by agreeing that an objection to the tribunal's competence \"fall[s] outside [the] scope\" of Article 10.20.4 and that \"objections asserted under [Article 10.20.4] are distinct from objections to the tribunal's competence\",37 thereby rejecting the Respondent's argument that a preliminary objection to the tribunal's competence as a matter of law falls within the scope of Article 10.20.4.\n\nUSG's Submission, September 10, 2014, at \u00b6 6 n.4.\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimant finds support for its position in the USG's Submission, including, inter alia, that:\n\n\u25a0 Article 10.20.4(c) only encompasses objections to the legal sufficiency of a claim and therefore if an objection to the tribunal's competence falls within the scope of Article 10.20.4, then Article 10.20.4(c) would require the tribunal to assume to be true all of the claimant's factual allegations in the notice of arbitration and the statement of claim, and not just those \"in support of any claim.\" Thus, the USG supports the Claimant's position that the inclusion of the phrase \"in support of any claim\" in Article 10.20.4(c) confirms that objections to the tribunal's competence fall outside the scope of Article 10.20.4.\n\n\u25a0 \"Subparagraph (d) confirms that a respondent is not required to request a preliminary decision on an objection to competence when invoking the procedures under paragraph 4 (or paragraph 5). That is, the applicable arbitration rules permit, but do not require, a respondent to seek a preliminary decision on any objections to competence, and paragraph 4 does not alter those rules.\"38 According to the Claimant, this evidences USG's rejection of the Respondent's \"necessary corollary\" argument39 and adopts the Claimant's reading of Article 10.20.4(d).\n\n\u25a0 \"[A]n objection under paragraph 4 *and any objection that the dispute is not within* *the tribunal's competence* \" emphasiz[es] that objections asserted under paragraph 4 are distinct from objections to the tribunal's competence.\"40 For the Claimant this statement by the USG is consistent with its position that \"the words \u2018an objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence' is additional confirmation that an objection under paragraph 4 of Article 10.20 regarding the substantive viability of a claim is different than, and not included within, an objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence. Any other reading impermissibly would cause the words of the Treaty to be in conflict.\"41\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 10.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"[t]he necessary corollary of this provision is that a respondent may raise an objection as to competence under Article 10.20.4\", because \"[i]f all competence objections truly were outside the scope of Article 10.20.4, as Renco argues, it would be superfluous to provide that a respondent does not waive a competence objection by raising (or not) an objection under Article 10.20.4.\" *See* Respondent's Submission, April 23, 2014, at \u00b6 13.\n\nUSG's Submission, September 10, 2014, at \u00b6 6 n. 4 (emphasis in the original).\n\nClaimant's Submission, April 3, 2014, at 6; Claimant's Submission, May 7, 2014, at 13-14.\n\n**(6) Request for Relief**\n--------------------------\n\n145.\n\nBased on the above arguments and \"as unequivocally confirmed by the USG's Submission,\"42 the Claimant contends that the Respondent's five competence objections fall outside the scope of Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty and that the Tribunal is not required or compelled to hear them in the Article 10.20.4 Phase of this arbitration, as argued by the Respondent.\n\nClaimant's Submission, October 3, 2014, at 14.\n\n146.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal issue an award declaring that the Respondent's competence objections fall outside Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty, and that, pursuant to the agreement between the Parties as reflected in Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondent will bring its objections to the Tribunal's competence during the merits phase of the case.\n\n**E. Submission of the USG Pursuant to Article 10.20.2 Regarding the Interpretation of Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nOn September 10, 2014, the USG filed a written submission as a non-disputing Party pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the Treaty, regarding the interpretation of Article 10.20.4 and informed the Tribunal that it did not wish \"to exercise its right to make an oral submission at this time.\"\n\n148.\n\nThe USG observed that it was not taking a position on how its interpretation applies to the facts of this case and noted that no inference should be drawn from the absence of comment on any issue not addressed in its Submission.\n\n149.\n\nThe Parties' respective positions on the USG's Submission are summarized in parts C(4) and D(5) of Section III of this Decision above.\n\n**(1) Expedited Review Mechanisms in U.S. International Investment Agreements**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe USG's non-disputing Party Submission traces the origins of the expedited review mechanisms, introduced by the USG in recent investment agreements, to the USG's experience in the *Methanex Corp. v. USA* case.43\n\n*See Methanex Corp. v. USA*, Note 9.\n\n151.\n\nIn the *Methanex* case, the arbitral tribunal constituted under NAFTA Chapter Eleven, concluded that it lacked authority to rule on the USG's preliminary objection that, even accepting all of the claimant's allegations of fact, the claims should be dismissed for \"lack of legal merit.\"44\n\n*Methanex Corp. v. USA*, Partial Award, August 7, 2002, at \u00b6\u00b6 109, 126.\n\n152.\n\nThe *Methanex* tribunal ultimately dismissed all claims for lack of jurisdiction but, according to the USG, this was possible only after spending a significant amount of time and resources pleading on jurisdiction and merits.\n\n153.\n\nAccordingly, in all subsequent investment agreements concluded to date by the USG, it has negotiated expedited review mechanisms that allow a respondent State to assert preliminary objections in an efficient manner.45 Article 10.20.4 and Article 10.20.5, is fully consistent with its position that objections to the tribunal's competence \"fall outside [the] scope\" of Article 10.20.4. The Claimant explains that in its Partial Award (during the jurisdictional phase of the proceeding), the *Methanex* tribunal considered the USG's challenge to jurisdiction (postponing decision pending its receipt of further pleadings and evidential materials from the parties), while concluding that it \"lacked authority\" to rule on the USG's objection to the legal sufficiency of Methanex's claims. In the Claimant's view, the introduction of the Article 10.20.4 procedure in further treaties was therefore clearly intended to provide tribunals with the authority that the *Methanex* tribunal lacked, while the introduction of the Article 10.20.5 procedure was intended to provide an expedited review mechanism both for Article 10.20.4 objections and for objections to the tribunal's competence under the applicable arbitration rules. *See Methanex Corp. v USA*, Note 9.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the USG's explanation of the origin of the expedited review mechanisms pursuant to\n\n**(2) Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 of the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nThe USG states that paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 10.20 establish efficient and cost-effective mechanisms for a respondent State to dispose of claims that cannot prevail as a matter of law, potentially together with any preliminary objections to the tribunal's competence.\n\n155.\n\nThe USG observes that paragraph 4 allows a respondent to submit \"any objection\" that, \"as a matter of law\", a claim is not one for which the tribunal may issue an award in favor of the claimant. The USG also notes that paragraph 4 further clarifies that it operates \"[w]ithout prejudice to a tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question.\"\n\n156.\n\nThus, according to the USG, paragraph 4 of Article 10.20 provides a further ground for dismissal, in addition to \"other objections\", such as preliminary objections to the tribunal's competence. The USG considers that in view of the \"without prejudice\" clause, a tribunal may also hear preliminary objections to competence asserted under the applicable arbitration rules.\n\n157.\n\nThe USG further indicates that paragraph 5 of Article 10.20 establishes that a tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis \"an objection under paragraph 4 *and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence\"*, [emphasis added] thus emphasizing that objections asserted under paragraph 4 are distinct from objections to the tribunal's competence. Likewise, the chapeau of paragraph 4 gives as an example of the \"other objections\" that fall outside its scope, \"an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence.\"46\n\nUSG's Submission, September 10, 2014, at \u00b6 6 n.4.\n\n158.\n\nRegarding paragraph 4, the USG also notes that sub-paragraph (a) requires any such objections to be submitted \"as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted\", and generally no later than the date for the submission of the counter-memorial, contrasting with the expedited procedures contained in paragraph 5.\n\n159.\n\nAs to sub-paragraph (b), the USG observes that it provides a mandatory requirement (\"a tribunal \"shall\" hear and decide as a preliminary question any objection made under paragraph 4\"). Thus, this requirement complements the tribunal's discretion, under the applicable arbitration rules, to decide an objection to competence as a preliminary matter.\n\n160.\n\nThe USG states that the evidentiary standard in sub-paragraph (c) facilitates an efficient and expeditious process for eliminating claims that lack legal merit. The USG notes that sub-paragraph (c) does not address, and does not govern, other objections, such as an objection to competence.\n\n161.\n\nThe USG further indicates that sub-paragraph (d) confirms that a respondent is not required to request a preliminary decision on an objection to competence when invoking the procedures under paragraph 4 (or paragraph 5). Thus, the applicable arbitration rules may allow, but do not require, a respondent to seek a preliminary decision on any objections to competence, and paragraph 4 does not modify those rules.\n\n162.\n\nFor the USG, Article 10.20.4 supplements the tribunal's authority under the available arbitration rules to decide preliminary objections, such as competence objections, separately from the merits.\n\n163.\n\nThus, according to the USG's submission, if a respondent makes a preliminary objection under Article 20.10.4, the tribunal retains its authority under the applicable arbitration rules to hear any preliminary objections to competence. However, reasons of procedural economy \"will often weigh in favor of deciding competence objections as a preliminary matter and at the same time as objections made under paragraph 4.\"47\n\n*Id.*, at \u00b6 11.\n\n164.\n\nFinally, the USG states that the expedited procedure provided for in Article 10.20.5 refers to all preliminary objections, whether permitted by paragraph 4 or the applicable arbitral rules. Thus, the USG submits that Article 10.20.5 modifies the applicable arbitration rules, requiring a tribunal to decide on an expedited basis any Article 10.20.4 objection as well as any objection to competence, provided that such request is made within 45 days of the date of the tribunal's constitution.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISIONS**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Relevant Issues**\n--------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe key questions for determination by the Tribunal are two:\n\n(1) Does Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty encompass within its scope preliminary objections which may be characterized as relating to competence?\n\n(2) Which, if any, of the preliminary objections raised by the Respondent should be permitted to proceed to scheduling and full briefing for final decision in the Article 10.20.4 Phase of these proceedings?\n\n166.\n\nIn this decision, the Tribunal addresses only the limited procedural issues raised by the Respondent's preliminary objections under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal does not otherwise address or decide any other procedural issues or any of the merits of the claims advanced or denied by the Parties.\n\n**B. The Relevant Treaty Provisions**\n-------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe relevant Treaty provisions at issue are found in Article 10.20.4. Although not engaged on the facts here, Article 10.20.5 is also of relevance to the extent that it assists in the proper interpretation of Article 10.20.4. For convenience, these two provisions are set out in full as follows:\n\nArticle 10.20.4:\n\n*\"4. Without prejudice to a tribunal's authority to address other objections as a* *preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.*\n\n*(a) Such objection shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial (or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment);*\n\n*(b) On receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor.*\n\n*(c) In deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant's factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute.*\n\n*(d) The respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 5*.\"\n\nArticle 10.20.5:\n\n*\"5. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is* *constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days*.\"\n\n**C. Interpretation of the Scope of Article 10.20.4**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Question Presented and the Tribunal's Remit**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe question presented for decision by the Tribunal relates to the proper scope of Article 10.20.4. The issue is one of considerable importance, not least because it is a matter of first impression under the Treaty.\n\n169.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that the two State Contracting Parties to the Treaty, the Republic of Peru and the United States of America, have adopted different views as to the ambit of Article 10.20.4.\n\n170.\n\nPeru has set out its view in its extensive written submissions in these proceedings. In short, Peru argues that Article 10.20.4 requires this Tribunal to address and decide \"any objection\" that a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the Claimant may be made under Treaty Article 10.26. Peru contends that \"any objection\" includes both objections as to the merits and to competence.\n\n171.\n\nThe USG has provided its interpretation of the scope and effect of Article 10.20.4 in its non-disputing Party submission. The position of the USG is that \"objections asserted under paragraph 4 [of Article 10.20] are distinct from objections to the tribunal's competence\" and that \"an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence\" falls \"outside the scope\" of Article 10.20.4.\n\n172.\n\nThe Tribunal credits the views of both State Contracting Parties with the highest respect. However, the Tribunal is not bound by the views of either party.48\n\n*See* Meg N. Kinnear, Andrea K. Bjorklund, *et al.,* Article 1128-Participation by a Party in Investment Disputes under NAFTA: An Annotated Guide to NAFTA Chapter 11, Supplement No. 1, March 2008 (Kluwer Law International 2006) at 1128-1-1128-5, 1128-4; *see also* Respondent's Submission October 4, 2014, at \u00b6 35 and the materials cited at Note 73.\n\n173.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal has taken note that the Free Trade Commission, established pursuant to the Treaty and authorized to issue binding interpretations as to the Treaty's provisions, has issued no interpretation of Article 10.20.4 to date.\n\n174.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the proper interpretation of Article 10.20.4 and how it should be applied to the facts of this case are tasks which reside exclusively with this Tribunal.\n\n**(2) Principles of Treaty Interpretation**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nAs emphasized by all Parties in this case, the starting point for the Tribunal's analysis of Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty must be Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, by which a treaty is to be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n176.\n\nIt is generally accepted that Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention requires that a treaty should be interpreted first on the basis of its \"plain language.\"49\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Yukos Universal Ltd. v. the Russian Federation*, PCA Case AA 227IIC 416 (2009), Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of November 30, 2009, at \u00b6 411 (\"According to Article 31 of the [Vienna Convention], a treaty must be interpreted first on the basis of its plain language.\").\n\n177.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the principle of effectiveness (*effet utile*) is broadly accepted as a fundamental principle of treaty interpretation. This principle requires that provisions of a treaty be read together and that \"every provision in a treaty be interpreted in a way that renders it meaningful rather than meaningless (or *inutile*).\"50\n\n*See* Oppenheim's International Law 1280-81 (R. Jennings & A. Watts eds., 9th ed. 1996) (\"The parties are assumed to intend provisions of a treaty to have a certain effect, and not to be meaningless: the maxim is *ut res magis valeat quam pereat*. Therefore, an interpretation is not admissible which would make a provision meaningless, or ineffective.\") *See also* *Eureko B.V. v. Republic of Poland, ad hoc,* Partial Award of August 19, 2005, at \u00b6 248 (\"It is a cardinal rule of the interpretation of treaties that each and every operative clause of a treaty is to be interpreted as meaningful rather than meaningless. [T]reaties, and hence their clauses, are to be interpreted so as to render them effective rather than ineffective.\" For further cases and materials on point, *see* Cremades Letter, Note 22 at 6-8.\n\n178.\n\nIn addition, Article 32 of the Vienna Convention provides that in the interpretation of a treaty recourse may be had to \"the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion\", either to \"confirm the meaning\" of the treaty provisions interpreted in accordance with Article 31 or \"to determine the meaning\" when the interpretation of treaty provisions leaves the meaning \"ambiguous or obscure\" or leads to a result which is \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"\n\n179.\n\nIn interpreting the Treaty provisions in issue here, the Tribunal will be guided by the fundamental principles set out above.\n\n**(3) Textual Analysis**\n------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the interpretation of the text of the relevant Treaty provisions.\n\n181.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Tribunal has concluded that the plain language of Article 10.20.4, interpreted in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms in their context, clearly shows that objections as to competence are not included within the scope of Article 10.20.4 objections.\n\n182.\n\nThe Tribunal begins with an overview of the structure and scheme of Article 10.20.4 and its companion Article 10.20.5.\n\n183.\n\nArticle 10.20.4 consists of a chapeau containing two clauses: (1) a principal clause and (2) a preceding subordinate clause. The chapeau is followed by four separate subparagraphs (a)-(d).\n\n184.\n\nThe principal clause states:\n\n*\"[A] tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26*.\"\n\n185.\n\nThe effect of the principal clause is to establish a special regime that requires a tribunal to deal with a certain category of objections\u2014namely, objections by a respondent to the legal sufficiency of claims brought by the claimant\u2014as preliminary questions. These objections are hereafter referred to as \"Article 10.20.4 objections.\"\n\n186.\n\nThe preceding subordinate clause in the chapeau to Article 10.20.4 states that the principal clause is:\n\n\" *[w]ithout prejudice to a tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence*.\"\n\n187.\n\nThe subordinate clause thus provides clarification that the mandatory procedure for addressing Article 10.20.4 objections established by the primary clause is to operate without detriment to or effect on a tribunal's power to deal with \"other objections\" (including competence objections) as preliminary questions.\n\n188.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that a \"tribunal's authority\" to deal with \"other objections\" is derived from the applicable arbitration rules.51 Where the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules apply (as is the case here), Article 23(3) of the Rules grants the tribunal the authority, exercisable at its discretion, to deal with an objection to jurisdiction as a preliminary question.\n\nClaimant's Submission, May 7, 2014, at 1-2; Respondent's Submission, October 4, 2014, at 23.\n\n189.\n\nSub-paragraphs (a)-(d) of Article 10.20.4 follow the principal clause of the chapeau and provide certain procedural rules when dealing with Article 10.20.4 objections. Thus:\n\n(a) \" *Such* objection\" must be submitted to the tribunal within the time limit specified.\n\n(b) Upon receiving \"an objection under this paragraph\", the tribunal shall suspend the proceedings on the merits and establish a timetable for dealing with the objection. Such timetable shall be \"consistent with any schedule [the tribunal] has established for considering any other preliminary question.\" This is a clear reference to preliminary questions dealt with under the applicable arbitration rules and accords with the general purpose of the article to ensure an efficient and cost-effective procedure for disposing of preliminary objections.\n\n(c) When deciding \"an objection under this paragraph,\" the tribunal is required to adopt an evidentiary standard which assumes that all of claimant's factual allegations in support of its claim as set out in the pleadings are true.\n\n(d) The respondent is not deemed to have waived \"any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits\" merely because it did or did not raise \" *an objection under this paragraph* \" or under Article 10.20.5.\n\n190.\n\nArticle 10.20.5 is a companion provision to Article 10.20.4 which provides for an expedited procedure for dealing with preliminary objections. Article 10.20.5 provides:\n\n*\"...Upon the request of the respondent within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence.* \"\n\n191.\n\nAs the above exposition of Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 demonstrates, the Treaty draws a clear distinction between three different categories of procedures for dealing with preliminary objections. Thus:\n\n(1) The principal (\"shall address and decide\") clause in Article 10.20.4 refers to objections alleging the insufficiency of a claim as a matter of law which a tribunal is mandated to decide as a preliminary issue based on assumed facts.\n\n(2) The subordinate (\"without prejudice\") clause in Article 10.20.4 preserves a tribunal's right to decide \"other objections\" (including competence objections) as preliminary questions pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.\n\n(3) Article 10.20.5 provides for a special expedited procedure, at a respondent's option, for dealing with preliminary objections under both (1) and (2).\n\n192.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the underlying scheme established by the provisions and the plain language found in the text make it clear that competence objections were not intended to come within the scope of the Article 10.20.4 objections referred to in category (1) above.\n\n193.\n\nFirst, it is noteworthy that the principal clause in Article 10.20.4 (preliminary objections category 1) makes no explicit reference to competence objections. This is to be contrasted with the express references to \"objections to the tribunal's competence\" contained in both the subordinate clause of Article 10.20.4 (category 2) and in Article 10.20.5 (category 3).\n\n194.\n\nIf the State Contracting Parties to the Treaty had intended competence objections to fall within the scope of Article 10.20.4 objections, they could have easily drafted language for inclusion in the principal clause of Article 10.20.4 to achieve this.52 However, both the language and the logic of the provisions suggest that this was not done because the drafters intended to draw a distinction between Article 10.20.4 objections on the one hand and \"other objections\", such as competence objections, on the other.\n\n*See* Cremades Letter, Note 22 at 5-6.\n\n195.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the use of the words \"other objections\" in the subordinate clause of Article 10.20.4 must be seen to be a reference to objections that are *other than*, meaning *different from*, the objections referred to in the article's primary clause. If Article 10.20.4 objections included objections to competence, there would plainly be no need to describe competence objections as \" *other* objections.\" Therefore, in order to invest logic and meaning in the provision as a whole, the Tribunal considers that competence objections must be understood to fall outside the scope of the Article 10.20.4 objections.\n\n196.\n\nFurther support for this reading of the Treaty's language is to be found in Article 10.20.5. As stated above, Article 10.20.5 was intended to provide an expedited pathway for the disposal of preliminary objections. By its terms, Article 10.20.5 is not limited to Article 10.20.4 objections.\n\n197.\n\nThe first sentence of Article 10.20.5 makes plain that the expedited procedure applies to both \"...an objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n198.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this sentence provides additional and cogent confirmation that the Treaty drafters intended to draw a clear demarcation between Article 10.20.4 objections and objections as to competence, and that the latter do not fall within the scope of the Article 10.20.4 objections.\n\n199.\n\nAs noted by Mr. Bernardo M. Cremades, if competence objections were already included within the scope of Article 10.20.4 then the words \"and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence\" at the end of the first sentence of Article 10.20.5 would be superfluous.53 The principle of *effet utile* requires that a treaty be interpreted so that every operative clause is \"meaningful rather than meaningless.\" In the Tribunal's judgment, to ascribe to the provision the meaning contended for by the Respondent would offend against this important principle.\n\nCremades Letter, Note 22 at 7- 8.\n\n200.\n\nFurther support for the distinction drawn in the Treaty provisions between Article 10.20.4 objections and competence objections can be seen in the way in which the timetabling of preliminary issues is addressed.54 Sub-paragraph (b) of Article 10.20.4 provides that upon the receipt of a preliminary objection under that Article, the tribunal shall establish a schedule for considering the objection which is \"consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question.\" As discussed above, the purpose of this phrase is to require, on grounds of efficiency, that Article 10.20.4 objections and competence objections brought under the applicable arbitration rules are dealt with on parallel briefing schedules. By contrast, Article 10.20.5 contains no such provision. This is obviously because Article 10.20.5 (unlike Article 10.20.4) already includes objections to competence within its scope.\n\n*Id.* at 8.\n\n201.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the phrase \"any objection\" in the principal clause of Article 10.20.4 clearly establishes Peru's right to bring objections to competence in the Article 10.20.4 Phase. The Respondent is supported by Professor Michael Reisman who asserts: \"[T]he ordinary meaning of the words 'any objection' is any objection.\"55\n\nProfessor Reisman's Letter, Note 6 at 4.\n\n202.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it would be wrong to read the words \"any objection\" in isolation. The Vienna Convention on the interpretation of treaties requires that the words must be construed in their proper context. When viewed in the context of the provision as a whole it is clear that the words \"any objection\" are not open ended. Rather, they are qualified - and circumscribed - by the preceding subordinate clause. Read together, it is clear that in this context, contrary to the Respondent's case, \"any\" does not mean \"any\" without qualification, but rather \"any\" within a limited universe that excludes those types of objections which are identified in the subordinate clause, and which are the subject of separate provisions elsewhere.\n\n203.\n\nFurther,\"any\" refers to a specific category of objections, namely \"any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made.\" [Emphasis added]\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimant's submission is that there is a difference between \"objecting to the viability of a particular claim as a matter of law (assuming all facts asserted by claimant to be true), and objecting to a tribunal's competence to hear and decide a claim.\"56 [Emphasis in original] The Respondent disagrees and argues that the word \"claim\" is broad enough to include jurisdictional or competence objections. In this regard, the Respondent relies on the opinion of Professor Reisman that \"dismissal of a claim on jurisdictional grounds is a dismissal as a matter of law.\"57\n\nClaimant's Submission, April 3, 2014 at 6.\n\nProfessor Reisman's Letter, Note 6 at 4.\n\n205.\n\nHaving carefully considered the views of both Parties, the Tribunal is persuaded that the better view is that there is a meaningful distinction between an objection that mounts a challenge to the sustainability of a legal claim, and an objection to a tribunal's competence to hear a dispute. As Professor Jan Paulsson has noted:\n\n\"[A] *motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action, or, to use the expression current in England, a strike-out application...is a defense on the merits and not a matter of admissibility* [or jurisdiction]. *The USA was not arguing* [in *Methanex* ] *that the case was unhearable, but that it was legally hopeless.* *That is precisely how one should understand the difference between a challenge of inadmissibility and a strike-out application*.\" *58*\n\nJan Paulsson, *Jurisdiction and Admissibility,* in Global Reflections on International Law, Commerce and Dispute Resolution, Liber Amicorum in Honour of Robert Briner 607-08 (2005).\n\n206.\n\nIn the case at hand, the distinction drawn by Professor Paulsson is apparent from the fact that when addressing an Article 10.20.4 objection for legal insufficiency of a claim, a tribunal will be called to decide whether the claim is \"legally hopeless.\" Consideration of an objection to competence, however, requires a tribunal to ask a different kind of question: whether the objection is \"hearable\" at all, irrespective of a party's substantive Treaty rights or the legal merit of the claim.\n\n207.\n\nMoreover, even if an objection to a tribunal's competence provides a basis for \"dismissal as a matter of law\", Article 10.20.4 only requires a tribunal to decide as a preliminary question an objection which is directed at the legal sustainability of a claim, not the tribunal's jurisdiction.59 This follows from the distinction created by the structure of Article 10.20.4 which, as discussed above,60 confirms that objections as to competence are \"other objections\", which are different from objections that \"as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made.\"\n\nClaimant's Submission, May 7, 2014 at 6.\n\n*See supra* at \u00b6\u00b6 182-191.\n\n208.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal is persuaded by the Claimant's submission that the text of subparagraph (c) of Article 10.20.4 provides a further indication that the scope of Article 10.20.4 objections is limited to objections to the legal sufficiency of a claim.61 Under sub-paragraph (c), when deciding an Article 10.20.4 objection \"the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant's factual allegations in support of any claim.\" [Emphasis added] If the word \"claim\" were intended to include objections to competence, then subparagraph (c) would require a tribunal to assume the entirety of the claimant's factual allegations in the pleadings to be true, not only those factual allegations \"in support of any claim.\" In the Tribunal's view, the inclusion of the words \"in support of any claim\" is consistent with the view that competence objections fall outside the scope of Article 10.20.4 objections. To interpret the language in sub-paragraph (c) otherwise would be impermissible under the principle of *effet utile*, as it would to render the phrase \"in support of any claim\" meaningless.\n\nClaimant's Submission, October 1, 2014 at 8-9.\n\n209.\n\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, the Tribunal has concluded that the Respondent's contention that the word \"claim\" in the primary clause of Article 10.20.4 should be interpreted broadly to include competence objections is without merit.\n\n210.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that sub-paragraph (d) of Article 10.20.4 provides support for its argument that competence objections should be included within the ambit of Article 10.20.4 objections. The Respondent has stated:\n\n\" *Article 10.20.4(d) confirms Peru's right to raise competence objections under Article 10.20.4, by providing that a respondent State* 'does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph *'. The necessary corollary to this provision is that a State*  *may* *raise an objection as to competence under Article 10.20.4*.\"62 [Emphasis in original]\n\nRespondent's Submission, October 4, 2014 at 8\n\n211.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this is incorrect. Sub-paragraph (d) reads in full as follows:\n\n\" *[t]he respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph*  *or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 5* *.\"* [Emphasis added]\n\n212.\n\nWhen read in its entirety, it is plain that the cross-reference to Article 10.20.5 (which includes objections as to competence) explains the earlier reference in sub-paragraph (d) to the non-waiver of competence objections. Therefore, in the Tribunal's judgment, the better view of sub-paragraph (d) is that the provision draws the same distinction between Article 10.20.4 objections and objections to competence as is found in the principal and subordinate clauses of Article 10.20.4 and in Article 10.20.5. As such, the Tribunal concludes that the provision does not support the Respondent's argument but confirms that competence objections are excluded from the scope of Article 10.20.4 objections.63\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has found it unnecessary to address the Claimant's arguments based on the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on which it expresses no opinion.\n\n213.\n\nIn conclusion, having carefully considered all of the submissions of both Parties and the relevant Treaty texts, the Tribunal has determined that on a proper interpretation of the text of the Treaty provisions, objections as to a tribunal's competence are outside the scope of Article 10.20.4.\n\n**(4) Object and Purpose**\n--------------------------\n\n214.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that the object and purpose of Article 10.20.4 and its companion Article 20.10.5 is to provide an efficient and cost-effective mechanism for respondent States to assert preliminary objections to dispose of claims at an early stage in the arbitration proceedings.\n\n215.\n\nFurther, both State Contracting Parties to the Treaty have traced the origins of the provisions contained in Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 to the NAFTA case of *Methanex v. United States.*64\n\n*See* the Respondent's Submission, April 23, 2014, at 4; the USG's Submission, September 10 2014, at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n\n216.\n\nIn *Methanex,* the United States was confronted with claims that it contended were without legal merit, even assuming the truth of the claimant's allegations. However, the tribunal ruled that it could not address such objections in a preliminary phase. Only after protracted and costly proceedings did the tribunal ultimately decide that it did not have jurisdiction and that the claims should be dismissed\n\n217.\n\nIn the light of *Methanex*, the United States and Peru agreed to include in the Treaty provisions which would allow a respondent State to assert preliminary objections in an efficient manner and thus avoid the unnecessary time and expense of adjudicating a legally meritless claim.\n\n218.\n\nThe Respondent contends that in order for Article 10.20.4 to fulfil its intended object and purpose, the provision must be interpreted to include competence objections within its scope. If this is not done, the Respondent argues, the preliminary objections mechanism provided for in the Treaty would be incapable of solving the issues which surfaced in *Methanex* and which they were originally intended to address.\n\n219.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Respondent's argument is unavailing. As discussed above, the scheme put into place by Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 of the Treaty provides for three different procedural options for dealing with preliminary objections. These include (1) the special procedure for dealing with Article 10.20.4 objections; (2) the provisions contained (in this case) in Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules for dealing with jurisdictional objections as preliminary questions; and, importantly, (3) the expedited procedure provided for under Article 10.20.5 which materially enhances the efficient handling of preliminary objections brought under both (1) and (2). Taken together, these provisions address the issues confronted by the respondent in *Methanex*.\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal is unpersuaded by Professor Reisman's suggestion that preliminary objections in which there may be disputed issues of fact (as per Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, and Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty, and unlike Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty) are somehow incapable of being determined with expedition.65\n\nProfessor Reisman's Letter, Note 6 at 6: \"... objections that included disputes about facts, with all that entails procedurally, would hardly lend themselves to an expedited procedure.\"\n\n221.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal doubts that the accepted object and purpose of the Treaty would be achieved if objections as to the Tribunal's competence could be brought more than once (i.e. under Article 10.20.4, on the basis of assumed facts, and thereafter as a preliminary objection under - in this case - Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules).\n\n222.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal concludes that the provisions contained in Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 provide for an efficient mechanism for disposing of claims at an early stage in the arbitral proceedings which is fully consonant with the object and purpose intended by the Parties.\n\n**(5) Treaty Negotiations**\n---------------------------\n\n223.\n\nPeru contends that the negotiating history of the Treaty demonstrates that the Parties agreed that the scope of Article 10.20.4 would encompass both competence objections and objections as to the merits.\n\n224.\n\nIn support, Peru has submitted excerpts from the negotiation summaries prepared by Peru's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism. Peru contends that the negotiation summaries demonstrate that the possibility of raising preliminary objections to the competence of the tribunal was one of the \"objectives\" of Peru in the negotiations with the United States during the Six (2004) and Seventh (2005) Rounds of negotiations.66 Further, Peru contends that the negotiation summary for the Eight Round (2005) of negotiations shows that Peru and the United States \"agreed to include in this article, in paragraph 4, an express reference to the possibility to challenge the tribunal's competence to hear and rule over the complaints.\"67\n\nUnofficial Translation of the MINCETUR 6th Round Negotiations, Note 11 at 29-30 and Unofficial Translation of the MINCETUR 7th Round Negotiations, Note 11 at 37.\n\nUnofficial Translation of the MINCETUR 8th Round Negotiations, Note 11 at 15.\n\n225.\n\nIn addition, Peru has submitted a letter from Mr. Carlos Herrera Perret who formerly served as \"team leader\" of negotiations for the investment chapters of the Treaty. Mr. Herrera states: \"[B]ased on my role in the negotiations, the issue of the interpretation of Article 10.20.4 of Chapter 10 of the Treaty is unequivocal: the scope of the provision is very broad and reflects the position that Peru sought in the negotiations.\"68\n\nHerrera Letter, Note 7.\n\n226.\n\nThe negotiation summaries and the Herrera Letter have presumably been put forward by Peru as evidence of \"preparatory work\" within the meaning of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention. However, these materials appear to reflect only Peru's own position, objectives, and understanding in the course of the negotiations.\n\n227.\n\nThe utility of unilateral evidence emanating from one of the negotiating sides of a treaty in investor-state disputes has been the subject of analysis by numerous commentators and tribunals. For example, Dr Thomas W\u00e4lde has noted:\n\n\" *One has to be careful with the views, in particular ex post, of participants in the negotiations. Like witnesses in court, they will interpret what has happened through the lens of their own\u2014as a rule limited and one-sided\u2014perspective, views on desirability, and interests of their principals. They will tend to suppress 'cognitive dissonance' and rather confirm what has happened is what they think should have happened.* \" *69*\n\nThomas W. W\u00e4lde, \" *Interpreting Investment Treaties: Experiences and Examples* \" *,* in Christina Binder et al., eds., International Investment Law for the 21st Century: Essays in Honour of Christoph Schreuer (Oxford University Press, 2009), at 778.\n\n228.\n\nSimilarly, Anthony Aust has stated:\n\n\" *The summary record of a conference prepared by an independent and experience secretariat will carry more weight than an unagreed record produced by [a] participating state. However, even the records of a conference served by a skilled secretariat will generally not tell the whole story. The most important parts of negotiating and drafting often take place informally, with no agreed record* *being kept. The reasons why a particular compromise formula was adopted, and what it was intended to mean, may be difficult to establish.* \" *70*\n\nAnthony Aust, Handbook of International Law (Cambridge University Press, 2005) at 5.\n\n229.\n\nHence tribunals in investor-state arbitrations have tended to approach the testimony of state officials and negotiators with caution.71\n\n*See e.g.*, *Eureko B.V. (The Netherlands) v. Republic of Poland,* ad hoc Arbitration, Partial Award of August 19, 2005, at \u00b6 185; *Tza Yap Shum v. Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6, Award of July 7, 2011, at \u00b6\u00b6 166-171, 212.\n\n230.\n\nIn any event, under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention a tribunal may have recourse to \"supplementary means of interpretation\", such as reference to a treaty's \"preparatory work\", in only limited circumstances. These are (i) to \"confirm the meaning\" of treaty provisions interpreted in accordance with Article 31, or (ii) to \"determine the meaning\" of treaty provisions when interpretation leaves the meaning of treaty provisions \"ambiguous or obscure\" or to a result which is \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"\n\n231.\n\nIn this case, this Tribunal has already determined that Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty, when interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, clearly and unambiguously excludes competence objections from its scope. Therefore, the Tribunal sees no need to refer to supplementary interpretation to either confirm or determine the meaning of the Treaty provisions.\n\n**(6) Investment Treaty Jurisprudence**\n---------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nThe Respondent has also argued that investment treaty jurisprudence supports its position that Article 10.20.4 should be interpreted to include competence objections within the scope of the provision.\n\n233.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent has referred to the *RDC v. Guatemala* Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction; the *RDC v. Guatemala* Second Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction; the *Pac Rim v. El Salvador* Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections; and the *Commerce Group v. El Salvador* Award.72\n\n*See Pac Rim v. El Salvador* Decision on Respondent's Preliminary Objections, Note 10 and *Commerce Group v.* *El Salvador* Award, Note 19.\n\n234.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent has relied on comparisons between ICSID Arbitration Rule 41.5 and the provisions contained in Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty.\n\n235.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the legal materials submitted by the Respondent referred to above and to the submissions of both Parties with respect thereto.\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal has not been materially assisted by the decisions of other arbitral tribunals construing provisions found in DR-CAFTA which are analogous (if not identical) to Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 of the Treaty. As not all the same points on construction were apparently argued in these cases as have been argued here, and, in so far as they differ from the points set out above, ultimately the Tribunal is unpersuaded by the analysis and conclusions of these other tribunals. In this Tribunal's view, none of these decisions is precisely on point with the issues presented in this case and as such can provide only limited guidance here.\n\n237.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal has not been materially assisted by comparisons between the provisions contained in ICSID Arbitration Rule 41.5 and the Treaty provisions of concern in this case. In the Tribunal's judgment, ICSID Rule 41.5 contains language that is very different from that found in Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 of the Treaty. Nor does ICSID Rule 41.5 share precisely the same object and purpose as Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5 of the Treaty.\n\n238.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal has placed no reliance on the above materials in reaching its decision here.\n\n**(7) Other**\n-------------\n\n239.\n\nThe Parties have raised a number of ancillary issues and arguments in their written submissions. For the avoidance of doubt, all of these issues and arguments have been carefully considered by the Tribunal in reaching its decisions even if each and every one has not been specifically referred to herein.\n\n**(8) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n240.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal has concluded that objections to a tribunal's competence fall outside the scope of Article 10.20.4. Therefore, the Treaty does not mandate or require this Tribunal to address and decide objections as to competence in the Article 10.20.4 Phase of the arbitration proceedings.\n\n241.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision follows from its interpretation of Treaty Articles 10.20.4 and 10.20.5. This interpretation has been based upon the principles of treaty interpretation declared in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, including the ordinary meaning of the terms contained in the Treaty, viewed in their context and in light of the Treaty's object and purpose.\n\n**D. The Respondent's Preliminary Objections**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the question of which of the Respondent's preliminary objections should proceed to scheduling and briefing in the Article 10.20.4 Phase of these proceedings.\n\n243.\n\nIn its submission dated March 21, 2014 the Respondent noticed three preliminary objections pursuant to Article 10.20.4:\n\n(1) *Violation of the Treaty's Waiver Provisions.* Peru contends that Renco has presented an invalid waiver in this arbitration, in violation of Article 10.16.1(b) of the Treaty. In addition, Peru contends that, through the initiation and continuation of certain proceedings, Renco has acted in violation of the Treaty's waiver requirement.\n\n(2) *Lack of Jurisdiction Ratione Termporis.* Peru asserts that the Treaty limits arbitrable claims to those that arise from facts that took place after the Treaty came into force in 2009. Further, Peru argues that the Treaty precludes the submission of claims more than three years after a claimant knew or should have known of an alleged breach. Peru contends that the claims advanced by Renco in these proceedings violate both temporal limitations.\n\n(3) *Failure of Claims Under the Plain Language of the Contract.* Peru contends that Renco's Treaty claims are based on alleged breaches of the Stock Transfer Agreement in connection with the tort suits proceeding against Renco in the United States. Peru argues that these contract claims must fail as a matter of law because the party to the Stock Transfer Agreement is not a defendant in the U.S lawsuits. Further, Peru argues that Renco failed to submit a claim for determination by a technical expert as required by the Stock Transfer Agreement. Therefore, Peru contends that it cannot be deemed to have breached a contractual obligation with respect to the U.S. lawsuits as asserted by Renco.\n\n244.\n\nPeru contends that each of the above preliminary objections falls within the scope of Article 10.2.4 and should be considered and decided by the Tribunal in the Article 10.20.4 Phase of these proceedings.\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimant considers that the three preliminary objections noticed by Peru in its letter dated March 21, 2014 include six different preliminary objections. These are: (1) presentation of an invalid waiver; (2) violation of the waiver; (3) lack of jurisdiction *ratione termporis* ; (4) violation of the Treaty's three-year limitations period; (5) failure to state a claim for breach of the investment agreement; and (6) failure to submit two factual issues for determination by a technical expert prior to commencement of the arbitration.\n\n246.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Peru's objections (1)-(4) and (6) above all relate to the Tribunal's competence or jurisdiction over this dispute. As such, the Claimant argues that they fall outside the scope of the Article 10.20.4 Phase established by Procedural Order No. 1. As to Peru's preliminary objection (5), the Claimant accepts that the Treaty allows Peru to bring this objection as a preliminary question under Article 10.20.4.\n\n247.\n\nPeru has asserted that the preliminary objections it has raised under the heading \"Violation of the Treaty's Waiver Provisions\" (characterized by the Claimant as objections (1) and (2)) implicate \"the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\"\n\n248.\n\nAs to the objections raised under the heading \"Lack of Jurisdiction *Ratione Termporis* \" (characterized by the Claimant as objections (3) and (4)) Peru has asserted: \"The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over these claims.\"\n\n249.\n\nAs regards Peru's preliminary objection based on the failure to submit two factual issues for determination by a technical expert prior to the commencement of the arbitration (characterized by the Claimant as objection (6)), this objection is one of admissibility. As such, Peru's objection here clearly goes to the competency of the Tribunal. In its own submissions, Peru has accepted that competence and admissibility are \"two sides of one and the same conceptual coin.\"73\n\nRespondent's Submission, October 4, 2014, at 8, citing with approval Veijo Heiskanen, *Menage A Trois?* *Jurisdiction, Admissibility and Competence In Investment Treaty Arbitration*, ICSID Review (2013), at 13.\n\n250.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, and in light of the Tribunal's finding above that on a proper interpretation of Treaty Article 10.20.4 objections relating to the Tribunal's competence fall outside the mandatory scope of Article 10.20.4, the Tribunal declines to hear Peru's competence objections in the Article 10.20.4 Phase of these proceedings. Peru may bring its competency objections later in these proceedings in accordance with the timetable agreed in Annex A of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n251.\n\nThere remains the question of Peru's preliminary objection based on the Claimant's alleged failure to state a claim for breach of the investment agreement (what the Claimant has characterized as preliminary objection (5)).\n\n252.\n\nBoth Parties agree that this objection properly falls within the scope of Article 10.20.4. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that this objection shall be briefed and heard as a preliminary objection in the Article 10.20.4 Phase of these proceedings in accordance with a timetable to be set by the Tribunal following further submissions from the Parties.\n\n**E. Summary and Decisions**\n----------------------------\n\n253.\n\nThe Procedural Schedule annexed to Procedural Order No. 1 requires the Tribunal to make a preliminary decision (or full or partial deferral of decision) on the Respondent's preliminary objections after hearing from the Parties.\n\n254.\n\nHaving carefully considered all of the submissions of both Parties, the Tribunal decides that on a proper interpretation of the Treaty provisions the Respondent's objections as to the Tribunal's competence fall outside the scope of Article 10.20.4.\n\n255.\n\nIn view of the above, only one of the various preliminary objections noticed by the Respondent, namely, the Claimant's alleged failure to state a claim for breach of the investment agreement, will be considered and decided in the Article 10.20.4 Phase of these proceedings.\n\n256.\n\nThe Respondent's other preliminary objections, which relate to competence, may be brought by the Respondent together with its Counter-Memorial on Liability in accordance with the timetable set out in Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n257.\n\nIn order to fix the timetable for the Article 10.20.4 Phase, the Parties are directed to file their submissions on the scheduling implications of this Decision within fourteen (14) days from the date hereof.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n258.\n\nThe Tribunal decides to make no order as to costs at this stage under Article 10.20.6 of the Treaty but to reserve its decision to the final stage of these arbitration proceedings.\n\n**VI. OTHER MATTERS**\n---------------------\n\n259.\n\nAs to all other matters, the Tribunal retains its full power to decide any further matters in these arbitration proceedings, whether by order, decision or award."}, {"Title": "Tribunal\u2019s Decision regarding Respondent\u2019s Request for Relief", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2015-06-02T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Tribunal\u2019s Decision regarding Respondent\u2019s Request for Relief\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThis Decision disposes of the Respondent's several requests for interlocutory and other relief in relation to the Article 10.20.4 Phase of these proceedings. The background is as follows.\n\n6.\n\nOn December 19, 2014 the Tribunal issued its Decision as to the Scope of the Respondent's Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20.4 dated December 18, 2014 (the \"Decision on the Scope of Article 10.20.4\" or the \"Scope Decision\"). The Spanish version of the Scope Decision was communicated to the Parties by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") on February 13, 2015.\n\n7.\n\nBy communications dated 2 January 2015 the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreed schedule for submissions relating to the Respondent's remaining preliminary objection pursuant to Article 10.20.4.\n\n8.\n\nOn January 27, 2015 a two day hearing regarding the Respondent's remaining preliminary objection pursuant to Article 10.20.4 was scheduled for September 1 and 2, 2015 in Washington, D.C.\n\n9.\n\nOn February 21, 2015 the Respondent filed its Preliminary Objection Under Article 10.20.4 dated February 20, 2015 accompanied by Legal Opinions of John B. Bellinger, III and Carlos C\u00e1rdenas Quir\u00f3s.\n\n10.\n\nOn February 23, 2015 the Claimant notified the Tribunal that it considered that the Respondent's filing raised jurisdictional and other issues beyond the scope of objections permitted per its Decision on the Scope of Article 10.20.4 and that accordingly, the Respondent's submissions should not be posted to the Centre's website. The Claimant reserved its right to address what it described as the Respondent's \"overreaching.\"\n\n11.\n\nOn March 9, 2015 the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal indicating that its February 23, 2015 submission should be published on the Centre's website in accordance with the transparency provisions of the Treaty and Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n12.\n\nOn April 17, 2015 the Claimant submitted its Opposition to Peru's 10.20(4) Objection accompanied by the Legal Expert Report of Dr. Fernando de Trazegnies.\n\n13.\n\nOn April 30, 2015 the Respondent addressed to the Tribunal, in a letter dated April 29, 2015, a request seeking relief from ongoing prejudice caused by the Claimant's conduct within and beyond the pending arbitration.\n\n14.\n\nOn May 4, 2015, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to comment on the Respondent's April 29, 2015 letter which it did on May 5, 2015.\n\n15.\n\nOn May 7, 2015 the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal requesting (i) the opportunity to be heard with respect to the Claimant's response of May 5, 2015 and (ii) an immediate (and at least temporary) suspension of the briefing calendar until the procedural implications of the pending issues are resolved. Both the Claimant and the Respondent commented further to the Tribunal on the request for a suspension of the briefing calendar on May 8, 2015.\n\n16.\n\nOn May 11, 2015 the Tribunal informed the Parties of the temporary suspension of the Respondent's Article 10.20.4 filing deadline and invited the Respondent to submit a full reply to the Claimant's May 5, 2015 letter by May 18, 2015.\n\n17.\n\nOn May 19, 2015 the Respondent submitted a reply, in a letter dated May 18, 2015, to the Claimant's letter of May 5, 2015, written further to the Respondent's letter of April 29, 2015 requesting relief from ongoing prejudice caused by the Claimant.\n\n18.\n\nOn May 21, 2015 the Tribunal indicated to the Claimant that if it wished to add anything to its submissions on the issues raised by the Respondent including and following its submission dated April 29, 2015, it must do so before May 25, 2015. The Claimant indicated by reply that it did not wish to comment further.\n\n**III. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal has had the benefit of a full exchange of correspondence between the Parties, a summary of which is set out by the Tribunal in this section. For the avoidance of doubt, even if not specifically noted in the summary below, all of the issues and arguments raised by the Parties in their correspondence have been carefully considered by the Tribunal in reaching its decisions.\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis of the issues is reserved to Section IV. below.\n\n**B. Submissions on the Respondent's Preliminary Objection under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent's Notification of its Preliminary Objection under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIn its Decision on the Scope of Article 10.20.4, the Tribunal determined that, on a proper interpretation, objections relating to the Tribunal's competence fall outside the mandatory scope of Article 10.20.4 and that, accordingly, only one of the preliminary objections noticed by the Respondent, namely, the Claimant's alleged failure to state a claim for breach of the investment agreement, would be considered and decided in the Article 10.20.4 Phase of these proceedings.1\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6254-255.\n\n22.\n\nIn its 2014 submissions on the meaning and ambit of Article 10.20.4, the Respondent argued that its refusal to assume liability for claims in the St. Louis Lawsuits could not constitute a violation of the Treaty because the Guaranty and Stock Transfer Agreement (the \"Contract\"), which together allegedly constitute an Investment Agreement, concern third party claims relating to Doe Run Peru, and, because the Plaintiffs in the St Louis Lawsuits chose to sue Doe Run Peru's U.S.-based affiliates in the US courts rather than bringing claims against Centromin's successor, Activos Mineros, or the Republic of Peru, or Doe Run Peru. As a matter of law, the Respondent cannot therefore have breached the Contract. Further, as the Claimant has failed to submit a claim for determination by a technical expert as required by the Contract, it is the Respondent's position that it cannot be deemed to have breached a contractual obligation with respect to the St Louis Lawsuits as the Claimant asserts.2\n\nDecision, Section III.B.(3) and \u00b6243(3).\n\n23.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's Decision on the Scope of Article 10.20.4 and the schedule established by the Tribunal in its Procedural Order No. 1 dated August 22, 2013, as modified by agreement of the Parties, the Respondent made submissions dated April 29, 2015 in support of its Preliminary Objection under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty (the \"Preliminary Objection\").\n\n24.\n\nIn its Preliminary Objection the Respondent advanced a number of legal arguments to support its position that claims advanced by the Claimant relating to its alleged violation of its investment agreements should be dismissed under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty including that (1) there is no investment agreement between Peru and Renco within the meaning of the Treaty; (2) even if the Contract constituted a valid investment agreement between Peru and Renco under the Treaty, Peru, as a matter of law, could not have breached any obligations to Renco under it because Peru is not a party to the Contract and because the obligations contained therein run only to Doe Run Peru and DRC Ltd.; and (3) even if the Guaranty constituted a valid investment agreement between Peru and Renco under the Treaty, Peru could not have breached any obligations to Renco thereunder because the Guaranty is void under Peruvian law and because Renco's claims under the Guaranty in any event are not ripe or otherwise fail to state a claim.3\n\nPreliminary Objection, \u00b63.\n\n**(2) The Claimant's Opposition to the Scope of the Respondent's Preliminary Objection**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nFollowing its receipt of the Respondent's Preliminary Objection, the Claimant suggested that the Respondent's filing raised \"*jurisdictional and other issues that go beyond the scope of what the Tribunal permitted Respondent to file per its Decision concerning 10.20.4 scope objections dated December 18, 2014*.\"4\n\nThe Claimant's email to the Centre dated February 23, 2015.\n\n26.\n\nThis led the Respondent to complain that the Claimant was behaving in a manner contrary to the Treaty and Procedural Order No. 1.5\n\nLetter from the Respondent dated March 9, 2015.\n\n**(3) The Claimant's Submission of its Opposition to Peru's 10.20(4) Objection**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nIn addition to submitting that the sole preliminary objection made by the Respondent which properly falls within the Tribunal's Scope Decision lacks merit, in its Submission of Opposition to Peru's 10.20(4) Objection (the \"Opposition\"), the Claimant also objected to the introduction by the Respondent in its Preliminary Objection of what it called \"*three additional patently improper objections*\" going largely to the competence of the Tribunal.6\n\nClaimant's Opposition, \u00b67.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimant submits that because the Respondent did not notify the Claimant or the Tribunal of its intention to raise these three objections, the Parties did not have an opportunity to brief whether these three objections fall within the scope of Article 10.20.4 and the Tribunal did not rule upon them in its Scope Decision. Further, the Claimant submits that by raising objections that were not notified in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondent is undermining the integrity of the Article 10.20.4 process and seeking to disadvantage the Claimant in the proceedings.7\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n29.\n\nAccordingly, in its Opposition submittal, the Claimant dealt only with the Respondent's objection that it considered to be authorised by the Scope Decision and reserved its right, should the Tribunal determine that it should address any of the other objections, to request an appropriate revision to the briefing schedule in order to permit it to do so.8\n\n*Op. Cit.*,\u00b623.\n\n**C. The Respondent's Request for Relief from the Alleged Ongoing Prejudice Caused by the Claimant's Conduct Within and Beyond the Proceedings**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nBy letter dated April 29, 2015, the Respondent complained to the Tribunal of three aspects of the Claimant's behavior within and beyond the arbitration which it claimed was causing it ongoing prejudice (the \"Request for Relief\"). The Respondent complained that (1) by declining to address most of the arguments in the Respondent's Preliminary Objection, the Claimant is granting itself the right to disregard the Tribunal's procedural orders while prejudicially reserving to itself the right to respond later, all of which violates the Respondent's rights to bring preliminary objections under the Treaty; (2) the Claimant has renewed its acts and is engaged in an ongoing violation of the waiver requirement in Article 10.18 of the Treaty; and (3) by seeking to prevent the Respondent from setting out its serious arguments regarding the Claimant's violations of law, contract, and Treaty, and from rightfully defending itself, the Claimant has systematically infringed the Respondent's procedural and substantive rights.\n\n31.\n\nOn May 5, 2015 at the Tribunal's invitation, the Claimant submitted its letter in response to the Respondent's April 29, 2015 Request for Relief (the \"Response\"). The Claimant contends that the Respondent's Request for Relief goes beyond zealous advocacy and in fact seeks to re-litigate decided issues, pushes the Tribunal into a reconsideration of its Scope Decision, and unfairly states that the Claimant has acted in bad faith because the Claimant seeks to follow and enforce the Tribunal's ruling. The Claimant asserts the Respondent has made its Request for Relief for two reasons: first, to expand the scope of the Article 10.20.4 Phase even after the Tribunal explicitly limited it to only one of the various preliminary objections noticed by the Respondent; and second, to further delay the proceedings.\n\n32.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal's direction of May 11, 2015, the Respondent addressed a further letter to the Tribunal in reply to the Claimant's Response regarding its April 29 Request for Relief (the \"Reply\").\n\n33.\n\nEach of the matters raised by the Respondent in its Request for Relief and its Reply as well as those addressed by the Claimant in its Response is addressed below.\n\n**(1) The Claimant's Interference with the Respondent's Treaty Right to Bring Preliminary Objections**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nIn briefing its Preliminary Objection, the Respondent submits that the three arguments it notified9 are not separate objections under Article 10.20.4 as the Claimant contends, but rather are, consistent with the Tribunal's Scope Decision, arguments in support of the Respondent's preliminary objection that, as a matter of law, the Claimant's claims for breach of an investment agreement are not claims for which an award in favor of the Claimant may be made under Article 10.26 of the Treaty.\n\n*See supra*, \u00b638.\n\n35.\n\nIt is the Respondent's position that each of the three legal arguments accord with the parameters set forth in Article 10.20.4 - in other words, they each require the dismissal of claims strictly as a matter of law, and assume the truth of the facts alleged by the Claimant, or otherwise rely on undisputed facts.10 Further, because the three legal arguments are closely related and intertwined, they should be heard together.11 Finally, the Respondent notes that the Claimant has no basis to complain that the legal arguments were not set out in full in the Respondent's previous filings, as Respondent was under no obligation to brief in full all details of the legal arguments in support of its particular preliminary objection before submitting its Preliminary Objection.12\n\nRequest for Relief, Section 1.a; Reply, Section 1.b.\n\nReply, Section 1.b.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimant seeks to restrict its Treaty right to bring preliminary objections which could dispose of or limit the scope of its claims in this case, by dictating which arguments the Respondent can and cannot raise in support of its preliminary objection under Article 10.20.4.13 The Respondent submits it would be seriously prejudiced if it were prevented from presenting all of its potentially dispositive arguments at this stage.14\n\nReply, Section 1.\n\n*Op. Cit.*, Section 1.b.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that it is in fact the Claimant, through its refusal to respond to the majority of the Respondent's arguments, which is acting in contravention of the Tribunal's Scope Decision. Rather than raising its objections with the Tribunal in good faith immediately after it filed its Preliminary Objection, or addressing all the arguments raised in that Objection in the alternative in its Opposition, the Respondent notes that instead the Claimant waited eight weeks to raise these issues, and attempted to unilaterally reserve the right to request additional time to brief arguments, which it itself had chosen not to address.15\n\nRequest for Relief, Section 1.b. In its Reply the Respondent notes that the Claimant has not even attempted to explain or justify in any way its failure to raise these issues with the Tribunal promptly, or to address the Respondent's arguments in the alternative in its Opposition.\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant cannot be permitted to dictate the content of its legal arguments, nor can it be permitted to reframe those arguments unilaterally.16 Due process now bars the Claimant from benefitting from its own procedural wrongdoing.17 Having failed to raise its issues with the Tribunal promptly, and having chosen not to address the majority of the Respondent's arguments in its Opposition, the Claimant is now not entitled to and has, in fact, waived its right to respond. The Respondent asserts that Claimant's attempt to reserve its rights and raise arguments in later briefing, or at the hearing, would violate the Respondent's right to due process, the equality of its defense, and the ability to present its case.18\n\nReply, Section 1.\n\nReply, Section 1.a.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n39.\n\nIn its Response, the Claimant submits that the Respondent is improperly relying on the reference to the term \"*investment agreement*\" in \u00b6 255 of the Scope Decision in its Preliminary Objection to expand its sole permitted objection into something broader than what it is, to encompass what are quintessentially competence objections within objections that fall within the scope of Article 10.20.4. The Claimant submits that this reference does not justify the Respondent's attempt to raise objections in its Preliminary Objection which it did not notice in the 10.20.4 Phase, even if it may now wish it had.19\n\nResponse, pp.2-3.\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's contention that it has the right to raise the three arguments made in its Preliminary Objection, and underscores that it was the Tribunal in its Scope Decision, and not the Claimant, that set the limitations as to what objections could be raised. The Claimant maintains that as the three objections are patently improper - because they relate to the competence of the Tribunal and were never notified by the Respondent as required by Procedural Order No. 1. - the approach it adopted in its Opposition was justified as the Claimant did not want to be complicit in Respondent's violation of the Tribunal's Decision on the Scope of Article 10.20.4. The Claimant argues that the Respondent will suffer no prejudice as a result because, in accordance with \u00b6 256 of the Scope Decision, it will have every opportunity to raise its other preliminary objections in its Counter-Memorial and subsequent phases of the proceedings.20\n\n*Op. Cit.*, p.4.\n\n**(2) The Claimant's Ongoing Violation of the Treaty**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimant is using procedural circumstances as an excuse to take additional steps to pursue local actions in Peru by its affiliates in violation of the waiver requirement in Article 10.18 of the Treaty, and that any delay by the Tribunal in ruling on this matter not only facilitates the Claimant's continued violation of the Treaty (and potential rendering of the Tribunal without jurisdiction), it also allows the Claimant to have two bites at the apple. According to the Respondent, either the Claimant will obtain the relief it seeks at the local level, or, if unsuccessful, it will turn to the Tribunal and claim that the decisions of the Peruvian courts constitute or are evidence of an additional Treaty violation.21\n\nRequest for Relief, Section 2. The Respondent also relies on the decisions in *Commerce Group v. El Salvador* ; *Waste Management, Inc. v. Mexico* and *Detroit International Bridge Company v. Canada* as evidence of the impact that an early resolution of waiver objections may have. It also notes that the Respondent's request is in line with Article 17.1 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and the requirement that the Tribunal \"*conduct the proceedings so as to avoid unnecessary delay and expense and to provide a fair and efficient process for resolving the parties' dispute*.\"\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, unlike many fork-in-the-road clauses which bar only local actions alleging treaty violations,22 the language of Article 10.18 of the Treaty makes clear that the Parties have conditioned their consent to arbitrate on claimants having waived their *\"right to initiate or continue [...] any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16*.\"23 According to the Respondent, the Treaty is thus intended to ensure that there are no proceedings of any nature concerning a measure alleged to constitute a breach of the Treaty in parallel to the arbitration.24\n\n*See* cases referenced in Request for Relief, FN 22.\n\nReply; Section 2 (the Respondent's emphasis included). *See* Article 10.18.2 of the Treaty.\n\nRequest for Relief, Section 2.a; Reply, Section 2.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent points to Action 368-2012 and the Constitutional *Amparo* Action as examples of local proceedings pursued by the Claimant, through its subsidiaries, concerning measures alleged to constitute a breach of the Treaty being conducted in parallel to the arbitration in breach of Article 10.18.25 It is the Respondent's submission that, in this way, the Claimant has taken steps intended to deliberately render the Tribunal's ultimate decision without effect and urges the Tribunal to take action. It emphasises that it is not requesting the Tribunal to reconsider its decision with respect to Article 10.20.4,26 but rather asks the Tribunal, pursuant to its independent authority under Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (which the Tribunal did not rule on in its Scope Decision), to decide as a preliminary question the Respondent's objection27 and put a halt to the Claimant's opportunistic behavior.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nReply, Section 2.\n\nRequest for Relief, Section 2.b.\n\n44.\n\nIn its Reply, the Respondent notes that the Claimant does not deny or even dispute that the local proceedings it continues to pursue in the Peruvian courts concern measures at issue in this arbitration; that it is using facts from those local proceedings in this arbitration; or that, through its subsidiary, it recently requested a ruling in one of those proceedings, which would directly impact this arbitration.28\n\nReply, Section 2.\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent submits that no prejudice to the Claimant will be occasioned by the Tribunal hearing this issue now. On the contrary, it suggests that if the waiver objection is not heard and decided now, the result will be an extraordinary waste of resources for the Parties and the Tribunal in having to brief and to decide all of the complex legal and factual issues pertaining to the Claimant's claims for tantamount to US$ 1 billion, if those claims are ultimately dismissed for failure to comply with the Treaty's waiver requirement.29\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n46.\n\nIt is the Claimant's position that the Tribunal has considered and already rejected the Respondent's arguments on why the waiver issue should be heard during the 10.20.4 Phase. As it has stated in the past, the Claimant maintains its position that the conduct being complained of does not violate the Treaty's waiver provisions, but that, in any event, the Tribunal will be the ultimate judge of the issue at a further stage in the proceedings. The Claimant suggests that the Respondent understands this, thus explaining why the Respondent is seeking reconsideration of the issue through a 'backdoor' of supposed improper recent conduct.30\n\nResponse, p.4.\n\n47.\n\nSpecifically in relation to the Respondent's request that the Tribunal decide its waiver objection as a preliminary matter under Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal has, following thorough briefing and consideration over many months, already rejected that request in its Scope Decision.31\n\nResponse, p. 3. The Claimant relies on \u00b6256 of the Decision where it states the Tribunal decided the Respondent could only bring its competence objections \"*together with its Counter-Memorial on Liability in accordance with the timetable set out in Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1*\" and refers also to \u00b685 in support.\n\n**(3) The Claimant's Violation of the Respondent's Due Process Rights**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nIt is the Respondent's position that the Claimant has infringed the Respondent's right to due process by preventing the Respondent from setting out its arguments regarding the Claimant's violations of law, contract, and Treaty, and from rightfully submitting its preliminary objections to defend itself in this case. It alleges that the Claimant has done this through its disregard for due process and the arbitral process; as well as its disregard for transparency.32\n\nRequest for Relief, Section 3.\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent points to the Claimant's opposition to transparency provisions and its resistance to the conduct of the proceedings on a dual language basis, even though Spanish is the official language of Peru. The Respondent highlights that even after the Tribunal ruled in Procedural Order No. 1 that the \"*procedural languages of the arbitration shall be English and Spanish*\" and that translations of key documents should be submitted, the Claimant has nevertheless failed to submit Spanish translations of its Article 10.20.4 pleadings.33 The Respondent also points out that by opposing that the hearing be open to the public and objecting to the publication of the Respondent's Preliminary Objection on the Centre's website, the Claimant continues to interfere with and control the public's access to information despite the transparency provisions in the Treaty.34\n\n*Op. Cit.*, Sections 3.a. and b; Reply, Section 3.\n\n*Op. Cit.*, Section 3.b.\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent also complains of the Claimant's continued resort to methods outside the arbitral process (and beyond its aforementioned breaches of the waiver provisions of the Treaty) to pursue its objectives, and, in particular, the lobbying of U.S. officials and the U.S. Government in connection with this dispute.35 According to the Respondent, official reports indicate that the Claimant has continued to lobby the U.S. Government with respect to this dispute, including lobbying the State Department and the U.S. Congress during the period covering the Article 10.20.4 scope phase and beyond, all the way through the last reporting date of March 31, 2015.36\n\n*Op. Cit.*, Section 3.a.\n\nReply, Section 3.\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's allegations. While the Claimant apologises in its Response for its belated translation into Spanish of certain previous submissions and undertakes to do better in this respect in the future, it objects to the Respondent's characterisation of these shortcomings as a deliberate \"*disregard of due process.*\"37\n\nResponse, p.5. The Respondent takes issue with the Claimant's suggestion it has in fact submitted the required Spanish translations in Section 3 of its Reply.\n\n52.\n\nThe Claimant denies all allegations regarding its supposed lobbying of U.S. officials concerning the Article 10.20(4) process, and refers the Tribunal to the confirmation provided by the U.S. government itself that no such lobbying occurred.38\n\nThe Claimant relies on the Letter of U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Lisa J. Grosh to the Tribunal dated September 10, 2014. The Respondent asserts in Section 3 of its Reply that the limited statement of the U.S. State Department that there had been no meetings with the parties concerning the interpretation of Article 10.20.4 does not undermine its position, as lobbying activities may be conducted in various ways.\n\n53.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that the allegation that it is interfering with the transparency of the proceedings is baseless. While recognizing the importance of the transparency of the proceedings, the Claimant submits that the Respondent should not be permitted to use transparency for its own ends in insisting that its Preliminary Objection be posted on the Centre's website in its entirety, despite its containing objections that are not remotely part of the Article 10.20.4 Phase, were not addressed in the Tribunal's Decision, and will not be considered, if at all, until months from now should Respondent raise them it its Counter-Memorial.39\n\nResponse, p.5.\n\n**(4) Request for Relief**\n--------------------------\n\n54.\n\nIn light of the ongoing prejudice suffered by the Respondent as a result of the conduct of the Claimant complained of in the preceding sections, the Respondent has requested that the Tribunal rule:\n\n(a) that the Claimant has waived its right to respond to the Respondent's arguments which it has chosen not to address in its Opposition;40 or if the Tribunal is to revise the briefing schedule and allow the Claimant to address the Respondent's arguments, (i) the Respondent must be granted an equal opportunity to respond; and (ii) the Claimant should not be permitted to address any of the Respondent's arguments for the first time at the Hearing;41\n\n(b) that it be permitted to brief, and that the Tribunal decide as a preliminary question in accordance with the Tribunal's authority under Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, its objection pertaining to the waiver requirement;42\n\n(c) that the Claimant comply with the provisions of the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 1 with respect to the translations of documents; that it comply with the transparency provisions of the Treaty and the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 1; and that the Claimant avoid other actions which unduly interfere with the arbitral procedure.43\n\nRequest for Relief, Section 1.c., Reply.\n\nReply, Section 1.a.\n\nRequest for Relief, Section 2.c.; Reply.\n\n*Op. Cit.*, Section 3.c.; Reply.\n\n55.\n\nRegarding the Respondent's Request set out in (a) above, the Claimant submits that the granting by the Tribunal of the request will amount to \"*due process*\" and \"*equality of the parties*\" violations because the orderly resolution of Respondent's preliminary objections in accordance with the Scope Decision and the schedule set out in Procedural Order No. 1 (as amended), will be disrupted to the Respondent's benefit at the expense of the Claimant. The Claimant urges the Tribunal to reject the request on the basis that the Respondent has no right to raise the arguments at this stage of the proceedings, and it should in fact do so, in accordance with the Tribunal's Decision, at the appropriate time later in the arbitration.44\n\nResponse, pp.4-5.\n\n56.\n\nRegarding the Respondent's Request set out in (b), the Claimant suggests this request is essentially an interlocutory appeal, and that the Tribunal must treat it as such. The Claimant refers to a recent decision in *Perenco v. Ecuador*45 where the tribunal refused to entertain what was essentially the appeal of an interlocutory order on the basis that such decisions are *res judicata*, and suggests the same approach should be followed here.46 The Claimant encourages the Tribunal to see the Request for Relief as an attempt to second-guess the Scope Decision through purported new events and the Claimant's alleged misconduct.\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Limited v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Ecuador's Reconsideration Motion, April 10, 2015. The Claimant also refers to *ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V., ConocoPhillips Hamaca B.V. and ConocoPhillips Gulf of Paria B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration, March 10, 2014.\n\nResponse, p 3. In its Reply, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's reliance on the tribunal's decisions in *Perenco v. Ecuador* and *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela* is misplaced. In those cases, Ecuador and Venezuela expressly requested the tribunals to reconsider their holdings on jurisdiction and liability, which is not the case here where the request is grounded on the Tribunal's independent authority under Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant insists that it has not engaged in any deliberate \"disregard of due process\" and that the allegation that it is interfering with the transparency of the proceedings is baseless. It does however acknowledge that will submit to any directive the Tribunal may make in this regard.47\n\nResponse, p.5.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISIONS**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal has been presented with three issues to deal with, each of which is addressed in turn below.\n\n**A. The Claimant's Interference with the Respondent's Treaty Right to Bring Preliminary Objections**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nAs noted in Section III.C.(1) above, Peru alleges that Renco has \"*interfered*\" with Peru's Treaty rights to bring its Preliminary Objection.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that in its Decision on the Scope of Article 10.20.4, it decided that only one of Peru's objections, namely \"*the Claimant's alleged failure to state a claim for breach of the investment agreement\"*,48 fell within the scope of Article 10.20.4.\n\nDecision, \u00b6255.\n\n61.\n\nPeru's argument in this regard was referred to in the Tribunal's Scope Decision at \u00b6 54. The argument was that the Contract concerns third-party claims relating to Doe Run Peru. Because Doe Run Peru is not a party to the St Louis lawsuits, then even assuming the facts alleged by Renco are true, Peru claims that, as a matter of law, it could not have breached the Contract.\n\n62.\n\nIn its subsequent submissions in support of its Preliminary Objection, Peru has now advanced a number of legal arguments including that (1) \"*there is no investment agreement between Peru and Renco within the meaning of the Treaty*\";49 (2) *\"[n]either the Contract nor the Guaranty was executed by both Peru and Renco*\";50 and (3) \"*the Guaranty is void*.\"51\n\nPreliminary Objection, p.9.\n\n*Op. Cit.*, \u00b629.\n\n*Op. Cit.*, \u00b674.\n\n63.\n\nRenco's position is that, consistent with the Tribunal's Scope Decision, the only argument that Peru should be permitted to make in support of its objection is that Peru, as a matter of law, could not have breached any obligation to Renco under the Contract, and hence under the Treaty, because the obligations contained in the Contract run only to Doe Run Peru and DRC, and not to Renco.\n\n64.\n\nRenco further argues that the other three arguments raised by Peru were never set out in Peru's previous filings, and that these matters in any event go to competence and fall outside the 10.20.4 procedure. Therefore, Renco has refused to respond to these three arguments in its April 17, 2015 Opposition. Instead, Renco has reserved \"*the right to request an appropriate revision to the briefing schedule in order to permit it to do so*\"52 at a later stage.\n\nOpposition, \u00b623.\n\n65.\n\nFor its part, Peru contends that the three legal arguments in issue are not separate objections under Article 10.20.4 but arguments in support of Peru's preliminary objection that none of Renco's claims can be sustained as a matter of law. Peru argues that, by refusing to engage on these issues, Renco is \"*dictating*\" what arguments Peru can and cannot make in support of its case and thus \"*interfering* \" with the exercise of its Treaty rights.\n\n66.\n\nPeru requests the Tribunal to rule that Renco has waived its right to respond to the three arguments it has chosen not to address in its briefs.\n\n67.\n\nRenco requests the Tribunal to rule that Peru's \"*additional objections*\" go to competence and should be dealt with later (presumably at the Counter-Memorial stage, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1). Alternatively, if the Tribunal decides the additional objections are properly within the Article 10.20.4 Phase, then a new briefing schedule will need to be fixed to allow Renco to respond.\n\n68.\n\nHaving carefully considered the arguments addressed by both Parties, the Tribunal has decided to reject Peru's request that the Tribunal find Renco has waived its right to respond to the three arguments raised by Peru in its Preliminary Objection but which were not addressed by Renco. In the Tribunal's view, the proper approach, both as a matter of fairness and procedural efficiency, is to require that all of the relevant legal arguments be addressed at the same time.\n\n69.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal directs the Parties to consult and agree a new briefing schedule which includes Renco's responsive submissions on the three arguments raised by Peru. The Parties are directed to bear in mind the hearing dates already fixed for September 1 and 2, 2015 and are requested to ensure that the new briefing schedule does not put the hearing dates in jeopardy. The Tribunal invites the Parties to notify the Tribunal of the new briefing schedule on or before **June 5, 2015**.\n\n**B. The Claimant's Ongoing Violation of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nAs noted in Section III.C.(2) above, Peru alleges that Renco has violated the waiver requirement in Article 10.18 of the Treaty and that the violation is ongoing. In particular, Peru says that Renco has used or is using one of its subsidiaries to pursue proceedings before the courts in Peru and that the proceedings concern the measures at issue in this arbitration. Renco denies this is a Treaty violation.\n\n71.\n\nPeru requests the Tribunal decide this issue now as a preliminary issue. Peru makes its application based on Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, not as part of the Article 10.20.4 procedure.\n\n72.\n\nRenco requests that Peru's application be dismissed. Renco says that the time to raise this issue is when Peru files its Counter-Memorial in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the positions of both Parties. Given the importance of this issue, and the urgency with which it has been pressed by Peru, the Tribunal has decided in accordance with Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules to grant Peru's request to hear and decide as a preliminary issue in the arbitration the question of whether Renco has violated the waiver requirement contained in Article 10.18 of the Treaty.\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal invites the Parties to consult and agree on a separate and streamlined timetable to dispose of this discrete issue in a way which does not disrupt the ongoing Article 10.20.4 procedure.\n\n75.\n\nPeru is invited to note that there will be cost consequences in the event Peru's application does not succeed.\n\n**C. The Claimant's Violation of the Respondent's Due Process Rights**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nAs noted in Section III.C.(3) above, Peru states that (i) ICSID is not publishing all of the case materials on its website due to objections from Renco; (ii) that Renco has not always complied with the requirement to submit materials in Spanish and English; and (iii) that Renco is continuing its alleged lobbying activities.\n\n77.\n\nPeru requests an order from the Tribunal that Renco comply with Procedural Order No. 1 and its other Treaty obligations regarding transparency and dual language texts and that it not \"interfere\" with the arbitration.\n\n78.\n\nRenco rejects the allegations but has stated that \"*Renco will submit to any directive the Tribunal may make in this regard*.\"53\n\nClaimant's Response, p.5.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the allegations made by Peru. Without reaching any judgement on the allegations themselves, the Tribunal wishes to state, in the strongest possible terms, that it will not tolerate any breach of the rules of procedure and accordingly directs both Parties to fully comply with their obligations under the Treaty, the UNCITRAL Rules and Procedural Order No. 1. Any disputes in this regard which remain unresolved, shall be referred immediately to the Tribunal for resolution.\n\n80.\n\nSave insofar as the Parties' applications have been dealt with herein, the same are dismissed.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Claimant's reservation of its right to apply for recovery of the full costs of Peru's application.54 The Tribunal has decided to make no order as to costs at this stage under Article 10.20.6 of the Treaty but to reserve its decision to the final stage of these arbitration proceedings.\n\nClaimant's Response p.4.\n\n**VI. OTHER MATTERS**\n---------------------\n\n82.\n\nAs to all other matters, the Tribunal retains its full power to decide any further matters in these arbitration proceedings, whether by order, decision or award."}, {"Title": "Partial Award on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Award (Partial)", "Date": "2016-07-15T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Partial Award on Jurisdiction\n-----------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis arbitration concerns a dispute submitted under the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement dated April 12, 2006 (\" **the Treaty** \") and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (2010). The Claimant is The Renco Group, Inc. (\" **Renco** \" or \" **the Claimant** \"). The Respondent is the Republic of Peru (\" **Peru** \" or \" **the Respondent** \"). The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to in this Partial Award as \"the Parties\".\n\n2.\n\nThis Partial Award contains the Tribunal's ruling on Peru's objection to jurisdiction as a result of Renco's alleged non-compliance with the requirement contained in Article 10.18(2) of the Treaty for an investor to waive its right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or any other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Treaty Article 10.16.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe full procedural history of these proceedings up to December 19, 2014 is set out in the Tribunal's Scope Decision referred to in paragraph 14 below. This will not be repeated here, save to the extent that it is relevant to the issue of Respondent's waiver.\n\n4.\n\nOn 29 December 2010, Renco served its Notice of Intent to Commence Arbitration.\n\n5.\n\nOn April 4, 2011, Renco served its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, which it subsequently amended on August 9, 2011. As set out in more detail in Section III below, the Notices both contained written waivers purportedly submitted in compliance with Article 10.18(2) of the Treaty.\n\n6.\n\nOn May 10, 2013, Peru submitted its Response to Renco's Amended Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated August 9, 2011.\n\n7.\n\nOn July 18, 2013, the Tribunal held the first procedural session.\n\n8.\n\nOn August 22, 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, which set forth the procedural timetable for the arbitration. The procedural timetable was the subject of extensive discussions and consultations between the Parties both before and during the first procedural session.\n\n9.\n\nOn February 20, 2014, Renco submitted its Memorial on Liability, including Witness Statements and Expert Reports.\n\n10.\n\nOn March 21, 2014, Peru submitted a notice of intention to make preliminary objections pursuant to Article 10.20(4) of the Treaty. Peru gave notice that it intended to raise three preliminary objections, the first of which was that Renco had violated the Treaty's waiver requirement in Article 10.18(2). The second and third objections related to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* and Renco's compliance with various provisions of the investment agreements at issue in the arbitration.\n\n11.\n\nOn April 3, 2014, Renco filed a submission challenging the scope of Peru's preliminary objections. Renco submitted that Peru's objections in fact encompassed six separate preliminary objections, namely:\n\n(a) The presentation of an invalid waiver;\n\n(b) The violation of the waiver;\n\n(c) The lack of jurisdiction *ratione temporis* ;\n\n(d) The violation of the Treaty's three-year limitation period;\n\n(e) The failure to state a claim for breach of the investment agreement; and\n\n(f) The failure to submit two factual issues for determination by a technical expert prior to commencement of the arbitration.\n\n12.\n\nOn April 23, 2014, Peru filed a submission on the scope of the preliminary objections.\n\n13.\n\nThereafter, the Parties filed further submissions in connection with the scope of Peru's preliminary objections.\n\n14.\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Tribunal issued its Decision with respect to the Scope of Peru's Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20(4) of the Treaty (\" **the Scope** **Decision** \"). The Spanish version of the Scope Decision was communicated to the Parties by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\" **ICSID** \" or \" **the Centre** \") on February 13, 2015.\n\n15.\n\nIn its Scope Decision, the Tribunal concluded as follows:\n\n(a) Article 10.20(4) objections relating to the Tribunal's competence fall outside the mandatory scope of Article 10.20(4).\n\n(b) Save for the preliminary objection that Renco had failed to state a claim for breach of the investment agreement, Peru's preliminary objections related to the Tribunal's competence and therefore fell outside the scope of Article 10.20(4). The Tribunal therefore declined to hear Peru's competence objections in the Article 10.20(4) phase of these proceedings.\n\n(c) Peru's preliminary objection relating to the investment agreement should be briefed and heard as a preliminary objection in the Article 10.20(4) phase of these proceedings in accordance with a timetable to be set by the Tribunal following further submissions from the Parties.\n\n16.\n\nAfter the Scope Decision was issued, by communications dated January 2, 2015, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreed schedule for submissions relating to Peru's remaining preliminary objection pursuant to Article 10.20(4).\n\n17.\n\nOn January 27, 2015, a two-day hearing regarding Peru's remaining preliminary objection pursuant to Article 10.20(4) was scheduled for September 1 and 2, 2015 in Washington, D.C.\n\n18.\n\nOn February 21, 2015, Peru filed its Preliminary Objection under Article 10.20(4) dated February 20, 2015 accompanied by Legal Opinions of John B. Bellinger, III and Carlos C\u00e1rdenas Quir\u00f3s.\n\n19.\n\nOn February 23, 2015, Renco notified the Tribunal that it considered that Peru's filing raised jurisdictional issues and other issues beyond the scope of objections permitted in its Decision on the Scope of Article 10.20(4) and that accordingly, Peru's submissions should not be posted to the ICSID website. Renco reserved its right to address what it described as Peru's \"overreaching.\"\n\n20.\n\nOn March 9, 2015, Peru wrote to the Tribunal indicating that its February 23, 2015 submission should be published on the ICSID website in accordance with the transparency provisions of the Treaty and Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n21.\n\nOn April 17, 2015, Renco submitted its Opposition to Peru's 10.20(4) Objection accompanied by the Legal Expert Report of Dr. Fernando de Trazegnies.\n\n22.\n\nOn April 30, 2015, Peru addressed to the Tribunal, in a letter dated April 29, 2015, a request seeking relief from alleged \"ongoing prejudice\" caused by Renco's conduct within and beyond the pending arbitration (\" **Respondent's Request for Relief** \"). Amongst other matters, in the Request for Relief, Peru complained that Renco had engaged in an ongoing violation of the waiver requirement contained in Article 10.18(2) of the Treaty as a result of the conduct of Renco's subsidiary company in domestic bankruptcy proceedings in Peru.\n\n23.\n\nOn May 4, 2015, the Tribunal invited Renco to comment on Peru's April 29, 2015 letter which it did on May 5, 2015.\n\n24.\n\nOn May 7, 2015, Peru wrote to the Tribunal requesting: (i) an opportunity to be heard with respect to Renco's response of May 5, 2015; and (ii) an immediate (and at least temporary) suspension of the briefing calendar until the procedural implications of the pending issues were resolved. Both Renco and Peru commented further to the Tribunal on the request for a suspension of the briefing calendar on May 8, 2015.\n\n25.\n\nOn May 11, 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties of the temporary suspension of Peru's Article 10.20(4) filing deadline and invited Peru to submit a full reply to Renco's May 5, 2015 letter by May 18, 2015.\n\n26.\n\nOn May 19, 2015, Peru submitted a reply to Renco's letter of May 5, 2015, written further to Peru's letter of April 29, 2015, requesting relief from \"ongoing prejudice\" caused by Renco.\n\n27.\n\nOn May 21, 2015, the Tribunal informed Renco that if it wished to add anything to its submissions on the issues raised by Peru including and following its submission dated April 29, 2015, it must do so before May 25, 2015. Renco indicated by reply that it did not wish to comment further.\n\n28.\n\nOn June 2, 2015, the Tribunal issued its Decision Regarding Peru's Requests for Relief. The Spanish version of the Decision was communicated to the Parties by ICSID on July 24, 2015. The Tribunal reached the following conclusion with respect to Peru's contention that Renco violated the waiver requirement in Article 10.18(2)(b) of the Treaty:\n\nGiven the importance of this issue, and the urgency with which it has been pressed by Peru, the Tribunal has decided in accordance with Article 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules to grant Peru's request to hear and decide as a preliminary issue in the arbitration the question of whether Renco has violated the waiver requirement contained in Article 10.18 of the Treaty.\n\n29.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal's Decision of June 2, 2015, the Parties proposed a procedural calendar for the Tribunal to consider on June 10, 2015.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter dated June 10, 2015, Renco requested:\n\n... that the Tribunal's December 18, 2015 Scope Decision in respect of Peru's waiver objection be reinstated [and that the Tribunal]... reconsider and reverse the portion of its June 2, 2015 Decision requiring full briefing on Peru's objection that Renco violated the waiver provisions of the Treaty, and reaffirm its previous ruling that such objection be brought by Peru together with its Counter-Memorial on Liability in accordance with the timetable set out in Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n31.\n\nOn June 17, 2015, Peru submitted its reply to Renco's request of June 10, 2015.\n\n32.\n\nOn June 20, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 reiterating its direction to the Parties to agree on a new briefing schedule including Renco's responsive submissions on the arguments raised by Peru in its Preliminary Objection under Article 10.20.4. The Tribunal further declined to reconsider its Decision of June 2, 2015. Accordingly, the Tribunal reiterated its direction to the Parties to agree on a \"separate and streamlined timetable\" to address the alleged ongoing breaches by Renco of the waiver requirement. Counsel were invited to inform the Tribunal of the new agreed briefing schedule, hearing dates and timetable by Wednesday, June 24, 2015. The Spanish version of Procedural Order No. 3 was communicated to the Parties by ICSID on July 24, 2015.\n\n33.\n\nFollowing the issuance of Procedural Order No. 3, the Parties exchanged their views1 on the procedural calendar and hearing dates.\n\nSee Renco's correspondence of June 22, 25, 27 and 29, 2015 and July 3, 2015. See also Peru's correspondence of June 22, 25, 26 (received on June 27), 27, 29 and, 30, 2015 and July 3, 2015.\n\n34.\n\nOn July 6, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, establishing a procedural schedule to address the Article 10.20(4) objections and a \"separate and streamlined\" schedule for the waiver objection. The Spanish version of Procedural Order No. 4 was communicated to the Parties by ICSID on July 24, 2015.\n\n35.\n\nPursuant to the schedule established by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 4, Peru filed its Memorial on Waiver on July 10, 2015 (\" **Memorial on Waiver** \" or \" **Memorial** \").\n\n36.\n\nOn July 30, 2015, Renco filed its Supplemental Opposition to Peru's Preliminary 10.20(4) Objection.\n\n37.\n\nOn August 10, 2015, Renco filed its Counter-Memorial Concerning Peru's Waiver Objections (\" **Counter-Memorial on Waiver** \" or \" **Counter-Memorial** \").\n\n38.\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the United States Government indicated that it had been monitoring the developments in the case and it was \"studying the most recent pleadings on waiver, which were obtained from the ICSID website, and is considering whether to make a submission to the Tribunal on issues of interpretation of the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement pursuant to Article 10.20.2\". The United States Government further informed the Tribunal and the disputing Parties of its intention to attend the hearing on waiver.\n\n39.\n\nOn August 17, 2015, Peru submitted its Reply on Waiver (\" **Reply on Waiver** \" or \" **Reply** \").\n\n40.\n\nOn August 21, 2015, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their observations, if any, on the United States Government's letter of August 17, 2015. The Parties did not raise any objections to the United States Government's letter.\n\n41.\n\nOn August 24, 2015, Renco submitted its Rejoinder on Waiver (\" **Rejoinder on Waiver** \" or \" **Rejoinder** \").\n\n42.\n\nOn September 1, 2015, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1 and Article 10.20.2 of the Treaty, the United States Government submitted its second non-disputing Party written submission regarding interpretation of the Treaty (\" **Second Submission of the United States of America** \").\n\n43.\n\nOn September 2, 2015, the Tribunal held a hearing in Washington D.C. to hear the Parties' oral arguments on the waiver objection.

OVERVIEW OF THE ISSUES AND THE PARTIES' CONTENTIONS**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nIn its Notice of Arbitration dated April 4, 2011, Renco submitted a claim to arbitration on its own behalf under Article 10.16(1)(a) of the Treaty and a claim on behalf of its wholly-owned local enterprise, Doe Run Peru S.R. LTDA (\" **DRP** \"), under Article 10.16(1)(b).\n\n57.\n\nIn its Amended Notice of Arbitration dated August 9, 2011, Renco withdrew its enterprise claim under Article 10.16(1)(b). However, Renco retained the claim it had submitted to arbitration on its own behalf under Article 10.16(1)(a). DRP also purported to withdraw its written waiver.\n\n58.\n\nRenco's Notice of Arbitration and Amended Notice of Arbitration were accompanied by written waivers in the following terms:2\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Waiver Accompanying Renco's** **Notice of Arbitration** | **Waiver Accompanying Renco's** **Amended Notice of Arbitration** |\n| \"Finally, as required by Article 10.18(2) of the Treaty, Renco and its affiliate DRP waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16, except for proceedings for interim injunctive relief, not involving payment of monetary damages, before a judicial or administrative tribunal of Peru. To the extent that the Tribunal may decline to hear any claims asserted herein on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds, Claimants reserve the right to bring such claims in another forum for resolution on the merits.\" | \"Finally, as required by Article 10.18(2) of the Treaty, Renco waives its right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16, except for proceedings for interim injunctive relief, not involving payment of monetary damages, before a judicial or administrative tribunal of Peru. ***To*** ***the extent that the Tribunal may decline to hear any claims asserted herein on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds, Claimant reserves the right to bring such*** ***claims in another forum for resolution on*** ***the merits*** *.* \" |\n\nThe redlined text appears in the original version of Renco's Amended Notice of Arbitration. The Tribunal has added the emphasis in bold and italics to the final sentence of the waiver.\n\n59.\n\nIn this Partial Award, The Tribunal will refer to the italicised text in the waiver accompanying Renco's Amended Notice of Arbitration as \"the reservation of rights\".\n\n60.\n\nIt is common ground that the provisions of Article 10.18(2)(b) dealing with waiver encompass two distinct requirements: a *formal* requirement (the submission of a written waiver which complies with the terms of Article 10.18(2)(b)) and a *material* requirement (the investor abstaining from initiating or continuing local proceedings in violation of its written waiver).3 As the arbitral tribunal held in *Waste Management I*, when considering the waiver provision in Article 1121 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\" **NAFTA** \"):4\n\nAny waiver, and by extension, that one which is now the subject of debate, implies a formal and material act on the part of the person tendering [the] same. To this end, this Tribunal will therefore have to ascertain whether Waste Management did indeed submit the waiver in accordance with the formalities envisaged under NAFTA and whether it has respected the terms of same through the material act of either dropping or desisting from initiating parallel proceedings before other courts or tribunals.\n\nMemorial on Waiver \u00b6 15; Counter-Memorial on Wavier \u00b6 65\n\n*Waste Management Inc v United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/2) Award dated June 2, 2000 \u00b6 20.\n\n61.\n\nPeru contends that Renco has failed to comply with the formal and material requirements of the waiver provision in Article 10.18(2)(b) of the Treaty. Peru cites the following reasons:\n\n(a) As to formal compliance:\n\n(i) By its \"reservation of rights\" Renco has purported to reserve its right to bring claims in another forum for resolution on the merits if the Tribunal dismisses any claims on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds. As a consequence, says Peru, Renco's waiver is non-compliant.\n\n(ii) DRP has failed to submit a waiver in the Amended Notice of Arbitration, despite the fact that Renco is submitting claims on behalf of DRP under the Treaty.\n\n(b) As to material compliance, Peru contends that Renco has (through DRP) initiated and/or continued proceedings in the Peruvian courts concerning measures alleged to constitute a breach of the Treaty in this arbitration.\n\n62.\n\nAs a result of Renco's alleged non-compliance with the Treaty's waiver requirements, Peru submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Renco's claims. Peru asks the Tribunal to render an award dismissing Renco's claims for lack of jurisdiction, together with an award of costs in its favor.\n\n63.\n\nRenco contends that it has complied with both the formal and material requirements of Article 10.18(2)(b) of the Treaty. Renco relies on the following grounds:\n\n(a) As to formal compliance:\n\n(i) The Treaty does not prevent a claimant from pursuing claims on the merits in another forum if its Treaty case is dismissed on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds. Therefore, Renco's waiver is compliant.\n\n(ii) Renco is asserting its own claims under Article 10.16(1)(a) for loss and damage that it has suffered as a result, in part, of measures that Peru has inflicted on its enterprise, DRP. Such claims, Renco asserts, may be submitted under Article 10.16(1)(a) and do not require a waiver from DRP.\n\n(b) As to material compliance:\n\n(i) The Peruvian proceedings relate to defensive measures taken by DRP, and defensive measures taken by an investor to defend itself against claims asserted in local proceedings do not breach the waiver requirement in Article 10.18(2)(b).\n\n(ii) The local proceedings do not relate to the same measures that are alleged to constitute a breach of Article 10.16(1)(a).\n\n64.\n\nFor these reasons, Renco submits that the Tribunal should dismiss Renco's waiver objections. Renco also seeks an award of costs.\n\n65.\n\nThe foregoing is only a brief summary of the gist of the Parties' positions in relation to Renco's compliance or non-compliance with the formal and material requirements of Article 10.18(2)(b). The Tribunal has had the benefit of extensive written and oral submissions from the Parties in relation to the issues presented. The Tribunal has carefully considered all of these submissions and, while not setting out every such submission in the body of this Award, refers in more detail to the central points raised by the Parties in the next section.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS AND DECISIONS**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal will begin by considering Peru's contention that Renco has failed to comply with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2)(b) by including the reservation of rights in the waiver accompanying its Amended Notice of Arbitration.\n\n**B. Relevant Treaty Provisions and their Interpretation**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe issues raised by the Parties involve complex issues of interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Treaty. The principal provisions engaged are Articles 10.16, 10.17 and 10.18. These provisions establish the procedures by which an investor may submit an investment dispute to arbitration. Given their importance to the issues at hand, it is appropriate to set out the text of these provisions in full below:\n\n**Article 10.16: Submission of a Claim to Arbitration**\n\n1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:\n\n(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached\n\n(A) an obligation under Section A,\n\n(B) an investment authorization, or\n\n(C) an investment agreement; and\n\n(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach; and\n\n(b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached\n\n(A) an obligation under Section A,\n\n(B) an investment authorization, or\n\n(C) an investment agreement; and\n\n(ii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach,\n\nprovided that a claimant may submit pursuant to subparagraph (a)(i)(C) or (b)(i)(C) a claim for breach of an investment agreement only if the subject matter of the claim and the claimed damages directly relate to the covered investment that was established or acquired, or sought to be established or acquired, in reliance on the relevant investment agreement [\u2026]\n\n**Article 10.17: Consent of Each Party to Arbitration**\n\n1. Each Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration under this Section in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n2. The consent under paragraph 1 and the submission of a claim to arbitration under this Section shall satisfy the requirements of:\n\n(a) Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and the ICSID Additional Facility Rules for written consent of the parties to the dispute;\n\n(b) Article II of the New York Convention for an \"agreement in writing;\" and\n\n(c) Article I of the Inter-American Convention for an \"agreement.\"\n\n**Article 10.18: Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party**\n\n1. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage.\n\n2. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless:\n\n(a) the claimant consents in writing to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and\n\n(b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied,\n\n(i) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), by the claimant's written waiver, and\n\n(ii) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(b), by the claimant's and the enterprise's written waivers\n\nof any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.\n\n3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2(b), the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) and the claimant or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) may initiate or continue an action that seeks interim injunctive relief and does not involve the payment of monetary damages before a judicial or administrative tribunal of the respondent, provided that the action is brought for the sole purpose of preserving the claimant's or the enterprise's rights and interests during the pendency of the arbitration.\n\n4. (a) No claim may be submitted to arbitration:\n\n(i) for breach of an investment authorization under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(B) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(B), or\n\n(ii) for breach of an investment agreement under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(C) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C),\n\nif the claimant (for claims brought under 10.16.1(a)) or the claimant or the enterprise (for claims brought under 10.16.1(b)) has previously submitted the same alleged breach to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure.\n\n(b) For greater certainty, if a claimant elects to submit a claim of the type described in subparagraph (a) to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure, that election shall be definitive, and the claimant may not thereafter submit the claim to arbitration under Section B.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal must interpret these provisions in accordance with the rules of treaty interpretation set out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\" **VCLT** \"). The provisions of the Treaty \"shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\" (VCLT, Article 31(1)).\n\n69.\n\nFor the purposes of interpretation, the \"context\" comprises the text, the preamble of the Treaty and its Annexes as well as the matters set out in Article 31(1)(a) and (b) of the VCLT. Furthermore, the Tribunal must \"take into account, together with context: (a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions... \" (VCLT, Article 31(3)).\n\n70.\n\nThe VCLT provides that the Tribunal may have recourse to \"supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31: (a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or (b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable\". Neither Party has referred to relevant parts of the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* in relation to the issues which arise for consideration.\n\n**C. Background: Waiver as a Precondition to the Existence of a Valid Arbitration Agreement and the Tribunal's Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nIt is axiomatic that the Tribunal's jurisdiction must be founded upon the existence of a valid arbitration agreement between Renco and Peru. Under the Treaty, an arbitration agreement is formed when an investor accepts Peru's standing offer to arbitrate claims by submitting a claim to arbitration in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section B of Chapter 10 of the Treaty. Peru's consent to arbitrate and \"the submission of a claim to arbitration under [Section B]\" are deemed to satisfy the requirements of a written arbitration agreement for the purposes of, *inter alia*, Article II of the New York Convention (see Article 10.17(2)).\n\n72.\n\nThe Treaty establishes several important conditions and limitations on Peru's consent to arbitrate claims under the Treaty. This is made clear by the title to Article 10.18 (\"Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party\"). Under Article 10.18(2), \"no claim may be submitted to arbitration\" under Section B unless:\n\n(a) the claimant consents in writing to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and\n\n(b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied,\n\n(i) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), by the claimant's written waiver, and\n\n(ii) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(b), by the claimant's and the enterprise's written waivers\n\nof any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.\n\n73.\n\nAccordingly, an arbitration agreement will be formed under the Treaty *only* if the investor satisfies the *formal* and *material* waiver requirements of Article 10.18(2)(b). This is so because compliance with Article 10.18(2) is a condition and limitation upon Peru's consent to arbitrate. Article 10.18(2) contains the terms upon which Peru's non-negotiable offer to arbitrate is capable of being accepted by an investor. Compliance with Article 10.18(2) is therefore an essential prerequisite to the existence of an arbitration agreement and hence the Tribunal's jurisdiction.5\n\nSee *Commerce Group Corp v The Republic of El Salvador* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/17, Award, March 14, 2011 \u00b6 115 (interpreting Article 10.18 of CAFTA-DR Treaty: \"[i]f the waiver is invalid, there is no consent. The Tribunal, therefore, does not have jurisdiction over the Parties' CAFTA dispute\"). See also *Railroad Development Corporation v Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Decision on Objection to Jurisdiction, CAFTA Article 10.20.5, November 17, 2008 \u00b6 56 (\"\u2018Only if' and \u2018unless' have the same meaning and, whether the term \u2018precedent' is used or not, the conditions set forth in Article 10.18 need to be met before the consent of the Respondent to arbitration is perfected\").\n\n74.\n\nIn terms of compliance with the *formal* requirement, an investor's waiver must be given in writing and it must be \"clear, explicit and categorical\". As emphasized by the tribunal in *Waste Management (No I):*6\n\nThe act of waiver *per se* is a unilateral act, since its effect in terms of extinguishment is occasioned solely by the intent underlying same. The requirement of a waiver in any context implies a voluntary abdication of rights, inasmuch as this act generally leads to a substantial modification of the preexisting legal situation, namely, the forfeiting or extinguishment of the right. Waiver thus entails exercise of the power of disposal by the holder thereof in order to bring about this legal effect.\n\nWhatever the case, any waiver must be clear, explicit and categorical, it being improper to deduce same from expressions the meaning of which is at all dubious.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, any waiver submitted pursuant to the provisions of NAFTA Article 1121(2)(b) must, depending upon the petition or request filed, be clear in all its terms with regard to abdication of given rights by the party proposing to make said waiver.\n\n*Waste Management Inc v United Mexican States (No I)*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/2, Award, June 2, 2000 \u00b6 18.\n\n75.\n\nArbitral tribunals which have been called upon to interpret the validity of waivers submitted by investors have repeatedly held that a waiver is invalid if an investor purports to carve out from its scope certain domestic court proceedings which cover the same ground as the measures being challenged in arbitration. For example, in *Waste Management (No I)* the claimant's waiver stated as follows:\n\nThis waiver does not apply, however, to any dispute settlement proceedings involving allegations that Respondent has violated duties imposed by other sources of law, including the municipal law of Mexico.\n\nWithout derogating from the waiver required by NAFTA Article 1121, Claimants here set forth their understanding that the above waiver does not apply to any dispute settlement proceedings involving allegations that Respondent has violated duties imposed by sources of law other than Chapter Eleven of NAFTA, including the municipal law of Mexico.\n\n76.\n\nThe arbitral tribunal concluded that the claimant had \"issued a statement of intent different from that required in a waiver pursuant to NAFTA Article 1121\". As a result, the tribunal concluded that the waiver was invalid and therefore that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction.7\n\n*Waste Management Inc v United Mexican States (No I)*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/2, Award, June 2, 2000 \u00b6\u00b6 31-32\n\n**D. The Validity of Renco's Waiver and Reservation of Rights**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nAgainst the background set out above, the Tribunal now turns to consider whether Renco's waiver complies with the formal requirements of Article 10.18(2)(b).\n\n*(1) Express Terms of Article 10.18(2)(b)*\n------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nIn accordance with Article 10.18(2)(b), in order to engage Peru's consent to arbitrate under the Treaty, Renco must submit a written waiver:\n\nof *any* right to initiate or continue before *any* administrative tribunal or court under the law of *any* Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, *any* proceeding with respect to *any* measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16 (emphasis added).\n\n79.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, the repeated references to the word \"any\" in Article 10.18 demonstrate that an investor's waiver must be comprehensive: waivers qualified in any way are impermissible.\n\n80.\n\nRenco has purported to qualify its written waiver by reserving its right to bring claims in another forum for resolution on the merits if this Tribunal were to decline to hear any claims on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds.\n\n81.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, this qualification is not permitted by the express terms of Article 10.18(2)(b). The only express exception to the waiver requirement set out in Article 10.18(2)(b) is for proceedings seeking \"interim injunctive relief and [which do] not involve the payment of monetary damages before a judicial or administrative tribunal of the respondent\" (Article 10.18(3)). It is common ground that this exception does not apply here.\n\n82.\n\nIn the considered judgment of this Tribunal, the term \"any proceeding\" in Article 10.18(2)(b) must be interpreted to cover proceedings which are or may be \"initiated or continued\" either:\n\n(a) At the time the notice of arbitration is filed;\n\n(b) During the pendency of the arbitration; and/or\n\n(c) After the arbitration has concluded, whether or not the investor's claims are dismissed on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds or on the merits.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this interpretation is clear from the ordinary meaning of the words \"any proceeding\" in Article 10.18(2)(b). There is no basis in the text of the Treaty for qualifying the temporal scope of the \"proceeding[s]\" in respect of which a written waiver must be provided, for example by excluding future proceedings which may be \"initiated\" by an investor if the Tribunal were to decide that it lacked jurisdiction or that Renco's claims were inadmissible.\n\n*(2) Object and Purpose of Article 10.18(2)(b)*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal's interpretation of Article 10.18(2)(b) is consistent with the object and purpose of the waiver provision. Renco, Peru and the United States all agree that the object and purpose of Article 10.18(2)(b) is to protect a respondent State from having to litigate multiple proceedings in different fora relating to the same measure, and to minimise the risk of double recovery and inconsistent determinations of fact and law by different tribunals.8\n\nMemorial on Waiver \u00b6 2; Counter-Memorial on Waiver \u00b6 56; Second Submission of the United States of America \u00b6 5.\n\n85.\n\nInvestment tribunals have concluded that the comparable waiver provision in Article 1121 of NAFTA has a similar object and purpose. For example:\n\n(a) In *Waste Management Inc v United Mexican States (No I)*, the tribunal held that \"when both legal actions [parallel domestic and NAFTA claims] have a legal basis derived from the same measures, they can no longer continue simultaneously in light of the imminent risk that the Claimant may obtain the double benefit in its claim for damages. This is precisely what NAFTA Article 1121 seeks to avoid\".9\n\n(b) In *Waste Management Inc v United Mexican States (No II)*, the tribunal held that \"[n]o doubt the concern of the NAFTA parties in inserting Article 1121 was to achieve finality of decision and to avoid multiplicity of proceedings\".10\n\n(c) In *International Thunderbird Gaming Corp v United Mexican States*, the tribunal observed that \"[t]he consent and waiver requirements set forth in Article 1121 serve a specific purpose, namely to prevent a party from pursuing concurrent domestic and international remedies, which could either give rise to conflicting outcomes (and thus legal uncertainty) or lead to double redress for the same conduct or measure\".11\n\n*Waste Management Inc v United Mexican States (No I)*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/2, Award, June 2, 2000 \u00b6 27.3.\n\n*Waste Management Inc v United Mexican States (No II)* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3), Decision of the Tribunal concerning Mexico's Preliminary Objection concerning the Previous Proceedings, June 26, 2002 \u00b6 27.\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming Corp v United Mexican States* Ad-hoc UNCTRAL, Award, January 26, 2006 \u00b6 118. See also *Detroit International Bridge Company v Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2012-25, Article 1128 Submission of the United States of America, February 14, 2014 \u00b6 6 (\"This construction of the phrase is consistent with the purpose of the waiver provision: to avoid the need for a Respondent to litigate concurrent and overlapping proceedings in multiple forums, and to minimize not only the risk of double recovery, but also the risk of \"conflicting outcomes (and thus legal uncertainty)\".)\n\n86.\n\nRenco submits that its reservation of rights does not undermine the object and purpose of Article 10.18(2)(b) because if the Tribunal were to dismiss all claims on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds there would be no risk of concurrent proceedings, double recovery or inconsistent findings of fact or law.\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept Renco's submission. The burden and risk of a multiplicity of proceedings arises whether or not the proceedings are commenced in parallel or sequentially. The fact that one set of proceedings terminates, and another set then commences, may be just as prejudicial to the respondent State as two sets of proceedings running in parallel.\n\n88.\n\nRenco's argument also overlooks the possibility that only some of its claims may be dismissed on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds. If Renco then chose to litigate the dismissed claims in a domestic court or tribunal, while at the same time pursuing the remaining claims before this Tribunal, Peru would be forced to litigate concurrent proceedings before a domestic court and before this Tribunal. In this scenario, the respondent State would confront a multiplicity of proceedings. There is also a risk that Renco may recover twice for the same damage and/or that the domestic court or tribunal may reach conflicting findings of fact or law. In the Tribunal's opinion, Article 10.18(2)(b) is designed to avoid these risks from eventuating.\n\n*(3) \"No U-turn\" Structure of Article 10.18(2)(b)*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nPeru submits that Renco's reservation of rights is also incompatible with the \"no U-turn\" structure of Article 10.18(2)(b). The United States, in its Second Submission as a non-disputing Party, agrees with Peru that Article 10.18(2)(b) is a \"\u2018no U-turn' waiver provision\". As such, so it is argued, Article 10.18(2)(b) is designed to encourage investors to investigate possible remedies within the host state's municipal law before seeking to internationalise their dispute by filing a notice of arbitration under the Treaty. However, once an investor has chosen to invoke the dispute settlement provisions in the Treaty, the waiver requirement prevents an investor from subsequently returning to a domestic court, irrespective of the outcome of the arbitration.\n\n90.\n\nRenco disagrees with Peru's and the United States' interpretation. Renco argues that an investor may not perform a U-turn once it has received a determination on the merits from an arbitral tribunal but, until that point is reached, the investor may pursue claims in a domestic court which have been dismissed on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds. Renco also points out that the object and purpose of Article 10.18(2)(b) cannot be to encourage investors to investigate possible remedies in the domestic courts because the Treaty includes a \"fork in the road\" provision.\n\n91.\n\nRenco is correct to point out that, under Article 10.18(4) of the Treaty, an investor is prevented from submitting an investment agreement claim to arbitration if the claimant or its enterprise \"has previously submitted the same alleged breach to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure\". Article 10.18(4)(b) provides as follows:\n\nFor greater certainty, if a claimant elects to submit a claim of the type described in subparagraph (a) to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure, that election shall be definitive, and the claimant may not thereafter submit the claim to arbitration under Section B.\n\n92.\n\nAnnex 10-G of the Treaty also contains a \"fork in the road\" provision for Section A obligations (for example, the prohibition against expropriation without compensation in Article 10.7 and the fair and equitable treatment obligation in Article 10.5). Paragraph (1) of Annex 10-G provides that \"[a]n investor of the United States may not submit to arbitration under Section B a claim that a Party has breached an obligation under Section A... if the investor or the enterprise, respectively, has alleged that breach of an obligation under Section A in proceedings before a court or administrative tribunal of that Party\". Paragraph (2) of Annex 10-G provides as follows:\n\nFor greater certainty, if an investor of the United States elects to submit a claim of the type described in paragraph 1 to a court or administrative tribunal of a Party other than the United States, that election shall be definitive, and the investor may not thereafter submit the claim to arbitration under Section B.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that, unlike Article 10.18(4)(b) and paragraph (2) of Annex 10-G, Article 10.18(2)(b) does not explicitly provide that an investor's election to submit a claim to arbitration \"shall be definitive\" and that the investor \"may not thereafter\" submit its claim to a court or administrative tribunal.\n\n94.\n\nHowever, in the Tribunal's opinion, the absence of such language does not assist Renco's argument. Article 10.18(2) sets out the requirements which must be satisfied as part of the submission of a claim to arbitration: in particular, the formal requirement of the provision of a written waiver. Article 10.18(2) does not address the effect of commencing proceedings before another forum, and so there is simply no place for the phrase \"shall be definitive\" which is found in Article 10.18(4) and Annex 10-G.\n\n95.\n\nIn any event, Article 10.18(2) does provide, in effect, that the investor \"may not thereafter submit its claim to a domestic court\" by insisting upon a written waiver of \" *any* right to initiate or continue before *any* [forum] *any* proceeding with respect to *any* measure alleged to constitute a breach.\" (emphasis added). In the Tribunal's opinion, this language must be interpreted to require an investor definitively and irrevocably to waive all rights to pursue claims before a domestic court or tribunal.\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the submission of Peru and the United States that Article 10.18(2)(b) is a \"no U-turn\" provision which is intended to provide flexibility, by allowing recourse to other fora up to a point, and certainty, by prohibiting any such recourse thereafter. In particular, it prevents an investor from returning to a domestic court after submitting its claims to arbitration. Renco's reservation of rights is incompatible with this \"no U-turn\" structure because it purports to reserve Renco's right to initiate subsequent proceedings in a domestic court and perform the very \"U-turn\" which Article 10.18(2)(b) is designed to prohibit.\n\n97.\n\nSupport for this interpretation of Article 10.18(2)(b) can be derived from the decision of the arbitral tribunal in *Waste Management II*.12 The claimant's original waiver was held to be invalid by a previous arbitral tribunal constituted under NAFTA because it purported to exclude certain proceedings from its scope which the claimant had continued to litigate in the domestic courts. The claimant then filed a new NAFTA proceeding, accompanied by an unequivocal waiver of the domestic proceedings. The respondent State argued that the first unsuccessful NAFTA proceeding prevented the claimant from bringing any further claim with respect to the measures that were alleged to be in contravention of NAFTA.\n\n*Waste Management Inc v United Mexican States* ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/00/3, Decision of the Tribunal concerning Mexico's Preliminary Objection concerning the Previous Proceedings, June 27, 2002 (\" *Waste Management II* \").\n\n98.\n\nThe arbitral tribunal found that the claimant was not prevented from bringing a second claim before the second NAFTA tribunal. In the course of its decision, the tribunal made a number of important findings, the first of which appears at paragraph 31 of the decision. The tribunal held as follows:\n\n*[I]t seems that the waiver contemplated by Article 1121(1)(b) is definitive in its effect, whatever the outcome of the arbitration*. The waiver concerns the right \"to initiate or continue\" domestic proceedings for damages or similar relief. A dismissal of the NAFTA claim would, it seems, be final not only with respect to NAFTA itself *but also any domestic proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that was alleged to be a breach of NAFTA*. Such proceedings may not be initiated or continued (except as permitted by Article 1121) at any time after the claim has been submitted to arbitration. (emphasis added)\n\n99.\n\nArticle 1121 of NAFTA is drafted in similar terms to Article 10.18(2)(b) of the Treaty. The Tribunal is satisfied that the same interpretation should be given to Article 10.18(2)(b). Once a valid waiver has been given under Article 10.18(2)(b), the waiver is irrevocable. A claimant may not thereafter \"initiate\" any subsequent proceedings in a domestic forum in respect of the same measure. The waiver required by Article 10.18(2)(b) is intended to operate as a \"once and for all\" renunciation of all rights to initiate claims in a domestic forum, whatever the outcome of the arbitration (whether the claim is dismissed on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds or on the merits).\n\n100.\n\nRenco argues that it would be contrary to the object and purpose of the dispute resolution procedures contained in Chapter 10 of the Treaty to require it to waive its right to initiate subsequent proceedings in a domestic court if its claim were dismissed on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds. In Renco's submission, the purpose of Chapter 10 of the Treaty is to create \"effective procedures\" for the resolution of disputes. This purpose would be frustrated if Renco were not able to have its dispute resolved in any forum. In this regard, Renco relies on paragraph 35 of the *Waste Management II* decision, where the tribunal held as follows:\n\nAn investor in the position of the Claimant, who had eventually waived any possibility of a local remedy in respect of the measure in question but found that there was no jurisdiction to consider its claim at the international level either, might be forgiven for doubting the effectiveness of the international procedures. The Claimant has not had its NAFTA claim heard on the merits before any tribunal, national or international; and if the Respondent is right, that situation is now irrevocable. Such a situation should be avoided if possible.\n\n101.\n\nThe tribunal's findings in *Waste Management II* must be placed in context. The tribunal was responding to an argument that the claimant only had one chance to present its claim before the first NAFTA tribunal. In other words, the respondent State argued that because the claimant's original waiver was invalid, the claimant could not start a second arbitration even if it was accompanied by a valid waiver.\n\n102.\n\nThe tribunal held that the respondent State's argument was contrary to the purpose of the dispute resolution procedure in NAFTA, which was designed to create effective procedures for the resolution of disputes. If the respondent State's argument had prevailed, the claimant would have had no forum in which to seek a resolution of its dispute because it had waived its rights to pursue a claim at the domestic level.\n\n103.\n\nRenco argues that it should be entitled to litigate its claims in a domestic forum if they are dismissed by this Tribunal on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds. In *Waste Management II*, the claimant was attempting to litigate before two separate NAFTA tribunals. The claimant was not seeking to return to a domestic forum after the first NAFTA tribunal dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, the *Waste Management II* decision cannot be invoked in aid of Renco's submission that it is not required to waive rights to pursue a claim in a domestic forum.\n\n104.\n\nRenco's next argument is that if its claims are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or admissibility, any such dismissal does not affect Renco's underlying rights. In such a case, there has been no determination of Renco's claims \"on the merits\" and therefore the principle of *res judicata* does not apply. Renco relies on paragraph 36 of the *Waste Management II* decision, where the tribunal held as follows:\n\nNeither does a claim which fails for want of jurisdiction prejudice underlying rights: if the jurisdictional flaw can be corrected, there is in principle no objection to the claimant re-commencing its action. This applies equally to claims which fail on (remediable) grounds of inadmissibility, such as failure to exhaust local remedies.\n\n105.\n\nRenco also argues that a dismissal based on lack of jurisdiction or inadmissibility does not preclude a later claim before a tribunal which has jurisdiction. In support of this submission, Renco cites paragraph 43 of *Waste Management II*, where the tribunal held as follows:\n\nThus there is no doubt that, in general, the dismissal of a claim by an international tribunal on grounds of lack of jurisdiction does not constitute a decision on the merits and does not preclude a later claim before a tribunal which has jurisdiction. The same is true of decisions concerning inadmissibility. The point is simply that a decision which does not deal with the merits of the claim, even if it deals with issues of substance, does not constitute *res judicata* as to those merits.\n\n106.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, Renco's argument fails to address the underlying question of whether Article 10.18(2)(b) *requires* an investor to waive its rights to pursue a subsequent claim in a domestic forum if the claim is dismissed on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds. Whether a subsequent claim may or may not be precluded by principles of *res judicata* is an entirely separate question.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal has already determined that Article 10.18(2)(b) is a \"no U-turn\" provision such that an investor may not subsequently initiate domestic proceedings if a claim is dismissed, whether on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds or on the merits. Accordingly, the fact that principles of *res judicata* might not preclude a later claim is beside the point.\n\n*(4) Reservation as \"superfluous\"*\n----------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nRenco has argued that its reservation of rights should have no effect on the validity of its waiver because the language is \"superfluous\". In Renco's submission, the reservation of rights is merely a \"belt and braces\" provision of the kind that is regularly included in legal documents.\n\n109.\n\nResponding to this argument at the oral hearing, counsel for Peru referred to a number of hypothetical scenarios where a claim could be dismissed on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds but where a waiver (without the reservation of rights) might still prevent a subsequent claim in a domestic court or tribunal. Each of these scenarios is discussed in turn below.\n\n110.\n\n*Scenario 1: Where a claim is dismissed on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds for reasons of illegality.* Peru refers by way of example to *Metal-Tech v Uzbekistan* where the tribunal held that it lacked jurisdiction because the claimant's investment was tainted by illegality.13 If Renco's reservation of rights were upheld in a hypothetical scenario of this kind, Peru submits that it would not be able to invoke a waiver containing Renco's reservation of rights to bar any subsequent claim in a domestic court because the claim was only dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. This could be extremely significant, and indeed extremely burdensome for Peru, since the practical result could be a full re-hearing of all issues that had previously been heard and determined in the arbitration. Peru submits that it should be entitled to rely on a clean waiver without the reservation of rights, rather than having to relitigate the issue of whether there was illegal conduct or argue that the prior award created a *res judicata* on this issue.\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd v Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, October 4, 2013 \u00b6\u00b6 372, 423.\n\n111.\n\nSignificantly, Renco concedes that \"if a domestic forum were available to the claimant in *Metal-Tech* to assert those dismissed treaty claims or claims under domestic law regarding the underlying measures, the waiver requirement under the US-Peru TPA per se would not bar those claims\".14 In the Tribunal's opinion, Renco's concession demonstrates that its reservation of rights is in fact not superfluous. The Tribunal stresses that no allegation or suggestion of corruption, fraud or illegality has been made against Renco in this arbitration. However, the hypothetical scenario referred to by Peru shows quite clearly that a respondent State may be prejudiced by a reservation of rights of the kind that Renco has included in its waiver because the respondent State may be deprived of a potential waiver defence in any subsequent domestic proceeding.\n\nRenco's Letter to the Tribunal dated September 23, 2015 at 2.\n\n112.\n\nRenco goes on to argue that if \"the bribery or other illegality finding [by the investment tribunal] were not a bar to those claims in that domestic forum, or if another claim regarding the same or related measures were available to the claimant (for example, unjust enrichment regarding the benefits that a State obtained under a contract that is subsequently voided), that domestic forum could proceed to rule on the merits of the claims dismissed in the investment arbitration\".15\n\nIbid.\n\n113.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, Renco's submission illustrates again why Renco's reservation of rights is not superfluous. If an investor were to advance a subsequent claim in a domestic court relying on principles of unjust enrichment, the respondent State might not be able to rely on *res judicata* principles to bar the subsequent claim.16 The respondent State may also be deprived of a potential waiver defence in any subsequent domestic proceeding because the reservation of rights excludes claims which were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or inadmissibility.\n\nFor example, there may be a lack of identity between the parties, cause of action and/or subject matter of the subsequent domestic claim and the earlier investment arbitration claim. In this scenario, a complete waiver without the reservation could potentially still bar the reformulated domestic claim.\n\n114.\n\n*Scenario 2: Where a claim is dismissed on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds but* *the tribunal, having heard the complete case, indicates the claim would have failed on the merits.* Peru refers by way of example to *Loewen v United States of America* where a bankruptcy and reorganisation led to a change in the investor's nationality which deprived the tribunal of jurisdiction. This fact did not come to light until after a full and extensive hearing on the merits. Nevertheless, having conducted a full hearing, and having progressed so far in its deliberations, the tribunal indicated (in an *obiter dictum*) that the claim would have failed on the merits.17 There are many other similar examples, including *Methanex v USA*. *18* In each case, claims were dismissed on jurisdiction or admissibility grounds, but following a full hearing and full deliberations, such that the tribunal was able to set out the reasons why the claims would have failed on their merits in any event. And in each case, if Renco's reservation of rights were upheld, Peru submits that the respondent State would not be able to rely on the waiver in order to bar any subsequent action on the same claims, because the claim was only dismissed on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds. Peru submits that a respondent State should be entitled to invoke the waiver as a defence to the subsequent claim in such a situation, and thereby avoid a complete re-hearing of the entire case.\n\n*The* *Loewen Group Inc and Raymond L Loewen v United States of America* ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/98/3, Award, June 26, 2003 \u00b6 2 (\"As our consideration of the merits of the case was well advanced when Respondent filed this motion to dismiss and as we reached the conclusion that Claimants' NAFTA claims should be dismissed on the merits, we include in this Award our reasons for this conclusion. As will appear, the conclusion rests on the Claimants' failure to show that Loewen had no reasonably available and adequate remedy under United States municipal law in respect of the matters of which it complains, being matters alleged to be violations of NAFTA\").\n\n*Methanex Corp v USA,* Final Award on Jurisdiction and Merits, Aug 3, 2005, Part IV - Ch.F \u00b6\u00b65-6 (\"By virtue of the Tribunal's decision above on the Disputing Parties' respective cases under Article 1101 NAFTA, it follows that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide the merits of Methanex's claims... By virtue of the Tribunal's decisions above on the Disputing Parties' respective cases under Article 1102, 1105 and 1110 NAFTA, it follows that Methanex's claims fail on the merits. Accordingly, assuming that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to determine the claims advanced by Methanex in its Second Amended Statement of Claim, the Tribunal decides, pursuant to Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules and Articles 1102, 1105 and 1110 NAFTA, to dismiss on their merits all claims there advanced by Methanex\").\n\n115.\n\n*Scenario 3: Where an expropriation claim is held to be inadmissible because it is plainly unarguable.* Peru refers by way of example to *Occidental v Ecuador* where the tribunal found it was so evident that there was no expropriation that it disposed of this claim on the basis that it was inadmissible.19 The tribunal also found a breach of the fair and equitable treatment and national treatment standards. Peru asked the Tribunal to assume that both of these claims had been dismissed. In this hypothetical scenario, the claimant could not re-litigate the fair and equitable treatment or national treatment breaches because these were dismissed on the merits. But Peru submits that, were Renco's reservation of rights in its waiver to be permitted, the even-more-unmeritorious expropriation claim that did not make it to the merits (because it was plainly unarguable) could potentially be re-litigated because the waiver would not apply to claims that were dismissed on the basis that they were inadmissible.\n\n*Occidental Exploration & Production Co v The Republic of Ecuador* (LCIA Case No UN3467), Final Award dated July 1, 2004, \u00b6\u00b6 80, 89, 92 (\"A claim of expropriation should normally be considered in the context of the merits of a case. However, it is so evident that there is no expropriation in this case that the Tribunal will deal with this claim as a question of admissibility. The Tribunal holds that the Respondent in this case did not adopt measures that could be considered as amounting to direct or indirect expropriation. In fact, there has been no deprivation of the use or reasonably expected economic benefit of the investment, let alone measures affecting a significant part of the investment. The Tribunal accordingly holds that the claim concerning expropriation is inadmissible\").\n\n116.\n\n*Scenario 4: Where a tribunal holds that it lacks jurisdiction over a claim concerning a breach of an Investment Agreement.* Peru observes that in this arbitration Renco has argued that several of Peru's objections to Renco's investment agreement claims under Article 10.20(4) are jurisdictional objections, namely Peru's objections that:\n\n(a) Peru has not breached the Stock Transfer Agreement because Peru is not party to that Agreement;\n\n(b) Peru has not breached the Guaranty Agreement because it is void under Peruvian law; and\n\n(c) Renco has failed to submit factual issues to a technical expert.\n\n117.\n\nIf Renco's reservation were upheld, Peru submits that it may not be able to rely on Renco's waiver in order to bar any subsequent claim based on the Stock Transfer or the Guaranty Agreement because the claims may have been dismissed on jurisdictional grounds. Peru submits that it should not be forced to make the same arguments about being a non-signatory to the Stock Transfer Agreement, or about the Guaranty Agreement being void under Peruvian law or about Renco having failed to submit factual issues to a technical expert. Peru submits that it should be entitled to invoke a waiver to preclude such claims, and a re-hearing before some other forum.\n\n118.\n\nRenco and Peru both agree that the Tribunal should refrain from making a determination as to whether Renco's waiver would in fact prevent Renco from initiating a claim in a subsequent court or tribunal.20 The Tribunal accepts that this is a question for any subsequent court or tribunal to determine. For present purposes, the Tribunal simply observes that the hypothetical scenarios set out above demonstrate that Renco's reservation of rights is not \"superfluous\", as Renco contends. If Renco's reservation of rights were held to be valid and permissible under Article 10.18(2)(b), Peru could in each of the above scenarios be deprived of a potential waiver defence.\n\nRenco's Letter to the Tribunal dated September 23, 2015 at 8; Hearing Transcript at p. 45 (Counsel for Peru, Ms Menaker): \"But that question as to whether its waiver would bar that future claim from going forward must be resolved by that future court or Tribunal that is seized with that claim. That's not an issue that should be negotiated with Peru now, and it's certainly not an issue for this Tribunal to decide\"), citing *Canfor Corp v United States of America, Terminal Forest Products Ltd v United States of America and Tembec et al v United States of America,* Order for the Termination of the Arbitral Proceedings, January 10, 2006 \u00b6 1.3.\n\n*(5) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n119.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal concludes that Renco has failed to comply with the formal requirements of Article 10.18(2)(b) by including the reservation of rights in the waiver accompanying its Amended Notice of Arbitration because:\n\n(a) The reservation of rights is not permitted by the express terms of Article 10.18(2)(b);\n\n(b) The reservation of rights undermines the object and purpose of Article 10.18(2)(b);\n\n(c) The reservation of rights is incompatible with the \"no U-turn\" structure of Article 10.18(2)(b); and\n\n(d) The reservation of rights is not superfluous.\n\n**E. The Consequence of Renco's Non-compliance with Article 10.18(2)(b)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(1) Overview*\n--------------\n\n120.\n\nHaving decided that Renco's waiver failed to comply with the formal requirements of Article 10.18(2)(b) of the Treaty, the Tribunal now turns to the question of what consequence should follow from this determination.\n\n121.\n\nFor its part, Peru submits that as a result of Renco's non-compliance with Article 10.18(2)(b) the Tribunal must dismiss Renco's claims for lack of jurisdiction. Renco contends otherwise and maintains that Peru's waiver objection should be dismissed.\n\n122.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal wishes to record the following observations which inform the Tribunal's approach to the ultimate disposition of the issue before it.\n\n123.\n\nThe Tribunal has been troubled by the manner in which Peru's waiver objection has arisen in the context of this arbitration. The arbitration had already been on foot for quite some time before Peru filed its Memorial on Waiver in July 2015. By this stage over four years had passed since Renco filed its Notice of Arbitration; the Tribunal had already issued Procedural Order No.1 which recorded the agreed briefing schedule for the arbitration; Renco had filed its Memorial on Liability; the Parties had exchanged voluminous submissions in connection with Renco's challenge to the scope of Peru's Preliminary Objections; and the Tribunal had issued a substantive decision on December 18, 2014 in relation to the Scope of Peru's Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20(4). Clearly, it would have been preferable for all concerned if Peru had raised its waiver objection in a clear and coherent manner at the very outset of these proceedings. Instead, they emerged piecemeal over a relatively lengthy period of time. This issue is considered further at paragraphs 180183 below.\n\n124.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal has found the issue of Renco's noncompliance with Article 10.18(2)(b) to be extremely difficult to resolve, requiring extensive and intensive deliberations by the Tribunal over many months. This is not only because the issues raised by the Parties are inherently complex, but also because of the severe consequences which would follow for Renco if Peru's plea for dismissal were to be accepted by the Tribunal.\n\n125.\n\nDespite the Tribunal's misgivings about the manner in which Peru's waiver objection was raised, the Tribunal has concluded that it is compelled by its mandate to reach a principled decision as to the consequences of Renco's non-compliance with Article 10.18(2)(b).\n\n126.\n\nIn the process of reaching its decision in this case the Tribunal has given careful consideration to a range of arguments which might weigh against dismissal of Renco's claims in these proceedings. These include:\n\n(a) Whether Renco should be permitted to cure its defective waiver by withdrawing the reservation of rights;\n\n(b) Whether the Tribunal can sever the reservation of rights so as to decide that Renco's waiver complies with Article 10.18(2)(b); and\n\n(c) Whether Peru's arguments and conduct in relation to its waiver objection constitutes an abuse of rights.\n\nEach is discussed in turn below.\n\n*(2) Cure*\n----------\n\n127.\n\nRenco submits that its waiver only suffers from a defect in \"form\" and that it should be entitled to cure this defect by withdrawing the reservation of rights or presenting a new waiver without the reservation of rights. Renco observes that this course of action would cause no prejudice to Peru because Renco has not committed any material breach of the waiver requirement in Article 10.18(2)(b).\n\n128.\n\nRenco submits that investment tribunals have allowed parties to cure \"formal\" (as opposed to \"material\") defects in their written waivers. Renco refers to *Ethyl Corporation v Government of Canada*, where the claimant's waiver was filed together with the statement of claim rather than with the notice of arbitration. The tribunal held that Canada suffered no prejudice as a result of the fact that the waiver was provided late. The delay was \"not of significance for jurisdiction in this case\".21\n\n*Ethyl Corporation v Government of Canada* NAFTA/UNCITRAL Case, Award on Jurisdiction, June 24, 1998 \u00b6\u00b6 89, 91.\n\n129.\n\nRenco also relies on *International Thunderbird Gaming Corp v United Mexican States*, where the facts were the same as in *Ethyl.* The tribunal held that the delay in the provision of the investor's waiver was a mere formal defect, which did not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction:22\n\nAlthough Thunderbird failed to submit the relevant waivers with the Notice of Arbitration, Thunderbird did proceed to remedy that failure by filing those waivers with the [Particularised Statement of Claim]. The Tribunal does not wish to disregard the subsequent filing of those waivers, as to reason otherwise would amount, in the Tribunal's view, to an over-formalistic reading of Article 1121 of the NAFTA. The Tribunal considers indeed that the requirement to include the waivers in the submission of the claim is purely formal, and that a failure to meet such requirement cannot suffice to invalidate the submission of a claim if the so-called failure is remedied at a later stage of the proceedings. The Tribunal joins the view of other NAFTA Tribunals that have found that Chapter Eleven provisions should not be construed in an excessively technical manner.\n\nIn construing Article 1121 of the NAFTA, one must also take into account the rationale and purpose of that article. The consent and waiver requirements set forth in Article 1121 serve a specific purpose, namely to prevent a party from pursuing concurrent domestic and international remedies, which could either give rise to conflicting outcomes (and thus legal uncertainty) or lead to double redress for the same conduct or measure. In the present proceedings, the Tribunal notes that the EDM entities did not initiate or continue any remedies in Mexico while taking part in the present arbitral proceedings. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that Thunderbird has effectively complied with the requirements of Article 1121 of the NAFTA.\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming Corp v United Mexican States*, Ad-hoc UNCTRAL, Award, January 26, 2006 \u00b6\u00b6 116-118.\n\n130.\n\nRenco observes that these decisions are consistent with numerous holdings of the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice, which routinely allow \"formal\" jurisdictional defects to be cured during a proceeding. Renco submits that outright dismissal of Renco's claims would require the Tribunal to construe the waiver requirement in Article 10.18(2)(b) in an excessively technical manner. In Renco's submission, this would be fundamentally unjust and would not further the object and purpose of the waiver requirement itself.\n\n131.\n\nRenco submits that if it were to submit a new claim to arbitration (accompanied by a new waiver without the reservation of rights) Peru may argue that Renco's claims may be barred by the three-year limitation period in Article 10.18(1) of the Treaty. However, if the Tribunal were to allow Renco to cure the defect by withdrawing the reservation of rights, the Tribunal should treat Renco as having complied with the waiver requirement in Article 10.18(2) from the outset of this arbitration.\n\n132.\n\nIn response, Peru submits that the Tribunal is not empowered to grant Renco an opportunity to cure its waiver. In support of this submission, Peru relies on *Railroad Development Corp v Republic of Guatemala*. In this case, the tribunal found that the claimant did not comply with the material requirement of the waiver obligation because it continued to litigate overlapping domestic proceedings after commencing the arbitration. The tribunal refused to allow the claimant to cure this defect by withdrawing the domestic proceedings. The tribunal held as follows:23\n\nThis being a matter pertaining to the consent of the Respondent to this arbitration, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction without the agreement of the parties to grant the Claimant an opportunity to remedy its defective waiver. It is for the Respondent and not the Tribunal to waive a deficiency under Article 10.18 or to allow a defective waiver to be remedied, as the United States did in *Methanex*.\n\n*Railroad Development Corp v Republic of Guatemala* CAFTA-DR/ICSID Case No ARB/07/23, Decision on Objection to Jurisdiction CAFTA Article 10.20.5, November 17, 2008 \u00b6 61.\n\n133.\n\nPeru also relies on the following submission of the United States Government in this arbitration:24\n\nThe discretion whether to permit a claimant to either proceed under or remedy an ineffective waiver lies with the respondent as a function of the respondent's general discretion to consent to arbitration.25 Therefore, while a tribunal may determine whether a waiver complies with the requirements of Article 10.18, a tribunal itself cannot remedy an ineffective waiver. Accordingly, a claim can be submitted, and the arbitration can properly commence, only if a claimant submits an effective waiver. The date of the submission of an effective waiver is the date on which the arbitration commences for purposes of Article 10.18.1.\n\nSecond Submissions of the United States \u00b6 16.\n\nIn support of this proposition, the United States cites *Railroad Development Corp v Republic of Guatemala*.\n\n134.\n\nPeru agrees with the submissions of the United States Government cited above. Therefore, Peru contends that there is a \"subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions\" for the purposes of Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT. Peru submits that only it may waive Renco's non-compliance with the formal requirement of Article 10.18. In this case, Peru has not agreed to disregard Renco's waiver violation.\n\n135.\n\nIn evaluating these contentions, the Tribunal recalls its earlier observation that Article 10.18(2)(b) comprises two distinct elements, namely a *formal* and a *material* requirement. Compliance with *both* elements is a precondition to Peru's consent to arbitrate and to the existence of a valid arbitration agreement. Renco failed to comply with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2)(b) by including the reservation of rights in its waiver. The fact that it has complied with the (different) *material* requirement is beside the point.\n\n136.\n\nEqually, given the clear and specific nature of the pre-conditions to consent in Art 10.18(2), *formal* invalidity is as critical as *material* invalidity. There is certainly no clear basis to downgrade *formal* compliance, or discount it as a pre-condition to consent.\n\n137.\n\nIndeed, as Peru noted in the course of its submissions,26 if anything, the text of Art 10.18(2) gives greater importance to *formal* compliance, than it does to *material* compliance:\n\nIn any event, the existence of a material breach of the waiver requirement is independent of Renco's formal violation, either one of which alone is fatal to Renco's claims. Contrary to Renco's suggestion, the formal requirement is as important, if not more important, than its material counterpart. In fact, it is the formal requirement that is expressed in the language of the Treaty itself: while the Treaty expressly provides in what form a waiver must be submitted, and specifically provides for the sole reservation that may be made by a claimant, the Treaty does not expressly state that the State's consent is conditioned upon the claimant's compliance with the terms of the waiver. Rather, that condition can be discerned from reading the language of the waiver requirement in context and in light of the Treaty's object and purpose and, thus, tribunals consistently have so interpreted the requirement, as reflected in the jurisprudence. Accordingly, there is no basis to construe the so-called \"formal\" requirement of the waiver any less strictly than the \"material\" requirement; if a violation of the latter requires dismissal, as tribunals unanimously have found, then a violation of the former does as well, as the Treaty expressly states and as both Parties to the Treaty have confirmed.\n\nPeru's submission of September 30, 2015.\n\n138.\n\nThe inevitable conclusion, therefore, is that no arbitration agreement ever came into existence. In the Tribunal's opinion, given the unequivocal language of Art 10.18(2), this is not a trivial defect which can be easily brushed aside\u2014the defective waiver goes to the heart of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n139.\n\n*Ethyl* and *Thunderbird* were both concerned with the proper interpretation of Article 1121 of NAFTA. The issue in each case was whether the requirement that the waiver \"shall be included in the submission of a claim to arbitration\" meant that the waiver had to be supplied with the notice of arbitration or with the statement of claim. In *Ethyl*, the tribunal concluded that the investor's compliance with Article 1121 was a prerequisite to the admissibility of its claims and not a precondition to jurisdiction. The tribunal held as follows:27\n\nCanada's contention that [the submission of a waiver with the Notice of Arbitration is] a precondition to jurisdiction, as opposed to a prerequisite to admissibility, is not borne out by the text of Article 1121, which must govern. Article 1121(3), instead of saying \"shall be included in the submission of a claim to arbitration\" \u2014 in itself a broadly encompassing concept \u2014 could have said \"shall be included with the Notice of Arbitration\" if the drastically preclusive effect for which Canada argues truly were intended. The Tribunal therefore concludes that jurisdiction here is not absent due to Claimant's having provided the consent and waivers necessary under Article 1121 with its Statement of Claim rather than with its Notice of Arbitration.\n\n*Ethyl Corporation v Government of Canada* NAFTA/UNCITRAL Case, Award on Jurisdiction, June 24, 1998 \u00b6 91.\n\n140.\n\nIn the present case, Article 10.18(2) of the Treaty provides that \"[n]o claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless. the notice of arbitration is accompanied... by the claimant's written waiver\". It would therefore appear that the text of Article 10.18(2) is much more explicit than the text of Article 1121 of NAFTA.\n\n141.\n\nIndeed, Peru observes that, since the publication of the 2004 United States Model BIT, the United States has amended the waiver language in its treaties, including in Article 10.18(2) of the Treaty and in the DR-CAFTA, to expressly state that the waiver must accompany \"the notice of arbitration\". Moreover, the title of the waiver provision also was amended by including in the title of Article 10.18 of the Treaty (as well as in the equivalent provisions of the DR-CAFTA and the US Model BIT) the word \"consent\".\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal is constrained to conclude, therefore, that the submission of a formally compliant waiver (and the material obligation to abstain from initiating or continuing proceedings in a domestic court) is a precondition to the State's \"consent\" to arbitrate and to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the *Ethyl* and *Thunderbird* decisions cannot assist Renco in the present case because of the differences between the text of Article 10.18 of the Treaty and Article 1121 of NAFTA.\n\n143.\n\nA further comment may be appropriate here as to the concern expressed in *Thunderbird* that \"overly formalistic\" or \"excessively technical\" approaches should be avoided. This is obviously of no assistance here, given (a) the non-superfluous nature of Renco's reservation, and (b) the specific requirements of Article 10.18(2) of the Treaty. Further, the tribunal in *Thunderbird* cannot be taken to have laid down a general proposition that *formal* defects in a waiver can never invalidate a submission to arbitration, or can always be remedied at a later stage. The decision in that case seems to have turned upon the highly technical and insignificant nature of the defect that was in issue (the untimely filing of certain waivers on behalf of the claimant's enterprises that had been \"inadvertently missing from earlier filings\", and were submitted with the Particularised Statement of Claim, well before Mexico raised any objection to jurisdiction and years before the hearing), which was all the more insignificant when set against the different language of NAFTA. Unlike the position in that case, there is no suggestion here that Renco's reservation in its waiver was inadvertent, and as explained earlier it is certainly not insignificant.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to consider the decisions of the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice cited by Renco. Article 10.22(1) of the Treaty provides that \"the tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law\". Furthermore, when interpreting the Treaty, the Tribunal must take into account \"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\" under Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT. The relevant rules of international law include general principles of law recognised by civilised nations. Furthermore, decisions of the International Court and the Permanent Court are \"a subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law\" (see Articles 38(1)(c) and (d) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice).\n\n145.\n\nRenco places reliance upon the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Case of the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions*. In this case, Greece had commenced proceedings against the United Kingdom under the Treaty of Lausanne before the Treaty had been ratified by the States Parties. The Treaty was subsequently ratified shortly after proceedings were commenced. However, the United Kingdom contended that the Permanent Court lacked jurisdiction at the time when proceedings were commenced.\n\n146.\n\nThe Court rejected the submission of the United Kingdom and held as follows:28\n\nEven assuming that before that time the Court had no jurisdiction because the international obligation referred to in Article II was not yet effective, it would always have been possible for the applicant to re-submit his application in the same terms after the coming into force of the Treaty of Lausanne, and in that case, the argument in question could not have been advanced. Even if the grounds on which the institution of proceedings was based were defective for the reason stated, this would not be an adequate reason for the dismissal of the applicant's suit. The Court, whose jurisdiction is international, is not bound to attach to matters of form the same degree of importance which they might possess in municipal law. Even, therefore, if the application were premature because the Treaty of Lausanne had not yet been ratified, this circumstance would now be covered by the subsequent deposit of the necessary ratifications.\n\n*Case of the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v United Kingdom)*, Judgment, August 30, 1924 PCIJ Series A, No. 2 at 34.\n\n147.\n\nThe *Mavrommatis* doctrine has been applied by the International Court of Justice on several occasions, in particular in the *Case Concerning the Application of the* *Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.*29 Serbia's first preliminary objection in this case was based upon Article 35(1) of the Statute of the Court, which provides as follows: \"The Court shall be open to the states parties to the present Statute\".\n\n*Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v Serbia)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, November 18, 2008 [2008] ICJ Reports 412.\n\n148.\n\nSerbia contended that it was not a Member of the United Nations (and thus not a party to the Statute of the Court) when Croatia commenced its proceedings on 2 July 1999. The Court was therefore not \"open\" to Serbia within the meaning of Article 35(1). The fact that Serbia later became a party to the Statute of the Court on 1 November 2000, as a result of its admission to the United Nations, was said by Serbia to be irrelevant.\n\n149.\n\nThe International Court rejected Serbia's submission. The Court accepted that, in general, fulfilment of the conditions in Article 35(1) had to be assessed when the application was filed. However, the Court explained that it had \"shown realism and flexibility in certain situations in which the conditions governing the Court's jurisdiction were not fully satisfied when proceedings were initiated but were subsequently satisfied, before the Court ruled on its jurisdiction\". The Court referred to the *Mavrommatis* case and held that the decisive question was as follows:30\n\nWhat matters is that, at the latest by the date when the Court decides on its jurisdiction, the applicant must be entitled, if it so wishes, to bring fresh proceedings in which the initially unmet condition would be fulfilled. In such a situation, it is not in the interests of the sound administration of justice to compel the applicant to begin the proceedings anew \u2014 or to initiate fresh proceedings \u2014 and it is preferable, except in special circumstances, to conclude that the condition has, from that point on, been fulfilled.\n\n*Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v Serbia)*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, November 18, 2008 [2008] ICJ Reports 412 at 441. The Court also observed that \"it is concern for judicial economy, an element of the requirements of the sound administration of justice, which justifies application of the jurisprudence deriving from the *Mavrommatis* Judgment in appropriate cases. The purpose of this jurisprudence is to prevent the needless proliferation of proceedings\" (at 443).\n\n150.\n\nThe Court found there was no reason why the initial defect in Croatia's application could not be \"cured by a subsequent event in the course of the proceedings, for example when that party acquires the status of party to the Statute of the Court which it initially lacked\". The Court found that it would not be in the interests of the sound administration of justice to require Croatia to initiate fresh proceedings.31 Accordingly, the Court dismissed Serbia's objection to jurisdiction.\n\nIbid at 442.\n\n151.\n\nThe question which arises for determination is whether the *Mavrommatis* doctrine can be applied to the facts of the present case. The Tribunal observes that in the *Mavrommatis* and *Genocide* cases the jurisdictional defect was cured as a result of a subsequent event occurring during the proceedings, namely the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne on which the Court's jurisdiction was based (in the *Mavrommatis* case) and the admission of Serbia to the United Nations resulting in its accession to the Statute of the International Court of Justice (in the *Genocide* case).\n\n152.\n\nIn the present case, however, the jurisdictional defect (Renco's non-compliance with Article 10.18(2)(b)) remains uncured. This jurisdictional defect could only be cured (a) if Renco took the positive step of withdrawing the reservation of rights, or submitting a new waiver without the reservation of rights, and Peru consented to this by way of a variation of Article 10.18(2)(b) of the Treaty, or (b) if Renco commenced a new arbitration together with a waiver without any reservation of rights.\n\n153.\n\nOption (a) here does not arise, in the absence of consent by Peru.\n\n154.\n\nOption (b) remains a possible course (putting aside any limitation issue under Article 10.18(1) of the Treaty). Given that, on this basis, Renco would be entitled to cure the defect itself, and unilaterally, by the commencement of a new arbitration, the question arises as to whether, applying the *Mavrommatis* doctrine, it might be said that it would not be in the interests of the sound administration of justice to compel Renco to begin a new proceeding.\n\n155.\n\nThe United States and Peru contend that there is a \"subsequent agreement\" regarding the interpretation of Article 10.18 to the effect that neither Renco nor the Tribunal can remedy a defective waiver and that the date for submitting an effective waiver is the date on which the arbitration commences. On this basis, Peru would appear to contend that the *Mavrommatis* doctrine is inapplicable to the facts of the present case.\n\n156.\n\nIn its Decision on Scope, the Tribunal observed that it credits the views of both State Parties with the highest respect. However, the Tribunal is not bound by the views of either State Party. Although the Tribunal must \"take into account\" any subsequent agreement between the State Parties pursuant to Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT, the proper interpretation of Article 10.18 and how it should be applied to the facts of this case are tasks which reside exclusively with this Tribunal.32\n\nScope Decision \u00b6\u00b6 172-174.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal is faced with an apparent conflict between the interpretation of Article 10.18 adopted by the United States and Peru and the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice as evidenced in the *Mavrommatis* doctrine. Having given careful consideration to the matter, the Tribunal has felt constrained to conclude that the clear and express language of Article 10.18 of the Treaty, as well as its object and purpose, establishes a *lex specialis* which must prevail over, or in any event precludes, the *Mavrommatis* doctrine. (This conclusion is made by a majority of the Tribunal as one member is not persuaded that Renco could not unilaterally cure its defective waiver.)\n\n158.\n\nUnder Article 10.18, the submission of a valid waiver is a condition and limitation on Peru's consent to arbitrate. This is a precondition to the initial existence of a valid arbitration agreement, and as such leads to a clear timing issue: if no compliant waiver is served with the notice of arbitration, Peru's offer to arbitrate has not been accepted; there is no arbitration agreement; and the Tribunal is without any authority whatsoever. If the Tribunal applied the *Mavrommatis* doctrine, the Tribunal would be exercising powers it simply does not have (because there is no arbitration agreement, and so the Tribunal is not a tribunal). In effect, it would be creating, retrospectively, an arbitration agreement for the Parties when no agreement had ever come into existence. To put it colloquially, the Tribunal would be \"pulling itself up by its own bootstraps\" in order to create jurisdiction when none existed. In the Tribunal's considered opinion, this would be entirely unprincipled and obviously impermissible.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the conclusion it has reached is consistent with the decision in *Detroit International Bridge Company v Canada*. In this case, the claimant's waiver expressly carved out claims pending between the parties in the so-called \"Washington Litigation\". The tribunal found that the claims in the Washington Litigation covered the same grounds as the measures challenged in the NAFTA arbitration. The claimant's waiver was therefore held to be defective. The claimant then withdrew its claim for damages in the Washington Litigation and filed a second waiver but still purported to carve out the Washington Litigation from the scope of its waiver. The tribunal found that the submission of the new waiver could not:33\n\n... retroactively validate several months of proceedings during which the Tribunal wholly lacked jurisdiction but had some kind of potential existence that might have been realized if it had acquired jurisdiction at some subsequent date. The lack of a valid waiver precluded the existence of a valid agreement between the disputing parties to arbitrate; and the lack of such an agreement deprived the Tribunal of the very basis of its existence.\n\n*Detroit International Bridge Company v Canada* NAFTA/PCA Case No 2012-25, Award on Jurisdiction, April 2, 2015 \u00b6 321.\n\n160.\n\nFor all of the reasons set out above, therefore, the Tribunal has concluded that Renco cannot unilaterally cure its defective waiver by withdrawing the reservation of rights. (This conclusion is made by a majority of the Tribunal as one member is not persuaded that Renco could not unilaterally cure its defective waiver.)\n\n*(3) Severance*\n---------------\n\n161.\n\nOn September 27, 2015, after the Tribunal had commenced its deliberations, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties to observe that neither Party had addressed the relevance, if any, of the principle of severability in connection with the question of the legal effect of the reservation contained in Renco's waiver. The Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on whether this principle could be applied so as to allow the reservation of rights to be severed from the remainder of Renco's waiver.\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal received extensive submissions from the Parties, as well as the United States, in relation to the principle of severability. The Tribunal observes that the principle that non-essential invalid conditions can be severed from the instruments in which they are contained was endorsed by Judge Lauterpacht in his Separate Opinion in the *Norwegian Loans* case. Judge Lauterpacht held that:34\n\n... it is legitimate\u2014and perhaps obligatory\u2014to sever an invalid condition from the rest of the instrument and to treat the latter as valid provided that having regard to the intention of the parties and the nature of the instrument the condition in question does not constitute an essential part of the instrument. *Utile non debet per inutile vitiari*. The same applies also to provisions and reservations relating to the jurisdiction of the Court. It would be consistent with the previous practice of the Court that it should, if only possible, uphold its jurisdiction when such a course is compatible with the intention of the parties and that it should not allow its jurisdiction to be defeated as the result of remediable defects of expression which are not of an essential character.\n\n*Case Concerning Certain Norwegian Loans (France v Norway)* [1957] ICJ Reports 9 at 56-57. See also *Interhandel (Switzerland v United States of America)* [1959] ICJ Rep 6 at 116-117 (Separate Opinion of Judge Lauterpacht).\n\n163.\n\nAs Renco points out, several investment tribunals have cited the severability principle when discussing the separability of an arbitration agreement from the contract in which it is contained such that a finding that the main contract is invalid does not necessarily entail the invalidity of the arbitration agreement.35 This is a well-established concept in the domestic arbitration laws of a large number of States which have adopted the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration.36\n\n*Daimler Financial Services AG v Argentina* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award, August 22, 2012 \u00b6 221; *Impregilo S.p.A. v Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Brigitte Stern, June 21, 2011 \u00b6 31; *ICS Inspection and Control Services Ltd v Argentina*, PCA Case No. 2010-09, Award on Jurisdiction, February 10, 2012 \u00b6 290; *CCL v Kazakhstan*, SCC Case No. 122/2001, Jurisdictional Award, January 1, 2003 \u00b6 29. See also *The Government of Sudan v The Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (Abyei Arbitration)*, Final Award, July 22, 2009 \u00b6\u00b6 416-424.\n\nSee UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (1985), Article 16(1).\n\n164.\n\nThe severability principle has also been applied by several international courts and tribunals in the context of State reservations to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights.37 Furthermore, the International Law Commission, in its 2011 study on treaty reservations, surveyed a wide range of state practice and endorsed a \"rebuttable presumption, according to which the treaty would apply to a State or international organization that is the author of an invalid reservation, notwithstanding that reservation, in the absence of a contrary intention on the part of the author\".38 However, the Commission observed that its recommendation \"form[ed] part of the cautious progressive development of international law\".\n\n*Loizidou v Turkey* Application No. 15318/89, Judgment of March 23, 1995, Series A, No. 310; *Belilos v Switzerland* Application No. 10323/83, Judgment of April 29, 1988. See also *Hilaire v Trinidad and Tobago*, Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Judgment of September 1, 2001, Series C, No. 80 \u00b6 98.\n\nReport of the International Law Commission, 63rd Session *Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties*, UN Doc A/66/10/Add.1 at 525-542 (guideline 4.5.3).\n\n165.\n\nPeru submits that the severability principle does not apply in the investor-state context. Peru submits that, unlike claimants seeking to accept a State's offer to arbitrate under an investment treaty, States entering into treaties are entitled to make reservations provided that they comply with Article 19 of the VCLT. Peru also submits that the severability principle is not universally accepted. Peru points out that an alternative approach is to find that a reservation contrary to the object and purpose of a treaty may result in the \"total invalidity\" of the treaty for the State making the reservation. Peru argues that this approach is most similar to the practice of international investment tribunals, which have determined that a claimant's failure to abide by the terms of State's offer to arbitrate in a treaty results in the invalidity of the arbitration agreement.\n\n166.\n\nPeru submits that, even if Renco's reservation of rights were deemed to be a nonessential part of its waiver, severance of the reservation of rights would infringe upon Peru's sovereignty because Peru was not obligated to extend an offer to arbitrate to claimants and did so only on condition that the offer be accepted, without reservation, at the time of the filing of the Notice of Arbitration. Furthermore, Peru argues that\u2014unlike the European Convention of Human Rights, which may have the objective of exercising jurisdiction over as many States as possible in order to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms\u2014investment tribunals have no mandate to expand the scope of a State's offer to arbitrate.\n\n167.\n\nFinally, Peru submits that the application of the severability principle in the present context would have radically different consequences. In the context of State reservations to treaties, the severability principle operates against the interests of the State making the reservation by preventing the State from escaping jurisdiction as a result of its reservation of rights. In the present context, the application of the severability principle would operate to the benefit of an investor and against the interests of the respondent State whose consent is conditioned upon the submission of a valid waiver at the time of the submission of the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n168.\n\nFor its part, the United States submits that the principle of severability is not a generally accepted rule of international law or custom. The United States points out that it has consistently maintained that a reserving State cannot be bound without its consent to a treaty without the benefit of its reservation. The United States submits as follows:\n\nTo apply the proposed \"principle of severability\" in order to sever an invalid reservation of rights in a claimant's waiver would defeat the purpose of the Agreement's arbitration provisions. It would alter the conditions of the respondent's offer to arbitrate and deprive the waiver provision of its intended purpose, thereby exposing the respondent to the risk of having to litigate, even temporarily, concurrently in multiple fora.\n\n169.\n\nRenco contends that the severability principle is a general principle of international law, as demonstrated by the authorities set out above. Renco submits that it does not consider its reservation as important or essential to its consent. Renco submits that the Tribunal should therefore sever the non-essential reservation of rights from its waiver. On this basis, Renco submits that it should be treated as if it had complied with the Treaty's waiver requirements from the outset of this arbitration even though any defect will have been eliminated at a point in time after Peru received Renco's Amended Notice of Arbitration.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the severability principle has been applied by international courts and tribunals in the context of State reservations to treaties or reservations contained in declarations by States accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of an international court. The principle has also been cited by investment tribunals in the context of the severability of an arbitration agreement from the main contract in which such an agreement is contained. However, the principle has not been applied by an investor-state tribunal in order to sever invalid language from a claimant's written waiver.\n\n171.\n\nThe Tribunal also observes that States are entitled, by virtue of their sovereignty, to apply such reservations to treaties as are permitted by Article 19 of the VCLT. Investors have no equivalent power to insert reservations into their acceptances of a State's standing offer to arbitrate under an investment treaty. In a system of arbitration without privity, a State is entitled to \"shape its consent as it sees fit by providing the conditions under which it is given\u2014in other words, the conditions subject to which an \u2018offer to arbitrate' is made to the foreign investors\".39\n\n*ST-AD GmbH v Bulgaria* PCA Case No. 2011-06 (ST-BG), Award on Jurisdiction, July 18, 2013 \u00b6 337.\n\n172.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to conclude that severability was a general principle of international law and that Renco's reservation of rights was a non-essential component of the waiver, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the severability principle could be applied in the particular context of this case. This is because of the same timing issue set out above. The Tribunal has concluded that no arbitration agreement ever came into existence as a result of Renco's non-compliance with Article 10.18(2)(b). If the severability principle were applied to sever the reservation of rights from Renco's waiver, the Tribunal would be assuming (incorrectly) that it is a valid tribunal with authority, and in effect creating an arbitration agreement for the Parties. The Tribunal would face the same \"bootstraps\" obstacle which it encountered in relation to the application of the *Mavrommatis* doctrine.\n\n173.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that it has no power to sever the reservation of rights from Renco's waiver and remedy Renco's non-compliance with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2)(b).\n\n*(4) Abuse of rights*\n---------------------\n\n174.\n\nRenco's final argument, raised briefly in its final written submission to the Tribunal, is that Peru's arguments and conduct in relation to its waiver objection constitute an abuse of rights. Renco submits that the abuse of rights doctrine proscribes the exercise of a legitimate legal right for improper or abusive purposes or to evade an obligation. As stated by Bin Cheng:40\n\nThe reasonable and bona fide exercise of a right implies an exercise which is genuinely in pursuit of those interests which the right is destined to protect and which is not calculated to cause any unfair prejudice to the legitimate interests of another State, whether these interests be secured by treaty or by general international law.\n\nBin Cheng *General Principles of Law as applied by International Courts and Tribunals* (CUP, 1987) at 131132.\n\n175.\n\nThe abuse of rights doctrine is an aspect of the principle of good faith and is a well-established general principle of international law. The doctrine has been cited and applied on numerous occasions by international courts and tribunals.41 The development of the abuse of rights doctrine in international law is discussed in detail in *Venezuela Holdings BV v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*.42 The tribunal observed that many ICSID tribunals have considered whether the conduct of an investor who engages in a corporate restructuring to obtain the benefit of investment treaty protection commits \"an abuse of the convention purposes\", \"an abuse of legal personality\", an \"abuse of corporate form\" or an \"abuse of the system of international investment protection\".43\n\nFor example, Peru invoked the abuse of rights doctrine in the *Tacna-Arica* arbitration: *The Tacna-Arica* *Question (Chile v Peru*) (1925) II RIAA 921. The arbitrator, President Calvin Coolidge, found that Chile had committed an abuse of authority in the disputed provinces of Tacna and Arica, which were subject to Chilean authority under the Treaty of Anc\u00f3n. President Coolidge found that \"in a considerable number of cases, particularly in the year 1923, the Chilean conscription laws have been used not so much for the obtaining of recruits. but with the result, if not the purpose, of driving young Peruvians from the provinces. So far as this has been done, the Arbitrator holds it to be an abuse of Chilean authority\" (at 941).\n\n*Venezuela Holdings BV v Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010 \u00b6\u00b6 169-185.\n\nIbid \u00b6 176.\n\n176.\n\nThe abuse of rights doctrine is not restricted to the exercise of treaty rights by investors. In *Saipem SpA v The People's Republic of Bangladesh*, the tribunal observed that \"[i]t is generally acknowledged in international law that a State exercising a right for a purpose that is different from that for which that right was created commits an abuse of rights\".44 The tribunal concluded that the Bangladeshi courts had abused their supervisory jurisdiction over the arbitration process by revoking the authority of an ICC tribunal despite any showing of misconduct.\n\n*Saipem SpA v The People's Republic of Bangladesh* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Award, 30 June 2009 \u00b6 160.\n\n177.\n\nIt is clear that the threshold for establishing an abuse of rights is high. As the arbitral tribunal put it in *Chevron Corp v Republic of Ecuador* :45\n\n[I]n all legal systems, the doctrines of abuse of rights, estoppel and waiver are subject to a high threshold. Any right leads normally and automatically to a claim for its holder. It is only in very exceptional circumstances that a holder of a right can nevertheless not raise and enforce the resulting claim. The high threshold also results from the seriousness of a charge of bad faith amounting to abuse of process. As Judge Higgins stated in her 2003 Separate Opinion in the *Oil Platforms* case, there is \"a general agreement that the graver the charge the more confidence must there be in the evidence relied on.\"\n\n*Chevron Corp v Republic of Ecuador* PCA Case No. AA 277, Interim Award, 1 December 2008 \u00b6 143, citing *Case Concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic Republic of Iran v United States of America)* Judgment, November 6, 2006 [2006] ICJ Rep 225, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins \u00b6 33.\n\n178.\n\nRenco submits that Peru's abuse of rights in the present case is clear: Peru suffers no prejudice as a result of the reservation of rights in Renco's waiver. At the hearing, the Tribunal asked Peru whether it would suffer any prejudice in this case if the Tribunal were to \"write [the additional language] out, in effect, make it disappear\".46 Peru responded that the Tribunal lacked the power to do so, but it did not articulate any prejudice that it would suffer.47\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 63.\n\nHearing Transcript, pp. 63-66.\n\n179.\n\nRenco submits that there is no scenario in which the additional language prevents the waiver provision in the Treaty from having its full force and effect. In these circumstances, Renco submits that Peru's motive is not to ensure that its waiver rights are respected or that the waiver provision's objectives are served. Rather, Renco submits that Peru's true motive is to evade its duty to arbitrate Renco's claims under the Treaty. Because that it is an improper motive, Renco submits that Peru's objections are an abuse of rights.\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal has already referred to the fact that it has been troubled by the manner in which Peru's waiver objection arose in this arbitration. Renco's Notice of Arbitration was filed on April 4, 2011 and its Amended Notice of Arbitration was filed on August 9, 2011. Both documents contained Renco's waiver, including the reservation of rights. Yet Renco's compliance with the formal and material requirements of Article 10.18(2)(b) was not put in issue until Peru filed its Notification of Preliminary Objections on March 21, 2014, nearly three years after Renco had submitted its claims to arbitration. Under the heading \"Renco's violation of the Treaty's waiver provision\", Peru made the following submissions:\n\nAs Peru will discuss and amplify in its submissions, Renco has presented an invalid waiver in this proceeding because it does not conform with the language required by the Treaty, and that Doe Run Peru S.R.Ltda. (\"Doe Run Peru\") was required to submit a waiver and improperly purported to withdraw its waiver submitted with Claimants' Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim of April 4, 2011. In addition, through the initiation and continuation of certain proceedings with respect to measures alleged to constitute a breach by Renco, both Renco and Doe Run Peru also have violated the waiver requirement.\n\nPursuant to the Treaty, Peru's consent, and therefore the Tribunal's jurisdiction, is subject to the submission of valid waivers by Renco and Doe Run Peru, which are lacking here. This objection thus clearly falls within the scope of Article 10.20.4.\n\n181.\n\nAlthough Peru submitted in this document that Renco's waiver \"does not conform with the language required by the Treaty\", the focus of Peru's waiver objections appeared to have been the absence of a written waiver by DRP and the conduct of the Peruvian bankruptcy proceedings, rather than the inclusion of the reservation of rights in Renco's waiver.\n\n182.\n\nIndeed, while Peru had complained to Renco many years ago that it considered the domestic Peruvian bankruptcy proceedings involving DRP violated Article 10.18(2), Peru did not raise any clear and specific objection in relation to Renco's reservation of rights until Peru filed its Comments on the submission of the United States of America on September 10, 2014. At paragraph 30, Peru submitted that Renco had violated the Treaty's waiver requirements because:\n\n(i) Renco and its affiliate, Doe Run Peru, filed waivers that impermissibly reserved the right to bring claims in other fora; (ii) Renco later filed a separate waiver that contained the same reservation...\n\n183.\n\nThis submission was not developed in any depth until Peru filed its Memorial on Waiver in July 2015, where Renco's compliance with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2)(b), by reason of the reservation of rights, was placed squarely in issue.\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that Renco failed to comply with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2) and that it has no power to allow Renco to cure this defect (as noted above, one member of the Tribunal did not join in this conclusion) or to sever the reservation of rights. However, the consequences for Renco may be extreme in the following scenario. If Renco should decide to file a new Notice of Arbitration accompanied by a \"clean\" waiver, Peru may be minded to argue that Renco's claims have become time-barred because more than three years have elapsed since Renco first acquired knowledge of the breaches alleged under Article 10.16(1) of the Treaty.\n\n185.\n\nIn these circumstances, while the possible operation of a 3 year time bar on the facts of this case cannot change the analysis of Article 10.18(2)(b) (i.e. the analysis must be the same, even if the objection had been raised at the outset of the arbitration), the question which arises is whether Peru's conduct with regard to the late raising of its waiver objection rises to the level of an abuse of rights. The test to be applied is whether Peru has sought to raise this objection for an improper motive or \u2014 as Renco puts it, whether Peru is seeking to evade its duty to arbitrate Renco's claims under the Treaty rather than ensure that its waiver rights are respected or that the waiver provision's objectives are served.\n\n186.\n\nHaving considered the issue with great care, the Tribunal has concluded that, in raising its waiver objection, Peru has sought to vindicate its right to receive a waiver which complies with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2)(b) and a waiver which does not undermine the object and purpose of that Article. In so finding, the Tribunal does not accept the contention that Peru's waiver objection is tainted by an ulterior motive to evade its duty to arbitrate Renco's claims. Indeed, Peru has no duty to arbitrate Renco's claims under the Treaty unless Renco submits a waiver which complies with Article 10.18(2)(b).\n\n187.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal does not wish to rule out the possibility that an abuse of rights might be found to exist if Peru were to argue in any future proceeding that Renco's claims were now time-barred under Article 10.18(1). To date, Peru has suffered no material prejudice as a result of the reservation of rights in Renco's waiver. However, Renco would suffer material prejudice if Peru were to claim in any subsequent arbitration that Renco's claims were now time-barred under Article 10.18(1).\n\n188.\n\nWhile this Tribunal cannot prevent Peru from exercising in the future what it then considers to be its legal rights, the Tribunal can, and it does, admonish Peru to bear in mind, if that scenario should arise, Renco's submission that Peru's conduct with respect to its late raising of the waiver objection constitutes an abuse of rights. In the unanimous view of the Tribunal, justice would be served if Peru accepted that time stopped running for the purposes of Article 10.18(1) when Renco filed its Amended Notice of Arbitration on August 9, 2011.\n\n*(5) Conclusion*\n----------------\n\n189.\n\nIt follows from the Tribunal's findings in this section of the Partial Award that Renco has failed to establish the requirements for Peru's consent to arbitrate under the Treaty. Renco's claims must therefore be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n**F. Other Objections**\n-----------------------\n\n190.\n\nIn the light of the Tribunal's conclusion that Renco has failed to comply with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2)(b) of the Treaty, the Tribunal concludes that it is unnecessary to consider Peru's second contention, namely that Renco has failed to comply with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2) because DRP has not provided a waiver in Renco's Amended Notice of Arbitration. It is also unnecessary to consider Peru's further contentions regarding DRP's conduct in the Peruvian bankruptcy proceedings. The Tribunal therefore expresses no view on these matters.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal defers the question of costs and invites the Parties to present written submissions on costs within 30 days of the date of this Partial Award.\n\n**VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS**\n--------------------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal is conscious that these proceedings have been on foot for some years. In reaching the decision to now dismiss Renco's claims, the Tribunal has not done so lightly. Careful consideration over a number of months has been given to each of the many helpful and challenging submissions provided by counsel for both sides. The Tribunal wishes to express its sincere gratitude to counsel for their high degree of professionalism throughout this period.\n\n**VII. FORMAL AWARD**\n---------------------\n\n193.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, and rejecting all submissions, claims and counterclaims to the contrary, the Tribunal **HEREBY FINDS DECLARES AND AWARDS** as follows. But for the view of one Member of the Tribunal that Renco should have been permitted to cure its defective waiver by withdrawing the reservation of rights (paragraph (b) below), all other conclusions of the Tribunal are unanimous.\n\n(a) Renco has failed to comply with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2)(b) by including the reservation of rights in the waiver accompanying its Amended Notice of Arbitration because:\n\n(i) The reservation of rights is not permitted by the express terms of Article 10.18(2)(b);\n\n(ii) The reservation of rights undermines the object and purpose of Article 10.18(2)(b);\n\n(iii) The reservation of rights is incompatible with the \"no U-turn\" structure of Article 10.18(2)(b); and\n\n(iv) The reservation of rights is not superfluous.\n\n(b) Renco cannot unilaterally cure its defective waiver by withdrawing the reservation of rights.\n\n(c) The Tribunal has no power to sever the reservation of rights from Renco's waiver and remedy Renco's non-compliance with Article 10.18(2)(b).\n\n(d) Peru's waiver objection is not tainted by any ulterior motive to evade its duty to arbitrate Renco's claims.\n\n(e) It follows that Renco has failed to establish the requirements for Peru's consent to arbitrate under the Treaty.\n\n(f) Renco's claims must therefore be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n194.\n\nThe Tribunal hereby reserves the question of costs pending receipt of submissions from the Parties after which the Tribunal will render a Final Award."}, {"Title": "Final Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2016-11-09T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Final Award\n-----------\n\n**I.

THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn July 15, 2016 the Tribunal issued its Partial Award on Jurisdiction (\" **Partial Award** \"). The Tribunal made the following findings:1\n\n(a) Renco has failed to comply with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2)(b) by including the reservation of rights in the waiver accompanying its Amended Notice of Arbitration because:\n\n(i) The reservation of rights is not permitted by the express terms of Article 10.18(2)(b);\n\n(ii) The reservation of rights undermines the object and purpose of Article 10.18(2)(b);\n\n(iii) The reservation of rights is incompatible with the \"no U-turn\" structure of Article 10.18(2)(b); and\n\n(iv) The reservation of rights is not superfluous.\n\n(b) Renco cannot unilaterally cure its defective waiver by withdrawing the reservation of rights.\n\n(c) The Tribunal has no power to sever the reservation of rights from Renco's waiver and remedy Renco's non-compliance with Article 10.18(2)(b).\n\n(d) Peru's waiver objection is not tainted by any ulterior motive to evade its duty to arbitrate Renco's claims.\n\n(e) It follows that Renco has failed to establish the requirements for Peru's consent to arbitrate under the Treaty.\n\n(f) Renco's claims must therefore be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nPartial Award on Jurisdiction dated July 15, 2016 \u00b6 193.\n\n10.\n\nIn the Partial Award, the Tribunal reserved its decision on the question of costs and invited the Parties to present supplementary written submissions on this issue.2\n\nIbid \u00b6\u00b6 191, 194.\n\n11.\n\nOn August 15, 2016 the Parties filed their respective submissions on costs (\" **Renco's Submission on Costs** \" and \" **Peru's Submission on Costs** \").\n\n12.\n\nOn 9 September 2016 the Parties filed brief further comments on the issue of costs (\" **Renco's Further Submission on Costs** \" and \" **Peru's Further Submission on Costs** \").\n\n13.\n\nFollowing a series of further exchanges between the Parties, on September 2, 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties to provide both sides with a final opportunity to make written submissions on the issue of costs on or before September 9, 2016. No further submissions were received from the Parties.\n\n**IV. THE APPLICABLE RULES**\n----------------------------\n\n14.\n\nArticle 10.26(1) of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\nA tribunal may also award costs and attorney's fees in accordance with this Section and the applicable arbitration rules.\n\n15.\n\nThe UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (as revised in 2010) (\" **UNCITRAL Rules** \") are the applicable procedural rules. The relevant provisions of the UNCITRAL Rules are as follows:\n\n**Article 40**\n\n1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems appropriate, in another decision.\n\n2. The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;\n\n(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\n\n[...]\n\n**Article 42**\n\n1. The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.\n\n**V. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Renco's Submissions**\n--------------------------\n\n16.\n\nRenco seeks reimbursement of all recoverable fees and expenses in connection with the filing of its Memorial on Liability dated February 20, 2014 (\" **Memorial on Liability** \"), including the witness statements and expert reports filed simultaneously with Claimant's memorial. Renco submits that Peru's delay in raising its jurisdictional waiver objection caused Renco to incur the substantial and unnecessary expense of a full merits filing and that Peru should bear Renco's costs in this regard.\n\n17.\n\nBeyond an order of costs against Peru with respect to Renco's merits filing, Renco submits that each Party should be ordered to bear the costs of its own legal representation and assistance and that each Party should be ordered to bear half of the costs of the Tribunal and the administering authority. Renco submits that the Tribunal has wide discretion to depart from the \"costs follow the event\" presumption established by Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. Renco submits that the Tribunal should depart from the presumption for three reasons:\n\n(a) First, Peru's conduct in connection with the delay in raising the waiver objection unnecessarily increased Renco's costs;\n\n(b) Second, the issues regarding Peru's objection to Renco's reservation of rights were novel and complex; and\n\n(c) Third, while Peru prevailed on issues relating to the waiver objection, Peru failed on other issues which were decided by the Tribunal and the Tribunal did not rule on many other issues which were briefed by the Parties.\n\n18.\n\nRenco states that it has incurred costs of USD 3,836,067.63 in preparing its Memorial on Liability. This sum is comprised of the following amounts:\n\n(a) Counsel's fees - USD 3,178,789.95;\n\n(b) Experts - USD 429,813.95; and\n\n(c) Disbursements - USD 227,463.73.\n\n19.\n\nRenco states that it has incurred costs of USD 749,354.30 in preparing its Article 10.20(4) Scope submission. This sum is comprised of the following amounts:\n\n(a) Counsel's fees - USD 720,420.94.\n\n(b) Disbursements - USD 28,933.36.\n\n20.\n\nRenco asks the Tribunal to render an award on costs:\n\n(a) Ordering Peru to pay Renco USD 3,836,067.63 for the costs that Renco incurred preparing its Memorial on Liability;\n\n(b) Ordering each Party to bear all other costs of their own legal representation and assistance (i.e. all costs other than the USD 3,836,067.63 referenced immediately above); and\n\n(c) Ordering each Party to bear half of the costs of the Tribunal and administering authority.\n\n21.\n\nAlternatively, if the Tribunal declines to award Renco the costs it incurred in connection with the filing of its Memorial on Liability, then Renco asks the Tribunal to order that each Party bear the costs of their own legal representation and assistance, and that each side shall bear half of the costs of the Tribunal and the administering authority.\n\n22.\n\nIn the further alternative, if the Tribunal decides to award Peru any of its costs, Renco submits that the Tribunal should offset those costs against:\n\n(a) The costs that Renco unnecessarily incurred due to Peru's delay in raising its jurisdictional waiver objection, in the amount of USD 3,836,067.36; and\n\n(b) The costs that Renco incurred in its successful Article 10.20(4) submissions, in the amount of USD 749,354.30.\n\n**B. Peru's Submissions**\n-------------------------\n\n23.\n\nPeru observes that Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules establishes a presumption that the costs of the arbitration must be borne by the losing party - the so-called \"loser pays\" or \"costs follow the event\" principle. This presumption also applies to the costs of legal representation. Peru submits that since Renco's claims were dismissed, Peru was the successful party in the arbitration and, as such, ought to be awarded costs.\n\n24.\n\nPeru further contends that the Tribunal should award costs to Peru because Renco opposed every attempt that Peru made to expeditiously determine the merits of Peru's waiver objection, in addition to other conduct that complicated and delayed the resolution of the dispute. Peru contends that it conducted the arbitration efficiently, including by raising issues regarding the waiver requirement, timely filing the related objection, and consistently requesting to be heard despite Renco's efforts to block Peru from protecting its rights under the Treaty.\n\n25.\n\nPeru argues that, in addition to delaying the decision of the waiver issue, Renco repeatedly engaged in actions which were inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Treaty and which aggravated and complicated the dispute, which provides further support for the allocation to Renco of the costs of this arbitration.\n\n26.\n\nPeru states that it has incurred costs of USD 8,392,778.62. Peru has provided a breakdown of this sum into the following three phases:\n\n(a) Phase 1: Before Notification of Preliminary Objections:\n\n(i) Counsel's fees - USD 2,154,559.80;\n\n(ii) Experts - USD 654,613.80;\n\n(iii) Disbursements - USD 98,564.39;\n\n(iv) Tribunal / administrative expenses - 175,000.\n\n(b) Phase 2: After Notification of Preliminary Objections:\n\n(i) Counsel's fees - USD 1,306,744.66;\n\n(ii) Experts - USD 142,327.97;\n\n(iii) Disbursements - USD 9,777.13;\n\n(iv) Tribunal / administrative expenses - USD 200,000.\n\n(c) Phase 3: After Peru Objected to Ongoing Violations:\n\n(i) Counsel's fees - USD 2,374,665.70\n\n(ii) Experts - USD 992,993.94;\n\n(iii) Costs - USD 83,531.23;\n\n(iv) Tribunal / administrative expenses - USD 200,000.\n\n27.\n\nPeru contends that its total costs are reasonable in amount, especially when viewed in the context of Renco's claim for damages in excess of USD 800 million and the fact that Renco unnecessarily increased the length and complexity of this arbitration, impacting Peru's costs, for example by raising numerous obstacles to Peru's attempts to have its waiver objections briefed and decided as a preliminary question.\n\n28.\n\nPeru therefore asks the Tribunal to render an award of costs in the amount of USD 8,392,778.62.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Application of the \"Costs Follow the Event\" Presumption in Article 42(1)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules (2010) establishes a presumption that \"[t]he costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties\". This presumption applies to the costs of the Tribunal as well as the Parties' legal and other costs, provided that such costs are reasonable in amount. Nevertheless, the Tribunal is empowered to \"apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case\".\n\n30.\n\nIn the Partial Award, the Tribunal concluded that it had no jurisdiction over Renco's claims because Renco had failed to provide an effective waiver of rights, as required by Article 10.18(2)(b) of the Treaty, and that accordingly Renco had failed to establish the requirements for Peru's consent to arbitrate under the Treaty. Given this conclusion, Renco must be regarded as the \"unsuccessful party\" for the purposes of Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The costs of the arbitration must therefore, in principle, be borne by Renco.\n\n31.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal is entitled to have regard to the \"circumstances of the case\" to determine whether it is reasonable to apportion the costs of the arbitration between the Parties. In the considered opinion of this Tribunal, three circumstances justify a departure from the presumption that Renco must bear the costs of the arbitration, namely:\n\n(a) The fact that Peru has only achieved a relative, rather than an absolute, measure of success;\n\n(b) The fact that the issues raised in the waiver phase of the arbitration were novel and complex; and\n\n(c) The fact that Peru delayed in raising its objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the basis of Renco's non-compliance with Article 10.18(2)(b) of the Treaty.\n\n**B. The Relative Success of the Parties**\n------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nAs to the first factor listed above, it is commonplace for arbitral tribunals to evaluate the relative success of the parties in reaching a determination on costs. For example, in *ICS Inspection and Control Services v Argentina*, the tribunal upheld one of the respondent's jurisdictional objections but declined to award the entirety of the respondent's legal costs, in part, because the tribunal had not ruled on several other jurisdictional objections which had been briefed by the parties.3\n\n*ICS Inspection and Control Services v Argentina*, Award on Jurisdiction, February 10, 2012, \u00b6 342 (CLA-147).\n\n33.\n\nIn the waiver phase of this arbitration, it is true that Peru succeeded in establishing that Renco's waiver did not comply with Article 10.18(2)(b) and hence that an essential element of Peru's consent to arbitration was absent. However, Peru raised two other objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction in its Memorial on Waiver filed on July 10, 2015, namely:4\n\n(a) The contention that Renco's wholly-owned local enterprise, Doe Run Peru S.R. LTDA (\" **DRP** \"), had failed to provide a waiver under Article 10.18(2) of the Treaty; and\n\n(b) The contention that Renco has (through DRP) initiated and/or continued proceedings in the Peruvian courts concerning measures alleged to constitute a breach of the Treaty in this arbitration.\n\nPartial Award \u00b6 61\n\n34.\n\nIt was unnecessary for the Tribunal to reach any decision on these issues because of the Tribunal's decision on Renco's non-compliance with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2)(b). Nevertheless, these issues were fully briefed in the Parties' memorials and they were the subject of extensive oral submissions at the hearing on waiver and in supplementary post-hearing written submissions. As the arbitral tribunal observed in *ICS Inspection and Control Services v Argentina*, it cannot be assumed that the Claimant's responses to these arguments were without merit.5\n\n*ICS Inspection and Control Services v Argentina*, Award on Jurisdiction, February 10, 2012, \u00b6 342 (CLA-147).\n\n35.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal observes that Renco was the successful party in the Tribunal's decision on the Scope of Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20(4) of the Treaty.6 The Parties exchanged extensive submissions following Peru's notification of preliminary objections, which encompassed issues relating to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* as well as Renco's compliance with the preconditions contained in investment agreements at issue in the arbitration. In view of the Partial Award, the Tribunal did not reach a decision on these jurisdictional objections and, again, it cannot be assumed that the Claimant's responses to these arguments were without merit.\n\nDecision as to the Scope of the Respondent's Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20(4), December 18, 2014.\n\n36.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, Peru's success in the arbitration has been qualified, and not absolute, and the Tribunal considers that this circumstance justifies a departure from the presumption that \"costs follow the event\".\n\n**C. The Novelty and Complexity of the Issues**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nAs to the second factor listed above, arbitral tribunals have observed that if the issues raised in an arbitration are especially novel or complex then this circumstance may justify a departure from the presumption that \"costs follow the event\". For example, in *Glamis Gold v The United States of America*, the tribunal ordered the unsuccessful claimant to bear two-thirds of the costs of the arbitration, and each party to bear their own legal and other costs, because, in part, the \"Claimant raised difficult and complicated claims based in at least one area of unsettled law\".7\n\n*Glamis Gold Ltd v The United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Award, June 8, 2009 \u00b6 833 (CLA-134).\n\n38.\n\nPeru contends that the \"novelty factor\" is no longer apposite when apportioning costs because investment arbitrations \"have become so well known and established as to diminish their novelty as dispute resolution mechanisms\", citing the observations made by the arbitral tribunal in *International Thunderbird Gaming Corp v The United Mexican States*.8 Moreover, Peru contends that the issue of Renco's compliance with Article 10.18(2)(b) was neither novel nor complex because arbitral tribunals have repeatedly held that waivers are invalid if an investor purports to carve out from the scope of the waiver certain domestic court proceedings.\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming Corp v The United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Award dated January 26, 2006 \u00b6 218 (CLA-19).\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Renco does not rely on the \"novelty and complexity\" of investor-state dispute settlement *per se* as relevant circumstance for the purposes of Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. Rather, Renco contends that the \"novelty and complexity of the issues\" raised in the arbitration justify a departure from the \"costs follow the event\" principle.9 In the Tribunal's opinion, the novelty and complexity of the issues are clearly relevant circumstances in determining whether to apportion costs between the Parties.\n\nRenco's Submission on Costs \u00b6 15.\n\n40.\n\nThe issues at stake in the waiver phase of the arbitration were undoubtedly novel and complex. In the Partial Award, the Tribunal observed that \"[t]he issues raised by the Parties involve complex issues of interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Treaty\".10 The Tribunal also observed that the issue of Renco's non-compliance with Article 10.18(2)(b) was \"inherently complex\" and the Tribunal found these issues \"extremely difficult to resolve, requiring extensive and intensive deliberations by the Tribunal over many months\".11\n\nPartial Award \u00b6 67.\n\nPartial Award \u00b6 124.\n\n41.\n\nSo far as the Tribunal is aware, no previous investment tribunal had considered the issue of whether an investor was entitled unilaterally to cure a waiver which suffered from a defect in form, nor whether an arbitral tribunal was empowered to apply the severability principle to remedy a defective waiver, nor whether an objection to jurisdiction of the kind raised by Peru at a late stage of the proceedings amounted to an abuse of rights. Moreover, on the first of these issues, the Tribunal's decision was reached by a majority of the Tribunal.12 In the Tribunal's opinion, these considerations justify a departure from the presumption that \"costs follow the event\".\n\nPartial Award \u00b6 157.\n\n**D. The Conduct of the Parties**\n---------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nAs to the third circumstance referred to above, arbitral tribunals have regularly scrutinized the conduct of the parties during the proceedings to determine whether to apportion costs. For example, in *Zhinvali v Georgia*, the tribunal awarded the claimant a substantial portion of its costs even though the tribunal dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds, because the respondent had raised a belated objection to jurisdiction and caused the claimant to incur unnecessary costs.13\n\n*Zhinvali Development Limited v Georgia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/1, Award, Jan. 24, 2003, \u00b6\u00b6 420-30 (CLA-187).\n\n43.\n\nIn the Partial Award, the Tribunal observed that it had been troubled by the manner in which Peru's waiver objection had arisen in the context of the arbitration. The Tribunal made the following observations in this regard:14\n\nThe arbitration had already been on foot for quite some time before Peru filed its Memorial on Waiver on July 2015. By this stage over four years had passed since Renco filed its Notice of Arbitration; the Tribunal had already issued Procedural Order No. 1 which recorded the agreed briefing schedule for the arbitration; Renco had filed its Memorial on Liability; the Parties had exchanged voluminous submissions in connection with Renco's challenge to the scope of Peru's Preliminary Objections; and the Tribunal had issued a substantive decision on December 18, 2014 in relation to the Scope of Peru's Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20(4). Clearly it would have been preferable for all concerned if Peru had raised its waiver objection in a clear and coherent manner at the very outset of these proceedings. Instead, they emerged piecemeal over a relatively lengthy period of time. This issue is considered further at paragraphs 180-183 below.\n\n[...]\n\nIndeed, while Peru complained to Renco many years ago that it considered to Peruvian bankruptcy proceedings involving DRP violated Article 10.18(2), Peru did not raise any clear and specific objection in relation to Renco's reservation of rights until Peru filed its Comments on the submission of the United States of America on September 10, 2014... [and] [t]his submission was not developed in any depth until Peru filed its Memorial on Waiver in July 2015, where Renco's compliance with the formal requirements of Article 10.18(2)(6), by reason of the reservation of rights, was placed squarely in issue.\n\nPartial Award \u00b6\u00b6 123, 182-183.\n\n44.\n\nPeru maintains that it \"raised its objections to Renco's serious violations of an express requirement of the Treaty in a timely and diligent manner\".15 Peru observes that in its preliminary response to the Notice of Arbitration dated September 9, 2011 it raised concerns regarding \"the scope of the mandatory waiver\" and \"the scope of the consent to arbitration,\" and that it reserved all rights, including as to jurisdiction.16 Peru also observes that in its preliminary objections dated March 21, 2014 it stated that \"Renco has presented an invalid waiver in this proceeding because it does not conform with the language required by the Treaty\".17 Peru also refers to a \"one-page figure\" summarising the waiver objections and filed together with its Comments on the submission of the United States of America on September 10, 2014.18\n\nPeru's Submission on Costs \u00b6 16.\n\nPeru's Submission on Costs \u00b6 14(a).\n\nPeru's Submission on Costs \u00b6 14(b)\n\nPeru's Submission on Costs \u00b6 14(b).\n\n45.\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, none of the documents to which Peru has referred in its costs submission amount to a clear and specific objection to the validity of the reservation of rights contained in Renco's written waiver. The fact remains that the reservation of rights was not placed squarely in issue until Peru filed its Memorial on Waiver in July 2015. By this stage, Renco had incurred substantial costs preparing its Memorial on Liability and its submissions in connection with the scope of preliminary objections under Article 10.20(4).\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Peru's submission that, in accordance with the briefing schedule contained in Annex A of Procedural Order No. 1 and Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, Peru was not required to raise an objection to Renco's violation of the waiver requirement until its Counter-Memorial on Liability.19 This case is therefore distinguishable from *Zhinvali v Georgia* where the respondent State failed to raise its jurisdictional objection until it filed its rejoinder, and had failed to raise it as a preliminary objection in its counter-memorial in breach of Rule 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\nArticle 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that \"[a] plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised no later than in the statement of defence\".\n\n47.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal considers that the arbitral proceedings could have been conducted more efficiently if Peru had raised a clear and specific objection to the reservation of rights in Renco's written waiver at the very outset of the arbitration. If an early decision had been made on this issue, then the Parties could have saved substantial legal fees and experts' fees in connection with Renco's claims on the merits. The Tribunal is not persuaded by Peru's submission that Renco impeded Peru's attempts to have the waiver issue addressed in the arbitration. In the Tribunal's opinion, Peru's delay in raising the waiver objection is a relevant circumstance which justifies a departure from the presumption that \"costs follow the event\".\n\n48.\n\nThe question which remains is whether Peru's delay warrants the costs order sought by Renco, namely that Peru must pay Renco USD 3,836,067.63 for the costs that Renco incurred preparing its Memorial on Liability. The Tribunal accepts that it has wide discretion in determining whether and, if so, how to apportion costs under Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. However, the Tribunal is not persuaded that this discretion should be exercised so as to require Peru to pay Renco's costs unless Peru \"has acted frivolously, in bad faith or otherwise irresponsibly\".20\n\nL. Nurick, \"Costs in International Arbitrations,\" (1992) 7 ICSID Rev-Foreign Investment LJ 57, 58 (CLA-180).\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that Peru's waiver objection was not tainted by any ulterior motive to evade its duty to arbitrate Renco's claims. Rather, in raising its waiver objection, Peru sought to vindicate its right to receive a waiver which complied with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2)(b) and a waiver which did not undermine the object and purpose of that Article.21 In view of these findings, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Peru should be required to bear Renco's costs in filing its Memorial on Liability.\n\nPartial Award \u00b6 186.\n\n**E. The Tribunal's Costs Order**\n---------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nIn the light of the three circumstances set out above, the Tribunal has concluded that it would be reasonable to order each Party to bear their own legal and other costs incurred in relation to the arbitration (i.e. Article 40(2)(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules) and that each Party shall bear half of the costs of the Tribunal and administering authority (i.e. Article 40(2)(a), (b), (c) and (f) of the UNCITRAL Rules).\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal records that the Parties have deposited a total of USD 1,150,000 (USD 575,000 each Party) with ICSID to cover the arbitration direct costs, which include: (i) the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal's Assistant; ii) ICSID's fees as administering authority; and (iii) other direct expenses including court reporting, interpretation, hearing broadcast, translations, courier, audio visual services and estimated charges related to the dispatch of this Award.\n\n52.\n\nThe fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal's Assistant amount to USD 673,308.42. This sum is comprised of the following amounts:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Arbitrator** | **Fees** | **Expenses** |\n| The Honorable L. Yves Fortier, CC, QC | USD 96,937.50 | USD 8,623.09 |\n| Mr. Toby T. Landau, QC | USD 118,125.07 | USD 16,943.79 |\n| Dr. Michael J. Moser | USD 360,525.00 | USD 58,758.97 |\n| Tribunal's Assistant | USD 13,395 |  |\n| Total | USD 588,982.57 | USD 84,325.85 |\n| **Total (Fees + Expenses)** | **USD 673,308.42** |\n\n53.\n\nPursuant to paragraph 5.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties agreed that ICSID would be designated as the administering authority and that the cost of ICSID's services would be included in the costs of the arbitration. ICSID's administrative fees amount to USD 128,000.\n\n54.\n\nPayments made by ICSID for other direct expenses of the proceeding (i.e. court reporting, interpretation, hearing broadcast, translations, courier, audio visual services and estimated charges related to the dispatch of this Award) amount to USD 46,649.59.\n\n55.\n\nBased on the above figures, the arbitration costs (i.e. items listed in Article 40(2)(a), (b), (c) and (f) of the UNCITRAL Rules), as of today, amount to USD 847,958.01. This sum has been deducted from the advances made to ICSID by the Parties. Once the costs related to the dispatch of this Award have been deducted, the ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed financial statement. The remaining balance in the case account shall be reimbursed to the Parties in equal shares in accordance with Article 43(5) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n**VII. FORMAL AWARD**\n---------------------\n\n56.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, and rejecting all submissions, claims and counterclaims to the contrary, the Tribunal **HEREBY FINDS DECLARES AND AWARDS** as follows:\n\n(a) Each Party shall bear their own legal and other costs incurred in relation to the arbitration;\n\n(b) Each Party shall bear half of the arbitration costs of the proceeding indicated in paragraph 55 of this Award. The ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed financial statement reflecting the final costs and balance in the case account; and\n\n(c) ICSID shall reimburse to each Party half of the unexpended balance of the advance on costs."}]}
