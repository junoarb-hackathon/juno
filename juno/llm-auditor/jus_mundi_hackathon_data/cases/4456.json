On September 7, 2021, the Tribunal established a calendar for Respondent's separate Responses to (a) the Request for Temporary Relief and (b) the Request for Provisional Measures. The Procedural Calendar was modified on September 20, 2021 and October 8, 2021. This Decision concerns Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief.\n\n**(i) Claimants' Position**\n---------------------------\n\n[3].\n\nIn their Application and related communications, Claimants refer to the Auto 749 issued on April 26, 2021 by the *Contralor\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia* (the \"CGR Decision\") following fiscal liability proceedings in which damages in the amount of US$811 million were awarded against Joint Venture Foster Wheeler USA Corporation and Process Consultants, Inc. (\"FPJVC\"), along with others. Claimants allege that the CGR Decision is the result of a proceeding improperly initiated by the CGR against FPJVC \"in a transparent attempt to shift blame for alleged acts of mismanagement from those who actually managed a project involving the modernization and expansion of a State-owned oil refinery located in Cartagena, Colombia.\"1\n\nApplication, \u00b6 2.\n\n[4].\n\nClaimants explain that they seek an emergency order preventing Colombia from disrupting the *status quo* by enforcing the CGR Decision pending the Tribunal's determination of their Application for Provisional Measures. Claimants submit that the Tribunal has the authority to grant the requested emergency relief under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Article 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA as their Application does not seek to enjoin the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach under Article 10.16 of the US-Colombia TPA.\n\n[5].\n\nAs to the urgency of the relief requested, Claimants refer to the Respondent's confirmation that the proceedings to enforce the CGR Decision are underway and argue that this \"worldwide campaign of litigation by Colombia while the CGR Decision is being challenged in this arbitration would aggravate this dispute, upset the status quo and threaten the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the dispute.\"2 [REDACTED]3\n\nClaimants' Reply of October 18, 2021, \u00b6 8.\n\nClaimants' Reply of October 18, 2021, \u00b6 9.\n\n**(ii) Respondent's Position**\n------------------------------\n\n[6].\n\nAccording to Respondent, the limitation in Article 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA to a tribunal's authority to recommend provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention would prevent this Tribunal from issuing the emergency temporary relief requested by the Claimants. Respondent submits, *inter alia*, that here Claimants are seeking to enjoin the application of the same measure they allege is a violation of the US-Colombia TPA. Respondent contends that the enforcement of the CGR Decision is the \"ultimate consequence\" of the fiscal liability proceeding which the Claimants argue was initiated in breach of the US-Colombia TPA. Accordingly, enjoining the enforcement of the CGR Decision \"would necessarily mean enjoining the 'application' or 'implementation' of the 'measure' alleged to constitute a breach of the Treaty, which is prohibited by Article 10.20(8).\"4\n\nRespondent's Response of September 30, 2021, \u00b6 23.\n\n[7].\n\nRespondent also argues that Claimants have failed to meet the \"heightened level of urgency\" required to issue temporary emergency relief pending a decision on an application for provisional measures. Respondent submits that the fact that the CGR is initiating proceedings to enforce the CGR decision does not entail an imminent threat to Claimants' assets. On this point, Respondent notes that the CGR (i) \"has not located any assets owned by Foster Wheeler or Process Consultants, either in Colombia or abroad\" and that, for that reason, it has not decreed any precautionary measures against the Claimants' assets.5 Respondent further explains that, as of the date of its Answer to the Emergency Application (*i.e*. September 30, 2021), the CGR official in charge of the enforcement proceeding of the CGR Decision is in the process of reviewing such decision. If this official determines that the CGR Decision meets all legal requirements, it may initiate a voluntary collection phase seeking payment from the Claimants. Upon conclusion of that stage, the CGR may proceed with the forced collection stage. Any assets attached during the forced collection proceeding can only be auctioned off when all pending judicial reviews have concluded, so even at that stage, Claimants may initiate an annulment action against the Ruling with Fiscal Liability and may request a stay of enforcement.\n\nRespondent's Response of September 30, 2021, \u00b6\u00b6 34-36.\n\n**(iii) Tribunal's Decision**\n-----------------------------\n\n[8].\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed and considered the Parties' submissions, including Claimants' communications of September 2, 15 and October 12, 2021 and Respondent's communications of September 30 and October 18, 2021 as regards Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief. The fact that the Tribunal does not specifically mention a given argument does not mean that it has not taken it into account.\n\n[9].\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Claimants have failed to make a showing of the heightened level of urgency required to grant the emergency temporary relief that they have requested. In particular, Claimants have not provided evidence that any of their assets are currently under threat of harm. The Tribunal wishes to stress that this decision is without prejudice to the Tribunal's consideration of the Parties' arguments regarding the urgency of the Provisional Measures that Claimants have requested be issued until this arbitration is concluded, and its authority to order Provisional Measures in this arbitration in light of Article 10.20(8) of the US-Colombia TPA.\n\n[10].\n\nThe Tribunal considers that its analysis of these matters would be further assisted by Respondent's Answer to the Request for Provisional Measures (due by October 28, 2021) and by the Parties' oral presentations on the Request for Provisional Measures. Accordingly, the Tribunal confirms that the Hearing on Provisional Measures will take place at the date tentatively scheduled, *i.e.,* November 4, 2021. The final schedule for the Hearing will be established by the Tribunal upon consultation with the Parties.\n\n[11].\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:\n\n(a) Claimants' Request for Emergency Temporary relief is denied;\n\n(b) The Tribunal confirms that it will hear the Parties' oral arguments on Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures during the Hearing that will take place virtually on November 4, 2021.\n\n(c) Either Party may bring to the Tribunal's attention any new, relevant, facts that fundamentally change the current circumstances;\n\n(d) The Tribunal reserves its decision on costs for a later stage."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2022-05-31T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn September 2, 2021, Amec Foster Wheeler USA Corporation, Process Consultants, Inc., and Joint Venture Foster Wheeler USA Corporation and Process Consultants, Inc. (\"Claimants\") filed an Application for Provisional Measures and Emergency Temporary Relief, together with the witness statements of Cesar Torrente dated August 30, 2021 (CWS-1), Steve Conway dated July 29, 2021 (CWS-2), Thomas Grell dated July 29, 2021 (CWS-3), and Colin Johnson dated August 9, 2021 (CWS-4), exhibits C-001 to C-010 and legal authorities CL-001 to CL-038, and a consolidated index of exhibits and legal authorities.\n\n2.\n\nOn September 7, 2021, the Tribunal invited the Republic of Colombia (\"Respondent\") to submit a response to (i) Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief by September 17, 2021, and (ii) Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures by September 28, 2021.\n\n3.\n\nOn September 9, 2021, Respondent submitted a letter along with Annexes 1 to 4, proposing a revised procedural calendar for its submissions on Claimants' Applications.\n\n4.\n\nOn September 10, 2021, Claimants submitted their observations to Respondent's revised procedural calendar, together with Annex 1.\n\n5.\n\nOn September 13, 2021, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and to try to reach agreement on the revised procedural calendar or, in case of disagreement, to provide any additional comments on the matter by September 15, 2021. The Tribunal also informed the Parties of its decision to stay the procedural calendar of September 7, 2021 until a revised calendar was agreed by the Parties or a decision on the matter was adopted by the Tribunal upon consideration of the Parties' positions.\n\n6.\n\nOn September 15, 2021, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had not been able to agree on a procedural calendar. Claimants submitted additional comments on the matter.\n\n7.\n\nOn September 16, 2021, Respondent submitted further comments on Claimants' communication of September 15, 2021.\n\n8.\n\nOn September 20, 2021, having considered the Parties' positions, the Tribunal established a revised procedural calendar by which Respondent was invited to submit (i) a response to Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief by September 30, 2021; and (ii) a response to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures by October 28, 2021.\n\n9.\n\nOn September 30, 2021, Respondent filed its Answer to Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief, together with Exhibits R-93 to R-99, Legal Authorities RL-008, RL-024, RL-228 to RL-242, and a consolidated index of exhibits and legal authorities.\n\n10.\n\nOn October 5, 2021, Claimants requested an opportunity to reply to Respondent's Answer to the Application for Emergency Temporary Relief. Claimants also requested that the Tribunal schedule oral arguments following receipt of Colombia's response to the Application for Provisional Measures due by October 28, 2021. On October 6, 2021, Respondent asked the Tribunal to reject Claimants' request. A further communication on the matter was received from Claimants on October 7, 2021.\n\n11.\n\nOn October 8, 2021, the Tribunal decided to invite Claimants to submit a Reply to Respondent's Answer to the Application for Emergency Temporary Relief by October 12, 2021 and to invite Respondent to submit a Rejoinder to that Reply by October 18, 2021. By this same communication, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confirm their availability for a hearing on Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, if needed, on November 4 or 5, 2021.\n\n12.\n\nOn October 12, 2021, Claimants submitted a Reply on the Application for Emergency Temporary Relief together with the supplemental witness statement of Cesar Torrente dated October 11, 2021 (CWS-5).\n\n13.\n\nOn October 13, 2021, Respondent confirmed its availability for a hearing on provisional measures on November 4, 2021. On that same date, Claimants informed the Tribunal that Charles Conrad, Claimants' co-lead counsel, was unavailable for a hearing on November 4, 2021 due to previous commitments. They inquired as to the possibility to schedule the hearing on another date in November 2021.\n\n14.\n\nOn October 18, 2021, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief.\n\n15.\n\nOn October 20, 2021, the Tribunal confirmed that, due to its limited availability of the during the month of November 2021, the Hearing on Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures (the \"Hearing\") would take place remotely, if needed, on November 4, 2021. By this same communication, the Tribunal proposed a hearing schedule and invited the Parties' comments by October 25, 2021.\n\n16.\n\nOn October 25, 2021, the Tribunal rejected Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief and confirmed that the Hearing would take place remotely on November 4, 2021.\n\n17.\n\nOn October 28, 2021, Respondent submitted its Answer to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures.\n\n18.\n\nOn November 4, 2021, at the Hearing, the Parties made further submissions and the Tribunal put questions to counsel for the Parties. In their oral arguments, Claimants referred to a presentation purportedly given by the Contralor\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia (the \"CGR\") which was not in the record. Following Respondent's inquiry regarding this document, Claimants acknowledged that the presentation was not yet in the record and agreed to submit it as a new exhibit. The Tribunal then gave Respondent leave to provide any comments upon the new exhibit by November 11, 2021.\n\n19.\n\nOn November 11, 2021, Respondent submitted its comments on the new CGR presentation, which had been introduced into the record by Claimants after the conclusion of the Hearing as Exhibit C-23.1\n\nOn November 9, 2021, the new exhibit was uploaded to the Box Folder for this arbitration proceeding as Exhibit C-23.\n\n20.\n\nAlso on November 11, 2021, Respondent informed the Tribunal of the Parties' agreed-upon corrections to the Hearing transcripts. The final Hearing transcripts incorporating the agreed corrections were issued on November 15, 2021.\n\n21.\n\nOn November 16, 2021, Claimants submitted comments on Respondent's communication of November 12, 2021. On that same date, Respondent applied to the Tribunal to strike Claimants' November 16, 2021 letter from the record. Further comments from Claimants were received on that same date.\n\n22.\n\nOn December 2, 2021, Claimants requested leave from the Tribunal to submit as an exhibit to their Application for Provisional Measures a copy of a Notice received on December 1, 2021 from the Coactive Collection Unit of the CGR.\n\n23.\n\nOn December 3, 2021, the Tribunal invited Claimants to submit a copy of the Notice by December 6, 2021 and Respondent to provide comments on the contents of the Notice by December 8, 2021. The Parties proceeded accordingly.\n\n24.\n\nOn December 10, 2021, the Tribunal rejected Respondent's request to strike Claimants' letter of November 16, 2021 from the record. In doing so, the Tribunal invited Respondent to submit any additional comments in connection with Claimants' letter by December 15, 2021. Respondent proceeded accordingly.\n\n25.\n\nOn February 9, 2022, Claimants requested leave to introduce three additional documents into the record and indicated that Respondent had confirmed that it had no objections to their request. In view of the Parties' agreement, the Tribunal invited Claimants to submit the three new documents as exhibits by February 14, 2022. In doing so, the Tribunal also invited Respondent to submit comments by February 18, 2022.\n\n26.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal's instructions, on February 14, 2022, Claimants introduced exhibit C-29 (Letter from the CGR dated Feb. 7, 2022 regarding the Coercive Collection Proceeding) and legal authorities CL-261 (Law 2195 of 2022) and CL-262 (Bill No. 341 of the 2020 Senate) into the record (the \"New Documents\"). On February 18, 2022, Respondent submitted comments on the New Documents.\n\n27.\n\nOn February 21, 2022, the Tribunal invited Claimants to provide comments on Respondent's letter of February 18, 2022 by February 24, 2022 and Respondent to reply by February 28, 2022. The Parties proceeded accordingly.\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed and considered the Parties' submissions, including Claimants' communications of September 2, 15, October 12 and 18, November 16, and December 2021, and February 14 and 24, 2022 and Respondent's communications of September 30, October 18 and 28, 2021, November 12 and 16, December 15, 2021, and February 18 and 28, 2022 as regards Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures. The fact that the Tribunal does not specifically mention a given argument does not mean that it has not taken it into account.\n\n**II. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n29.\n\nIn their Application and related communications, Claimants refer to the Auto 749 issued on April 26, 2021, by the CGR (the \"CGR Decision\") following fiscal liability proceedings in which damages in the amount of US$811 million were awarded against Joint Venture Foster Wheeler USA Corporation and Process Consultants, Inc. (\"FPJVC\"), along with others. Claimants allege that the CGR Decision is the result of a proceeding improperly initiated by the CGR against FPJVC \"in a transparent attempt to shift blame for alleged acts of mismanagement from those who actually managed a project involving the modernization and expansion of a State-owned oil refinery located in Cartagena, Colombia.\"2\n\nApplication, \u00b6 2.\n\n30.\n\nClaimants argue that, unless enjoined, the enforcement of the CGR Decision will aggravate the *status quo [REDACTED]*. They add that the risk of irreparable harm is both imminent and urgent. On this basis, Claimants seek an order for provisional measures \"preventing Colombia from initiating any enforcement proceedings with respect to the disputed CGR Decision until the Tribunal has issued its final award on the merits.\"3\n\nApplication, \u00b6 10. See also, Claimants' *petitum* reproduced in full in \u00b6 52 below.\n\n**i. The Tribunal's Authority to Grant Provisional Measures under the US-Colombia TPA**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nClaimants argue that the interim relief that they seek \"fall[s] squarely within the authority of the Tribunal pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Article 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA.\" In particular, Claimants refer to the first part of Article 10.20.8, which states that \"[a] tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, including ... to protect the tribunal's jurisdiction.\" According to Claimants, this accords with Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, which states that \"the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"4\n\nClaimants' Letter of September 15, 2021, page 4.\n\n32.\n\nClaimants note that \"tribunals hearing investor-state claims commonly grant provisional measures to restrain sovereign States from enforcing disputed court judgments, fines, taxes, and penalties because preventing such harm was necessary to preserve the *status quo* of the arbitration pending a final ruling on the merits,\" and submit that \"few actions could be more aggravating to this dispute, or effect the integrity of these proceedings more than [REDACTED].\"5\n\n*Id.*\n\n33.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's argument that the second part of Article 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA, which provides that \"[a] tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16,\" would prevent the Tribunal from granting the requested measures.\n\n34.\n\nClaimants explain that they are not seeking to enjoin a measure that they have alleged to be a breach of Article 10.16 of the US-Colombia TPA.6 This is because all of the breaches that they have alleged in this arbitration \"\u2013 the bringing of a fiscal liability proceeding against parties that are plainly not 'fiscal managers' and hence not within the jurisdiction of the CGR, the gross departures from due process in those proceedings, the retroactive application of a statute seemingly aimed at Claimants broadening the definition of 'fiscal manager', the unequal treatment of Claimants when compared to the Colombian respondents before the CGR, the calculation of damages under an absurd and illogical model introduced into the CGR proceeding at the very last minute, the imposition of liability on a joint and several basis without even an effort to show causation, and the denial of any meaningful opportunity to appeal \u2013 have already occurred.\"7 For this reason, Claimants continue, they are not asking the Tribunal to restore them to the position they were in before the CGR initiated the concluded fiscal liability proceeding.8 Instead, what Claimants are requesting here is that the Tribunal enjoin \"parallel proceedings brought to enforce the CGR Decision that raise the same issues that are before the Tribunal, threatening its jurisdiction and aggravating the dispute.\" On this point, Claimants add that Colombia's imminent enforcement proceedings will be \"new measures constituting separate proceedings that are not challenged in the pending arbitration.\"9\n\nTr. p. 22:18-21.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Application for Emergency Temporary Relief, \u00b6 16.\n\nClaimants' Letter of September 15, 2021, page 7.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Application for Emergency Temporary Relief, \u00b6 16. *See* also Tr. p. 25:11-26:18.\n\n35.\n\nClaimants note that in *IBT v. Panama*, *Feldman v. Mexico*, and *Pope & Talbot v. Canada,* the three cases cited by Colombia in support of its position, the \"investor sought to *change* the *status quo\"* and \"to enjoin the breaches that claimants were complaining of.\"10 In particular, Claimants note that the tribunal in *IBT v. Panama* \"determined that claimants sought to modify the *status quo* by rectifying measures they alleged were breaches of the treaty and denied the request.\"11 Here, unlike in *IBT v. Panama*, \"if the Tribunal does not stay enforcement of the CGR Decision, [REDACTED].\"12\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Application for Emergency Temporary Relief, \u00b6 20 (emphasis in the original).\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Application for Emergency Temporary Relief, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*Id.*\n\n**ii. The Requirements for Granting Provisional Measures**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nClaimants note that the elements required to obtain an order for provisional measures are: (1) *prima facie* jurisdiction; (2) *prima facie* establishment of the right to the relief sought; (3) imminent danger of serious prejudice (necessity); (4) urgency; and (5) proportionality.13 They submit that they unequivocally satisfy each of these elements as follows:\n\nApplication, \u00b6 105.\n\na. *Prima facie* jurisdiction\n-----------------------------\n\n37.\n\nClaimants assert that they \"make more than a *prima facie* showing that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider and resolve this dispute.\"14 They state that Colombia consented to this arbitration pursuant to Article 10.17.1 of the US-Colombia TPA, which provides that: \"[e]ach Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration under this Section in accordance with this Agreement.\"15 In turn, Claimants consented to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in Chapter 10 of the US-Colombia TPA when they submitted their Request for Arbitration.16\n\nApplication, \u00b6 118.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 108.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 115.\n\n38.\n\nClaimants further argue that they are qualified to commence this arbitration against Colombia under the US-Colombia TPA. First, this matter arises directly out of an \"investment dispute,\" specifically, FPJVC's rights established under the US-Colombia TPA with respect to its investment in Colombia. Claimant FPJVC is a contractual joint venture and each of its members \u2013 Claimant Amec Foster Wheeler USA Corporation and Claimant Process Consultants, Inc. \u2013 are corporations organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, so that Claimants are an \"enterprise of a Party\" within the meaning of the US-Colombia TPA.17\n\nApplication, \u00b6 111.\n\n39.\n\nClaimants are also \"investor[s] of a Party\" and have made an \"investment\" under the US-Colombia TPA. On this point, Claimants explain that they contracted with Reficar (a Colombian State-owned enterprise) to provide project management services for the expansion of an oil refinery owned by Colombia. In doing so, Claimants invested significant amounts of time, capital, personnel, and labor in Colombian territory with the expectation that they would return a profit. The contract also created rights, both tangible and intangible, to a contractual benefit having economic value to Claimants. This dispute concerns Colombia's violations of its obligations to Claimants under the US-Colombia TPA.18\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 112-113.\n\n40.\n\nAdditionally, Claimants submit that the contract is an \"investment agreement,\" as defined by the US-Colombia TPA, because Reficar is \"a national authority of a Party,\" which is wholly owned by Ecopetrol (a Colombian entity controlled by the Ministry of Mines and Energy) and, as such, it also entitles Claimants to submit a claim to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(c) of the US-Colombia TPA.19\n\nApplication, \u00b6 114.\n\n41.\n\nFinally, Claimants argue that they have satisfied all notice and time requirements to submit a claim to arbitration under the US-Colombia TPA as follows: six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to this claim. Less than three years have elapsed from the date on which Claimants first acquired knowledge of the breaches, and the resulting damages from the same, under Article 10.16.1 of the US-Colombia TPA. Furthermore, Claimants and Respondent attempted, without success, to resolve the dispute through consultation and negotiation. The required waiting period following the submission of Claimants' notice of its intention to submit the claim to arbitration had expired prior to Claimants' filing of their Request for Arbitration.20\n\nApplication, \u00b6 116.\n\nb. *Prima facie* establishment of the right to the relief sought\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nClaimants argue that their rights to an exclusive remedy pursuant to Article 26 of the ICSID Convention and to the preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute deserve protection.21 Notably, they submit that:\n\n(i) *Preservation of the Status Quo*. ICSID tribunals routinely grant provisional measures to protect this right by enjoining a party from initiating parallel proceedings that concern the same subject matter of the arbitration. On this basis, Claimants \"seek an order preventing Colombia from taking steps to enforce the disputed CGR Decision until this arbitration has concluded, as enforcement would certainly aggravate the dispute and impair Claimants' rights to effectively participate in this arbitration.\"22\n\n(ii) *Right to an Exclusive Award*. Citing *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*, Claimants submit that the right to an exclusive remedy means that a party may not seek any other recourse with respect to the subject matter of the arbitration, whether by way of domestic or international relief. On this basis, Claimants request that the Tribunal \"enjoin Colombia from commencing any enforcement proceedings with respect to the CGR Decision or pursue any other recourse against Claimants that involves the subject matter of this dispute to preserve FPJVC's right to an exclusive remedy under the TPA.\"23\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 117-118.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 93-95. *See* also, Tr. p.18:13-19:6.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 96-98. *See* also, Tr. p. 17:5-18:12.\n\n43.\n\nClaimants note that, when determining whether to grant provisional measures, previous investment tribunals \"have required only that the claimant plead a facially plausible case.\" Here, according to Claimants, the \"factual and legal bases for the Application far exceed the establishment of Claimants' *prima facie* case on the merits.\"24\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 119-120.\n\n44.\n\nOn this point, Claimants explain that the CGR's exercise of jurisdiction, assertion of charges, and subsequent findings in the CGR Decision denied Claimants fair and equitable treatment under Article 10.5 of the US-Colombia TPA and the National Treatment standard under Article 10.3 of the US-Colombia TPA. According to Claimants, Colombia also deprived FPJVC of the fundamental protections in the Contract and indirectly expropriated its benefits in violation of Article 10.7 of the US-Colombia TPA. Finally, Claimants have also pleaded, *inter alia*, that Colombia's violation of the Contract amounts to a violation of both the most favored nation guarantee in Article 10.4 and Article 10.16 of the US-Colombia TPA.25\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 122-125.\n\nc. Necessity\n------------\n\n45.\n\nClaimants contend that provisional measures are necessary when, in the absence of such measures, the requesting party would suffer \"irreparable loss\".26 They submit that it is sufficient for FPJVC to show that \"there is a 'material risk' that harm will occur.\"27 In this case, as Claimants explain, absent the measures sought, Claimants \"will be stripped of their rights under the Contract,\"28 and their \"[REDACTED].\"29 Claimants add that, under that scenario, \"no award by the Tribunal will adequately compensate Claimants' damages.\"30\n\nApplication, \u00b6 126.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 130.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 149.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 131.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 147. *See* also, Tr. p. 20:3-13.\n\n46.\n\nClaimants also note that, as requested here, investment tribunals frequently enjoin States \"from enforcing disputed court judgments, fines, taxes and penalties finding that, in the absence of the interim measures, the investor would suffer irreparable harm.\" The prevention of such harm is necessary to preserve the *status quo* pending a final ruling on the merits.31 Claimants add that investment tribunals have also held that provisional measures are \"necessary\" to \"preserve the contractual rights agreed upon by the parties \u2013 like the contract between Reficar and FPJVC,\"32 or to \"order the discontinuance of parallel proceedings to maintain the *status quo* and prevent aggravation of the ICSID arbitration,\"33 scenarios which are also applicable here.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 132-137.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 139-141.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 142-145.\n\nd. Urgency\n----------\n\n47.\n\nClaimants allege that, as stated above, the provisional measures are urgent and necessary both to preserve the *status quo* and to protect the Parties' right to an exclusive remedy. They add that \"these rights will be immediately lost if Colombia proceeds to enforce the CGR Decision before this Tribunal reaches its determination on the merits of Claimants' underlying claims.\"34\n\nApplication, \u00b6 151.\n\n48.\n\nClaimants submit that \"the threat of harm to FPJVC is imminent\" and explain that, once their appeal against the CGR Decision had been summarily dismissed, \"under Colombian procedures, the CGR decision [became] final and enforceable with immediate effect,\"35 in Colombia or in any foreign jurisdiction. According to Claimants, \"to the extent any local remedies to prevent enforcement of the CGR Decision remain pending or unresolved, these matters will only, at most, temporarily suspend the enforcement of the CGR Decision.\"36\n\nApplication, \u00b6 152.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 152-153. *See* also, Claimants' Reply to the Application for Emergency Temporary Relief, \u00b6 4.\n\n49.\n\nClaimants further submit that \"the mere threat of recognition or enforcement proceedings, by itself, warrant[s] urgent relief.\"37 They note that Colombia has admitted that it has \"initiat[ed] enforcement proceedings\" during which the CGR may attach Claimants' assets at any time. Claimants contend that this admission, by definition, makes the harm to Claimants' interests imminent.38\n\nApplication, \u00b6 155.\n\nClaimants' Reply to the Application for Emergency Temporary Relief, \u00b6 10.\n\n50.\n\nAdditionally, on December 2, 2021, Claimants drew the attention of the Tribunal to the Notice received on December 1, 2021 from the Coactive Collection Unit of the CGR. In doing so, Claimants noted that the Notice states that collection proceedings have commenced and that it contains an invitation to Claimant Process Consultants, Inc. (\"PCI\") to pay the obligation owed as determined by the CGR through Auto 749, COP $2.940.950.323.482,43, plus interest. Finally, on February 14 and 24, 2022, Claimants also brought to the Tribunal's attention, *inter alia*, the enactment of Law 2195 codifying CGR's previous practices and granting it new statutory powers to enforce and collect CGR decisions. According to Claimants, this new law, \"is clearly part of the CGR's ongoing effort to collect from parties such as Claimants.\" Claimants also referred to an email sent on February 7, 2022 by the CGR to Mr. Hector Hern\u00e1ndez, Claimants' Colombian counsel, asking if he would accept service of the payment order issued by the CGR. According to Claimants, such service is \"a condition to commencing the coercive stage of the collection proceeding.\"39\n\nClaimants' Letter of February 24, 2022 p. 3. *See* also \u00b6\u00b6 22 and 25-27 supra.\n\ne. Proportionality\n------------------\n\n51.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the provisional measures sought are proportionate, \"given that the Respondent would suffer little to no harm.\"40 On this point, Claimants explain that \"at most Respondent would have to wait for the conclusion of these ICSID proceedings before enforcing the CGR Decision,\" so \"any harm dealt to Colombia would simply be the passing of more time until it can enforce the CGR Decision.\" In contrast, Claimants could face [REDACTED].\"41\n\nApplication, \u00b6 157.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 157-160. *See* also, Tr. p. 14:16-20 and Tr. p. 21:12-17.\n\n**iii. The Request**\n--------------------\n\n52.\n\nOn the basis of the above, Claimants request that the Tribunal order the following provisional measures:\n\n(1) \"Respondent, its courts, its executive branch, and any administrative agency, including the CGR, refrain from taking any measures of enforcement of the CGR Decision discussed herein until this arbitration has concluded;\n\n(2) Respondent, its courts, its executive branch, and any administrative agency, including the CGR, shall suspend all enforcement proceedings or actions directed towards the enforcement of the CGR Decision mentioned herein until this arbitration has concluded;\n\n(3) That Respondent shall communicate this Order without delay to the CGR, and any other authority with jurisdiction to enforce the CGR Decision discussed herein, and inform such authority that the CGR Decision is not enforceable pending the outcome of this arbitration;\n\n(4) That Respondent refrain from taking any action that would aggravate or exacerbate this dispute, threaten the integrity of this arbitration or frustrate the effectiveness of any award from this Tribunal;\n\n(5) Respondent shall promptly inform the Tribunal of the action that it has taken in compliance with this Order; and\n\n(6) Granting Claimants such other and further relief as the Tribunal deems just and equitable.\"\n\n**B. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n53.\n\nIn its Answer to the Application for Provisional Measures and related communications, Respondent requests that the Tribunal dismiss the Application for Provisional Measures and issue an order for costs and attorney's fees against Claimants.\n\n**i. The Tribunal's Authority to Grant Provisional Measures under the US-Colombia TPA**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Article 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA limits the type of provisional relief that may be ordered under the Treaty, such that it prohibits the Tribunal from granting the provisional measures requested by Claimants.\n\n55.\n\n*First*, Respondent explains that Article 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA limits the Tribunal's authority under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention to recommend provisional measures, by providing that \"(ii) [a tribunal may not] enjoin the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.\" This limitation, Respondent adds, is consistent with Article 10.26.1 of the US-Colombia TPA, which limits the types of remedies a tribunal may award to monetary damages or restitution of property. The Respondent notes that \"if a tribunal constituted under the Treaty cannot order a respondent to revert, stop or modify a measure found to be in violation of the Treaty, it follows that it also cannot enjoin the application of such measures.\" Respondent notes that Claimants have failed to address this point in their submissions.42\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6\u00b6 7-9. Tr. p. 37:16-38:6. *See* also, Tr. p. 41:14-42:6.\n\n56.\n\nAccording to Respondent, both Claimants' own admissions and the facts of the case should lead the Tribunal to conclude that Claimants are seeking to enjoin the application of the same measures they allege constitute a violation of the US-Colombia TPA.43\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16-17. Tr. p. 44:18-47:4.\n\n57.\n\nRespondent explains that the CGR Decision is the culmination of the Fiscal Liability proceeding, which Claimants allege was initiated in breach of the US-Colombia TPA. Respondent adds that \"because the purpose of a fiscal liability proceeding is to determine whether public servants and private parties have caused a damage to the State through the mismanagement of public resources and to seek compensation from those responsible, 'applying' the [CGR Decision] means seeking satisfaction from the fiscally liable parties, including Foster Wheeler and Process Consultants, of the amount set forth in the [CGR Decision].\" Accordingly, enjoining the enforcement of the CGR Decision \"would necessarily mean the 'application' or implementation of the measure alleged to constitute a breach of the Treaty, which is prohibited by Article 10.20.8\"44\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 15. Tr. p. 48:17-50:4.\n\n58.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent submits that, by seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the CGR Decision, Claimants are actually seeking to alter the *status quo*. This is because stopping the CGR's enforcement efforts would \"alter the ordinary course of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding\" preventing Colombia from applying its own laws and affecting third parties, namely, the other juridical and natural persons found jointly and severally liable alongside Foster Wheeler and Process Consultants.45\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 19. Tr. p. 58:10-22.\n\n59.\n\nAs to Claimants' argument regarding the right to an exclusive remedy under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, Respondent submits that this Article is irrelevant here, as \"[t]he exclusivity of the remedy set forth in Article 26 refers only to investment disputes, barring the parties that have consented to ICSID arbitration from seeking relief in another forum.\"46\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 18, footnote 36. Tr. p. 57:12-58:9.\n\n60.\n\nRespondent further notes that *IBT v. Panama*, *Feldman v. Mexico*, and *Pope & Talbot v. Canada* are directly relevant to this case; the tribunals in those cases rejected requests for provisional measures seeking to enjoin the application of a measure at issue in the arbitration on the basis of provisions identical to Art. 10.20.8 of the US-Panama TPA, as is the case here.47\n\nTr. p. 53:5-55:17.\n\n61.\n\nRespondent concludes that \"if the Tribunal were to enjoin the enforcement of the [CGR Decision], it will tacitly recognize that the [CGR Decision] is not the Measure at issue in this arbitration, and thus Claimants will be prevented from alleging [sic] in the arbitration that the [CGR Decision] constitute a violation of the Treaty and claim [sic] damages associated with the supposed breach.\"48\n\nTr. p. 56:2-12.\n\n**ii. The Requirements for Granting Provisional Measures are Not Met**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"both Parties substantially agree\" that a request for provisional measures must satisfy the following five cumulative requirements: (1) that the provisional measures sought are necessary and urgent to prevent an irreparable harm; (2) that the tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction over the dispute; (3) that the applicant has made a showing of a *prima facie* case on the merits; (4) that granting the provisional measures does not prejudice the other party; and (5) that granting the provisional measures does not cause the tribunal to prejudge the merits of the dispute.\"49\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 21.\n\na. Lack of *prima facie* jurisdiction\n-------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants have failed to meet their burden of proof to show that there is a *prima facie* basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Respondent refers to its Memorial on Preliminary Objections, and submits that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over this case for the following reasons:\n\n\u25aa \"The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* over this case because Claimants did not comply with the requirements established in Article 10.16.1 of the Treaty for submitting a claim to arbitration thereunder: there is no breach of a substantive obligation of the Treaty or an investment agreement and Claimants have not incurred any loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach. In fact, the Provisional Measures Application highlights the absence of an actual loss or damage arising out of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, as the interim relief Claimants seek is aimed at \"preventing\" the supposed loss or damage that could stem from the enforcement of the Ruling with Fiscal Liability.\n\n\u25aa Claimants do not have a qualifying investment under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention because the Services Contract, which Claimants allege constitutes their \"investment\", does not qualify as an investment\" under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention since it is an ordinary commercial contract for the provision of services that does not entail investment risk for Claimants.\n\n\u25aa Claimant FPJVC does not qualify as a \"national of another Contracting State\" under the ICSID Convention because FPJVC is \u2013 in Claimants' own words \u2013 a \"contractual joint venture\", and as such, it cannot be considered a \"juridical person\" for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n\u25aa Contrary to the express requirement in Article 10.16.2 of the Treaty, Claimants Foster Wheeler and Process Consultants did not send a notice of intent to submit the present dispute to arbitration, thus depriving this Tribunal of jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* over their claims.\n\n\u25aa Claimants did not effectively waive their right to initiate or continue proceedings with respect to the measure that they allege to be a breach of the substantive obligations under the Treaty. On the one hand, Claimants' 'waiver' \u2013 submitted with their Notice of Arbitration \u2013does not satisfy the formal requirements set forth by Article 10.18.2(b) of the Treaty since it contains a reservation of rights (which is not only impermissible but empties the waiver of content). On the other hand, Foster Wheeler and Process Consultants have not effectively and materially complied with such 'waiver' because not only have they continued to participate actively in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, and have even appealed the Ruling with Fiscal Liability before the fiscal liability and administrative sanctions chamber of the CGR, but they have also \u2013 subsequent to filing their Notice of Arbitration \u2013 initiated two additional *acciones de tutela* before Colombian courts for alleged violations of due process with regard to the conduct of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, all of which results in the lack jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* of the Tribunal.\"50\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6\u00b6 47-49 (footnotes omitted).\n\nb. Lack of a *prima facie* case on the merits\n---------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nRespondent alleges that Claimants have also failed to meet their burden to establish a *prima facie* case on the merits.51 First, according to Respondent, Claimants' FET claim has no basis, since \"(i) the Treaty's FET standard only protects investments and not investors, and all of Claimants' claims are based on alleged acts, omissions and conduct by Colombia that would have affected only investors; (ii) in any event, Claimants plead their case on the basis of an incorrect FET standard, since the FET standard \u2013 under the Treaty \u2013 is limited to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, and none of Claimants' allegations is capable of violating the minimum standard of treatment.\"52\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6\u00b6 47-49.\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 51.\n\n65.\n\nSecond, no *prima facie* case on expropriation has been made. According to Respondent, Claimants have merely alleged that the following contractual rights have been allegedly expropriated: [REDACTED] However, Respondent continues, \"neither of these two 'contractual rights' is capable of being economically exploited independently and separately from the rest of the Services Contract.\"53\n\n*Id.*\n\n66.\n\nThird, the national treatment obligation under Article 10.3 of the US-Colombia TPA is also completely baseless. According to Respondent, \"it is clear that Claimants have failed to prove \u2013 even *prima facie* \u2013 that the conditions necessary for a breach of the national treatment obligation are met due to the fact that: (i) the Indictment Order (as well as the [CGR Decision] that was issued after this Arbitration was initiated) involves both nationals and foreigners.\"54\n\n*Id.*\n\n67.\n\nFourth, Respondent argues that Claimants' claims are not capable of constituting a *prima facie* breach of the MFN obligation under Article 10.4 of the Treaty for the following reasons: \"(i) the MFN obligation is a standard of 'treatment' and Claimants have failed to make a *prima facie* showing of a factual scenario in which third-country investors were accorded more favorable treatment, in like circumstances, than U.S. investors; (ii) the MFN clause of the Treaty cannot be used to import substantive obligations from other investment treaties (new rights) that are not found in the base treaty (*i.e.*, the Treaty), nor \u2013 if the importation of new rights were permitted \u2013 can such an importation be contrary to the public policy considerations taken into account by the Contracting Parties to the Treaty; (iii) even if the importation of an umbrella clause from another treaty were permitted, the umbrella clause of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT that Claimants seek to import does not grant consent to arbitrate claims for breaches of that umbrella clause; and (iv) in any event, even if the umbrella clause of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT could be imported in the manner requested by Claimants, it would be impossible to apply that clause in this case because the requirements for its application are not met (*inter alia*, because Reficar is not an agency of the Colombian central government).\"55\n\n*Id.*\n\n68.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that there could not have been a breach of an investment agreement, because the US-Colombia TPA \"does not grant jurisdiction to the Tribunal to hear alleged contractual breaches and, in any case, no investment agreement *prima facie* exists.\"56\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 51 (footnotes omitted).\n\n69.\n\nRespondent also rejects Claimants' contention that they have *prima facie* established that they have a right to the relief sought. According to Respondent, Claimants' claims would fall outside the Tribunal's powers under Article 10.26 of the US-Colombia TPA, because \"(i) the Tribunal is not empowered to award moral damages; (ii) the Tribunal is also not empowered to award non-monetary orders or injunctions; and (iii) the Tribunal cannot grant an offsetting award since it is not empowered to award hypothetical damages.\"57\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 52.\n\nc. No necessity or urgency\n--------------------------\n\n70.\n\nCiting *Phoenix v. Czech Republic*, Respondent argues that provisional measures should only be granted in situations of \"absolute necessity and urgency.\" Because Claimants will not suffer an irreparable harm if the requested relief is not granted, there is no absolute urgency or necessity in their Application.58\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6\u00b6 29-32.\n\n71.\n\n*First*, as to the \"necessity\" requirement, Respondent submits that Claimants have failed to prove that the relief they seek is necessary to prevent an irreparable harm. It explains:\n\n\u25aa \"The [CGR Decision] is joint and several, and so collection efforts of the amount set forth therein will not solely focus on Claimants.\n\n\u25aa Although the [CGR Decision] became final at the administrative level, it is still subject to judicial review. Claimants may initiate an annulment action against the [CGR Decision] and may request a stay of enforcement to halt any collection efforts.\n\n\u25aa A request for a provisional stay of enforcement before the administrative adjudicatory jurisdiction would not require Foster Wheeler or Process Consultants to offer a bond.\n\n\u25aa The fact that the CGR has been thus far - more than four years since the initiation of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding - unable to locate any assets of Claimants in Colombia shows that enforcement against them will likely prove unsuccessful. In fact, Mr. Thomas Grell, Claimants' witness and the President of Foster Wheeler, admits that that company does not have any assets in Colombia.\n\n\u25aa The CGR's efforts to identify Claimants' assets abroad have also failed so far.\n\n\u25aa Even though the CGR will renew its search for assets during the forced collection proceeding, such a search is likely to be unsuccessful. Claimants are not likely to have acquired assets in Colombia, and the search for assets abroad faces enormous legal and practical hurdles.\n\n\u25aa The CGR does not currently have in place precautionary measures against assets owned by Claimants in Colombia or abroad, despite having authority to do so. That is unsurprising given that an asset must first be identified before it can be attached or seized.\n\n\u25aa In the unlikely event that the CGR is able to identify assets owned by Claimants in a foreign jurisdiction (Claimants accept the bulk of their assets are located abroad), attaching such assets is entirely another matter. The CGR relies on cooperation mechanisms that are ill-suited for such purpose.\n\n\u25aa The CGR must carry out any collection efforts of the [CGR Decision] in accordance with the provisions set forth in the relevant Colombian laws and regulations, and simply does not have authority to embark on a \"worldwide litigation campaign\" against Claimants.\n\n\u25aa [REDACTED] If locating a single asset abroad has thus far - more than four years since the initiation of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding - proven hopeless, locating, attaching, and auctioning off the bulk of Claimants assets is simply impossible.\n\n\u25aa Even if the CGR manages to attach any of Claimants' assets - either in Colombia or abroad - during the forced collection proceeding, it may only auction those assets after the courts of the administrative adjudicatory jurisdiction rule on any annulment actions initiated by Claimants against the [CGR Decision].\n\n\u25aa If an asset owned by Claimants is attached and sold off, monetary damages would be an appropriate means to repair such damage.\"59\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 34 (footnotes omitted).\n\n72.\n\n*Second*, as to the \"*urgency*\" requirement, Respondent submits that \"the fact that the CGR is initiating enforcement proceedings of the [CGR Decision] [\u2026], does not entail an imminent threat to Claimants' assets 'urgently' requiring the provisional measures.\"60\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 37.\n\n73.\n\nRespondent explains that the \"forced collection proceedings of rulings with fiscal liability\" take place in two stages: (1) the voluntary collection stage \u2013 which seeks to obtain payment of the amount owed by debtors on a voluntary basis by means of negotiated payment agreements \u2013 and (2) the forced collection stage, at which point, the debtor may resist enforcement by filing objections against the administrative act by which the payment order is issued. In this case, the Respondent submits, the collection proceedings are in their early stages and \"the CGR will first attempt to persuade the fiscally liable parties to pay voluntarily.\"61 Even if the proceedings were to enter into the forced collection stage, Claimants would have the means to resist enforcement of the CGR Decision under Colombian law.62 In its letter of December 8, 2021, Respondent indicates that the notice from the Coactive Collection Unit of the CGR received by Claimants on December 1, 202163 confirms this point as it notifies Claimants of the initiation of the voluntary collection stage of the collection proceeding and invites them to make payment of the amount established in the CGR Decision.64 On February 18, 2022, when commenting on the CGR's email of February 7, 2022 to Mr. Hernandez,65 Respondent indicated that \"a payment order [in the collection proceedings] has now been issued \u2013 as Respondent anticipated it would, marking the initiation of the forced collection stage, *but* (i) the CGR has yet to serve notice of the payment order on Claimants; (ii) Claimants may file objections to the payment order before the CGR; and (iii) if the CGR rejects their objections and orders the sale of any assets of Claimants previously attached, Claimants may challenge such decision before the courts of the administrative adjudicatory jurisdiction, with such challenge having the effect of suspending the sale of the attached assets.\"66\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 37.\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 22-23 supra.\n\nRespondent's Letter of December 8, 2021. On this point, see also Respondent's Answer \u00b6 34 and Tr. pp. 62-64.\n\n*See* \u00b6 50 supra.\n\nRespondent's Letter of February 18, 2022, p. 2-3 (emphasis added). *See* also \u00b6\u00b6 22 and 25-27 supra.\n\n74.\n\nFinally, Respondent rejects Claimants' argument pursuant to which they would need only to show \"material risk of harm\" instead of \"irreparable harm.\" Respondent notes that the alleged harm that Claimants seek to prevent with the provisional measures \"is highly speculative and distant,\" and that the Tribunal \"cannot grant interim relief based on mere conjectures of potential harm.\"67\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 39.\n\n75.\n\nAccording to Respondent, none of the cases cited by Claimants assists their position, as they do not factually resemble this case and they were not based on investments treaties with a provision akin to Article 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA.68\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6\u00b6 41-45.\n\nd. Prejudice to Respondent and Third Parties\n--------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nFirst, Respondent alleges that granting the provisional measures \"would affect Respondent's sovereign right to enforce the [CGR Decision].\" Respondent explains that the CGR has \"a constitutional and legal obligation to enforce the [CGR Decision] and to attempt to recover the amount determined therein,\" and adds that \"Colombia's right to enforce its domestic laws outweighs Claimants' feigned concern about the enforcement of the [CGR Decision]\".69\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 55.\n\n77.\n\nRespondent further explains that granting the Request \"would mean that the enforcement of the [CGR Decision] would be limited to the remaining fiscally liable parties, excluding Claimants, which would change the *status quo* and affect the rights of third part[ies].\"70\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 55.\n\ne. Prejudgment of the merits\n----------------------------\n\n78.\n\nRespondent explains that \"even though Claimants do not expressly refer to this requirement independently, in paragraph 117 of their Application, Claimants cite the case *Pey Casado v. Chile*, in which the tribunal warned against the danger of prejudging the merits of the claim.\"71\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 58.\n\n79.\n\nAccording to Respondent, if the Tribunal were to grant the provisional measures sought, \"it [would] be prejudging this case because it [would] effectively grant Claimants the relief they are seeking without fully examining the merits.\"72\n\nRespondent's Answer, \u00b6 60.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe core discussion between the Parties is related to the potential impact of the enforcement of the CGR Decision upon Claimants and their businesses and assets during the course of this arbitration. In reliance upon such asserted impact, Claimants filed an Application for Provisional Measures with the Arbitral Tribunal simultaneously with an Application for Emergency Temporary Relief, which was dismissed on October 25, 2021, for lack of established urgency and necessity.\n\n81.\n\nThe pending Application by Claimants seeks, first and foremost, an order of the Arbitral Tribunal requiring Respondent, its courts, its executive branch and any administrative agency (which includes the CGR) to refrain from taking any measures for the enforcement of the CGR Decision. Should any such similar measure have been initiated, Claimants request that the Arbitral Tribunal order its immediate suspension.\n\n82.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has analysed and deliberated upon the allegations and arguments of the Parties. It has further reviewed the exhibits as well as doctrine and case law. On that basis, it proceeds to issue its Decision on Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures.\n\n**B. Legal Framework**\n----------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe analysis of the Application for Provisional Measures by the Arbitral Tribunal will focus on (i) the discussion regarding the authority of the Arbitral Tribunal to grant provisional measures at the request of a party in light of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and, further, Article 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA (the \"Relevant Provisions\"), and (ii) the conformity of the Application tendered by Claimants with the requirements widely accepted by arbitral tribunals as a basis upon which to grant provisional measures.\n\n84.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides the following:\n\n\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"\n\n85.\n\nRule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules reads as follows:\n\n\"(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the constitution of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of either party, fix time limits for the parties to present observations on the request, so that the request and observations may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution.\n\n(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights and interests.\"\n\n86.\n\nPursuant to Rule 39 (1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, an application for provisional measures must address three matters: the rights to be preserved; the measures requested; and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n87.\n\nFinally, Article 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA provides as follows:\n\nA tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal's jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal's jurisdiction. A tribunal may not order attachment or enjoin the application of a measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16. For purposes of this paragraph, an order includes a recommendation.\n\n**C. Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe Parties have discussed extensively whether the Arbitral Tribunal has the power and authority to grant the provisional measures envisaged in the Application filed by Claimants.\n\n89.\n\nWhile it is substantially undisputed that in ICSID cases, arbitral tribunals have the power and authority to recommend provisional measures, as envisaged by the Relevant Provisions, it is also noteworthy that the language of the second part of Article 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA includes a limitation upon the power and authority otherwise conferred upon arbitral tribunals by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n90.\n\nFor the avoidance of any doubt, it is important to underscore that it is also undisputed (and it could not be understood otherwise) that Article 47 of the Convention provides that parties may limit the power and authority conferred upon arbitrators. The opening language of Article 47 of the ICSID Convention provides for such possibility by the inclusion of the express qualification: \"*except as the parties otherwise agree*\". Thus, the power and authority of an arbitral tribunal is not absolute to the extent that parties, in the exercise of their private autonomy, may opt to set limits upon them. In this case, upon entering into the US-Colombia TPA, the Parties consented expressly to such limitation associated with the type of relief that may not be ordered by an arbitral tribunal.\n\n91.\n\nIn line with the authorization provided by Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, Article 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA encompasses the authority granted to arbitral tribunals to recommend provisional measures, together with the limitation imposed on such power and authority by virtue of the nature of the relief sought, which must be strictly observed. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the preceding construction of the provisional measures system is in strict compliance with the Relevant Provisions.\n\n92.\n\nArticle 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA has given rise to an extensive discussion among the Parties. Respondent is adamant in stating that the relief sought by Claimants in the context of the Application for Provisional Measures coincides with the relief sought in the context of Claimants' main claim in the Arbitration. Respondent further alleges that Claimants are looking to stop it from enforcing through its instrumentalities the collection of amounts owed by Claimants by virtue of the CGR Decision which found Claimants fiscally liable.\n\n93.\n\nClaimants' reasoning led them to state that their application for an order to enjoin the collection efforts by Respondent does not seek the same relief as that which they seek in the arbitration. The Arbitral Tribunal emphasizes that Claimants and Respondent have brought into issue the nature and extent of the CGR Decision and whether the collection efforts were the culmination of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding or a separate and independent proceeding.\n\n94.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal observes that, even on *prima facie* analysis, it is clear that the principles and features of the proceeding instituted by the CGR against Claimants and others are complex matters. Any review would necessarily encompass various phases, including the forced collection proceedings that Claimants now seek to enjoin by filing their Application for Provisional Measures.\n\n95.\n\nIrrespective of deciding whether the relief sought falls within the scope of the limitation in Article 10.20 8 of the US-Colombia TPA, an exercise that would certainly require the appraisal of various other elements which are not before the Arbitral Tribunal, it is the Arbitral Tribunal's understanding that the forced collection proceedings are part of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding. This is a logical conclusion that derives from the essence and nature of the proceeding which is designed to ascertain the existence of fiscal liability of public servants, individuals and/or legal entities, who or which, it is alleged, may have harmed the State's interests and caused them damage. Assuming that the decision is affirmative, enforcement is a natural consequence of the complex process with a view to making the aggrieved party whole and allowing it to recover the losses and damages incurred by virtue of wrongdoings perpetrated by those deemed liable. Hence, the collection proceedings may not in any circumstance be deemed a separate and independent mechanism to recover any sums owed. They are, indeed, the culmination of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.\n\n96.\n\nAnother aspect of the matter of which the Arbitral Tribunal has taken account in its consideration of the nature and essence of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding and the impact of the application of Article 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA is the need to ascertain whether the provisional measures requested are such that they will protect the *status quo* without aggravating the dispute.\n\n97.\n\nAs anticipated earlier, the Arbitral Tribunal has had the opportunity to analyze the nature and essence of the Fiscal Liability Proceeding and to determine that it is a complex process consisting of various phases which are inter-related. The initial phase of the proceeding is aimed at issuing a ruling with respect to fiscal liability. Should the ruling uphold the fiscal liability of those who harmed the interests of the Republic causing it damage, the process culminates with the enforcement of the affirmative ruling against those individuals and entities that are deemed liable thereby and the consequent collection of the amounts owed.\n\n98.\n\nHence, the *status quo* in this case, as the Arbitral Tribunal understands it, is that Respondent enjoys the freedom to apply its national laws and rules and to proceed with all the steps required to finalize the process. Respondent maintains that the Arbitral Tribunal may not enjoin it from conducting the fiscal liability process, nor may it purport to restrain the ordinary exercise of that process by Respondent.73 In the Tribunal's opinion, Claimants' contention that the relief sought encompasses their right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the avoidance of any aggravation of the dispute between the Parties is not borne out by the circumstances in this case. This argument, if accepted, would end up altering and modifying the *status quo* rather than preserving it.\n\n*See,* for example, *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Procedural Order No. 2 (October 16, 2002), p. 301 (Ex. RL-242)\n\n99.\n\nThe power and authority of this Arbitral Tribunal to grant the provisional measure sought by Claimants will depend upon the Arbitral Tribunal's determination of whether such power and authority is subject to the Treaty limitation.\n\n100.\n\nThe determination by the Arbitral Tribunal of the application of the limitation provided by the Treaty is a very sensitive matter. It requires extreme care on the part of the Arbitral Tribunal, not least, because the Arbitral Tribunal is very conscious of its duty not to prejudge the merits of this case in the context of the current summary proceedings.\n\n101.\n\nThis Arbitration is still in its preliminary phase. The Arbitral Tribunal does not yet have available to it all the information that it would need and require to enable it to decide whether the relief sought as a provisional measure is identical to that which constitutes the relief sought and to be reflected in the final award, should the Arbitral Tribunal's decide that it has jurisdiction, and, ultimately, were to rule in favour of Claimants.\n\n102.\n\nIt is the understanding of the Arbitral Tribunal that provisional measures have an extraordinary nature and, due to such unique characteristic, they should only be granted in very limited circumstances and provided that the party seeking the measures can demonstrate that all of the applicable prerequisites have been met. Should one of them fail to be met, the order may not be issued.\n\n103.\n\nThus, in addition to the Arbitral Tribunal having the power and authority to grant the provisional measures under Article 10.20.8 of the US-Colombia TPA, cumulative requirements must be met for the granting of the provisional measures requested.\n\n104.\n\nThis Arbitral Tribunal has already determined that it lacks the information that it needs and requires to determine its power and authority under the Treaty. In any event, it is incumbent upon the Arbitral Tribunal to ascertain whether the prerequisites for an order to grant provisional measures have been met.\n\n**D. Requirements to be met by Claimants**\n------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Parties agree that if all the requirements are met, then the Arbitral Tribunal may make the order sought. Furthermore, the burden of proof of the satisfaction of all such requirements shall rest with the applicant, in this case, Claimants. The Arbitral Tribunal also understands that among those requirements, special attention must be given at this stage to those which go to the necessity and urgency of the order to be granted.\n\n106.\n\nAlthough this Arbitral Tribunal is now deciding whether to grant the Application for Provisional Measures, it has clearly in mind that Claimants previously filed an Application for Emergency Temporary Relief which was dismissed by the Arbitral Tribunal on October 25, 2021. That application was denied by reason of Claimants' inability to establish that their assets were under threat of harm, there being no, or no sufficient evidence of urgency, necessity or danger of imminent harm.\n\n107.\n\nSince Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief was dismissed on those grounds, the Arbitral Tribunal deems it appropriate to revisit and analyze anew the current status of urgency and necessity, such that it is in a position to ascertain whether the then prevailing conditions have been altered by subsequent events.\n\n108.\n\nFollowing the exchange of briefs in connection with this Application for Provisional Measures, Claimants requested leave from the Arbitral Tribunal to submit a copy of a Notice received on December 1, 2021 from the Coactive Collection Unit of the CGR as an exhibit in support of their Application. According to Claimants, such Notice stated that collection proceedings had commenced and it invited PCI to pay the obligation owed as determined by the CGR through Auto 749, namely COP $2.940.950.323.482,43, plus interest. Claimants stated that this was new information that did not exist when the Parties had made their submissions on the Application for Provisional Measures. The Arbitral Tribunal granted leave to Claimants to submit the Notice received and invited Respondent to comment on it.\n\n109.\n\nOn December 8, 2021, Respondent clarified that the Notice simply notified PCI of the voluntary collection stage of the collection proceedings and invited it to make payment of the amount established in the CGR Decision. Respondent further noted that the payment amount indicated in the Notice was less than the amount established in the CGR Decision. On this point, Respondent reiterated that the payment obligation in the CGR Decision is joint and several, such that payments made by any fiscally liable party reduce the total amount owed by all. Finally, Respondent explained that the voluntary collection stage may last up to three months following which, the CGR would initiate forced collection stage. Even if matters reached the point of a forced collection stage, the CGR's search and the eventual attachment of assets abroad faced monumental practical hurdles as it had explained.\n\n110.\n\nLooking back, the Arbitral Tribunal is now able to compare the situation which prevailed at the time of Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures with the current situation.\n\n111.\n\nDespite the development before the Arbitral Tribunal, referenced at paragraphs 108 and 109 above, it may be established that notwithstanding the receipt of the Notice on December 1, 2021, Claimants have not been able to report any consequential measure affecting their assets. Apparently, similar notices were served on those other parties found liable by Auto 749. The Arbitral Tribunal has no reason to believe that was not the case in so far as Auto 749 includes other individuals and entities found jointly and severally liable with Claimants.\n\n112.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the additional exhibits introduced by Claimants on February 14, 2022 and the Parties' comments of February 18 and 24, 2022.\n\n113.\n\nThe briefs submitted by Respondent list in detail the various steps to be followed by the authorities in their collection efforts. From the communications received from the Parties in February 2022, the Arbitral Tribunal understands that the forced collection stage has just been initiated, but that the CGR has yet to serve notice of the payment order on Claimants, to which Claimants may object. The Tribunal further understands, first, that if the CGR rejects Claimants' objections and orders the sale of any assets previously attached, Claimants may challenge such decision before the Colombian courts and, second, any such challenge would have the effect of suspending the sale of the attached assets.\n\n114.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has before it Claimants' statement that unless enjoined, the enforcement of the CGR Decision will aggravate the *status quo [REDACTED]*. They add that the risk of irreparable harm is both imminent and urgent.\n\n115.\n\nAs a matter of fact, however, the evidence before the Arbitral Tribunal does not allow it to draw the conclusion that Claimants' assets are under any immediate threat, or that the current collection proceedings by themselves give rise to an imminent risk that Claimants will suffer irreparable harm. In the opinion of the Tribunal and, irrespective of any discussion of whether what is required is a showing that the harm has to be irreparable to give rise to the right to protection, or whether a simple danger or threat of harm would suffice, the reality is that no, or no sufficient, evidence has been adduced by Claimants to establish that either is yet present in this case.\n\n116.\n\nMoreover, the passing of time since the filing of the Application for Provisional Measures has so far demonstrated that no harm to Claimants' assets is imminent and that they have not yet suffered damage. Claimants have not been able to produce any evidence that circumstances are such that provisional measures protection are necessary and appropriate.\n\n117.\n\nIn sum, the Arbitral Tribunal has been unable to identify any material change in circumstances upon a comparison of the current situation with that which prevailed towards the end of last year when it rejected Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief, which could affect the assets and the businesses of Claimants by virtue of the normal course of such collection proceedings under Colombian laws. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the requirements related to necessity and urgency have been met.\n\n118.\n\nSince all requirements must be met cumulatively, the failure identified above is sufficient to enable the Arbitral Tribunal to decide the application without the need for any further analysis of the remaining requirements.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n119.\n\nFor these reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal **DISMISSES** Claimants' Application for Provisional Measure. Should hereafter Claimants consider that a material change of circumstances has arisen, the Arbitral Tribunal grants them liberty to apply on the basis that it would be prepared to entertain a further reasoned application, fully supported with evidence of the asserted urgency of, and necessity for, the measures then sought. A decision on the allocation of the costs originated by this Application will be rendered at the appropriate procedural time.\n\nDate: May 31, 2022"}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2024-12-19T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**Table of Selected Abbreviations**\n-----------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (2006) |\n| US-Colombia TPA or Treaty | U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, which entered into force on May 15, 2012 |\n| C-[#] | Claimants' Exhibit |\n| Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections | Claimants' Counter Memorial on Preliminary Objections dated October 14, 2021 |\n| Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections | Claimants' Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections dated February 11, 2022 |\n| CL-[#] | Claimants' Legal Authority |\n| Hearing | Hearing on Preliminary Objections held in Washington, D.C., and by video conference from May 19, 2022 to May 20, 2022 |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated March 18, 1965 |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| R-[#] | Respondent's Exhibit |\n| Memorial on Preliminary Objections | Respondent's Memorial on Preliminary Objections dated July 1, 2021 |\n| Reply on Preliminary Objections | Respondent's Reply on Preliminary Objections dated December 13, 2021 |\n| Tribunal | Arbitral tribunal constituted on June 18, 2020 |\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the U.S. - Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, which entered into force on May 15, 2012 (the \"**US-Colombia TPA**\" or the \"**Treaty**\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe claimants are Amec Foster Wheeler USA Corporation and Process Consultants, Inc., two companies incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (U.S.), and Joint Venture Foster Wheeler USA Corporation and Process Consultants, Inc., a U.S. contractual joint venture organized under the laws of the State of New York (U.S.) (together, the \"**Claimants**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe respondent is the Republic of Colombia (\"**Colombia**\" or \"**Respondent**\").\n\n4.\n\nClaimants and Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\" The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nThis case relates to a dispute arising out of a contract for the construction and expansion of a Colombia-owned oil refinery for the supply of environmentally clean motor fuels.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn December 6, 2019, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Amec Foster Wheeler USA Corporation (\"**Foster Wheeler**\"), Process Consultants, Inc. (\"**Process Consultants**\"), and Joint Venture Foster Wheeler USA Corporation and Process Consultants, Inc. (\"**FPJVC**\"), against Colombia, together with Exhibits C-001-RFA through C-005-RFA and Legal Authority CL-001-RFA (the \"**Request**\").\n\n7.\n\nOn December 31, 2019, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding, arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators. The Tribunal is composed of Jos\u00e9 Emilio Nunes Pinto, a national of Brazil, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; John Beechey, a national of the United Kingdom, appointed by Claimants; and Marcelo Kohen, a national of the Argentine Republic, appointed by Respondent.\n\n9.\n\nOn June 18, 2020, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\"), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments, and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Marisa Planells-Valero, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n10.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on September 18, 2020, by video conference.\n\n11.\n\nFollowing the first session, on March 18, 2021, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington D.C. (U.S.). Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out the schedule for the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings. On April 1, 2021, the Tribunal issued a revised procedural calendar, including amendments agreed by the Parties.\n\n12.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, on July 1, 2021, Respondent filed its Memorial on Preliminary Objections (\"**Memorial on Preliminary Objections**\"), together with Exhibits R-001 through R-092 and Legal Authorities RL-001 through RL-227.\n\n13.\n\nOn September 2, 2021, Claimants submitted an Application for Provisional Measures and Emergency Temporary Relief, together with Exhibits C-001 through C-010, Legal Authorities CL-001 through CL-038, and the Witness Statements of C\u00e9sar Torrente (CWS-1), Steve Conway (CWS-2), Thomas Grell (CWS-3), and Colin Johnson (CWS-4).\n\n14.\n\nOn September 7, 2021, the Tribunal invited Respondent to submit discrete responses to Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief (by September 17, 2021), and to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures (by September 28, 2021).\n\n15.\n\nOn September 9, 2021, Respondent requested extensions of time to file its responses regarding both of Claimants' Applications. Respondent proposed a revised schedule upon which Claimants commented on September 10, 2021.\n\n16.\n\nOn September 13, 2021, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and to try to reach agreement on a revised procedural calendar regarding Claimants' Applications or, in case of disagreement, to provide any additional comments by September 15, 2021. The Tribunal also informed the Parties of its decision to stay the procedural calendar of September 7, 2021 until a revised calendar had been agreed by the Parties or a decision on the matter had been adopted by the Tribunal upon consideration of the Parties' positions.\n\n17.\n\nOn September 15, 2021, the Parties filed their respective comments regarding the procedural calendar. Respondent objected to Claimants' comments on September 16, 2021.\n\n18.\n\nOn September 20, 2021, the Tribunal issued a revised procedural calendar, as follows: (i) Respondent's Answer to Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief to be filed by September 30, 2021; and (ii) Respondent's Answer to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures to be filed by October 28, 2021.\n\n19.\n\nOn September 30, 2021, Respondent filed its Answer to Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief, together with Exhibits R-093 through R-099 and Legal Authorities RL-228 through RL-242.\n\n20.\n\nOn October 5, 2021, Claimants requested leave to file a reply in response to Respondent's Answer to the Application for Emergency Temporary Relief. Claimants also requested that the Tribunal schedule oral arguments. Respondent objected to Claimants' request by communication of October 6, 2021. Claimants filed further observations on October 7, 2021.\n\n21.\n\nOn October 8, 2021, the Tribunal invited (a) Claimants to submit a Reply to Respondent's Answer to the Application for Emergency Temporary Relief by October 12, 2021, and (b) Respondent to submit a Rejoinder to that Reply by October 18, 2021. In addition, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confirm their availability for a hearing on Claimants' Application of Provisional Measures.\n\n22.\n\nOn October 12, 2021, Claimants filed their Reply on the Application for Emergency Temporary Relief, together with Legal Authorities CL-039 through CL-049 and Supplemental Witness Statement of C\u00e9sar Torrente (CWS-5).\n\n23.\n\nOn October 14, 2021, Claimants filed their Counter Memorial on Preliminary Objections (\"**Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections**\"), together with Exhibits C-011 through C-022 and Legal Authorities CL-050 through CL-207.\n\n24.\n\nOn October 18, 2021, Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief, together with Legal Authorities RL-243 through RL-247.\n\n25.\n\nOn October 25, 2021, the Tribunal rejected Claimants' Application for Emergency Temporary Relief. The Tribunal decided unanimously as follows:\n\n(a) Claimants' Request for Emergency Temporary relief is denied;\n\n(b) The Tribunal confirms that it will hear the Parties' oral arguments on Claimants' Request for Provisional Measures during the Hearing that will take place virtually on November 4, 2021.\n\n(c) Either Party may bring to the Tribunal's attention any new, relevant, facts that fundamentally change the current circumstances.\n\n(d) The Tribunal reserves its decision on costs for a later stage.\n\n26.\n\nOn October 28, 2021, Respondent submitted its Answer to Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, together with Legal Authorities RL-248 through RL-266.\n\n27.\n\nOn November 4, 2021, the Tribunal held a Hearing on Provisional Measures by video conference.

In their oral arguments, Claimants referred to a document which was not in the record. The Tribunal gave Respondent leave to provide any comments upon the new document by November 11, 2021.\n\n29.\n\nOn November 11, 2021, Respondent submitted its comments on the new document which had been introduced into the record by Claimants as Exhibit C-23.\n\n30.\n\nOn November 16, 2021, Claimants responded to Respondent's communication of November 12, 2021. On that same date, Respondent applied to the Tribunal to strike Claimants' November 16, 2021 letter from the record. Further comments from Claimants were received on that same date.\n\n31.\n\nOn December 2, 2021, Claimants requested leave to submit a new document into the record, namely, the Notice from the Coactive Collection Unit of the Comptroller General of the Republic of Colombia (the \"**Notice**\").\n\n32.\n\nOn December 3, 2021, the Tribunal invited Claimants to submit a copy of the Notice by December 6, 2021, and Respondent to provide comments on the contents of the Notice by December 8, 2021. The Parties proceeded accordingly.\n\n33.\n\nOn December 10, 2021, the Tribunal rejected Respondent's request to strike Claimants' letter of November 16, 2021 from the record. In doing so, the Tribunal invited Respondent to submit any additional comments in connection with Claimants' letter by December 15, 2021. Respondent proceeded accordingly.\n\n34.\n\nOn December 13, 2021, Respondent filed its Reply on Preliminary Objections (\"**Reply on Preliminary Objections**\"), together with Exhibits R-100 through R-126 and Legal Authorities RL-267 through RL-332.\n\n35.\n\nOn February 9, 2022, Claimants requested leave to submit additional documents into the record, indicating that Respondent had confirmed that it had no objection to their request. Based on the agreement of the Parties, the Tribunal invited Claimants to submit the new documents by February 14, 2022. The Tribunal also invited Respondent to submit comments by February 18, 2022.\n\n36.\n\nOn February 11, 2022, Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections (\"**Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections**\"), together with Exhibits C-024 through C-029 and Legal Authorities CL-208 through CL-262.\n\n37.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal's instructions, on February 14, 2022, Claimants filed the new documents and requested leave to answer to Respondent's comments regarding the new documents. Respondent filed its observations on February 18, 2022.\n\n38.\n\nOn February 21, 2022, the Tribunal invited Claimants to comment on Respondent's communication of February 18 by February 24, 2022, and Respondent to submit any additional comments by February 28, 2022. The Parties proceeded accordingly.\n\n39.\n\nOn April 4, 2022, the United States of America filed a written submission as a Non-Disputing State Party (the \"**NDP Submission**\") pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the US-Colombia TPA.\n\n40.\n\nOn April 19, 2022, the President held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by video conference.\n\n41.\n\nOn April 25, 2022, Claimants filed their observations on the NDP's Submission, together with Exhibits C-030 through C-033 and Legal Authorities CL-263 through CL-287. On the same day, Respondent filed its observations on the NDP Submission, together with Legal Authorities RL-333 to RL-343.\n\n42.\n\nOn April 26, 2022, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the organization of the hearing.\n\n43.\n\nOn April 27, 2022, Respondent requested leave to submit an additional document into the record. The next day, on April 28, 2022, Respondent requested that certain portions of Claimants' comments upon the NDP Submission be stricken from the record.\n\n44.\n\nOn May 3, 2022, following an exchange of communications, the Tribunal invited Claimants to submit their comments regarding Respondent's request of April 27, 2022.\n\n45.\n\nOn May 4, 2022, Claimants filed their comments on Respondent's request to strike certain portions of Claimants' observations on the NDP Submission, together with Legal Authorities CL-288 through CL-291.\n\n46.\n\nOn May 9, 2022, in accordance with the Tribunal's instructions, Claimants filed their observations on Respondent's request of April 27, 2022.\n\n47.\n\nOn May 14, 2022, the Tribunal determined Respondent's requests of April 27 and 28, 2022.

PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n---------------------------\n\n86.\n\nBefore examining the arguments presented by the Parties with respect to this Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Tribunal will address two preliminary matters disputed by the Parties: the relevance of party and non-party submissions, and the test for establishing jurisdiction.\n\n**A. The relevance of party and non-party submissions**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nIn support of its position, Colombia relies on previous party and non-party submissions, especially the non-party submissions made by the United States of America, the other Contracting Party to the Treaty.\n\n88.\n\nClaimants contend that to the extent the NDP Submission addresses other treaties, it is not a generally recognized source of international law under the Vienna Convention, as Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention refers to subsequent agreement or subsequent practice of the relevant treaty. A non-party interpretation of a different treaty cannot, by definition, establish the subsequent agreement or practice of the Treaty. And in order to show subsequent practice, Colombia must prove that both the U.S. and Colombia repeatedly interpret the Treaty in a consistent way, which it failed to do.\n\n89.\n\nFurther, Claimants submit that non-party submissions are of questionable value, given the incentive for States to limit the scope and reach of investment claims against them. As such, the NDP Submission should be considered nothing more than an *amicus* submission.26\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, Section III.B.\n\n90.\n\nRespondent contends that the views of the Contracting Parties to the Treaty are fundamental to understanding what their intentions were in agreeing to certain obligations and determining how the provisions of the Treaty should be interpreted. Subsequent agreements and practice of contracting parties to a treaty are considered to be authentic means of interpretation. As such, the NDP Submission is of greater probative value for determining the scope and meaning of Treaty provisions than decisions of arbitral tribunals interpreting other treaties.27\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this aspect needs to be addressed by this Award due to the relevance of the fact that, in this very case, the non-party is one of the contracting parties to the Treaty. Despite Claimants' understanding that the NDP Submission is nothing more than an *amicus* submission, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that good reasons exist to attribute additional value to it. The aspects being discussed, and the arguments on which the Parties base their positions, are not foreign to the non-party. If the text of a given provision in a bilateral treaty needs interpretation, it is incumbent upon the interpreter to conduct research to identify the real intention of the parties upon their entering into a bilateral treaty, such as the TPA.\n\n92.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is satisfied that it should not disregard the position adopted by the US as a non-party and it is free to attribute such weight as it deems appropriate to the NDP Submission in light of the circumstances.\n\n93.\n\nThat being said, the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal is the result of a thorough investigation and examination of all documents and submissions filed by the Parties. The NDP Submission is part of the arbitration record. It is indicative of the States' intentions when they agreed to certain obligations and it must be taken into account. But the positions referred to therein must necessarily be assessed together with the rest of the submission and the evidence presented by the Parties.\n\n94.\n\nFurthermore, the NDP Submission may also clarify certain elements to be considered by this Tribunal in its evaluation as to whether or not it has jurisdiction to decide the dispute between the Parties in light of the prerequisites established by their mutual negotiations and which are laid down in the text of the Treaty.\n\n95.\n\nIn sum, the Arbitral Tribunal will examine carefully the NDP Submission to the extent that it may be a useful source of information with respect to the construction of the applicable provisions of the Treaty and which the Tribunal is bound to interpret.\n\n**B. The test for establishing jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nIn order to decide an objection raised pursuant to Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty, the Tribunal is required to \"assume to be true claimant's factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration.\"28 With respect to the Jurisdictional Objections, Respondent argues that the Tribunal is not subject to such requirement and, therefore, Claimants have the burden of proving all facts on which the Tribunal's jurisdiction is based.29\n\nAgreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, signed Nov. 22, 2006, Chapter 10, Article 10.20.4(c), CL-1, RL-1.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 280.\n\n97.\n\nFor their part, Claimants claim that Colombia's Jurisdictional Objections were brought on a preliminary basis, as repeatedly confirmed by Colombia. As such, the same burden of proof applies to them as to other preliminary objections, *i.e*., all factual allegations in the Request for Arbitration must be deemed true and Colombia has the burden of proof regarding its objections.30\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 132.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Claimants' assertion is inconsistent with the letter of the Treaty.\n\n99.\n\nArticle 10.20.4(c) provides that \"[i]n deciding an objection *under this paragraph*, the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant's factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration [\u2026].\"31 It is thus clear that only in analysing Respondent's objections which fall under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty, is the Tribunal to proceed on the basis of an assumption that Claimants' factual allegations are true.\n\nTreaty, Article 10.20.4(c), CL-1, RL-1 (emphasis added).\n\n100.\n\nColombia's jurisdiction objections are brought under different provisions of the Treaty. They do not come within the scope of Article 10.20.4(c). The burden is thus on Claimants to prove the necessary and relevant facts to establish that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear their claims.\n\n101.\n\nWhilst Claimants seek to confer a character of generality to the provision contained in Article 10.20.4(c) of the Treaty, the Arbitral Tribunal does not find support for such a proposition in the text of the Treaty. As stated above, the Treaty is clear in providing that the tribunal shall assume claimant's factual allegations to be true only with respect to objections brought under Article 10.20.4(c). There is no language in the Treaty that indicates that such rule applies to objections brought under different provisions.\n\n102.\n\nIn any event, considering that, as detailed below, in light of the Arbitral Tribunal's decision on Respondent's preliminary objections, the question as to whether the Tribunal should assume Claimants' factual allegations to be true in order to rule on Respondent's jurisdictional objections has no bearing on the conclusions reached by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n**V. JURISDICTION**\n-------------------\n\n103.\n\nRespondent submits a preliminary objection under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty, alleging that the claim submitted to arbitration by Claimants is not a claim in respect of which, as a matter of law, an award in their favour can be made, because the requirements set forth in Article 10.16.1 of the Treaty for the submission of a valid claim to arbitration are not met; and Claimants' claims exceed the forms of relief that the Tribunal is empowered to grant under Article 10.26 of the Treaty (\"**Preliminary Objection**\").\n\n104.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent presents the following five jurisdictional objections: first, Respondent argues that Claimants do not have a protected investment under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention. Second, Respondent alleges that Claimant FPJVC does not qualify as a \"Juridical Person\" under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Third, Respondent argues that the Notice of Intent was issued by FPJVC alone and not by the other Claimants. Fourth, Respondent submits that Claimants have definitively elected to submit their claim for breach of fair and equitable treatment to the Colombian Courts. Finally, Respondent argues that there is no consent to submit Claimants' claims to arbitration, because their waiver is invalid.\n\n105.\n\nThe Parties' respective positions in connection with Respondent's objections are outlined below. The Tribunal notes, however, that in deciding this matter, it has considered the full extent of the Parties' arguments in their written submissions. To the extent that arguments are not referred to expressly in the summary below, they should be deemed to be subsumed into the Tribunal's analysis. The Tribunal is free to determine the order in which it will examine those objections. Should the Tribunal find one of them to be admissible, there will be no need to examine the rest of them.\n\n**A. PreliminaryObjectionUnder Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) An Award Cannot be Made in Claimants' Favour Because the Requirements of Article 10.16.1 of the Treaty Are Not Met**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n106.\n\nRespondent refers to Article 10.16.1 of the Treaty, which provides that a claimant may only submit to arbitration a claim that alleges (i) that the respondent has breached a substantive obligation under the Treaty, an investment authorization, or an investment agreement; and (ii) that, by reason of or arising out of such breach, the claimant has incurred loss or damage. In Colombia's view, Claimants' claims have met neither of these requirements and therefore must be dismissed in their entirety.32\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 169; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 84.\n\n*(i) Claimants' Claim is Premature*\n-----------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nAs to the alleged breach of a substantive obligation, Respondent submits that Claimants' claims are premature, because \"at the time of the initiation of this Arbitration, [\u2026] there was no measure on the part of Colombia that could have constituted a violation of the Treaty's substantive obligations.\"33\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 181; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 85-89 and 108.\n\n108.\n\nFirst, Respondent refers to Article 10.5.2(a) of the US-Colombia TPA which establishes \"the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings, in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world.\" Respondent explains that \"the administrative adjudicatory proceeding referred to in Article 10.5.2(a) (or '*procedimiento contencioso administrativo*', [in the Spanish version of the Treaty]) is a judicial proceeding before the administrative adjudicatory jurisdiction and must be distinguished from an administrative proceeding \u2013 e.g., the Fiscal Liability Proceeding \u2013 before administrative authorities \u2013 e.g., the CGR.\"34\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 98. Respondent explains that, when referring to Article 10.5.2(a) of the US-Colombia TPA, Claimants incorrectly translate \"administrative adjudicatory proceeding\" as \"*procedimiento adjudicatorio administrativo*\" (Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 28), whereas in fact the official Spanish language text reads \"*procedimiento contencioso administrativo*\" (which presupposes a judicial proceeding before the administrative adjudicatory jurisdiction).\n\n109.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"it is clear from the wording of [Article 10.5.2(a) of the US-Colombia TPA] that the obligation not to deny justice established in the Treaty is limited to proceedings of a judicial nature before courts with administrative adjudicatory jurisdiction and does not cover purely administrative proceedings.\" Accordingly, Respondent continues, \"an administrative act that is subject to subsequent judicial control cannot \u2013 by itself \u2013 constitute a denial of justice or breach any of the other substantive obligations under the Treaty alleged by Claimants.\"35 In this case, even if the Fiscal Liability Proceeding had already begun at the time Claimants filed their Notice of Arbitration,36 \"the [CGR Decision] had not even been issued.\"37\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 95, 98.\n\nThe Fiscal Liability Proceeding started on June 5, 2018 by issuance of an Indictment Order. According to Respondent, an Indictment Order is a procedural administrative act that does not define any legal situation, such that it could constitute a violation of the Treaty's substantive obligations. See Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 93.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 173; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 85, 88, 93.\n\n110.\n\nRespondent refers to a number of decisions in support of its position, including *Glencore v. Colombia,* a case under the Colombia-Switzerland BIT, and to which Claimants also refer.38 Respondent notes that the Colombia-Switzerland BIT includes a provision requiring the claimant to exhaust local administrative remedies before initiating arbitration and the tribunal found that the claim was ripe, notwithstanding that a judicial decision had not been issued.39 On the contrary, in this case, the CGR Decision did not even exist at the time of the submission of the Notice of Arbitration. Respondent further submits that \"while it is true that the Treaty does not contain an express requirement to exhaust administrative remedies, in order to claim a denial of justice in an administrative adjudicatory proceeding, the administrative phase must be exhausted before the judicial phase in the administrative adjudicatory jurisdiction can begin.\"40 Therefore, Respondent concludes, \"absent an administrative adjudicatory proceeding, it is logically impossible for the substantive obligations of the Treaty to have been breached, much less so for a denial of justice to exist.\"41\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 179-180; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 107; *Glencore International A.G. and C.I.

Dominican Republic*42 in which the tribunal emphasized that \"an administrative act, in and of itself, particularly as [sic] the level of a first instance decision-maker\" cannot \"constitute a denial of justice under customary international law, when further remedies or avenues of appeal are potentially available under municipal law\"43 and added that \"there can be no denial of justice without a final decision of a State's highest judicial authority.\"44 Therefore, in Respondent's view, Claimants' case is premature in that \"[a] mere administrative act that [\u2026] is subject to judicial control cannot, by itself, constitute a measure that is capable of constituting a breach of a substantive Treaty obligation.\"45\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 177; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 96, 97; *Corona Materials, LLC v.

Since the Colombian administrative courts have not yet had the opportunity to decide upon the matter, Claimants' claims under the Treaty are premature and not admissible.48\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 109.\n\n114.\n\nRespondent also refers to *EnCana v. Ecuador*, in which the tribunal held that \"investor-State arbitration under a provision [similar to Article 10.16.1 of the U.S.-Colombia TPA] must relate to a measure in breach of the [treaty] which has caused loss to the Claimant by the time of the commencement of the arbitration.\"49\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 103-104 (emphasis in the original); *EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3481, Award, February 3, 2006, \u00b6 163, RL-277. Respondent also notes that Claimants refer to *Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, PCA Case No. 2009-23, Second Partial Award on Track II, August 30, 2018, \u00b6\u00b6 4.461, 7.2-7.3, RL-78. However, contrary to the present case, in that case \"the 'ripeness' of the claim was not at issue.\"\n\n*(ii) No Prima Facie Breach of Substantive Obligations*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nRespondent refers to Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty, which establishes that \"[i]n deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant's factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration [\u2026].\" According to Colombia, this \"presumption of truthfulness is limited to the factual allegations raised by Claimants in their Notice of Arbitration and does not extend to subsequent factual allegations, conclusions unsupported by factual allegations, or legal allegations.\"50 According to Respondent, in their Notice of Arbitration, Claimants failed to establish a *prima facie* breach of a substantive treaty obligation.51\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 79-81, 111 (emphasis omitted).\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 183-185; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 110.\n\n- *Fair and Equitable Treatment*\n--------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nFirst, Claimants' allegations regarding a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard (\"**FET**\") cannot satisfy the *prima facie* threshold, because this standard under the Treaty (i) protects only Investments and not Investors; and (ii) is limited to the minimum standard of treatment (\"**MST**\") under customary international law. None of Claimants' allegations is capable of giving rise to a breach of this standard. Regardless of the applicable scope of the FET standard, there could not have been a denial of justice, since the administrative judiciary has not yet reviewed the CGR Decision.52\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 112.\n\n117.\n\nIn relation to the first argument, Respondent relies on the wording of Article 10.5.1 of the Treaty, which only refers to \"covered investments\"53. It reads this provision as only providing protection to Investments, not to Investors.54 In support of this submission, Colombia relies, *inter alia,* on submissions of the United States as a non-disputing party in other arbitration proceedings,55 as well as on the *Grand River v. United States* decision.56 For Colombia, even if the facts alleged by Claimants were taken to be true, they would have affected the investors and not their investment (*i.e.* the Service Contract).57\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 187.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 187; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 116.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 188; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 120; *Angel Samuel Seda and others v.

Mexico* (*i.e.* a gross denial of justice and a complete lack of due process or a manifest arbitrariness).62 In Colombia's view, none of the allegations raised by Claimants, with the exception of the denial of justice and violation of due process claims, is \"even remotely linked\" to a possible breach of the MST standard.63\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 196; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 134.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 197.\n\n120.\n\nRespondent adds that, contrary to Claimants' allegations, the customary MST \"does not include the protection of legitimate expectations.\"64 Even if that was the case, Respondent continues, for legitimate expectations to exist: \"they (i) must be objectively analyzed, (ii) at the time of making the investment, (iii) must be reasonable, and (iv) must be based on specific promises to the investor.\"65 According to Respondent, Claimants have failed to refer to any specific promises that were made to them and that could give rise to legitimate expectations.66\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 135.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 137.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 138-139.\n\n121.\n\nFinally, Colombia submits that, in accordance with Article 10.5.2(a) of the U.S.-Colombia TPA, the protection against denial of justice is limited only \"to judicial proceedings and does not cover administrative proceedings.\"67 In the present dispute, there could not have been a denial of justice, because no judicial proceedings had been initiated to challenge the CGR Decision at the time Claimants submitted their Request for Arbitration.68 Without a judicial review and without a final and definitive judicial decision, a denial of justice cannot possibly be established under customary international law.69\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 201; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 98.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 141-143.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 202-206; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 100, 143-144.

As fiscal liability is autonomous and independent from contractual liability, contractual clauses are unenforceable in a fiscal liability proceeding.79 [REDACTED].\"80 Thus, Respondent concludes that the allegations of expropriation raised by Claimants cannot establish a *prima facie* case of expropriation under the U.S.-Colombia TPA.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 221-223; see also *Glencore International A.G. and C.I.

Respondent refers to Claimants' contention that Colombia breached the MFN obligation in Article 10.4 of the Treaty \u2013\u2013 \"by allegedly granting Swiss investors and Swiss covered investments more favourable treatment than that granted to U.S. investors, on grounds that Swiss investors can purportedly invoke the umbrella clause contained in the Colombia-Switzerland BIT while Claimants cannot, given that the Treaty does not contain such a clause.\"84\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 231.\n\n130.\n\nRespondent argues that the MFN standard under Article 10.4.1 of the U.S.-Colombia TPA \"requires a comparison of factual situations of the treatment actually accorded to parties in like circumstances,\" to U.S. investors and investors from third countries, which Claimants have not established.85 Additionally, the MFN provision cannot be used to import a new right from an investment treaty concluded with a third country that is not found in the base treaty.86\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 170.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 232 (emphasis omitted).\n\n131.\n\nMoreover, even if the MFN provision allowed Claimants to import a completely new right from a different investment treaty, it would not be possible to import an umbrella clause from some other investment treaty concluded by Colombia as \"this would contravene the public policy considerations that the Contracting Parties took into account when specifically excluding an umbrella clause from the Treaty.\"87 Instead, the U.S.-Colombia TPA included a definition of the term \"investment agreement\", establishing the possibility that certain contractual claims could be submitted to arbitration by an investor in the event of a breach of a particular written agreement qualifying as an \"investment agreement\" under the Treaty.88\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 234.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 234; Reply on Preliminary Objections., \u00b6\u00b6 172-173.\n\n132.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent explains that while the Colombia-Switzerland BIT contains an umbrella clause, it does not contain a consent to submit to arbitration any claims that may arise from a breach of that umbrella clause. Accordingly, even if the importation of the umbrella clause from the Colombia-Switzerland BIT was possible under the MFN clause of the Treaty, it would not be possible to import the right to submit that claim to arbitration, because such a right does not exist under that treaty either.89\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 235-237; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 174-178. Respondent explains that while Article 10(2) of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT contains an umbrella clause, Article 11(3) of the treaty expressly provides that the contracting parties consent to the submission of investment disputes to international arbitration, \"except for disputes with regard to Article 10 paragraph 2 of [the treaty].\" In support of this position, Respondent refers to *Glencore International A.G. and C.I. Prodeco S.A. v. Republic of Colombia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/6, Award, August 27, 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 1001, 1006, 1009, 1025, RL-20. Finally, Respondent adds that, \"for the same reasons, Claimants fail to comply with the requirements for applying the umbrella clause of the Colombia-Japan BIT, which is worded almost identically to the umbrella clause in the Colombia-Switzerland BIT.\"\n\n133.\n\nFinally, Respondent submits that, even if the umbrella clause of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT could be imported in the manner requested by Claimants, it would be impossible to apply that clause in this case as the requirements for its application are not met.90 Namely, (i) Reficar is not an \"agency\" of the Colombian government; (ii) the Services Contract cannot be both \"an investment\" and \"a written agreement\", which contains the obligation relating to the investment; and (iii) the factual allegations raised by Claimants cannot constitute a breach of the umbrella clause, because there was no breach of the Services Contract arbitration clause and any contractual limitation imposed on Reficar could not affect its fiscal liability. Thus, Claimants have not been capable of establishing a *prima facie* breach of the MFN clause.91\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 238-239.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 178-179. Respondent explains that Claimants' fiscal liability is autonomous and independent to their contractual liability and falls outside the material scope of the Services Contract's arbitration clause.\n\n*(iii) No Prima Facie Breach of an Investment Agreement*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nColombia rejects Claimants' argument pursuant to which the Services Contract is treated as if it were an \"investment agreement\", because \"it was entered into between Reficar, a 'State entity' and a 'national authority of a Party', and FPJVC, an 'investor of another Party.\"'92\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 242-243; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 181.\n\n135.\n\nFirst, Respondent recalls that under Article 10.28 of the U.S.-Colombia TPA, an investment agreement is a written agreement on which \"the investor relies in establishing or acquiring a covered investment other than the written agreement itself.\"93 According to Respondent, it is clear from the text of the Treaty, that \"the Services Contract cannot constitute an 'investment agreement' and, at the same time, a 'covered investment other than the written agreement itself.'\"94 Although Claimants submit that they have also invested assets like time, personnel, labour and capital while providing goods and services to Colombia, they \"do not allege that those constituent items form part of their 'covered investment' in this case, nor do those items form the basis of Claimants' damages claim.\"95 The sole \"covered investment\" is the Services Contract and the damages claimed by Claimants relate exclusively to the Services Contract and not to the time, personnel, labour, capital, good or services, which have been in any event \"fully compensated or reimbursed in accordance with the provisions of the Services Contract.\"96\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 242, 244.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 244; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 181.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 183.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 183.\n\n136.\n\nSecond, Respondent explains that the Services Contract was concluded with Reficar, a mixed capital company that forms part of the decentralized government,97 whereas the U.S.-Colombia TPA describes a national authority of a party as \"an authority at the central level of government.\"98 Reficar cannot be a \"national authority\" under the U.S.-Colombia TPA, because the Contracting Parties to the Treaty have \"expressly established that Ecopetrol, Reficar's parent company, is not an authority at the central government level.\"99 Claimants' arguments as to the attribution of Reficar's actions to Colombia are irrelevant in this case, because the issue is not the attribution of Reficar's actions, but rather whether Reficar can be considered a \"national authority\" under the U.S.-Colombia TPA.100\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 245 (emphasis omitted).\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 245; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 184.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 185. Respondent refers to Chapter 9, Annex 9.1, Section A, of the Colombia-US TPA, as amended by Decision No. 2 of the Free Trade Commission of the US-Colombia TPA, RL-318, which contains a list of U.S. and Colombian entities divided into four categories: Central Level of Government Entities, Sub-Central Level of Government Entities, Other Covered Entities and Special Covered Entities. Respondent notes that neither Ecopetrol nor Reficar are listed as Central Level of Government Entities, and that Ecopetrol is listed as a \"Special Covered Entity,\" *i.e.*, as an entity that \"conducts its procurement under private law ... and without any control or influence by the Government of Colombia.\"\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 186.\n\n137.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent does not dispute that [REDACTED].\"101 However, the existence of an arbitration clause under the Services Contract has no impact on the concept of \"investment agreement\" under the U.S.-Colombia TPA, nor does it provide the Tribunal with jurisdiction to hear purely contractual claims.102 Claimants allege that their claims \"relate to CGR's... actions, and that such actions would constitute breaches by Colombia of the Services Contract.\"103 However, the Fiscal Liability Proceeding concerns Claimants' fiscal, not contractual, liability.104 Thus, any loss or damage caused by the CGR's actions would be \"non-contractual in nature, and beyond the scope of any contractual breach of a purported investment agreement.\"105\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 248.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 248.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 188 (inner quotation omitted); see also Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 114.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 188.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 188.\n\n138.\n\nTherefore, Respondent submits, the Services Contract is not an \"investment agreement\" and Claimants have failed to establish a *prima facie* case of a breach of an investment agreement in this dispute.106\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 250; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 180, 189.\n\n*(iv) No Loss or Damage Resulting from the Alleged Breaches*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nRespondent recalls that apart from the existence of a breach of a substantial Treaty provision or an investment agreement, two additional requirements must be met in order to make the claim admissible under the Treaty: (i) there must be a certain loss or damage at the time of submitting the claim to arbitration and (ii) such loss or damage must be incurred by reason of such breach. These requirements are aimed at \"preventing the submission of claims that are not yet ripe, because no loss has occurred.\"107\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 251-252; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 190-193.

Colombia* is inapposite, because, contrary to the Switzerland-Colombia BIT, the U.S.-Colombia TPA does not include a provision requiring the claimant to exhaust local administrative remedies before initiating arbitration.137 Therefore, Claimants submit, a provision requiring exhaustion of local remedies is to be understood as imposing additional requirements on a claimant.138 The fact that the U.S.-Colombia TPA does not include any express requirement that local administrative remedies have to be exhausted supports Claimants' ripeness claim.139\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 27.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 27.\n\n150.\n\nOn this point, Claimants also note that the FET provision in Article 10.5.2(a) of the U.S.-Colombia TPA, \"includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings.\"140 Claimants submit that while analyzing an identical provision, the tribunal in *TECO Guatemala Holdings v.

Claimants reject Respondent's argument based on the Spanish version of the TPA, pursuant to which, the reference to \"administrative adjudicatory proceedings\" is a reference to a judicial proceeding before the administrative adjudicatory jurisdiction. According to Claimants, there is nothing in the English text of the U.S.-Colombia TPA (which is equally as authoritative as the Spanish text173) that indicates that such proceedings are limited to judicial proceedings only.174 Other tribunals interpreting the same language have reached the same conclusion.175 As to the differences between the two language versions, Claimants' interpretation should prevail in accordance with Article 33(3) of the VCLT, because \"Claimants' interpretation can have the same meaning in English and Spanish, but Respondent's interpretation only makes sense, if at all, in Spanish.\"176 Accordingly, Article 10.5.2(a) of the U.S.-Colombia TPA should \"be interpreted as allowing for a denial of justice claim resulting from an administrative adjudicatory proceeding\", such as the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.177\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 83; Treaty, Article 23.6.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 81-83.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 83; *Corona Materials LLC v.

However, Claimants submit, this Annex does not refer to Chapter 10 (Investment) in any way, and the text of Chapter Nine limits Annex 9.1's application to 'procuring entities.'

Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n185.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal is not empowered under Article 10.26 of the U.S.-Colombia TPA to grant the relief sought by Claimants. In particular, Colombia submits that (i) the Tribunal cannot award moral damages; (ii) the Tribunal cannot award non-monetary damages or injunctions; and (iii) the Tribunal cannot issue an offsetting award.261\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 262; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 216.\n\n186.\n\nFirst, under Article 10.26 of the US-Colombia FTA, the Tribunal is empowered to award \"monetary damages\" and expressly prohibited from awarding \"punitive damages.\"262 Respondent argues that moral damages are considered \"non-monetary damages\" under international law263 and cites *Daillo*264 and *Cantoral Benavides v. Peru*265, among others*,* in support of this position.266 Thus, Respondent says that the Tribunal cannot award Claimants moral damages,267 whether they are considered \"non-monetary\" or \"punitive\" damages.268 The principle of full reparation cannot override the express language of the U.S.-Colombia TPA.269\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 264; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 217, 219.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 265.\n\n*Case concerning Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.

Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n191.\n\nClaimants argue that, contrary to Respondent's submission, moral damages do not fall within the category of punitive damages279 and that none of Respondent's authorities suggests otherwise.280 Moral damages are compensatory and monetary, and thus this Tribunal is allowed to award them281. Claimants agree that awarding punitive damages is not recognized in international law, and that compensation should be restorative in nature.282 However, they contend that moral damages are not punitive in nature.283 On the contrary, Claimants argue, moral damages are \"compensatory and monetary, and thus fully allowed by the [U.S.-Colombia] TPA.\"284 Furthermore, \"the purpose of the principle of full reparation could not be achieved without the recognition of moral damages.\"285\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 125; Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 127.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 127.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 125 and 128; see *Desert Line Projects LLC v.

Such provision contains the requirements which are to be fulfilled, if a claim is to qualify as a claim for which an award may be made under Article 10.26 of the TPA.\n\n196.\n\nAs an initial step, Article 10.15 of the TPA provides that \"[i]n the event of an investment dispute, the claimant and the respondent should initially seek to resolve the dispute through consultation and negotiation, which may include the use of non-binding, third-party procedures.\"\n\n197.\n\nIn this case, it is reported that the Parties' efforts were unsuccessful. Claimant was dissatisfied by the failure to reach a negotiated solution and decided to move forward in accordance with the rules provided by the TPA.\n\n198.\n\nClaimants claim in their Request for Arbitration that Respondent, through its instrumentalities and/or other high-level authorities \u2013 CGR \u2013 in conducting the investigation in the Fiscal Liability Proceedings, has ridden over Claimants' rights and breached fundamental provisions of the TPA, customary international law, and Colombian law giving rise to moral and monetary damages to Claimants.\n\n199.\n\nAs detailed above, Claimants' claims in this case are based on the Fiscal Liability Proceeding initiated by the CGR in Colombia against Foster Wheeler and Process Consultants amongst other natural and juridical persons, both Colombian and foreign. According to Claimant:\n\n(i) \"[t]he national treatment claim is based on the CGR's refusal to apply the same legal standard to the Claimants as it did to the similarly-situated Colombian Ecopetrol Board members who were released from the CGR proceedings even though they, unlike FPJVC, had actual decision-making authority;\"\n\n(ii) \"[t]he expropriation of Claimants' fundamental protections in the Contract occurred when the CGR stripped it of such rights by forcing FPJVC into the proceedings without legitimate legal or factual bases;\"\n\n(iii) \"[t]he fair and equitable treatment claim arises from the CGR's acts that were contrary to Claimants' due process rights, as well as breaching Claimants' legitimate expectations, including that its contract rights would be respected and that it would receive fair treatment from Colombian governmental entities like the CGR in accordance with Colombian law and the provisions of the TPA, among other acts and omissions. Claimants' fair and equitable treatment claim also arises from the denial of justice suffered by Claimants arising from, among other acts and omissions, the numerous due process violations that plagued the entirety of the CGR proceedings;\"\n\n(iv) \"Claimant's umbrella clause claims and Investment Agreement claims both occurred with the CGR's initial acts to deprive FPJVC of its contract rights by initiating the proceedings.\"291\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 13.\n\n200.\n\nBased on the above, Claimants contend that nothing further than what has been set forth in the Request for Arbitration is required for their claims to be sufficiently \"ripe\" and that more recent events in connection with the Fiscal Liability Proceedings have only exacerbated the violations of law committed by Colombia.\n\n201.\n\nColombia, however, argues that, according to Article 10.16.1 of the TPA, the submission of a valid claim to arbitration requires that a substantive obligation under the Treaty had been breached as of the date of the submission. At the time Claimants filed their Notice of Arbitration, Claimants had failed to identify any measure in the Fiscal Liability Proceedings capable of constituting such a breach, since at that moment, only the Indictment Order, which is a procedural administrative act that did not define any legal situation, had been issued.\n\n202.\n\nAccording to Respondent, despite the fact that the CGR issued the Ruling with Fiscal Liability on July 6, 2021, months after the commencement of this arbitration, Claimants' claim remains premature as any administrative act that is subject to subsequent judicial control cannot constitute a breach under the Treaty.\n\n203.\n\nArticle 10.16.1(a) of the TPA provides, in its relevant part, as follows:\n\n1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:\n\n(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached\n\n(A) an obligation under Section A,\n\n(B) an investment authorization, or\n\n(C) an investment agreement;\n\nand\n\n(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach; [\u2026].\n\n204.\n\nAs such, for a claim to be admissible, a measure capable of constituting a Treaty breach must have existed as of the date of the submission. The Arbitral Tribunal will thus analyse whether, as of the day of the submission of the present Request for Arbitration, a measure capable of constituting a Treaty breach existed.\n\n205.\n\nEven if the evidence associated with the claims may, in certain instances, be made available only after the filing of the appropriate request for arbitration, this shall not be deemed a blank check allowing a claimant to introduce documents periodically throughout the arbitration. Moreover, the submission of evidence after the initial procedural moment is also subject to a high standard of proof as to when the evidence became available.\n\n206.\n\nThis possibility is limited by the due process of law and the right of defence of respondent which must be at all times preserved. In sum, even if the evidence is central for the admissibility of the claim and was only obtained after the relevant filing, the introduction of the same may not be considered in ascertaining the fulfilment of the prerequisites under the Treaty.\n\n207.\n\n*First*, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that there is no dispute between the Parties that, at the time the arbitration was initiated, only the Indictment Order had been issued and a final administrative decision was still pending.\n\n208.\n\n*Second,* the Tribunal accepts that when the Fiscal Chamber formally rejected FPJVC's appeal on 6 July 2021 and affirmed the Ruling with Fiscal Liability in its entirety, Claimants had exhausted their administrative appeals.\n\n209.\n\nNonetheless, the Ruling with Fiscal Liability is still subject to subsequent judicial control by the tribunals of the administrative adjudicatory jurisdiction.\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal notes Claimants' argument that the Ruling with Fiscal Liability is the result of an administrative adjudicatory proceeding falling within the ambit of Article 10.5.2(a) of the Treaty, thus allowing a claim for denial of justice. However, the Arbitral Tribunal understands that the administrative adjudicatory proceeding referred to in Article 10.5.2(a) is a judicial proceeding before the administrative adjudicatory jurisdiction, and not an administrative proceeding as the Fiscal Liability Proceeding.\n\n211.\n\nThe recourse to the expression used in the Spanish version of the Treaty is helpful to confirm such understanding in so far as \"*procedimiento contencioso administrativo*\" unequivocally means a proceeding initiated before a national court.\n\n212.\n\nMoreover, Article 10.5.2(a) expressly states that \"'fair and equitable treatment' includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world*.*\" It is clear from the text of this article that the obligation not to deny justice encompasses all of criminal, civil and administrative adjudicatory proceedings.\n\n213.\n\nThis is further confirmed by the analysis of other provisions of Chapter 10 of the Treaty. When the Treaty refers specifically to purely administrative proceedings, as opposed to judicial proceedings, it makes reference to \"administrative proceedings\"292 and \"administrative process.\"293 The only instance in which the expression \"administrative adjudicatory proceedings\" is used is in Article 10.5.2(a) which, when read in conjunction with \"criminal, civil, or\" must refer to judicial proceedings.\n\nArticle 10.8.4(e) of the Treaty, CL-1, RL-1: \"Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 through 3, a Party may prevent a transfer through the equitable, non-discriminatory, and good faith application of its laws relating to: [\u2026] (e) ensuring compliance with orders or judgments in judicial or administrative proceedings.\".\n\nArticle 10.9.3(b)(ii) of the Treaty, CL-1, RL-1: \"[\u2026] Paragraph 1(f) does not apply: [\u2026] when the requirement is imposed or the commitment or undertaking is enforced by a court, administrative tribunal, or competition authority to remedy a practice determined after judicial or administrative process to be anticompetitive under the Party's competition laws.\".\n\n214.\n\nHence, the obligation not to deny justice established in the Treaty is limited to proceedings of a judicial nature before national courts and does not cover purely administrative proceedings.\n\n215.\n\nIn the present case, considering that the judiciary has not yet intervened, it cannot be considered that there could be a denial of justice under customary international law. As decided by the *Flughafen v. Venezuela* tribunal, \"[t]here could be no international responsibility of a State for denial of justice if there is still an effective local remedy against the local decision that is challenged.\"294 [Translation of the Tribunal]\n\n*Flughafen Z\u00fcrich A.G. and Gesti\u00f3n e Ingenier\u00eda IDC S.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/19, Award, November 18, 2014, \u00b6 392, RL-83.\n\n216.\n\nEven if one might argue that subsequent events could ripen a claim after the commencement of the arbitration, in the present case, no final decision before the administrative adjudicatory jurisdiction exists. Considering that the Ruling with Fiscal Liability could be overturned after judicial review, it cannot constitute a denial of justice or a breach of any of the other substantive obligations under the Treaty alleged by Claimants.\n\n217.\n\n*Third*, as noted by the NPD Submission, with which the Tribunal agrees, \"[i]t is well-established that the international responsibility of States may not be invoked with respect to non-final judicial acts, unless recourse to further domestic remedies is obviously futile or manifestly ineffective.\"295 Claimants, however, have not presented any evidence to substantiate their allegations that it would be obviously futile or manifestly ineffective to seek further review of the Ruling with Fiscal Liability. On the other hand, Respondent has provided the Tribunal with several examples of rulings with fiscal liability issued by the Deputy Comptroller that have been rendered ineffective or reversed, in whole or in part, following a prosecution of judicial remedies.296\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 5.\n\nSee for example *Consejo de Estado* of Colombia, Chamber for Administrative Adjudicatory Proceedings, First Section, Judgment, November 20, 2014 (*Condor S.A. Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Seguros v. Comptroller of Bogot\u00e1 D.C.*), pp. 11-12, 33, RL-87; *Consejo de Estado* of Colombia, Chamber for Administrative Adjudicatory Proceedings, First Section, Judgment, October 22, 2015 (*Marta In\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez Arias v. Municipality of Armenia-Municipal Comptroller of Armenia*), pp. 9-10; 22-23, RL-88; *Consejo de Estado* of Colombia, Chamber for Administrative Adjudicatory Proceedings, Fifth Section, Judgment, July 5, 2018 (*Ezequiel Paladines Cuellar v. Office of the Departmental Comptroller of the Atlantic*), pp. 27-28, RL-89; *Consejo de Estado* of Colombia, Chamber for Administrative Adjudicatory Proceedings, First Section, Judgment, November 12, 2020 (*Ana Mar\u00eda Pi\u00f1eros Ricardo v. Comptroller General of the Republic*), pp. 108-109, RL-90; *Consejo de Estado* of Colombia, Chamber for Administrative Adjudicatory Proceedings, First Section, Judgment, February 18, 2021 (*Aseguradora Colseguros S.A. v. Comptroller General of the Republic*), pp. 36-37, RL-91.\n\n218.\n\n*Finally*, the denial of justice when alleged has to be accompanied by strong evidence. The existence of appeals or revision mechanisms have a temporary effect. A lower-level decision by an instrumentality which is made in accordance with applicable procedural rules may not be deemed a denial of justice, since the recourse to a higher-level authority may result in a revision or an annulment of the decision. It is open to Claimants to pursue an appeal as due process allows and as is consistent with the scope of fair and equitable treatment adumbrated in Article 10.5.2(a) of the TPA.\n\n219.\n\nTherefore, the absence of a measure capable of constituting a breach of a substantive obligation under the TPA by Respondent at the time the arbitration was initiated makes Claimants' claim premature and inadmissible.\n\n220.\n\nThe fact that the Ruling with Fiscal Liability issued by the CGR is not an administrative adjudicatory proceeding as provided by the TPA and contemplates certain appeals or defences at the administrative judicial level is fatal to the admissibility of Claimants' claims. For Treaty purposes, an administrative act of CGR does not entitle a party to commence arbitration based on the argument of denial of justice capable of breaching the FET obligation by Respondent. Based on the information provided by the Parties to the Arbitral Tribunal it is apparent that Claimants have taken no steps to initiate judicial proceedings to challenge the Ruling with Fiscal Liability.\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal resumes the discussion with respect to the timing of filing of the Request for Arbitration and the inexistence at that point of a final administrative act. The Tribunal reiterates that the final administrative act had to be in existence at the time of the filing of the Request for Arbitration, and it was not.\n\n222.\n\nIn light of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants failed to comply with the first prerequisites for the admission of their claims under the Treaty in so far as there is no evidence of any breach of a provision of the TPA at the time the Request for Arbitration was submitted. Hence, the Tribunal accepts the preliminary objection filed by Respondent and, further, decides that Claimants' claims may not be admitted, the arbitration being therefore terminated.\n\n223.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, does not need to analyze whether loss or damage existed at the time the claim was submitted to arbitration.\n\n224.\n\nFinally, in light of the above conclusion, the Tribunal need not analyze its powers under Article 10.26 of the U.S.-Colombia TPA to grant the relief sought by the Claimants.\n\n**B. Objections to Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------\n\n**(1) Claimants Do Not Have a Protected Investment Under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n225.\n\nFirst, Colombia argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae*, because Claimants do not possess an \"investment\" under Article 10.28 of the U.S.-Colombia TPA. This Article requires an \"investment\" to have certain characteristics, such as *e.g.,* the assumption of risk.297 Article 10.28(e) establishes \"turnkey, construction, management, production, concession, revenue-sharing, and other similar contracts\" among the forms that an investment may take. Colombia argues that Claimants do not have a management or construction contract, but \"merely a contract for the provision of consultancy services\",298 and adds that \"[c]ommentators agree that paragraph (e) [\u2026] excludes ordinary commercial contracts that do not have the characteristics of an investment.\"299\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 281-282; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 244; see Article 10.28 of the U.S.-Colombia TPA, RL-1.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 241 (emphasis omitted).\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 283; see Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 241-243; see, for example, Lee M.

Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n243.\n\nClaimants argue that Colombia's objection has no legal merit. Claimants submit that it is common ground that the definition of a \"juridical person\" is that which obtains under the law of incorporation of the entity which, in case of FPJVC, is New York State law.356 Claimants then note that, contrary to the position in *Impregilo v. Pakistan*, where the joint venture had \"no legal personality under Swiss law,\"357 FPJVC is a juridical person under New York law:358 \"New York law recognizes joint ventures as juridical persons with the capacity to sue and be sued, and they routinely appear as parties in New York litigation.\"359\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 157-158.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 158; *Impregilo S.p.A. v.

According to Claimants, the case law cited by Respondent does not support its position on this point.365\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 151.\n\n246.\n\nIn sum, Claimants submit that FPJVC qualifies as a \"national of another Contracting State\"366 and Colombia's objection should be dismissed.367\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 163, 171.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 152.\n\n**c.

Mexico* rejected Respondent's argument, noting that other tribunals \"have dismissed the proposition that a failure to satisfy [notice of intent requirements] must result in the loss of jurisdiction\",384 and that a tribunal \"must do what best serves the interests of justice.\"385 Claimants cite additional case law in support of their position.386\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 175; *B-Mex, LLC, et al. v.

Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n256.\n\nColombia submits that Annex 10-G to the U.S.-Colombia TPA constitutes a limitation to Respondent's consent to arbitration by providing \"that a claim that Colombia has breached a substantive obligation under the Treaty may not be submitted to arbitration under the Treaty if the U.S. investor has already claimed the breach in a judicial or administrative proceeding in Colombia.\"393\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 320\u2013321 (emphasis omitted).\n\n257.\n\nColombia argues that, unlike other *electa una via* provisions, Annex 10-G \"does not require that the purported breach be brought before the judicial or administrative court, but simply that the breach of a substantive Treaty obligation be alleged in a local judicial or administrative proceeding.\"394 It adds that that is precisely what has happened in the present case.395\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 322 (emphasis in the original).\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 323; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 280.\n\n258.\n\nRespondent recalls that in the First Tutela before the Colombian courts, Foster Wheeler and Process Consultants alleged that their due process rights had been infringed in the Fiscal Liability Proceeding, specifically, they alleged that due process was an element of the FET obligation under the U.S.-Colombia TPA.396 Colombia submits that Claimants' allegations in the local proceedings \"are perfectly aligned with the allegations for breach of FET in this Arbitration.\"397 In accordance with Annex 10-G to the U.S.-Colombia TPA, Claimants, having raised such allegations in a local proceeding, are now precluded from bringing the same claim before this Tribunal.398\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 323; see also \u00b6 324.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 326 (emphasis omitted).\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 323, 327.\n\n259.\n\nAccording to Colombia, none of the arguments raised by Claimants can effectively preclude the application of the *electa una via* provision contained in Annex 10-G to the U.S.-Colombia TPA.399 The only requirement for Annex 10-G's application is the allegation of a breach of the FET obligation400 and it is irrelevant whether or not the First Tutela was brought to preserve Claimants' rights.401\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 279.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 280.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 280.\n\n260.\n\nNothing in the U.S.-Colombia TPA prevented Claimants from initiating local actions and then waiving them before commencing the Arbitration.402 Concurrently, nothing prevented Claimants from bringing the First Tutela without alleging a breach of the FET obligation under the U.S.-Colombia TPA.403\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 283.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 283.\n\n261.\n\nMoreover, nothing in Annex 10-G requires \"that the subject matter, parties and cause of action in both proceedings be identical.\"404 This provision merely requires that \"the investor or the enterprise [has] alleged a breach of the same substantive obligation under the Treaty.\"405 Claimants' citation of Article 10.18.4 of the U.S.-Colombia TPA to contend that the *electa una via* provisions contained in both provisions have similar language is inapposite. Unlike Article 10.18.4, Annex 10-G only requires that a breach of a substantive obligation under the Treaty be alleged (and not that the same breach be submitted to a judicial or administrative tribunal).406\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 284.\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 284 (emphasis omitted).\n\nReply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 285.\n\n262.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* to hear Claimants' claim of breach of the FET obligation under the Treaty.407\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 328; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 278, 286.\n\n**b. Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n263.\n\nClaimants raise two main counterarguments.408 First (i), that the action filed in Colombia was necessary to preserve Claimants' rights, and second (ii), that this action fails to meet the triple identity test necessary to have a preclusive effect.409\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 183.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 183.\n\n264.\n\nAs regards the first argument, Claimants submit that the First Tutela sought nothing more than to preserve Claimants' rights before the CGR and was brought under Colombian law.410 An *acci\u00f3n de tutela* is a \"subsidiary and residual\" mechanism for \"immediate judicial protection of the fundamental rights\"411 and it cannot trigger a fork-in-the-road412 provision.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 184.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 185 (emphasis omitted); see Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 136-283.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 184.\n\n265.\n\nAccording to Claimants, they had no reasonable alternative other than to submit the First *T*utela if they were to preserve their fundamental rights under Colombian law.413 In support of their argument, Claimants cite case law where tribunals have found that a fork-in-the-road provision cannot be triggered by defensive actions brought to preserve a claimant's rights.414\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 186.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 187-188; Christoph Schreuer, Travelling the BIT Route of Waiting Periods, Umbrella Clauses and Forks in the Road, 9(2) Offprints of The Journal of World Investment & Trade, 241, 249 (2004), CL-193.\n\n266.\n\nSecond, Claimants submit that the First Tutela does not meet the triple identity test, which requires \"a claim with the same object, [the same] parties and [the same] cause of action [has] already [been] brought before a different judicial forum.\"415 First, the object is different, because in this arbitration, Claimants are seeking monetary damages and additional costs, whereas *tutelas* cannot be brought for monetary damages.416 Second, the parties are different, because while in this arbitration the Parties are FPJVC and Colombia, in the First Tutela the parties are FPJVC and CGR, among others.417 Finally, the cause of action is also different.418 In the First Tutela the claims are brought under the Colombian Constitution419 as opposed to the U.S.-Colombia TPA or the ICSID Convention.420 Colombian constitutional claims are \"fundamentally different\" from claims brought pursuant to the U.S.-Colombia TPA.421 Claimants also submit that \"[c]learly the local claim did not result in the submission of the BIT dispute to the [Colombian] courts.\"422 In addition, Claimants' First Tutela \"expressly disclaimed seeking any relief under the [U.S.-Colombia] TPA.\"423\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 190; *Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A. v.

Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n270.\n\nRespondent notes that Article 10.18 of the U.S.-Colombia TPA establishes that \"a claim may not be submitted to arbitration unless the notice of arbitration is accompanied by a written waiver by the claimant of the claims submitted to arbitration.\"431 The Contracting Parties' consent to arbitration is conditioned upon the fulfilment of this prerequisite, among others.432 This was confirmed by the tribunal in *Renco v. Peru*,433 when it stated that \"an effective waiver is a fundamental prerequisite for the existence of an arbitration agreement.\"434\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 330.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 331; Reply on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 289.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 332; *The Renco Group Inc. v.

See also Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 332-334.\n\n271.\n\nIn particular, Respondent recalls that in *Renco v. Peru*, the claimant filed a notice of arbitration including a waiver with reservations, which was replicated in its second notice of arbitration.435 The tribunal found that such waivers were not permitted under the treaty.436 Colombia submits that *Renco v. Peru* is analogous to the present dispute as in both cases, the claimants made a reservation of rights that exceeded what is permissible under Article 10.18.2(b) of the U.S.-Colombia TPA (or the identical provision of the Peru-U.S. TPA).437\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 333.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 333; *The Renco Group Inc. v.

Colombia*, the U.S. interpreted Article 10.18.2(b) of the U.S.-Colombia TPA as \"a condition of consent to arbitration, [and emphasized] the need to comply with the formal and material requirements in order for such a waiver to be valid and effective.\"438\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections., \u00b6 336; *Angel Samuel Seda and others v.

Claimants' Position**\n--------------------------\n\n278.\n\nClaimants take the preliminary point that Respondent's objection should be dismissed, because the party by which multiple parallel proceedings were initiated was Colombia.450 A party should not be allowed to invoke treaty provisions in the name of avoiding parallel proceedings, \"when it is the very cause of that procedural chaos.\"451\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 200.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 200.\n\n279.\n\nMoreover, Claimants recall Article 10.18.3 of the U.S.-Colombia TPA, which allows a claimant to initiate or continue actions brought for the purpose of preserving its rights.452 Claimants argue that the *acciones de tutela* fall within this exception.453 Furthermore, none of Respondent's authorities supports the argument that \"a request for arbitration must be accompanied by a waiver of any right to self-defense.\"454 The waiver pursuant to Article 10.18.2(b) of the U.S.-Colombia TPA requires Claimants not to act offensively.455 Claimants' reservation of the right to self-defense is not contrary to such requirement.456\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 201.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 202; see also \u00b6\u00b6 72-75.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 203.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 167.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 167.\n\n280.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent's reliance on the case *Renco v.

In that case, there was no dispute that the relief sought in local proceedings was the same as that sought in international arbitration.461 In the present case, however, Colombia brought the local action and Claimants are merely seeking to defend themselves against it.462 The Second Tutela was for non-monetary relief. The Third Tutela was for interim relief to allow Claimants a reasonable amount of time within which to appeal the CGR decision.463\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 170; *Commerce Group Corp. and San Sebastian Gold Mines, Inc. v.

Mexico*, also cited by Respondent, the claimant did not file any waiver until long after the arbitration had commenced.464 Here, Claimants filed an appropriate waiver and their defences in the local proceedings \"created no risk of either legal uncertainty or double redress.\"465 Finally, in *Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala*, there was no dispute in that case that the claimant had filed a domestic arbitration that overlapped with the ICSID arbitration. Notably, rather than dismissing the whole claim, the tribunal dismissed only the individual claims that were at issue in the domestic arbitration.466 Finally, as to Colombia's assertion that Claimants should abandon all local proceedings, Claimants argue that those proceedings are not theirs to abandon, they are Colombia's.467 The reservation of the right to self-defense necessarily refers to Colombia's proceedings in which Claimants are forced to defend themselves.468\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 172.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 172.\n\nRejoinder on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 173; *Railroad Development Corporation v.

Tribunal's Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThis objection need not be examined in light of the Tribunal's decision regarding the inadmissibility of the claims when appraising the Preliminary Objection.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**A. Respondent's Cost Submissions**\n------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nRespondent requests an award of costs in the total amount of US$ 1,575,326.469\n\nRespondent's Statement of Costs, \u00b6 7. This amount is comprised of US$ 350,000 on advance payments to ICSID and US$ 1,225,326 for legal fees and expenses (US$ 1,100,750 for legal fees and expenses of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP, and US$ 124,576 for legal fees and expenses of the *Agencia Nacional de Defensa Jur\u00eddica del Estado de Colombia*). On September 18, 2024, Respondent confirmed that it had not incurred any additional costs.\n\n285.\n\nAccording to Respondent, its preliminary objections are \"legitimate, sound, well-founded, and admissible under Article 10.20.4 of the Treaty and all other relevant provisions.\"470 Claimants, on the other hand, not only failed to present a convincing case on jurisdiction, but also employed what was said to be a questionable conduct that increased the costs of these proceedings. For example, Claimants (i) initiated this arbitration pre-emptively and prematurely, (ii) initially opposed Respondent's request to hear its preliminary objection as a preliminary question, despite the express language of the Treaty, causing the Parties to exchange several communications to address Claimants' unfounded opposition, (iii) filed a Provisional Measure Application devoid of legal and factual basis, (iv) shifted positions during the course of the arbitration, causing Colombia to dedicate considerable time in addressing them, (v) initiated several parallel proceedings such as the *acciones de tutela* causing Respondent to defend itself simultaneously in different fora, and (vi) made several untimely requests to incorporate new evidence into the record. Respondent says that all of these tactics and strategies support an award on costs in its favour.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Costs, \u00b6 5.\n\n**B. Claimants' Cost Submissions**\n----------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nClaimants claim an award of costs in the total amount of US$ 2,413,233.471\n\nClaimants' Statement of Costs, p. 3 and Claimants' Supplemental Statement of Costs, p. 4. This amount is comprised of US$ 375,000 on advance payments to ICSID, and US$ 2,038,233 for legal fees and expenses (US$ 1,897,406 for attorney's fees, US$ 122,391 for supplemental attorney's fees and US$ 18,436 of costs).\n\n287.\n\nClaimants allege that Respondent's objections were frivolous and should be denied. As such, and pursuant to the principle that costs follow the event, Claimants' costs in defending against those objections should be borne by Colombia.\n\n288.\n\nMoreover, Respondent misused the preliminary objections procedure and engaged in conduct to make the proceedings more expensive, a factor which should be taken into account by the Tribunal. For example, Colombia (i) belatedly requested the Tribunal to hear its Article 10.20.4 objections and its jurisdictional objections as preliminary matters, making its application 20 days after the 45-day window for expedited preliminary objections pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty had lapsed, (ii) challenged facts that must be assumed to be true, raised inappropriate objections regarding complex issues of fact and law, and abused the preliminary objections process to make its case on the merits without giving Claimants an opportunity to fully present evidence or obtain disclosure, (iii) insisted on Spanish translations for the hearing but then insisted that the Spanish transcripts not be part of the record, and (iv) filed a meritless application to strike Claimants' response to the NDP Submission.\n\n289.\n\nFinally, Respondent's meritless objections to the Claimant's application to introduce excerpts of the statement of claim and accompanying expert report [REDACTED] caused Claimants to incur substantial costs in responding to Colombia's arguments and subsequently commenting on the weight and relevance of the documents once admitted by the Tribunal.\n\n290.\n\nFor all these reasons, all costs should be borne by Respondent.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's Decision on Costs**\n---------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings, the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n292.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n293.\n\nSince the decision made by the Tribunal constitutes the recognition of the arguments put forward by Respondent, and considering that Claimants were also unsuccessful on their Application for Provisional Measures, the Arbitral Tribunal holds that Claimants shall reimburse Respondent for its share on the costs associated with the Tribunal's fees and expenses, the Tribunal Assistant's fees and expenses and ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses in the amount of US$ 330,528.39 as well as for its legal costs amounting to US$ 1,225,326472.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Costs, \u00b6 7. This amount is comprised of US$ 1,100,750 for legal fees and expenses of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP, and US$ 124,576 for legal fees and expenses of the *Agencia Nacional de Defensa Jur\u00eddica del Estado de Colombia*. On September 18, 2024, Respondent confirmed that it had not incurred any additional costs.\n\n294.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal's Assistant, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Tribunals' fees and expenses** |  |\n| Jos\u00e9 Emilio Nunes Pinto | US$ 168,156.78 |\n| John Beechey | US$ 84,364.84 |\n| Marcelo Kohen | US$ 119,736.94 |\n| **Assistant's fees and expenses** |  |\n| Maria Claudia Procopiak | US$ 10,650.00 |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **ICSID's administrative fees** | US$ 220,000.00 |\n| **Direct expenses** | US$ 58,148.22 |\n| **Total** | **US$ 661,056.78** |\n\n295.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.473 As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to US$ 330,528.39.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n296.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal by unanimous vote decides as follows:\n\n(1) ADMITS the Preliminary Objection filed by Respondent and DECLARE that the Claimants' claims are inadmissible and as a consequence thereof the arbitration is terminated.\n\n(2) ORDERS Claimants to pay to Respondent the amount of US$ 330,528.39 in connection with the Arbitral Tribunal's fees and expenses, the Tribunal Assistant's fees and expenses and ICSID's costs as well as Respondent's legal costs in the amount of US$ 1,225,326.\n\n(3) REJECTS all other prayers for relief.\n\nDate: December 19, 2024"}]}
