INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n[1].\n\nThe Claimants are shareholders of National Cotton Company (\"NCC\"), a company formed and incorporated in Egypt according to Egyptian law on August 17, 1994. At that time the shareholders were:\n\n\u2022 The National Bank of Egypt 40,000 Shares (20% of NCC's issued stock)\n\n\u2022 The Pension Fund of the Employees 10,000 Shares (5% of NCC's issued stock)\n\n\u2022 Mahmoud A. Wahba 65,000 Shares (32,5% of NCC's issued stock)\n\n\u2022 James T. Wahba 25,000 Shares (12,5% of NCC's issued stock)\n\n\u2022 John B. Wahba 25,000 Shares (12,5% of NCC's issued stock)\n\n\u2022 Timothy T. Wahba 25,000 Shares (12,5% of NCC's issued stock)\n\n\u2022 Mai M. Wahba 10,000 Shares (5% of NCC's issued stock)\n\n[2].\n\nOn February 26, 1997, the National Bank of Egypt (the \"National Bank\") was replaced as a shareholder in NCC by Champion Trading Company, a Delaware (USA) incorporated company which acquired the National Bank's 40,000 shares (representing 20% of NCC issued stock). In addition, the Pension Fund of the Employees of the National Bank (The \"Pension Fund\") was replaced as a shareholder by Ameritrade International, Inc. another Delaware (USA) incorporated company which acquired the Pension Fund's 10,000 shares (representing 5% of NCC's issued stock). Ameritrade International, Inc. is not affiliated with Ameritrade, Inc., the U.S. online brokerage company.\n\n[3].\n\nAccording to the Claimants, NCC was formed in order to avail itself of the new possibilities created in the Summer 1994 when the Egyptian Parliament passed a number of laws privatising and liberalising the raw cotton trade.\n\n[4].\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Egyptian Government, following the liberalisation of the cotton industry and NCC's incorporation, took a series of measures, which harmed NCC and, accordingly, the Claimants' investments in Egypt.\n\n[5].\n\nAccording to the Claimants, these measures ultimately resulted in NCC being unable to continue to trade, leading to its insolvency which rendered the Claimants' investments worthless. The Claimants state that these measures constituted violations of the *\"Treaty between the United States of America and the Arab Republic of Egypt Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments\"* of September 29, 1982, which entered into force on June 27, 1992 (the \"Treaty\").\n\n**2. PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n[6].\n\nOn May 29, 2002, the Claimants seized the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) with a Request for Arbitration directed against the Arab Republic of Egypt. The Claimants sought the following relief:\n\n*an award:*\n\n*(a) declaring that Egypt unlawfully expropriated the Claimants' investments in Egypt without providing prompt, adequate and effective compensation, and discriminated against and unlawfully failed to accord those investments the requisite protection and security;*\n\n*(b) ordering that Egypt compensate the Claimants in respect of the losses they have suffered through Egypt's unlawful conduct, described above, in an amount to be quantified precisely during this proceeding, but in no event in an amount less than USD 100 million;*\n\n*(c) ordering that Egypt pay the Claimants' costs occasioned by this arbitration including, without limitation, arbitrators' fees, administrative costs fixed by ICSID, the expenses of the arbitrators, the fees and expenses of any experts, and the legal costs incurred by the parties (including fees of counsel);*\n\n*(d) ordering that Egypt pay interest on all sums awarded at a rate of 10% compounded quarterly, such interest to run from the date losses were incurred until the date of effective payment of the sums awarded; and*\n\n*(e) granting the Claimants any other relief the Tribunal deems appropriate.*\n\n[7].\n\nThe ICSID registered the Request on August 8, 2002.\n\n[8].\n\nThe Claimants designated Mr. L. Yves Fortier as Arbitrator and the Respondent designated Professor Laurent Ayn\u00e8s as Arbitrator. With the agreement of the Parties, the Secretary-General of the Centre appointed Mr. Robert Briner as the President of the Arbitral Tribunal and with letter of January 31, 2003, the Centre noted that, in accordance with Rules 6-1 of the Arbitration Rules of the Centre, the Arbitral Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings have begun on January 30, 2003. Mrs Martina Polasek, Counsel, ICSID, was designated by ICSID as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n[9].\n\nA first session of the Arbitral Tribunal was held on March 7, 2003, at the World Bank offices in Paris in the presence of representatives of the Parties, President Robert Briner and Arbitrator Professor Laurent Ayn\u00e8s and Mrs Martina Polasek. Arbitrator Mr. Yves Fortier participated through video conferencing.\n\n[10].\n\nAmong other matters it was agreed that the place of the proceeding is Paris, that the procedural language is English, which is the working language of the Arbitral Tribunal and that pleadings and other documents may be submitted in either English or French or, in case of translation from a third language, into one of these languages.\n\n[11].\n\nBefore the first session of the Arbitral Tribunal, with letter of March 5, 2003, the Respondent remitted a \"Note pr\u00e9liminaire sur la comp\u00e9tence\" in which the Respondent stated that the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction with respect to the claims by the physical persons as well as those of the corporate Claimants. At the first session, the Arbitral Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided to first deal with the issue of its jurisdiction and a timetable for the further procedure was agreed upon.\n\n[12].\n\nIn accordance with this timetable the Respondent submitted on April 18, 2003 its \"M\u00e9moire sur la comp\u00e9tence\".\n\n[13].\n\nThe Claimants submitted on May 30, 2003 their reply Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n[14].\n\nThe Respondent on June 19, 2003 submitted \"Observations compl\u00e9mentaires sur la comp\u00e9tence\".\n\n[15].\n\nOn June 27, 2003 a session of the Arbitral Tribunal on jurisdiction was held at the World Bank offices in Paris. A sound recording and a transcript were made of these proceedings.\n\nWere present:\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal\n\nMr. Robert Briner (President)  \n Professor Laurent Ayn\u00e8s   \nMr. L. Yves Fortier\n\nThe Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nMrs Martina Polasek\n\nOn behalf of the Claimants\n\nMr. Emmanuel Gaillard, Shearman & Sterling  \n Ms Yas Banifatemi, Shearman & Sterling   \nMr. Merwan Lomri, Shearman & Sterling  \n Mr. Dany Khayat, Counsel for Claimants   \nMr. Arif Ali, Counsel for Claimants   \nMr. James Wahba, Claimant  \n Mr. John Wahba, Claimant  \n Mr. Timothy Wahba, Claimant  \n Mrs Susanne Wahba, Guardian of Mr. T. Wahba   \nMr. Mahmoud Wahba Officer of the Corporate Claimants\n\nWitness and Expert\n\nMrs Eglal El-Waqeel  \n Professor Hisham Sadek\n\nOn behalf of the Respondent\n\nCounsellor Iskandar Ghattas, Undersecretary of the State for the Ministry of Justice  \n Counsellor Hossam Abel Azeim, President of the State Lawsuits Authority  \n Mr. Osama Mahmoud Vice-President of the State Lawsuits Authority  \n Mr. Mostafa Abdel Gaffar Member of the Directorate General for International and Cultural Cooperation of the Ministry of Justice  \n Mr. Robert Saint-Esteben, Bredin Prat  \n Mr. Louis-Christophe Delanoy, Bredin Prat  \n Mr. Tim Portwood, Bredin Prat  \n Mr. Denis Bensaude, Bredin Prat  \n Mr. Matthieu Pouchepadass, Bredin Prat\n\nWitness and Expert\n\nMajor General Hamdy Hafez   \nProfessor Hossam El Ehwany\n\n[16].\n\nAt the end of the examination of the witnesses and experts, counsel for both Parties summed up their respective positions and the Arbitral Tribunal accepted to receive after the Hearing the \"Dossier de plaidoirie\" which had been used by counsel for Respondent during his pleadings. At the end of the Hearing the Parties and the Arbitrators stated that they had no further issues to raise and the Parties confirmed that they were in agreement with the procedure as conducted by the Arbitral Tribunal up to this time.\n\n**3. DISCUSSION**\n-----------------\n\n**3.1 General**\n---------------\n\n[17].\n\nIn accordance with Article VII 3.(c) of the Treaty this arbitration is conducted under the provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (\"Convention\"). The Convention, in Article 25(2)(a), defines as a \"National of another Contracting State\": \"*any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute*\".\n\n**3.2 Position of the Respondent**\n----------------------------------\n\n[18].\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the three individual Claimants, James, John and Timothy Wahba are all dual nationals as they have both the American as well as the Egyptian nationality and they can therefore not invoke the Convention.\n\n[19].\n\nThe Respondent also contests the right for the two corporate Claimants, Champion Trading Company and Ameritrade International, Inc., to be parties to this dispute as it has not been demonstrated that American nationals hold a substantial interest in these companies as required by the Treaty. In order to define the status of an American corporate party one has to employ the same criteria as for the individual claimants and in the determination that American nationals have to hold a substantial interest, one has to disregard interest held by dual nationals.\n\n[20].\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent also maintains that the present litigation already constitutes the object of proceedings before the Egypt state authorities and that the Claimants therefore, in accordance with Article VII of the Treaty, are excluded from invoking the arbitration proceedings under the Treaty.\n\n[21].\n\nThe Respondent therefore asks the Arbitral Tribunal to declare that it lacks jurisdiction to decide on the claims of both the individual and the corporate Claimants and that the Claimants should be ordered to pay all costs of these proceedings.\n\n**3.3 Position of the  Claimants**\n----------------------------------\n\n[22].\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the non-corporate Claimants are not Egyptian nationals because they did not acquire Egyptian nationality, that in any case, under international law the nationality has to be established according to the rule of the real and effective nationality and that the non-corporate Claimants have not effectively acquired Egyptian nationality.\n\n[23].\n\nThe corporate Claimants are \"nationals of another Contracting State\" within the meaning of the Convention and the Treaty as they are incorporated in the United States and all the shareholders of the corporate Claimants are nationals of the United States and United States nationals have a \"substantial interest\" in the corporate Claimants.\n\n[24].\n\nThe present dispute under the Treaty is different from the dispute before the administrative courts of Egypt insofar as they involve different parties and have different causes of action.\n\n[25].\n\nThe Claimants therefore request the Arbitral Tribunal to declare that it has jurisdiction to hear the claims raised by the Claimants against the Respondent and that the Respondent should be ordered to pay all costs and expenses incurred by the Claimants in connection with these proceedings.\n\n**3.4 Findings of the  Arbitral  Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[26].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will first examine the situation of the three individual, noncorporate Claimants and then the entitlement of the corporate Claimants and finally the question whether the Egyptian court proceedings exclude the right for the Claimants to bring the present dispute before the ICSID Tribunal.\n\n**3.4.1 The\u00a0Individual  Claimants**\n-----------------------------------\n\n[27].\n\nAll three individual Claimants were born in the United States of America as sons of Dr. Mahmoud Ahmed Mohamed Wahba, born at Kafr-El-Sheikh, Egypt, on February 12, 1941 and Mrs Susanne Patterson Wahba, born in Minnesota, USA, on June 24, 1944 (not parties to these proceedings).\n\n[28].\n\nJames Tarrick Wahba was born in Connecticut, USA, on August 3, 1979, John Wahba was born in Connecticut, USA, on February 8, 1980 and Timothy Robert Wahba was born in Connecticut, USA, on April 2, 1985. Being a minor, Timothy Robert is represented in these proceedings by his mother Susanne Patterson Wahba.\n\n[29].\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that a child born of an Egyptian father, either within or outside Egypt, automatically acquires at birth Egyptian nationality if at that time the father holds Egyptian nationality.\n\n[30].\n\nMuch evidence was presented and discussed in the written submissions and at the Hearing regarding the question whether Dr. Mahmoud Wahba had, as alleged by the Claimants, given up his Egyptian nationality in 1975, after he was authorised to acquire and did in fact acquire US nationality.\n\n[31].\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Egyptian authorities never ruled that Dr. Mahmoud Wahba had given up or lost his Egyptian nationality. The Respondent submits that after he acquired his US nationality Dr. Wahba remained an Egyptian national and therefore his three sons have automatically, at birth, acquired Egyptian nationality.\n\n[32].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has been presented with conflicting and contradictory documents by the Parties regarding the nationality status of Dr. Mahmoud Wahba in Egypt and accusations of fraud were raised.\n\n[33].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal need not come to any finding regarding the authenticity or lack thereof of any of the controversial documents which have been presented in the course of these proceedings.\n\n[34].\n\nIt is uncontested that Dr. Mahmoud Wahba, on March 27, 1997, applied for an Egyptian personal identity card (Exhibit D90) and that he received the identity card. It is also not contested that he carried the Egyptian passport N\u00b0 287, issued by the Consulate of the Arab Republic of Egypt in the United States of America in 1992, and that he used this passport extensively for travels to Egypt, at least between the period of 1995 and 1997.\n\n[35].\n\nIt is also not contested that the Claimants did not produce any authorisation by the Minister of the Interior allowing Dr. Mahmoud Wahba to renounce his Egyptian nationality upon acquiring his American nationality (see Affidavit Professor Sadek of May 28, 2003, page 4, paragraph 5). Although the evidence presented regarding the use of his Egyptian passport and the delivery of the Egyptian identity card occurred in the nineties and not the years 1979 through 1985 when the three individual Claimants were born, no plausible explications were given and no evidence whatsoever was offered to explain how Dr. Mahmoud Wahba could have lost his Egyptian nationality in 1975 but then have used this same nationality to ask for and receive an Egyptian identity card and passport which he used extensively.\n\n[36].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal therefore comes to the conclusion that at the time the three individual Claimants were born, their father still possessed his Egyptian nationality and that therefore under Egyptian law the three individual Claimants upon birth automatically acquired the Egyptian nationality (see Affidavit Professor Sadek of May 28, 2003, page 3, paragraph 3).\n\n[37].\n\nThe Claimants have, however, argued that under international public law, even if a person might technically be considered to be a dual national, an international tribunal, dealing with the question of the nationality of a party in an investment dispute under the Convention, must look to the real and effective nationality and that this real and effective nationality of all individual Claimants was that of the United States and of the United States only.\n\n[38].\n\nThe Respondent answers that, even if the rule of the real and effective nationality could be considered to constitute a rule of international law, the Convention has a clear rule in Article 25(2)(a) that *\"any person who... also had the nationality of the* *Contracting State party to the dispute is excluded from the possibility of bringing his dispute under the arbitration procedure of the Convention*\". The Respondent concludes that this clear and specific rule must be applied by the Tribunal which has no discretion to resort to a \"so-called\" general rule.\n\n[39].\n\nBoth Parties have drawn the attention of the Arbitral Tribunal to the \"travaux pr\u00e9paratoires\" for the Convention.\n\n[40].\n\nThe Respondent drew our attention to the commentary of Professor Schreuer1 according to which the early drafts of the Convention had provided that a national of the other Contracting State *\"may possess concurrently the nationality... of the State party to the dispute*\" (History Vol. I, p. 122, Vol. II, pp. 170-171) but that apparently, after various other formulae had been debated, a proposal was adopted unanimously to exclude dual nationals explicitly if one of their nationalities was that of the host State (Vol. II at pp. 876, 874, 878, 868, 880/881, 937), and that this became the present text of the Convention Article 25 (2)(a).\n\nCh. Schreuer, T *he ICSID Convention : a commentary*, Cambridge University Press, 2001, n\u00b0 440-442.\n\n[41].\n\nThe Accompanying Report of the Executive Directors of March 18, 1965 stated on page 9 \"*this ineligibility is absolute and cannot be cured even if the State party to the dispute has given its consent*\".\n\n[42].\n\nThe Respondent furthermore refers to the comments of Messrs Shihata/Parra2 :\n\n\"*Many BITs, to take another example, purport to extend the benefits of the treaties to investors who are natural persons with the nationality of the host State so long as they also have the nationality of the other State party to the treaty. Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, however, categorically excludes from the jurisdiction of the Centre disputes between a State and natural persons with the nationality of that State, irrespective of whatever other nationality the individual may have. In view of this, the Secretariat of the Centre lately had to inform an aggrieved individual with the nationality of both parties to the BIT concerned that he would, despite the terms of the BIT, be unable to resort to arbitration under the ICSID Convention\".*\n\nShihata/Parra, *The experience of the international centre for settlement of investment disputes,* 14 ICSID Review - Foreign Investment Law Journal 299 (1999), p. 308.\n\n[43].\n\nThe Claimants refer *inter alia* to Aron Broches, who wrote that during the final debates the working group \"*had expressed its unwillingness to deal in the Convention with the problem of involuntary acquisition of nationality, feeling that it would be up* *to the Tribunals concerned to decide whether forced nationality would have to be taken into account or could be disregarded3\".*\n\nDocuments Concerning the Origin and the Formulation of the Convention, Volume II, Part II, Doc. 106 (SID/LC/SR - January 5, 1965), Summary Proceedings of the Legal Committee Meeting, December 10, 1964, p. 868, Annex C14\n\n[44].\n\nAccording to the Claimants \"*the issue before this Tribunal is whether a nationality claimed by the Respondent solely for the purpose of challenging jurisdiction should be given effect*\" (Reply Memorial, \u00a7 51). The Claimants are of the opinion that the Tribunal should determine its jurisdiction on the basis of the applicable rules of international law, and that under those rules \"*it is not sufficient for a State claiming an individual as its national to merely refer to the provision of its internal law\"* (Reply Memorial, \u00a7 53). The Claimants, in this connection, refer to the Convention of The Hague on Nationality of 12 April 1930 (Annex C12), which never became effective but which often is seen as representing the state of international law on the question of nationality of individuals. Article 1 of the Convention states:\n\n*\"It is for each State to determine under its law who are its nationals. This law shall be recognised by other States in so far as it is consistent with international conventions, international custom, and the principles of law generally recognised with regard to nationality\"*.\n\n[45].\n\nAccording to the Claimants \"*[t]he principles of law generally recognised with regard to nationality include the rule of effective nationality according to which a nationality conferred by a State cannot produce effects unless it is effective and corresponds to a genuine link between the State and the individual\"* (Reply Memorial, \u00a7 54).\n\n[46].\n\nThe Claimants specially refer to the landmark decision of the International Court of Justice of April 6, 1955 in Liechtenstein vs. Guatemala, the so-called Nottebohm Case (ICJ Reports 1955; also Annex C32).\n\n[47].\n\nThe Claimants also refer to the case law of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, which decided in Case N\u00b0 A/18 of 6 April 1984 (5 Iran-U.S.C.T.R.-251), following three cases which had been decided by Chamber Two in 1983, that it did have jurisdiction over claims of a dual national, *i.e.* a person holding both the Iranian and the US nationality, against Iran as respondent when the dominant and effective nationality of the Claimant was the US nationality.\n\n[48].\n\nIn these cases it was held that in a case of conflict of nationalities and rights flowing from the status as a national of a particular country, the rule of the effective or the dominant and effective nationality should be applied.\n\n[49].\n\nThe Nottebohm case decided in 1955 contained the following key statement:\n\n*\"According to the practice of States, to arbitral and judicial decisions and to the opinions of writers, nationality is a legal bond having as its basis a social fact of attachment, a genuine connection of existence, interests and sentiments, together with the existence of reciprocal rights and duties. It may be said to constitute the juridical expression of the fact that the individual upon whom it is conferred, either directly by the law or as the result of an act of the authorities, is in fact more closely connected with the population of the State conferring nationality than with that of any other State. Conferred by a State, it only entitles that State to exercise protection vis-\u00e0-vis another State, if it constitutes a translation into juridical terms of the individual's connection with the State which has made him its national.\"*\n\n[50].\n\nThe Nottebohm case turned on the question whether Liechtenstein could exercise diplomatic protection on behalf of Nottebohm. Nottebohm was born in 1881 as a German citizen in Germany and went to Guatemala in 1905 where he developed his activities in the field of commerce, banking and plantations. During one of his brief visits to Liechtenstein, where a brother of his had been living since 1931, he applied for Liechtenstein nationality which he obtained on October 20, 1939 and also received a Liechtenstein passport. At the beginning of 1940 he returned to Guatemala to resume his former business activity. He had never become a national of Guatemala. In October 1943 the Guatemala authorities arrested Nottebohm and he was deported to the United States and interned there for two years and three months. In 1944, after he had been deported to the United States, legal proceedings were commenced in Guatemala designed to expropriate, without compensation to him, all his proprieties in Guatemala. After the war, Nottebohm was not allowed back to Guatemala and in 1946 took up residence in Liechtenstein. The issue was therefore not one of a dual nationality but whether Liechtenstein could exercise diplomatic protection on behalf of Nottebohm. The ICJ came to the conclusion that his ties with Liechtenstein during the relevant period before and during the taking of his proprieties in Guatemala were not of such a nature as to allow Liechtenstein to exercise diplomatic protection before the ICJ.\n\n[51].\n\nForty years after the ICJ, The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in case N\u00b0 A/18 had to interpret the \"Declaration of the Government of the Democratic Popular Republic of Algeria concerning the Settlement of Claims by the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran (Algiers Declaration) which states in Article II(1) \"*an international arbitral tribunal (the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal) is hereby established for the purpose of deciding* *claims of nationals of the United States against Iran and claims of nationals of Iran* *against the United States... \"* and Article VII(1)(a), states: \"*A \"national\" of Iran or of the United States, as the case may be, means (a) natural person who is a citizen of Iran or the United States*\n\n[52].\n\nAfter having quoted the above cited *dictum* of Nottebohm, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal stated that \"*while Nottebohm itself did not involve a claim against the State of which Nottebohm was a national, it demonstrated the acceptance and the approval by the International Court of Justice of the search for the real and effective nationality based on facts of a case, instead of an approach relying on more formalistic criteria. The effects of the Nottebohm decision have radiated throughout the international law of nationality.\"*\n\n[53].\n\nThat Tribunal went on to state, before it found that it had jurisdiction over claims against Iran by dual Iran-United States nationals when the dominant and effective nationality of the claimant during the relevant period was that of the United States, that *\"[i]n view of the pervasive effect of this rule since the Nottebohm decision, the Tribunal concludes that references to \"national\" and \"nationals\" in the Algiers Declarations must be understood as consistent with that rule unless an exception is clearly stated. As stated above, the Tribunal does not find that the text of the Algiers Declarations provides such a clear exception\"*.\n\n[54].\n\nThe findings of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal therefore concern the interpretation of an international treaty, the Algiers Declarations, and of the words \"national\" and \"nationals\" used in that Treaty, which itself does not contain any further definition.\n\n[55].\n\nAccording to the Claimants this Tribunal should, when applying the nationality requirement under Convention, use the definition as it has been developed in international law as shown in the above quoted Nottebohm and A/18 decisions.\n\n[56].\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Egyptian nationality of the three individual Claimants does not correspond to the prevailing definition of nationality in international law. If they are to be considered Egyptian it is only because of Egyptian law which conferred Egyptian nationality on them at birth. The Claimants submit that, in fact, they neither have today nor ever have had any particular ties or relations with Egypt. Claimants conclude that such an involuntary nationality should not to be taken into account when interpreting the Convention.\n\n[57].\n\nThe Nottebohm and A/18 decisions, in the opinion of the Tribunal, find no application in the present case. The Convention in Article 25 (2)(a) contains a clear and specific rule regarding dual nationals. The Tribunal notes that the above cited A/18 decision contained an important reservation that the real and effective nationality was indeed relevant *\"unless an exception is clearly stated\".* The Tribunal is faced here with such a clear exception.\n\n[58].\n\nAccording to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention of May 23, 1969, a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaties in their context and in the light of their object and purpose.\n\n[59].\n\nAccording to the ordinary meaning of the terms of the Convention (Article 25 (2)(a)) dual nationals are excluded from invoking the protection under the Convention against the host country of the investment of which they are also a national. This Tribunal does not rule out that situations might arise where the exclusion of dual nationals could lead to a result which was manifestly absurd or unreasonable (Vienna Convention, Article (32)(b)). One could envisage a situation where a country continues to apply the *jus sanguinis* over many generations. It might for instance be questionable if the third or fourth foreign born generation, which has no ties whatsoever with the country of its forefathers, could still be considered to have, for the purpose of the Convention, the nationality of this state.\n\n[60].\n\nIn the present case this situation does not arise and the question need not be answered.\n\n[61].\n\nIt is undisputed that the documents regarding the investments in NCC (see e.g. Annexes D5 and D15 through D25) mentioned only the Egyptian nationality of the three individual Claimants. In their Reply Memorial (\u00a7\u00a7 88 and 89) the Claimants state that the incorporation on behalf of the then under age Wahba sons *\"was carried out by National Bank of Egypt as incorporator of NCC, thus was aimed at accelerating the incorporation and the registration process.\"*\n\n[62].\n\nThe Claimants further add that the activity of NCC could have been carried out by Egyptian companies which were not necessarily owned by Egyptians only and that the use of the Egyptian nationality in the corporate documents of NCC was only done to speed up the incorporation process and not in order to allow the company to pursue an activity which it could not have pursued if it would have not be owned by Egyptian nationals.\n\n[63].\n\nThis question need not be addressed by this Tribunal. What is relevant for this Tribunal is that the three individual Claimants, in the documents setting up the vehicle of their investment, used their Egyptian nationality without any mention of their US nationality. According to the documents, Dr. Mahmoud Wahba acted in this connection as the legal guardian of his then still minor three children. The mere fact that this investment in Egypt by the three individual Claimants was done by using, for whatever reason and purpose, exclusively their Egyptian nationality clearly qualifies them as dual nationals within the meaning of the Convention and thereby based on Article 25 (2)(a) excludes them from invoking the Convention.\n\n[64].\n\nThe Tribunal therefore holds that it does not have jurisdiction over the claims of the three individual Claimants.\n\n**3.4.2 The  Corporate  Claimants**\n-----------------------------------\n\n[65].\n\nAccording to Article I (b) of the Treaty \"*\"Company of a Party\" means a company duly incorporated, constituted, or otherwise duly organised under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party or its subdivision in which*  \n*(i) natural persons who are nationals of such Party....*  \n*have a substantial interest.\"*\n\n[66].\n\nArticle 25 (2)(b) of the Convention states: the term *\"National of another Contracting* *State\"* is defined as *\"a judicial person which had the nationality of a Contracting* *State other then the State party to the dispute....\"*\n\n[67].\n\nIt is not disputed that Champion Trading Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware on 24 July 1995 and Ameritrade International Inc. was likewise incorporated in the State of Delaware on 20 May 1992.\n\n[68].\n\nAccording to the uncontested statement of the Claimants, the shareholders of both companies are the natural persons Mahmoud Wahba, Susanne Patterson Wahba, James T.

Wahba and each of these five individuals holds 20% of the capital of each company (C29).\n\n[69].\n\nNeither the Treaty nor the Convention contain any exclusion of dual nationals as shareholders of companies of the other Contracting State, contrary to the specific exclusion of Article 25 (2)(a) of the Convention regarding natural persons.\n\n[70].\n\nThe Respondents did not adduce any precedents or learned writings according to which dual nationals could not be shareholders in companies bringing an ICSID action under the Treaty.\n\n[71].\n\nThe Tribunal therefore holds that it does have jurisdiction over the claims of the two corporate Claimants.\n\n**3.4.3. Proceedings before the  State  Council**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n[72].\n\nIt is not disputed that the Egyptian company NCC in the Fall of 1996 seized the Egyptian Conseil d'Etat with its claims against the Arab Republic of Egypt for alleged losses arising from various acts allegedly committed by the Egyptian authorities.\n\n[73].\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the subject matter of the claim of NCC before the Egyptian Conseil d'Etat and the claim before this Tribunal concern the same dispute and the real claimant behind both claims is Dr. Mahmoud Wahba.\n\n[74].\n\nThe Convention does not contain any rules regarding possible parallel proceedings.\n\n[75].\n\nAccording to Article VII 3.(a) of the Treaty recourse to ICSID arbitration is only possible if \"(iii) *the national or company concerned has not brought the dispute before the courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of the Party that is a Party to the dispute.\"* The terms \"national\" or \"company\" are defined for the purpose of this Treaty in Article I (e) and (a). The nationals and company concerned in the present dispute are the three individuals Claimants and the two corporate Claimants, however not NCC. The Respondents have not shown any convincing reason why the Treaty should not be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning expressed therein which excludes from ICSID arbitration only those disputes where the ICSID claimant is also the claimant in the national proceedings.\n\n[76].\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal therefore rejects the defence of the Respondent that it does not have jurisdiction because of the claim brought by NCC before the Egyptian Conseil d'Etat.\n\n[77].\n\nThe Tribunal reserves the questions of costs and arbitration fees.\n\n[78].\n\n**FOR THE ABOVE REASONS THE TRIBUNAL DECLARES**\n\n- that it does not have jurisdiction over the individual Claimants John T.

Wahba, John B. Wahba and Timothy T. Wahba - submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") a Request for Arbitration directed against the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n\n2.\n\nICSID registered the Request on August 8, 2002.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants designated Mr. L. Yves Fortier, Q.C., as Arbitrator, and the Respondent designated Professor Laurent Ayn\u00e8s as Arbitrator. With the agreement of the Parties, the Secretary-General of the Centre appointed Mr. Robert Briner as the President of the Arbitral Tribunal, and by letter of January 31, 2003, the Centre noted that, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules of the Centre, the Arbitral Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun on January 30, 2003. Mrs. Martina Polasek, Counsel, ICSID, was designated by ICSID as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n4.\n\nA first session of the Arbitral Tribunal was held on March 7, 2003, at the World Bank offices in Paris in the presence of representatives of the Parties, President Robert Briner, Arbitrator Professor Laurent Ayn\u00e8s, and Mrs. Martina Polasek. Arbitrator Mr. L. Yves Fortier, Q.C., participated through video conferencing.\n\n5.\n\nAmong other matters, it was agreed that the place of the proceeding would be Paris, that the procedural language would be English, which is the working language of the Arbitral Tribunal, and that pleadings and other documents could be submitted in either English or French. It was also agreed that any documents submitted in a language other than English or French would be translated into either of those languages.\n\n6.\n\nBefore the first session of the Arbitral Tribunal, by letter of March 5, 2003, the Respondent remitted a \"Note pr\u00e9liminaire sur la comp\u00e9tence\" in which the Respondent stated that the Arbitral Tribunal lacked jurisdiction with respect to the claims by the physical persons as well as those of the corporate Claimants. At the first session, the Arbitral Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided to first deal with the issue of its jurisdiction, and a timetable for the further procedure was agreed upon.\n\n7.\n\nIn accordance with this timetable, the Respondent submitted on April 18, 2003, its \"M\u00e9moire sur la comp\u00e9tence\".\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants submitted on May 30, 2003, their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent on June 19, 2003, submitted \"Observations compl\u00e9mentaires sur la comp\u00e9tence\".\n\n10.\n\nOn June 27, 2003, a hearing of the Arbitral Tribunal on jurisdiction was held at the World Bank offices in Paris.

At the end of the hearing, the Parties and the Arbitrators stated that they had no further issues to discuss, and the Parties confirmed that they were in agreement with the procedure as conducted by the Arbitral Tribunal up to that time. On July 15, 2003, the Parties submitted their respective statements of costs in regard to the proceeding on jurisdiction.\n\n12.\n\nOn October 21, 2003, the Arbitral Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction.

Wahba, John T. Wahba and Timothy T. Wahba. This Decision is annexed to this Award and constitutes a part thereof.\n\n13.\n\nOn October 27, 2003, the Centre was informed that the corporate Claimants had appointed new counsel, the law firm Jones Day. On March 16, 2004, Jones Day informed the Centre that Mr. Peter E. Kirby and Ms. Ren\u00e9 Cadieux of the law firm Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP would act as co-counsel in the proceeding.

THE CLAIMS\n-------------\n\n33.\n\nIn their original Request for Arbitration of May 29, 2002, the original Claimants sought the following relief :\n\n*An award:*\n\n*(a) declaring that Egypt unlawfully expropriated the Claimants' investments in Egypt without providing prompt, adequate and effective compensation, and discriminated against and unlawfully failed to accord those investments the requisite protection and security;*\n\n*(b) ordering that Egypt compensate the Claimants in respect of the losses they have suffered through Egypt's unlawful conduct, described above, in an amount to be quantified precisely during this proceeding, but in no event in an amount less than USD 100 million;*\n\n*(c) ordering that Egypt pay the Claimants' costs occasioned by this arbitration including, without limitation, arbitrators' fees, administrative costs fixed by ICSID, the expenses of the arbitrators, the fees and expenses of any experts, and the legal costs incurred by the parties (including fees of counsel);*\n\n*(d) ordering that Egypt pay interest on all sums awarded at a rate of 10% compounded quarterly, such interest to run from the date losses were incurred until the date of effective payment of the sums awarded; and*\n\n*(e) granting the Claimants any other relief the Tribunal deems appropriate.*\n\n34.\n\nIn their last submissions, the final position of the Claimants was that they are\n\n*\"seeking damages on their own behalf and on behalf of their respective investment the National Cotton Company (NCC) from Egypt for violations of the \"Treaty between the United States of America and the Arab Republic of Egypt Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments\".* (Claimants' Reply of October 30, 2005, paragraph 3)\n\n*\"In particular, the Claimants allege that Egypt violated its obligations to provide non-discriminatory treatment under Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty and to provide treatment in accordance with international law including full protection and security and fair and equitable treatment under Article II(4) of the Treaty.\"* (Claimants' Reply of October 30, 2005, paragraph 4).\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimants furthermore stated :\n\n*In its Memorial II, the Claimants also explain how Egypt violated its obligation under Article II(4) of the Treaty by failing to provide fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security in accordance with the minimum standard of* *treatment required under international law. In particular, Egypt's treatment of* *NCC - both in terms of the arbitrary removal of its ability to conduct its business and in terms of the secretive and non-transparent manner in which it intervened to compensate a limited group of select companies - fell below the minimum standard of treatment, constituting an abuse of right under customary international law and violated the international law principle of transparency.\"* (Claimants' Reply of October 30, 2005, paragraph 8).\n\n36.\n\nWith respect to the alleged violation of *\"fair and equitable treatment\"* the Claimants, in their Reply of October 30, 2005, made the following statement:\n\n*\"In its Memorial II, the Claimants made a claim based on an abuse of rights argument relating, in large part, to the treatment NCC received as a result of the cooperation between the NBE and the Socialist Prosecutor, resulting in what Egypt refers to as the \"1997 Moratorium.\"*\n\n*As mentioned earlier, the entire circumstances surrounding the restructuring agreements with the NBE is the subject of litigation in U.S. Courts. Therefore, on the basis of comity and out of and respect for both this Tribunal's jurisdiction and that of the U.S. Courts, the Claimants are hereby withdrawing all claims based on the cooperation between the NBE and the Socialist Prosecutor and the resulting agreements with NBE.\"* (paragraphs 142 and 143).\n\n37.\n\nThe conclusion of the Claimants' position is stated in Chapter 6 of their Reply of October 30, 2005:\n\n*\"At the end of this round of pleadings, the Tribunal can now discern a fairly clear picture of what transpired in the Egyptian cotton industry after liberalization and privatization in 1994. NCC entered the market at the express request of Egyptian officials and proceeded to engage in buying and selling cotton in accordance with the privatization and liberalization laws. Almost immediately the privatization* *and liberalization program was derailed by actions taken by Egyptian officials. Those actions resulted [* sic *] massive losses to the Egyptian cotton industry leading to a liquidity crisis in mid-1996.*\n\n*Egypt acted to resolve that liquidity crisis by engaging in a massive scheme of compensation to selected companies. While the Egyptian Cabinet approved the payment in a general way, Egyptian officials granted compensation in an overtly discriminatory fashion.*\n\n*The first Settlement in 1997 was followed by at least four other Settlements, totalling well over EGP 7 billion. All of the payments were made in a selective and discriminatory fashion and NCC was systematically excluded from the program.*\n\n*The Claimants invested in NCC in April 1997 and would have benefited from any payments made to NCC in August 1997 and in later years. It is entirely plausible to assume that had NCC received its fair and non-discriminatory share of compensation in 1997 that it would have continued in business as a major Egyptian cotton company. All of the companies that received payments in the first settlement are still continuing in business in Egypt to this day.*\n\n*No legislative scheme was enacted at any time to support the payment scheme and the payments were made completely outside of any documented program. Egypt has attempted but has failed at every turn to demonstrate the existence of any agricultural price support system operating through compensation payments. Egypt has provided no legislative scheme for such payments. Documents that have been provided are internally inconsistent and demonstrate nothing more than the fact that payments were made in the five Settlements on a wholly selective and discriminatory basis.*\n\n*Egypt has confirmed that there were no rules and regulations surrounding the payments. That the payments were effected in a \"top-down\" fashion, without the beneficiary companies being subjected to requirements of application and proof of claims, or entitlement. The whole scheme operated in a thoroughly nontransparent fashion and its existence was known only to a few Egyptian officials and favoured members of the cotton industry.*\n\n*In view of the facts and arguments made above, may it please this Tribunal to declare and adjudge the following:*\n\n*Order the Arab Republic of Egypt to pay to the Claimant, Champion Trading Company, the amount of US$73,034,224 plus the appropriate interest on that amount from September 30, 2005 until full payment.*\n\n*Order the Arab Republic of Egypt to pay to the Claimant, Ameritrade International Inc., the amount of US$292,136,897 plus the appropriate interest on that amount from September 30, 2005 until full payment.*\n\n*The Arab Republic of Egypt be hereby ordered to pay to the Claimants, Champion Trading Company and Ameritrade International Inc. the costs in this arbitration including:*\n\n*(i) the full cost of the Arbitration Tribunal;*\n\n*(ii) the professional fees and disbursements of professionals used by the Claimants to prepare and prosecute this claim; and*\n\n*(iii) appropriate pre and post-judgement interest on such amounts at commercial rates.\" (* paragraphs 153 through 159).\n\n38.\n\nIn its final submission, the Rejoinder of November 30, 2005, the Respondent submitted the following request :\n\n*\"-*  ***Dire et juger***  *que les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s A* *MERITRADE*  **I** *NTERNATIONAL*  **I** *NC* *.*  *E* *t C* *HAMPION* *T* *RADING*  *C* *OMPANY*  *sont mal fond\u00e9es en toutes leurs pr\u00e9tentions; en cons\u00e9quence*\n\n***- D\u00e9bouter***  *purement et simplement les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s A* *MERITRADE*  **I** *NTERNATIONAL*  **I** *NC* *.*  *E* *t C* *HAMPION*  *T* *RADING*  *C* *OMPANY*  *de l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de leurs demandes; et*\n\n***- Condamner***  *solidairement les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s A* *MERITRADE*  **I** *NTERNATIONAL*  **I** *NC* *.*  *E* *t C* *HAMPION*  *T* *RADING*  *C* *OMPANY* *, ainsi que Messieurs John, James et Timothy W* *AHBA*  *\u00e0 l'indemniser de l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des pr\u00e9judices moral et mat\u00e9riel que lui aura caus\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure, le pr\u00e9judice mat\u00e9riel comprenant notamment l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 des frais, dont les frais d'arbitrage et de conseil, qu'elle aura expos\u00e9s pour faire face \u00e0 cette action.\"*\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore in the following Chapters examine the various allegations regarding the alleged actions of Egyptian authorities which the Claimants state violate the provisions of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the United States of America and the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n\n3. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n---------------------\n\n3.1. The Treaty between The United States of America and The Arab Republic of Egypt\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThis dispute is about whether Egypt has violated its duties under the *\"Treaty between The United States of America and The Arab Republic of Egypt Concerning the* *Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments\"* signed on September 29, 1982 and in force as of June 27, 1992 (the \"BIT\")1 and/or under other applicable international legal rules.\n\nArticle II (2)(a) of the BIT provides:\n\n*\"Each Party shall accord investments in its territory, and associated activities in connection with these investments of nationals or companies of the other Party, treatment no less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investments and associated activities of its own nationals and companies, or nationals and companies of any third country, whichever is the most favourable.\"*\n\nArticle II (4) of the BIT provides:\n\n*\"The treatment, protection and security of investments shall never be less than that required by international Law and national legislation.\"*\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Annex C-5.\n\n3.2 The cotton industry and the market status before 1994\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nCotton is one of Egypt's principal industries. The cotton industry involves a complex manufacturing process starting with seed cotton and ending with textile fibre or garments2.\n\nMemorial of the Claimants, p. 2.\n\n42.\n\nAfter harvest of the cotton crop, the farmers - or producers - sell the seed cotton to cotton ginners who process it by separating the cotton lint from the cotton seeds and remove all foreign matter. A cotton gin is a manufacturing facility made up of a processing plant, where the seed cotton is processed in huge ginning machines and warehouse space for the storage of seed cotton, cotton lint, cotton seeds and waste cotton. The ginned cotton lint is sold to spinning mills to be spun into cotton fibre. The cotton seeds are sold to edible oil plants to have their oil extracted and their waste used as animal feed. Finally, cotton waste is sold to specialty manufacturers for use in gauze3.\n\nMemorial of the Claimants, p. 2-3.\n\n43.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that the pre-1994 situation was that of a classical State-controlled economy where the Government controlled all the production, purchasing, and distribution of cotton. There were no privately-owned cotton companies. The Government was also closely monitoring the banking system.\n\n44.\n\nAccording to the Law No. 88/19624, the cotton crop was to be sold to the Egyptian Cotton Committee at a price fixed each season by a Decree of the Ministry of the Economy, which also determined the conditions, circumstances and date of delivery of the cotton to the Committee5. For example, for the season 1985/1986, the purchase price was fixed by Ministerial Resolution No. 297/19856.\n\nExhibit D-115.\n\nLaw No. 88/1962, Art. 1, in Exhibit D-115\n\nExhibit D-116.\n\n45.\n\nThe Egyptian Cotton Committee sold the cotton for local consumption or export under the conditions of and at the prices declared by the Committee, after approval by the Ministry of the Economy7. For example, for the season 1985/1986, the sale price for local consumption was fixed by Ministerial Resolution No. 221/19868.\n\nLaw No. 88/1962, Art. 2, in Exhibit D-115.\n\nExhibit D-124.\n\n46.\n\nFinally, no cotton was to be exported or sold to local spinning mills except through direct purchase from the stock of the Committee9.\n\nLaw No. 88/1962, Art. 2, in Exhibit D-115.\n\n47.\n\nThis mechanism resulted in the setting of a fixed price at which the farmers could sell their cotton, as well as a price at which the cotton would be sold to local mills or for export. The Government thereby guaranteed the price to the producers and supported the growing of cotton, since this industry is considered to occupy an economically strategic position for the country10.\n\nExplanatory note to the Law No. 88/1962, p. 3, in Exhibit D-115.\n\n48.\n\nMoreover, by establishing the Egyptian Cotton Committee as the sole seller of cotton, the Government was able to monitor the cotton trade, could avoid speculations regarding the crop, and could maintain price stability11.\n\n*Id.* p. 4, in Exhibit D-115.\n\n49.\n\nSince all cotton purchases were made on behalf of the Government, these purchases were financed through bank loans to the cotton companies, which were reimbursed once the cotton was resold by the cotton companies12.\n\nReply of the Respondent, p. 24\n\n50.\n\nWhen the cotton resale price was higher than the fixed purchase price, the cotton company would make a profit. When the cotton resale price fixed by Decree was lower than the fixed purchase price, a negative balance would result for the cotton companies. This balance would ultimately be paid by Governmental funds, according to the Law No. 88/196213 and similar later Laws and Decrees, since all cotton trading was done on behalf on the Government and according to its instructions14.\n\nExhibit D-115.\n\nLetter of May 30, 1999, from the Ministry of Public Business Sector to the Ministry of Finance, in Exhibit D-125.\n\n51.\n\nFrom the 1985/1986 season until the 1993/1994 season, the continuous increases in the purchase prices from the farmers in comparison to the sale prices led to a regular increase of the debt of the cotton trading companies towards the banks15.\n\nExhibit D-125.\n\n52.\n\nAs of August 31, 1996, the cotton companies\u2019 negative balance - and ultimately the Government\u2019s - amounted to EGP 3,975.94 million, pursuant to the audit report of the Central Audit Agency16.\n\nExhibit D-125.\n\n3.3 The liberalization of 1994 and the incorporation of NCC\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nIn 1994, the Egyptian Parliament passed a series of laws with the objective to liberalize the Egyptian cotton industry and open it to private sector participation as follows17:\n\nExhibits D-52, D-53 and D-54.\n\nLaw No. 141/1994 Authorizing the Establishment of the Cotton Spot Exchange18:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExhibit D-52.\n\n54.\n\nThis Law established a Spot Cotton Exchange through which the cotton would be purchased and sold, and also recognized the possibility for cotton to be purchased and sold outside the Spot Cotton Exchange.\n\n55.\n\nConsequently, any cotton company had the option of purchasing and selling cotton through the Exchange or outside. However, to participate in the dealing of cotton through the Exchange, the company had to be recorded as a member of the Exchange, after having fulfilled certain requirements and having filed an application19.\n\nArt. 1 to 5, in Exhibit D-52.\n\n56.\n\nA Cotton Exchange Committee was appointed to supervise the Exchange, in particular, to establish the internal regulations and rules of the exchange and its organization and to prepare an annual report to the General Assembly of the Exchange20. A Technical Committee was also created to determine the average prices of the different types of cotton and to announce them21.\n\nArt. 8, in Exhibit D-52.\n\nArt. 31, in Exhibit D-52.\n\nLaw No. 210/1994 Organizing Domestic Cotton Trade22:\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nExhibit D-53.\n\n57.\n\nThis Law allowed cotton traders to freely purchase and sell cotton on the domestic market, outside the Spot Cotton Exchange, as previously established by the Law No. 141/1994.\n\n58.\n\nThe conditions and procedures of this optional purchase and sale mechanism were defined in the By-Laws23 to be issued by the Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade24.\n\nArt. 1, in Exhibit D-53.\n\nArt. 3 of the Preamble, in Exhibit D-53; Ministerial Decree No. 389/1994 promulgating the executive regulations of the Law organizing cotton trade internally, in Exhibit D-91, Art. 46 of the Law, in Exhibit D-53.\n\n59.\n\nAny cotton company which wished to participate in this purchase and sale mechanism had to file an application in order to be registered25.\n\nArt. 3 to 8, in Exhibit D-53.\n\nLaw No. 211/1994 called the \"Cotton Exporters Union Act\"26:\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nExhibit D-54.\n\n60.\n\nAccording to this Law, cotton companies had to be registered in order to export cotton27. A Management Committee was established to issue the rules and regulations of the Export Union28.\n\nArt. 3 to 7, in Exhibit D-54.\n\nArt. 17, in Exhibit D-54.\n\n61.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that although these Laws allowed the private sector to fully participate in all aspects of the cotton industry, they did not afford companies the complete freedom to trade cotton. Thus, according to the Law No. 210/199429, the producers could, during a transitional period, optionally sell their cotton to the Collection Centres - *i.e.,* the Spot Cotton Exchange as established by Law No. 141/1994 - where minimum prices were guaranteed by the Government30. Between 1994 and 2000, a Decree was enacted at the beginning of each season to organize the functioning of the Collection Centres31.\n\nArt. 4 of the Preamble, in Exhibit D-53.\n\nExhibits D-92 to D-95.\n\nReply of the Respondent, p. 28; Exhibits D-98 to D-104.\n\n62.\n\nIf, on the one hand, these Laws liberalized and opened the cotton industry to new participants, and in particular to non-State-owned companies, they established, on the other hand, the legal basis for the Government to take regulatory measures from time to time32.\n\nReply of the Respondent, p. 6.\n\n63.\n\nOn August 17, 1994, the National Cotton Company (\"NCC\"), a privately-owned cotton company, was incorporated.\n\n64.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, NCC's incorporation was made with the active encouragement of senior Egyptian officials as a joint investment between the National Bank of Egypt (\"NBE\") and the Pension Fund of the employees of the NBE, holding together 25% of the shares, and some members of the Wahba family, holding 75% of the shares.\n\n65.\n\nNCC was the first privately-owned cotton ginning and trading company in Egypt combining both production and sales activities. NCC was as well the largest company in terms of the number of employees33.\n\nMemorial of the Claimants, p. 3-4; Exhibit C-1, p. 2-3.\n\n66.\n\nOther privately- or publicly-owned companies were operating in the market at the same time as NCC34. Pursuant to the Law No. 210/1994, NCC was registered like any other cotton company which wished to trade on the domestic market outside the Collection Centres.\n\nExhibit D-111.\n\n3.4. The 1994/1995 season\n-------------------------\n\n67.\n\nPursuant to the new liberalization laws, Ministerial Resolution No. 364/1994 was passed in August 1994 whereby the Government undertook to guarantee fixed minimum prices for seed cotton during the season 1994/1995 to the farmers who optionally chose to supply their cotton to the Collection Centres35.\n\nMinisterial resolution No. 364/1994 in connexion with fixing the minimum prices of seed cotton, Exhibit D-92.\n\n68.\n\nDuring that season, production of cotton was lower than average due to bad meteorological conditions. Low production and high international market prices resulted in higher overall market prices. This increase in prices led the farmers to sell their cotton directly to cotton companies in order to get a higher price, instead of selling at the lower fixed price to Collection Centres.\n\n69.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, only 15% of the harvest - produced either by farmers who did not find any purchaser due to the small amount of crop offered or by farmers who did not want to expend resources in search of a buyer - was sold through the Collection Centres, since the prices were lower than the market prices. Consequently, due to these specific market conditions and the small amount of cotton sold through the Collection Centres, the Government did not undertake to reimburse any price differentials the way it did during the pre-1994 period36.\n\nCounter-memorial of the Respondent, p. 30-31; Exhibit D-98.\n\n70.\n\nDuring that season, NCC purchased directly from the free market, outside the Collection Centres, approximately 18% of the national production of raw cotton.\n\n71.\n\nA company wishing to export or import cotton was required to apply for a permit from the Union of Cotton Exporters in order to be registered, pursuant to Law No. 211/1994. Import and export permits were granted in advance for the 1994/1995 season. Consequently, only state-owned companies were in possession of these permits37, and, therefore, NCC could not benefit from such permits for the ongoing season and could neither import nor export cotton.\n\nExhibit C-1, p. 5; Exhibit C-CMW-6.\n\n3.5. The 1995/1996 season\n-------------------------\n\n72.\n\nIn August 1995, Ministerial Resolution No. 549/1995 was passed whereby the Government would guarantee the fixed minimum prices of the seed cotton for the season 1995/1996 for the producers who optionally chose to supply their cotton to the Collection Centres38.\n\nMinisterial Resolution No. 549/1995 in connexion with fixing the minimum prices of seed cotton, Exhibit D-93, Exhibit C-CMW-16.\n\n73.\n\nDuring that season, NCC purchased approximately 12% of the national production of raw cotton. The market conditions were identical to those of the previous season, and the market prices were high. Again, the increase in the market prices led the farmers to sell their cotton directly to cotton companies in order to get a higher price, instead of selling at a lower fixed price to the Collection Centres.\n\n74.\n\nOn February 1, 1996, the Government passed Decree No. 34/1996 authorizing the export of cotton for the ongoing season39. Thus, NCC was granted an export permit during 8 days, until the Government decided again to prohibit the export of cotton40.\n\nExhibit C-CMW-8.\n\nExhibit C-1, p. 5-6.\n\n75.\n\nThe Government then passed Ministerial Decree No. 457/199541 for the 1995/1996 season, ordering the dealers of cotton not to store any ginned cotton for more than 30 days.\n\nExhibit C-CMW-14.\n\n76.\n\nBy the end of the 1995/1996 season, NCC had ceased to purchase cotton.\n\n3.6 The 1996/1997 season and the transfer of shares to the Claimants\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nIn April 1996, the Government passed Ministerial Act No. 133/1996 guaranteeing the minimum prices of seed cotton for the season 1996/199742.\n\nMinisterial Act No. 133/1996 determining minimum prices of seed cotton, Exhibit D-94, Exhibit CMW-22.\n\n78.\n\nDuring this season, production of cotton was higher than average and market prices therefore decreased, making it more advantageous to sell and purchase through Government Centres instead of buying directly from farmers, since prices were fixed.\n\n79.\n\nIn view of the market conditions (i.e. the low prices), the Government introduced by Decree No 908/199643 the reimbursement of the price differential resulting from a higher resale price, in comparison with the purchase price from the farmers, for all companies which participated in purchasing and selling cotton through the Collection Centres. Four privately owned companies - Modern Nile Cotton Company, Arab Cotton Ginning and Trade Company, Arab Investment Cotton Company, and the partially privatized Nile Ginning Company - participated in the system of purchasing and selling through the Collection Centres.\n\nExhibit D-100.\n\n80.\n\nOn April 1, 1997, the Claimants acquired the shares held by the NBE and the Pension Fund; Ameritrade replaced the NBE, acquiring its 40,000 shares, and Champion acquired the Pension Fund's 10,000 shares, for a total amount of EGP 3.75 million44.\n\nCounter-memorial of the Respondent, p. 14.\n\n3.7 The 1997/1998 season and the subsequent seasons\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nThe market conditions of the 1997/1998 season were identical to the conditions of the 1996/1997 season, resulting in low overall market prices. Again, the decrease in the market prices led the farmers to sell their cotton through the collection centres, rather than directly to companies, in order to get a better price.\n\n82.\n\nThe Government introduced by Decree No. 931/199745 a reimbursement mechanism of the price differential resulting from a higher resale price, in comparison with the purchase price from the farmers, for the companies which participated in purchasing and selling cotton through the Collection Centres.\n\nDecree No. 931/1997, in Exhibit D-101.\n\n83.\n\nIn 1998, the Government modified the price supporting scheme. For the 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 seasons, the minimum price was determined by a new formula. However, the mechanism allowing the cotton companies to choose whether or not to participate in the trade through the Collection Centres remained identical, according to Decrees No. 1048/199846 and No. 1014/199947.\n\nExhibit D-102.\n\nExhibit D-103.\n\n3.8 The Settlements\n-------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Government of Egypt has executed five series of payments to several cotton companies, namely a Settlement of September 15, 1997, and four other Settlements, those of June 29, 1998, of July 1, 2000, of November 5, 2002, and of December 12, 2003.\n\n85.\n\nThe 1997 Settlement provided for a payment by the Government of EGP 3,975 billion in favour of six publicly-owned companies48.\n\nExhibit C-3.\n\n86.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, these companies had submitted to the Government the documents that proved that they had purchased cotton through the Governmental system, and the price differences were recorded by the Government as a debt owed to these companies, since the Ministry of Finance had declared that the Government would bear the costs resulting from the price differential49.\n\nTranscript of the hearing held on December 13, 2004, p. 54-55.\n\n87.\n\nThis payment was the consequence of an accumulation of dues (debts) of the Government for the benefit of the cotton companies since the mid-1980s. This debt increase had lead to a liquidity crisis in the banks - since the banks financed these Governmental debts - and therefore became a serious problem for the Government50. The Settlement represented a benefit for both the companies and the banks51.\n\n*Id.* p. 112.\n\n*Id.* p. 116-117.\n\n88.\n\nThe four subsequent Settlements were paid to publicly-owned companies as well as to private companies52. Those Settlements were paid in the respective amounts of: EGP 443 million on June 26, 1998, for the 1996/1997 season; EGP 3.3 billion on July 1, 2000, for the 1997/1998 season; EGP 400 million on November 5, 2002; EGP 107 million on December 18, 2003. The Settlements in the years 2002 and 2003 dealt with price differences for the 2000/2001 season as well as interests and leftovers from previous seasons.\n\nExhibit CMW-29.\n\n89.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, as in the previous Settlement, the companies receiving payments from these Settlements had submitted to the Government the documents that proved that they had purchased cotton through the Governmental system, and the price differences were recorded by the Government as a debt owed to these companies, since the Ministry of Finance had declared that the Government would bear the costs53.\n\nTranscript of the hearing held on December 13, 2004, p. 54-55.\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n-------------\n\n4.1 Position of the Claimants\n-----------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent has violated its obligations to provide nondiscriminatory treatment under Article II (2)(a) of the BIT (**i.e.,** discrimination/national treatment claim, cf. **infra** 4.1.1) and to provide treatment in accordance with international law including full protection and security and fair and equitable treatment under Article II (4) of the BIT (**i.e.,** denial of fair and equitable treatment/full protection and security claim, cf. **infra** 4.1.2).\n\n4.1.1. Discrimination claim\n---------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the series of the five Settlements executed in 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2003 were in violation of the non-discrimination obligations owed by Egypt under the BIT. According to the Claimants, when Egyptian officials decided in August 1997 to take action to relieve the crisis facing the cotton industry - a crisis the Claimants assert was created by the officials themselves - Egypt had an obligation under the BIT to ensure that the action was taken on a non-discriminatory basis. Their decision to implement a compensation program - which by design, implementation and impact, benefited only certain enterprises to the exclusion of NCC - was a violation of Egypt\u2019s obligation to provide NCC with national treatment according to Article II (2)(a)54.\n\nReply of the Claimants, p. 1.\n\n92.\n\nIn order to honour its obligations to provide national treatment under the BIT, the Government of Egypt could not choose to pay only selected companies without also compensating NCC. NCC could have continued in business if it had not been denied access to the Settlements on the same terms as its competitors55.\n\n*Id.* p. 1.\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimants rely on the *Pope & Talbot* standard as the test to be applied, according to which: *\"the critical test for national treatment in the investment Treaty context, as* *demonstrated by the Pope & Talbot Tribunal, is whether differences in treatment have a reasonable nexus to rational government policies that (i) do not distinguish, on their* *face, or de facto, between foreign-owned and domestic companies, and (ii) do not* *otherwise unduly undermine the investment-liberalizing objectives of the Treaty [...] The rationale for this approach is the acknowledgement that it is almost always impossible to provide positive evidence of discriminatory governmental intent. However, by examining the proffered government policy rationale for the action and determining whether the action in question discriminates de jure or de facto against foreign-owned investments that are in like circumstances to the benefited local investments one can quite reasonably arrive at a conclusion with respect to the government action\"*56*.*\n\n*Id*. p. 25.\n\n94.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, once a difference in treatment has been established, the burden shifts to the other party to demonstrate that a reasonable, non-discriminatory policy justification exists which would explain the differences in treatment received by the foreign-owned investment. In the present case, the Claimants alleged that having established *prima facie* the existence of a discriminatory Governmental action, the Respondent had to provide evidence that the Settlements were based on reasonable and non-discriminatory underlying grounds, which Egypt failed to do57.\n\n*Id*. p. 26-27.\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimants refer to a set of events that allegedly led to violation of the nondiscrimination clause by Egypt. On August 7, 1995, a Coordination Committee was established by Decree to supervise the cotton operations of the affiliated companies and of the private companies who chose to supply their cotton to the collection centres58. The Committee also drafted and adopted a Uniform Contract to govern the transactions between buyers and sellers59. According to the Claimants, NCC sought to negotiate concessions and special terms with the Coordinating Committee. Its requests were unsuccessful and, according to Mahmoud Wahba, NCC was ordered, by letter of March 11, 1996, from the Coordinating Committee, to deliver a certain quantity of cotton to certain spinning mills60.\n\nMinisterial Decree No. 338/1995, Exhibit C-CMW-17.\n\nExhibit C-1, p. 8; Template of the Unified Contract, Exhibit C-CMW-18.\n\nExhibit C-1, p. 9; Exhibit C-CMW-19.\n\n96.\n\nDuring the 1995/1996 season, NCC made several requests to the Government to receive an export authorization; all of the requests were unsuccessful61.\n\nExhibits C-CMW-11 to C-CMW-13.\n\n97.\n\nIn 1996, NCC was forced to sell its stocks within a short period of time in order to comply with the regulations of the Ministerial Decree62. In August 1996, NCC was left with huge amounts of cotton because of the export prohibition and needed to sell its stocks urgently63, before the beginning of the new season64. NCC was finally able to sell its cotton in September 1996, at the time when the new crop for the 1996/1997 season was introduced. The price paid for NCC's stocks by the Government-owned mills being very low65, NCC sustained losses. By the end of the 1995/1996 season, NCC had lost huge amounts of money as a result of Government actions designed to reverse the 1994 privatisation Laws.\n\nExhibit C-1, p. 7-8.\n\n*Id.* p. 7 No. 33.\n\nMeeting of the board of directors of August, 19, 1996, Exhibit C-CMW-20.\n\nExhibit C-1, p. 9 No. 47-48; Meeting of the board of directors of August, 19, 1996, Exhibit C-CMW-20.\n\n98.\n\nOn 14 August, 1997, the Government issued a Decree establishing minimum seed cotton prices for farmers. As a result of the minimum prices, cotton companies sustained losses and Egypt launched a scheme to compensate them for these losses. At the end of 1996/1997 season, Egypt implemented this program to compensate the cotton industry participants for the losses resulting from its actions in the market.\n\n99.\n\nDuring the subsequent seasons, although NCC had stopped purchasing cotton, the company remained active in the cotton industry. NCC was selling cotton left over from the 1995/1996 season, in particular cotton waste, which is used by the industry in stuffed articles and to make gauze. In addition, NCC was trying during this period to collect its accounts receivable66.\n\nExhibit C-1, p. 15.\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimants allege that, in executing the Settlements, the Government of Egypt violated its obligations under the BIT67. NCC - as well as the entire private sector - was excluded from participating in this scheme on the grounds that: *\"(i) the minimum price* *was only available to those farmers who delivered their cotton to Government approved distribution centres; (ii) compensation was only available to companies operating State-approved distribution centres; and (iii) the State-owned companies controlled the* *allocation and operation of distribution centres and none were allocated to the private* *sector\"*.68\n\nMemorial of the Claimants, p. 9-10.\n\n*Id.* p. 10-11.\n\n101.\n\nAs a result, the Claimants claim that these series of payments made by Egypt to some companies operating in the cotton industry in the post-1996 period were discriminatory. A select group of national companies operating in the cotton sector were provided with substantial sums of money while NCC, a company owned by Americans, received nothing. According to the Claimants, by making payments to other company and failing to make similar payments to NCC, Egypt discriminated against NCC and failed to provide NCC with national treatment, an action in violation of Egypt's obligation under the BIT.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent has failed to provide any evidence that would support the conclusion that the scheme described by Egypt operated prior to 1994, or in the years 1996/1997, 1997/1998, 2000/2001 and subsequent years. Egypt has produced no laws, no regulations, no ministerial decrees, no demonstration of the various companies booking their entitlements to various payments, and no demonstration of the Egyptian government booking its corresponding liability to make those payments69.\n\nReply of the Claimants, p. 27.\n\n4.1.2. Lack of transparency claim (originally: Fair and equitable treatment/full protection and security claim)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimants claim that Egypt violated its obligations under Art. II (4) of the BIT by failing to provide fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security in accordance with the minimum standard of treatment required under international law.\n\n104.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants allege that Egypt's treatment of NCC - both in terms of the arbitrary removal of NCC's ability to conduct its business and in terms of the secretive and non-transparent manner in which Egypt intervened to compensate a limited group of select companies - fell below the minimum standard of treatment, constituting an abuse of rights under customary international law and violating the international law principle of transparency70.\n\n*Id.* p. 2.\n\n105.\n\nInitially71, the Claimants claimed that the Claimants' major shareholder, Mr. Wahba, was compelled, under threats by the Government, to agree to the sale to the Claimants of the shares in NCC held by the NBE and the Pension Fund. As a consequence, the Claimants claim, the agreement relating to the purchase of the shares by the Claimants was made under duress72. In the Claimants' Reply, the Claimants withdrew all claims based on the relationship between the NBE and the Socialist Prosecutor and the resulting agreements with the NBE, since these issues are currently pending in U.S. courts.73\n\n*Cf.* Memorial of the Claimants.\n\nMemorial of the Claimants, p. 26.\n\nReply of the Claimants, p. 27-28.\n\n106.\n\nHowever, the Claimants maintained their claim regarding the lack of transparency of the Settlements.\n\n107.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the applicable standard that determines the obligations of Egypt in this context are the doctrine of abuse of rights and the principle of transparency.74\n\nMemorial of the Claimants, p. 59.\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the terms of the Settlements were not publicly known. They were neither incorporated in a Decree or a Law nor published. Moreover, payments were made in favour of companies without any prior application, and without any objective criteria. As a consequence, by funding selected members of the cotton industry in a clandestine fashion, the Respondent violated the transparency principle under the BIT75.\n\nReply of the Claimants, p. 28.\n\n4.2 Position of the Respondent\n------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe Respondent rejects all claims of the Claimants.\n\n110.\n\nThe Respondent contests that it pursued any discriminatory actions. The Respondent also maintains there has been no violation of the fair and equitable treatment/full protection and security obligations and no violation of the transparency principle.\n\n4.2.1 Discrimination claim\n--------------------------\n\n111.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the five Settlements that resulted in payments by the Government to cotton companies are the materialization of Government undertakings to bear the costs of price differentials by compensating the cotton trade companies for the price differences that occurred between the minimum purchase price from the producers and the fixed sale price to customers. These five Settlements included a Settlement of September 15, 1997, and other Settlements of June 26, 1998, of July 1, 2000, of November 5, 2002, and of December 18, 2003.\n\n112.\n\nThe Settlement of September 15, 1997, concerns the reimbursement of price differentials regarding trade operations that occurred before 1994, *i.e.,* before the liberalization of the Egyptian cotton market and before the creation of NCC76.\n\nCounter-memorial of the Respondent, p. 52.\n\n113.\n\nThe other Settlements - those of June 26, 1998; July 1, 2000; November 5, 2002; and December 18, 2003 - concern the reimbursement of price differentials resulting from the optional collective system of cotton commercialization that was established during the liberalized years of the cotton industry, and in particular from the 1996/1997 season onwards77.\n\n*Id.* p. 52-53.\n\n114.\n\nNCC chose not to participate in the optional collective system of cotton commercialization and chose not to buy its cotton from the Collection Centres. Since NCC was not in the same situation as the companies that had purchased their cotton through the Collection Centres, NCC did not benefit from the Settlements. Therefore, the Settlements were not discriminating against NCC in comparison with the cotton companies which had used the Collection Centres78.\n\n*Id.* p. 53.\n\n115.\n\nThe purpose of the Settlements was to reimburse the Government's debts resulting from price differences on an objective basis established by the liberalization Laws and their applications Decrees. Egypt never owed any debt to NCC regarding price differences79.\n\n*Id.* p. 54.\n\n116.\n\nThe Respondent contests that there should be a shift in the burden of proof, as alleged by the Claimants80. However, should the Respondent have to provide the necessary proof of a non-discriminatory policy, the Respondent claims that it has provided enough positive evidence that the difference of treatment was justified by objective circumstances, independent from any consideration linked to nationality81.\n\nRejoinder of the Respondent, p. 16.\n\n*Id.* p. 4.\n\n117.\n\nThe Central Agency drafted an audit report in 199782 regarding the price differences, the purpose of which was to examine and check the amount of debt owed by the Ministry of Finance to the trading cotton companies83.\n\nExhibit D-152.\n\nRejoinder of the Respondent, p. 25.\n\n118.\n\nThe four Settlements from June 29, 1998, to December 12, 2003, did not concern the activities pertaining to the 1994/95 and 1995/96 seasons. All Settlements were based on governmental Decrees84. It has not been disputed that both publicly-owned and private companies were the beneficiaries of these Settlements. The Claimants could not show that NCC would in any way have been prohibited from continuing to participate in the Egyptian cotton market. The only reason advanced by the Claimants was their economic impossibility to continue their activity in view of the heavy losses which they had incurred during the two seasons in which they did participate. This Tribunal has not been asked to examine the reasons for the losses incurred by NCC resulting, according to the Claimants, from acts and omissions of the Egyptian authorities. All these alleged acts and omissions are the object of a lawsuit commenced by NCC against the Egyptian Government before the Egyptian Administrative Courts. In any case, the acts and omissions occurred before the investment of the two corporate Claimants in NCC and would therefore be outside the jurisdiction of this Tribunal based on the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Egypt and the USA.\n\nExhibits D-98 to D-104.\n\n119.\n\nThe Respondent states that it has provided enough evidence that the litigious payments pertained to a support program for cotton producers and, as NCC did not participate in this support program, the Claimants could not claim any payment85.\n\nRejoinder of the Claimants, p. 5.\n\n4.2.2 Lack of transparency claim\n--------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nAccording to recent case law, the fair and equitable standard must be assessed in light of all the facts and circumstances of the case, including the behaviour of the Claimants86.\n\nReply of the Respondent, p. 57-58.\n\n121.\n\nThe Government's acts and the measures taken were reasonable and objectively justified. The Socialist Prosecutor's acts were also legitimate and based on the Law. The magistrates working for the Socialist Prosecutor and for the Court of Ethics are independent from the Government and from the NBE87. Thus, the NBE required the Social Prosecutor to take action against Mr. Wahba only after the failure of the negotiations relating to an agreement with Mr. Wahba concerning his debts, according to regular judicial proceedings, and not in an arbitrary manner88.\n\n*Id.* p. 62.\n\nCounter-memorial of the Claimants, p. 64.\n\n122.\n\nRegarding the full protection and security standard, the acts of the Government, the NBE, and the Socialist Prosecutor against Mr. Wahba were lawfully taken in order to protect public funds, according to Egyptian Law and Article X (1) of the BIT89.\n\n*Id.* p. 68.\n\n123.\n\nRegarding the transparency claim, the Respondent states that the BIT contains no such obligation. However, should such obligation exist, the Settlements were made public, as they were taken in the form of published Laws and Decrees90.\n\n*Id.* p. 65.\n\n4.3 Findings of the Arbitral Tribunal\n-------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal will first examine the discrimination claim and then the transparency claim.\n\n4.3.1. Claim under Art. II (2) (a) - non-discrimination principle of the BIT\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nThe non-discrimination principle is found in Art. II (2)(a) of the BIT, which prohibits discrimination based on nationality and requires the State to treat equally investments that are in like situations.\n\n126.\n\nThe purpose of Art. II (2)(a) is to promote foreign investment and to guarantee the foreign investor that his investment will not because of his foreign nationality be accorded a treatment less favourable than that accorded to others in like situations.\n\n127.\n\nThe Parties are in agreement that the application of this clause requires that a foreign company make an investment and/or any associated activity in connection with this investment, in the territory of a Contracting State.\n\n128.\n\nTo comply with the non-discrimination provision, the following requirements need to be met: there shall be no treatment less favourable - *i.e.,* no discrimination - between foreign and national investments when they are in like situations. This standard requires the Arbitral Tribunal to first determine whether the parties involved - NCC and the companies who received payments from the Government under the various Settlements - were in like situations, and then to compare the treatment being received by foreign investments with the treatment received by local investors to determine whether there was a violation of the provision.\n\n129.\n\nWere the parties involved - NCC and the companies who received payments from the Government - in like situations?\n\n130.\n\nThe national treatment obligation does not generally prohibit a State from adopting measures that constitute a difference in treatment. The obligation only prohibits a State from taking measures resulting in different treatment in like circumstances91. A like situation has been defined as a similar situation that should be assessed within the same business or economic sector92.\n\n*A. Goetz and others v. Burundi* (ICSID Case No. ARB/95/3), para. 121, in Exhibit D-134: \" une discrimination suppose un traitement diff\u00e9renci\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 des personnes se trouvant dans une situation semblable \".\n\n*Pope & Talbot v. Canada*, Award of April 10, 2001, para. 78, available at http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/tna-nac/ documents/Award\\_Merits-e.pdf.\n\n131.\n\nIn the present case, the Parties agree that NCC and the other publicly - or privately -owned cotton trading companies were *prima facie* in similar situations: both purchased cotton from farmers, and both ginned their cotton and sold it.\n\n132.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the payments made by the Government to some cotton trade companies were based on objective criteria: the payments aimed either to reimburse debts for pre-1994 operations or to reimburse price differentials for operations post-1995/96 in which NCC did not participate93. Therefore, the payments did not violate the national treatment obligation.\n\nCounter-memorial of the Claimants, p. 53.\n\n133.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the payments made by the Government did discriminate. An analysis of the intent of the Government of Egypt is irrelevant. Because the Claimants did demonstrate a *prima facie* difference in treatment, the burden had shifted to the Respondent to demonstrate that a reasonable non-discriminatory policy justification existed that would explain the differences in treatment received by NCC and the other cotton companies94.\n\nReply of the Claimants, p. 25-26.\n\n134.\n\nUnder Art. II (2)(a) of the BIT, the Government of Egypt should not treat differently NCC and other cotton trading companies on the grounds of their different nationality, if they were in like situations. The question would remain whether a difference of treatment in like situations could be permissible based on other objective grounds. It is, however, not necessary for the Arbitral Tribunal to answer this question since the Arbitral Tribunal, as shown hereafter, finds that NCC and the companies which received the payments were not in a like situation.\n\nThe 1997 Settlement:\n--------------------\n\n135.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Settlement relates to reimbursement of price differentials regarding trade operations that occurred before 1994.\n\n136.\n\nUnder the Law No. 88/196295, all cotton produced was to be delivered to the Egyptian Cotton Committee at a price which would be fixed prior to the beginning of each season by decision of the Minister of Economy96. The Egyptian Cotton Committee was to sell the cotton locally or for export at a price fixed also by the Minister of Economy97. Before the 1994 liberalization, it was prohibited for spinning mills to purchase cotton except through direct purchase from the established Committee.\n\nExhibit D-115.\n\nArt. 1, in Exhibit D-115.\n\nArt. 2, in Exhibit D-115.\n\n137.\n\nAccording to the Law, the Minister of Economy fixed the purchase prices paid by the cotton export companies for the cotton bought from the producers (on behalf of the Government), from the 1985/1986 season until the 1993/1994 season98. The sale prices from cotton companies to local consumers were also fixed by ministerial resolution99.\n\nExhibits D-116 to D-123.\n\nExhibit D-124.\n\n138.\n\nThe mechanism was explained in a letter from the Minister of Public Sector to the Minister of Finance100 and during the December 13, 2004, hearing in Paris. The cotton company bought cotton from the producer at a fixed price on behalf of the Government and sold it to local mills or for export.\n\nLetter of May 30, 1999, in Exhibit D-125.\n\n139.\n\nThe differences between the prices are debited or credited on the account of the public treasury. Over the years the purchase price from the producers increased, so that the balance of the debt of the Ministry of Finance amounted to EGP 3,975.94 million as of August 31, 1996, pursuant to the audit of the cotton accounts control department at the Central Audit Agency. On September 15, 1997, the Ministry of Finance paid its debt by issuing notes on the public treasury for a one-year period with interest of 8%. Other amounts, especially interest on the outstanding amounts, were, however, still due101.\n\nExhibit D-125.\n\n140.\n\nAn auditing report was made for the Cotton Trade & Export Company102, in which the agency mentioned the price differences and the debts of the Ministry of Finance for the price differences, the repurchase differences, the marketing expenses differences and the financing burdens of these amounts103.\n\nReport of the Central Audit Agency of June 30, 1993, in Exhibit D-128.\n\n*Id.* p. 3.\n\n141.\n\nThe marketing expenses represent all the costs involved in every activity between the acquisition of raw cotton and the sale of ginned cotton. The company engaging in these activities gets paid for these production or transformation costs104.\n\nTranscript of the hearing held on December 13, 2004, p. 150-152.\n\n142.\n\nAuditing reports were also made for the Misr Cotton Export Company105 and for the Port Said Cotton Export Company106.\n\nExhibit D-129.\n\nExhibit D-130.\n\n143.\n\nTo conclude, regarding the 1997 Settlement, the documents presented to the Arbitral Tribunal evidence that the reason for the payments was to extinguish the debts recorded for the period before 1994. Therefore, since NCC was not incorporated at the time these debts were incurred, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the payments of the 1997 Settlements were not discriminatory.\n\nThe Subsequent Settlements:\n---------------------------\n\n144.\n\nRegarding the other Settlements - those of June 26, 1998; July 1, 2000; November 5, 2002; and December 18, 2003 - they concern, according to the Respondent, the reimbursement of price differentials that occurred, for the 1996/1997 season and the seasons thereafter, in relation with the liberalized optional collective system of cotton commercialization.\n\n145.\n\nAs previously exposed, after 1994 the cotton companies had the option of buying cotton either from the Collection Centres - organized at the beginning of each year by a ministerial Decree - or directly from the producers. The producers, like the cotton companies, also had the option of selling their cotton either to the Centres or to the companies. At the Collection Centres, a minimum price, fixed by the Government107, was guaranteed to the producers.\n\nExhibits D- 92 to D-95.\n\n146.\n\nFor the 1994/1995 and 1995/1996 seasons, the Government did not have to make any payments to cotton companies, since, due to the higher resale price of cotton, the companies did not sustain any losses during these seasons. The support system was therefore not used.\n\n147.\n\nIf NCC possibly incurred losses in the 1995/1996 season (see above \u00a7\u00a795-97) these, according to the Claimants, were not caused by price differentials but by administrative acts like the impossibility to freely export cotton or the problems associated with the stocks of cotton held by NCC. The Claimants, however, do not, or at least no longer, base their claim on these acts of the Egyptian authorities which are (or at least were) the object of a law suit commenced by NCC against the Egyptian Government before the Egyptian Administrative Courts.\n\n148.\n\nDuring the 1996/1997 and 1997/1998 seasons, however, the market prices were very low, and therefore most of the production was sold through the Collection Centres. The difference between the price paid by the private or public companies which had purchased cotton from the Collection Centres and the resale price was reimbursed by the Government to these companies.\n\n149.\n\nThe letter of May 30, 1999108, also states that the Ministry of Finance would bear the differences between the minimum prices for producers and the sale prices for the 1996/1997 season. As of June 30, 1997, the debt amounted to EGP 443 million and payment was made by issuance of notes.\n\nExhibit D-129.\n\n150.\n\nFor the 1997/1998 season, the Ministry of Finance also stated that it would bear the price if the export prices dropped below the minimum guaranteed.\n\n151.\n\nEvery year, the Central Audit Agency would audit the accounts of the State-owned companies, including the account used to record the price differences due by the Ministry of Finance109.\n\nExhibits D-126 and D-127.\n\n152.\n\nA company's participation in purchasing cotton through the Collection Centres was a prerequisite for that company to receive a reimbursement.\n\n153.\n\nNCC was not part of the companies that could potentially receive a reimbursement for the 1996/1997 and 1997/1998 seasons, since NCC did not participate in buying any cotton during these seasons. Moreover, according to the Respondent, Egypt did not violate the national treatment obligation which prohibits discrimination (between foreign and domestic nationals) on the grounds of nationality.\n\n154.\n\nAlthough both kinds of companies operate in the same industry and are subject to same kind of rules, there is a significant difference between a company which opts to buy cotton from the Collection Centres at fixed prices and a company which opts to trade on the free market, whether or not the company is privately-owned or State-owned or whether the company is national or foreign.\n\n155.\n\nThe first requirement to be fulfilled in order to receive compensation payments from the Government is the participation in the trading of cotton through the Collection Centres. The Parties are in agreement that NCC did not participate in this system. Therefore, NCC cannot be compared with other cotton trading companies regarding the Settlements.\n\n156.\n\nSince the Arbitral Tribunal came to the conclusion that the companies were not in a like situation, it does not need to analyze the other requirements which prohibit discrimination on the grounds of nationality.\n\n4.3.2. Claim under Art. II (4) - Lack of transparency claim\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe non-discrimination principle can also be found more generally in Art. II (4) of the BIT, which provides for a general non-discrimination principle, as required by international law and national legislation.\n\n158.\n\nBecause the Claimants withdrew their claim based on the alleged violation of the fair and equitable treatment and the full protection and security obligations, the Arbitral Tribunal will not further analyze this facet of the claim.\n\n159.\n\nHowever, the Claimants maintained their claim based on the lack of transparency of the Settlements, pursuant to Art. II (4) of the BIT, which will be analyzed hereunder.\n\n160.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Settlements were implemented and executed in violation of the transparency principle in international law, since they were secretly made to selected members of the cotton industry110.\n\nReply of the Claimants, p. 28.\n\n161.\n\nThe transparency principle was developed by the Claimants111 by reference to the principle of transparency as it has been addressed by the WTO Appellate Body, and recalled the U.S.-Underwear case in which the Appellate Body described how the principle of transparency finds expression in the GATT agreement: *\"[...] The essential implication is that Members and other persons affected, or likely to be affected, by Governmental measures imposing restraints, requirements and other burdens, should have a reasonable opportunity to acquire authentic information about such measures and, accordingly, to protect and adjust their activities, or alternatively to seek modification of such measures\"*112*.*\n\n*Id.* p. 66.\n\nThe Settlement of September 15, 1997, concerns the reimbursement of price differentials regarding trade operations that occurred before 1994, *i.e.,* before the liberalization of the Egyptian cotton market and before the creation of NCC76.\n\n162.\n\nThe Claimants113 also mentioned how the principle of transparency was clarified in the ICSID case *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales,* which holds: *\"[...]*  *The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations* *. Any and all State actions conforming to such criteria should relate not only to the guidelines, directives or requirements issued, or the resolutions approved hereunder, but also to the goals underlying such regulations. The foreign investor also expects the host State to act consistently, i.e. without arbitrarily revoking any preexisting decisions or permits issued by the State that were relied upon by the investor to assume its commitments as well as to plan and launch its commercial and business activities. The investor also expects the State to use the legal instruments that govern the actions of the investor or the investment in conformity with the function usually assigned to such instruments, and not to deprive the investor of its investment without the required compensation. In fact, failure by the host State to comply with such pattern of conduct with respect to the foreign investor or its investments affects the investor's ability to measure the treatment and protection awarded by the host State and to determine whether the actions of the host State* *conform to the fair and equitable treatment principle.\"114* (Emphasis added by the Claimants).\n\nReply of the Claimants, p. 68.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TECMED S.A.* v. *Mexico*, (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), May 29, 2003, at para. 354, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/laudo-051903%20-English.pdf.\n\n163.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the payments were known, public and transparent. The payments were published and the reimbursements were decided on the grounds of a report drafted by the independent Central Audit Agency. Evidence was produced by the Respondent to this effect.\n\n164.\n\nThe parties are in agreement that each Party has the burden to prove the facts on which it relies to support its claims and defenses. It was therefore the obligation of the Claimants to prove that the Settlements were not made in a transparent manner. The Tribunal notes that the Laws and Decrees regarding the organization of the cotton trading structures, the prices and the Government Centres' purchase and sale mechanism were public, available, or have been published or produced by the Respondent upon the request of the Claimants. The Claimants were in a position to know beforehand all rules and regulations that would govern their investments for the respective season to come. The Claimants have not produced any evidence or even pertinent arguments that Egypt violated the principle of transparency under international law and this claim therefore also has to be denied.\n\n5. COSTS\n--------\n\n165.\n\nThe Parties submitted statements of their costs on July 15, 2003, with respect to the jurisdictional phase and on July 10, 2006, regarding the merit phase and the overall costs of the proceeding. The original Statement of the Claimants of July 10, 2006, was resubmitted in its final revised form on July 17, 2006.\n\n166.\n\nEach party has paid an amount of USD 225,000 to ICSID as advance payments for the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and to cover the expenses and administrative fee of ICSID. In the following cost computations these amounts are not included.\n\n167.\n\nFor the jurisdictional phase the Claimants claimed a total of USD 283,121.71, and the Respondent claimed the sums of USD 170,000; EGP 236,021.11; and EUR 9,738.30115.\n\nThe abbreviation USD signifies United States Dollars, EGP signifies Egyptian Pounds, and EUR signifies Euros.\n\n168.\n\nFor the merits phase the Claimants put forward a claim for USD 1,089,158. The Respondent claims the sum of USD 548,075; EGP 152,679.88; and EUR 19,791.48.\n\n169.\n\nTherefore, the Claimants claim for the total arbitration an amount of USD 1,375,279, and the Respondent claims the sums of USD 668,075; EGP 388,700.99; and EUR 29,529.78.\n\n170.\n\nIn their submission of July 24, 2006, the Claimants state that they \"have no reply statement to make on the costs presented by [the] Arab Republic of Egypt.\"\n\n171.\n\nIn its statement of July 24, 2006, the Respondent indicated that it has no comments regarding the statements of the Claimants but draws the attention of the Arbitral Tribunal to the important difference between the cost statements with respect to the jurisdictional phase and the merits phase.\n\n172.\n\nEach Party has requested that its costs be assumed by the other Party.\n\n173.\n\nNeither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings contain any provisions how the costs are to be apportioned between the Parties. Article 61 of the ICSID Convention provides that, except as the parties otherwise agree, which is not the case in this Arbitration, the Arbitral Tribunal shall assess the expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom these expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Arbitral Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants in the Decision on Jurisdiction were successful with respect to the two corporate Claimants which represent 25% of the share capital of NCC but that the claims of the three individual Claimants representing 37.5% of NCC were denied.\n\n175.\n\nIn this Award, the Arbitral Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the claims of the remaining Claimants are without any merit. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent produced a great number of documents based on repeated production requests by the Claimants after having already produced two witnesses for the hearing in Paris on December 13, 2004.\n\n176.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the opinion that it is appropriate in this case that basically the costs follow the event. Taking all factors into consideration, especially the fact that the claim was denied, the Arbitral Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the Claimants shall assume the total amount of the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and of ICSID. They are therefore ordered to pay an amount of USD 225,000 to the Respondent.\n\n177.\n\nWith respect to the costs of the Parties, the Arbitral Tribunal holds that the Claimants have to carry their own costs and expenses as their claims were denied. Especially in view of the fact that the Respondent contested the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and as the Tribunal did allow the claims of the two Corporate Claimants to go forward, it would seem appropriate that the Claimants pay to the Respondent one half its expenses. The amounts claimed by the Respondent (at the September 2006 rates of exchange approximately USD 775,000) seem reasonable also when compared to the total costs claim of the Claimants. The Claimants shall therefore pay to the Respondent the amount of USD 334,037.50; EGP 194,350; and Euro 14,765.\n\n178.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction the Arbitral Tribunal held that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the claim of the three individuals, James T. Wahba, John B. Wahba and Timothy T. Wahba. It has never been disputed that the Arbitral Tribunal is competent to order these three original claimants to carry the appropriate costs of the jurisdictional phase of this procedure. These three individual claimants hold 37.5% of the share capital of NCC, compared to the 25% held by the two corporate Claimants. The question of costs and arbitration fees was reserved in the Decision on Jurisdiction. It is not possible to identify precisely the fees and costs which are attributable to the jurisdiction phase and those attributable to the merits. Based on the information available to the Arbitral Tribunal it would seem that approximately 20% of the overall activity of the Arbitral Tribunal and of the Parties, their counsel, and their witnesses were devoted to the Decision on Jurisdiction. The Arbitral Tribunal therefore holds that the three original claimants, James T. Wahba, John B. Wahba and Timothy T. Wahba, are jointly and severably liable to the Respondent for 20% of the total amount the Claimants owe to the Respondent, therefore the sum of USD 66,807.50; EGP 38,870; and EUR 2,953 (accounting for 20% of the Claimants' share of Respondent's expenses), plus USD 45,000 (accounting for 20% of the advance made by the Respondent to cover the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and of ICSID). The total owed by the three original Claimants to the Respondent is, therefore, the sum of USD 1 1 1,807.50; EGP 38,870; and EUR 2,953.\n\nNOW THEREFORE, the Arbitral Tribunal\n\n**DECIDES AND AWARDS AS FOLLOWS** **:**\n\n1. The claims of the Claimants are denied.\n\n2. a) The Claimants shall carry the fees and expenses of the members of the Arbitral Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes of United States Dollars 450,000.\n\nb) The Claimants shall therefore pay to the Respondent the amount originally paid by it to the Centre of United States Dollars 225,000.\n\n3. The Claimants shall carry the expenses incurred by them in connection with these proceedings and shall pay to the Respondent one half of the expenses incurred by it, therefore: United States Dollars 334,037.50; Egyptian Pounds 194,350; Euros 14,765.\n\n4. The original individual claimants:\n\nMr. James T. Wahba; Mr. John B. Wahba; and Mr. Timothy T. Wahba\n\nare jointly and severally liable together with the Claimants to the Respondent for the payment of the Respondent's expenses up to the following amounts United States Dollars 111,807.50 Egyptian Pounds 38,870 Euros 2,953"}]}
