Thomas QC\n-------------------------------------\n\n**Introduction**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nThe main issue before the Tribunal concerns the application of the limitation period prescribed by Article 10.18 of the Peru-United States Trade Promotion Agreement (the \"**TPA**\" or the \"**Treaty**\"). I regret to say that I cannot agree with the decision reached by my distinguished colleagues. I believe that they have erred by focusing on the wrong question.1\n\nTo be clear, this dissent is concerned solely with the majority's treatment of the limitation period.\n\n2.\n\nAs the Decision recounts, the present proceeding is not the first time in which the two parties have been in dispute. In a prior proceeding (\"***Renco I***\"), initiated in 2011, a tribunal found that the Claimant failed to comply with the second condition expressed in Article 10.18 of the Treaty (which requires a claimant to file a waiver of other remedies at the time the claim is submitted to arbitration).2 The Tribunal held that, \"if no compliant waiver is served with the notice of arbitration, Peru's offer to arbitrate has not been accepted; there is no arbitration agreement; and the Tribunal is without any authority whatever.\"3 The claim was therefore dismissed.\n\nArticle 10.18.2 states:  \n2. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless:  \n(a) the claimant consents in writing in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and  \n(b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied,  \n(i) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1 (a), by the claimant's written waiver, and  \n(ii) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1 (b), by the claimant's and the enterprise's written waivers of any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.\n\n*The Renco Group v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/1 (\"*Renco I*\"), Partial Award on Jurisdiction, 15 July 2016 (L. Yves Fortier, Toby T. Landau, Michael J. Moser (President)), \u00b6 158 (**C-3** / **R-8** / **RLA-24**).\n\n3.\n\nBy the time that the *Renco I* tribunal rendered its Partial Award, over four years had elapsed since the purported submission of the claim to arbitration. Given the Treaty's three-year limitation period, this posed an obvious difficulty for the Claimant. A new claim would raise serious questions as to what measures alleged to breach the Treaty could be put before the new tribunal. Recognizing this, the *Renco I* tribunal stated that while it \"cannot prevent Peru from exercising in the future what it considers to be its legal rights,\" if the claim were to be submitted to a new tribunal, the Respondent should bear in mind \"Renco's submission that Peru's conduct with respect to the late raising of the waiver objection constitutes an abuse of rights.\"4 The tribunal found no abuse by Peru by its having raising the waiver objection in that proceeding, but said it was troubled by what it considered to be the late raising of the objection. Accordingly, \"justice would be served if Peru accepted that time stopped running for the purposes of Article 10.18(1) when Renco filed its Amended Notice of Arbitration on August 9, 2011.\"5\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 188.\n\n*Id.*\n\n4.\n\nAfter *Renco I* 's dismissal, settlement discussions were held pursuant to a \"Consultation Agreement\" and then a \"Framework Agreement\".6 The parties agreed, without prejudice to their respective positions as to the effect of the effluxion of time since the commencement of the *Renco I* arbitration, that the time taken up by such negotiations would not be held against either party:\n\nThe Parties waive their respective rights to assert any statute of limitations, laches or other limitations argument or defense based on the passage of time between 10 November 2016 and the end of the Consultation Period with respect to the claims asserted in each of the respective Notices. For clarity, this wavier is strictly limited as set forth herein and is only prospective, and does not impact the timeliness, or untimeliness, of any claims as of the date hereof or other rights or defenses, temporal or otherwise, except as set forth herein.7\n\nDated 10 November 2016 and 14 March 2017, respectively.\n\nFramework Agreement, \u00b6 2(c) (**R-10**).\n\n5.\n\nAfter negotiations failed, on 23 October 2018, the Claimant filed two new claims: (i) a new Treaty claim; and (ii) a contract claim with which this Tribunal is not concerned.8\n\nThe two proceedings are separate proceedings (registered as PCA Case No. 2019-46 and PCA Case No. 2019-47). The parties to each dispute decided to appoint the same arbitrators to hear each case.\n\n**The Issue Before the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nArticle 10.17.1 of the Treaty, entitled, \"*Consent of Each Party to Arbitration*\", limits a State Party's consent to a claim which is submitted \"to arbitration under this Section *in accordance with this Agreement\u2026*\". [Emphasis added.]\n\n7.\n\nThe next article, Article 10.18, \"*Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party*\" underscores the conditional nature of the consent: a would-be claimant must comply with the prescribed conditions and limitations in order to perfect the State's offer to arbitrate and thereby form an arbitration agreement. Failure to comply with the conditions and limitations on a would-be respondent's consent deprives the tribunal of the whole or part of its jurisdiction, depending upon the circumstances of the case. This is well established and, as noted above at paragraph 2, was accepted to be the case by the *Renco I* tribunal.9\n\n*Renco I*, Partial Award, \u00b6 158.\n\n8.\n\nThe Decision rests on my colleagues' analysis of what they see as the effect of the initiation of the *Renco I* arbitration on the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal.10 I see the issue quite differently. While *Renco I* provides important background to the present arbitration, my main interest is in how that tribunal interpreted and applied Article 10.18 of the Treaty to arrive at its conclusion that it was without jurisdiction.11\n\nDecision, \u00b6 208: \"In addition, it is undisputed between the Parties that between the conclusion of *Renco I* and the filing of the Notice of Arbitration in the present case, only three days elapsed in respect of which the Parties had not agreed on a suspension of the prescription period. These three days do not make any material difference because the notices of arbitration in *Renco I* were filed several months before the three-year period elapsed. Therefore, unless Peru is precluded from invoking Article 10.18.1 due to an abuse of rights, the decisive question is whether the prescription period was suspended in relation to the Claimant's FET and indirect expropriation claims during the pendency of *Renco I*. If it was not, the claim resting on MEM's refusal to grant an extension would have become prescribed on 11 March 2012. The same holds true for all other claims resting on breaches alleged to have occurred before 13 November 2013 (i.e. the cut-off date calculated by the Respondent).\" [Emphasis added.]\n\nI note that the *Renco I* tribunal was careful to confine its comment on the limitation period to the Respondent and rightly made no attempt to bind any future tribunal in respect of its independent duty to ascertain the extent of its jurisdiction and to act within it; it would have been wrong for it to attempt to do so. In particular, the tribunal made no attempt to bind the parties to a view of the suspension of the running of time. Whether one calls that proceeding a nullity or by some other term, juridically, the tribunal did not exist as it explicitly found in its \"boot straps\" analysis (\u00b6 158 (and 172)): \"To put it colloquially, the Tribunal would be \u2018pulling itself up by its own bootstraps' in order to create jurisdiction when none existed. In the Tribunal's considered opinion, this would be entirely unprincipled and obviously impermissible.\"\n\n9.\n\nInsofar as the *present* Tribunal's jurisdiction is concerned, I have endeavoured to apply the Treaty, as written, to the *present* claim. I do not believe that the Treaty allows this Tribunal to relax the jurisdictional limitations that govern the claim because of what transpired in a prior proceeding. Thus, much of the majority's reasoning is, in my respectful opinion, not relevant to the narrow issue which is before this Tribunal.\n\n10.\n\nThat issue is this: on 23 October 2018, the Claimant filed a new Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim (including a waiver to which no objection has been taken). Given the three-year limitation period specified by the Treaty, is it open to the Claimant to proceed in this new claim before this new Tribunal on the basis that this Tribunal has the temporal jurisdiction to consider measures dating back to 1 February 2009 \u2013 as the *Renco I* tribunal could have considered, had it been properly established? Or is the Claimant precluded from alleging breaches that fall outside of the three-year cut-off period specified by the TPA?\n\n11.\n\nIn essence, the Claimant argues that although *Renco I* was dismissed, it is nevertheless entitled to seize this Tribunal with jurisdiction reaching back to 1 February 2009 because the Respondent was put on notice of its claims (as they stood at the time12) and the temporal jurisdiction of that tribunal, had it been properly established, would have reached back to the date of the treaty's entry into force of 1 February 2009. The Claimant argues further, invoking in this respect the *Renco I* tribunal's admonition quoted above, that any attempt by Peru to enforce the three-year cut-off limitation would be abusive.\n\nIt is common ground that the claims have evolved due to actions taken by Peru since April 2011.\n\n12.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent asserts that the presumptive cut-off date of the present Tribunal's temporal jurisdiction is 23 October 2015 (three years dating back from 23 October 2018), but owing to the Framework Agreement's provision, quoted above, there is what Peru has termed an \"Adjusted Treaty Prescription Date,\" which lengthens this Tribunal's temporal jurisdiction to 13 November 2013.13 Any measure that occurred prior to that date is said to fall outside of the Tribunal's temporal jurisdiction.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 34-36.\n\n13.\n\nA valid submission to arbitration would have suspended the running of time for the *Renco I* tribunal because the claim was submitted to arbitration in April 2011 and therefore the events occurring as of the date of the entry into force of the Treaty would fall well within the three-year limitation period applicable to the *Renco I* proceeding. That would have been the case had the *Renco I* tribunal been established properly. But that did not occur due to the defective waiver which the Claimant granted in both its original Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim and in its Amended Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim of 11 August 2011.\n\n14.\n\nDoes that mean that the limitation period for the present claim is the same as what the *Renco I* tribunal's temporal jurisdiction would have been had a proper waiver been filed? For the majority, the answer is yes. They focus on the effect of submitting a claim to arbitration under the Treaty and hold that once a claim is submitted, the running of time is suspended. They therefore find:\n\nThe Contracting Parties could have drafted Article 10.18.1 in a way that requires more than a claim being \"submitted to arbitration\" (which term necessarily refers back to Article 10.16.4) for the prescription period to be suspended, thereby expressly departing from general principles of law in this regard. However, they chose not to do so. The Tribunal is not prepared to conclude that a claim \"submitted to arbitration\" within the meaning of Article 10.16.4 does not suspend the prescription period merely because the Contracting Parties made coinciding submissions to the effect that Article 10.18.1 is a \"clear and rigid\" requirement that is not subject to any \"suspension, prolongation or other qualification\", in circumstances where (i) the Contracting Parties themselves qualify this general statement; (ii) the plain language of the Treaty does not address the issue of suspension at all and suggests that the prescription period is satisfied by a claim that meets the requirements set out in the UNCITRAL Rules; (iii) if at all, the context and object and purpose of the treaty militate in favor of such a suspension of the prescription period, in particular to avoid manifestly unreasonable results in case an arbitral award is annulled; and (iv) general principles of law, which are to be read into the Treaty pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, provide for such a suspension.14\n\nDecision, \u00b6 236.\n\n15.\n\nThere are quite a few points packed into this paragraph, but the key points for present purposes are: (i) the focus on the suspension of the running of time *when the Renco I claim was submitted to arbitration;* (ii) the attempt to reconcile the idea of the suspension of the running of time with the statements made by the two States Party to the Treaty that the limitation period is a \"clear and rigid\" requirement that is *not* subject to any \"suspension, prolongation or other qualification\"; (iii) the contention that the Treaty does not address whether the submission of a claim to arbitration suspends the running of time (and hence the suggestion that the answer to that question is to be found in the UNCITRAL Rules); and (iv) that the running of time must be taken to have been suspended because the context and object and purpose of the treaty militate in favour of such an interpretation, particularly \"to avoid manifestly unreasonable results\" in the event of annulment. They then resort to general principles of international law, which they \"read into\" the Treaty in order to find that the running of time was suspended back in 2011.\n\n16.\n\nIt can be seen, therefore, that the focus of their analysis is on what happened when the first claim was submitted to arbitration before the *Renco I* tribunal and a desire to avoid what is regarded to be a manifestly unreasonable result as a consequence of that claim's dismissal.\n\n17.\n\nThis is not what the Tribunal has to decide. I well understand the sentiment which has driven the majority's analysis, but it is *not* legally relevant to an ascertainment of the temporal jurisdiction of *this* Tribunal. Limitation periods are, by definition and intention, categorical in their application and when applied in the facts of a particular case can be seen to produce harsh consequences for a claimant. But they reflect the choices of legislatures, in the context of municipal law, and the agreement of the State Parties, in the context of an international treaty.\n\n18.\n\nBefore turning to the limitation period clause contained in the Treaty, I have one final introductory remark: I note that the majority does not base its decision on abuse of right. I therefore put that issue to one side.\n\n**The Applicable Treaty Provision**\n-----------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe vast majority of bilateral investment treaties and other investment protection treaties do not contain a limitation period and therefore the issue did not arise before the late 1990s. Limitation periods were introduced in what might be called \u2018second' and \u2018third generation' treaties. By the former, I refer to the NAFTA, which signaled a sea change in terms of the amount of detail prescribed by the State Parties when it came to the jurisdictional and procedural aspects of initiating and conducting an arbitration under NAFTA's Chapter Eleven. Unlike bilateral investment treaties in force at the time of NAFTA's drafting which, except to specify one or more sets of available rules, typically said little about the conduct of arbitrations arising thereunder, some 24 articles were negotiated by the NAFTA Parties to govern investor-State arbitrations conducted under that treaty.15 NAFTA was thus the first treaty to introduce a three-year limitation period and a requirement that the claimant file a waiver, pursuant to which it undertook not to initiate or continue other remedies once its claim was submitted to NAFTA arbitration.16\n\nSee Section B of Chapter Eleven which sets out a series of articles dealing with several aspects of the conduct of investor-State arbitrations under the NAFTA. In contrast, some treaties simply left it to tribunals to determine what rules would be applied.\n\nThe NAFTA contained an exception to the prohibition on the initiation or continuance of other remedies, namely, \"proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the disputing Party\", that is broader than that used in subsequent treaties such as that applicable in the instant case. The TPA, consistent with post-NAFTA US treaty-making practice, has a more narrowly focused exception. See Article 10.18.3.\n\n20.\n\nBy \u2018third generation' treaties, I refer to even more detailed treaties that subsequently have been negotiated by the NAFTA Parties (individually with other States), but also more latterly by other pairs and groupings of States, which reflect the lessons of NAFTA arbitration. The TPA is such a \u2018third generation' treaty.\n\n21.\n\nArticle 10.18.1 of the Treaty states:\n\n1. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.60.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1 (a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1 (b)) has incurred loss or damage.17\n\nThe third deals with the class of claims dealing with alleged breaches of investment authorizations or investment contracts and the relationship between such claims and other dispute settlement procedures.\n\n22.\n\nIt warrants taking a moment to consider the phrasing of this provision. Four points can be made:\n\na. It is clearly worded.\n\nb. Its opening words are phrased in peremptory and definitive terms: \"*No claim may be submitted* \u2026\".\n\nc. It does not express any exceptions to the three-year rule and thus the natural ordinary meaning of the clause is \"three years means three years\".\n\nd. Of critical importance, it confers no power of any type on a tribunal to vary its application depending upon the circumstances of a particular case.\n\n23.\n\nOne would have to work very hard indeed to find any ambiguity whatsoever in this clause because it is plain on its face.18 As Caplan and Sharpe noted in their commentary on the 2012 US Model BIT, which contains virtually identical language, the provision *\"* establishes *the outermost time limit for submitting a claim* to arbitration.\"19\n\nThe CAFTA-DR equivalent was described as follows in *Corona Materials* :  \n191. Having regard to the ordinary meaning of the terms, read in their context and in light of the Agreement's object and purpose, the DR-CAFTA Parties have plainly conditioned their consents to arbitration. If a claimant does not comply with the conditions and limitations established in Article 10.18, its claim cannot be submitted to arbitration.  \n192. The present proceeding concerns the Claimant's compliance, or not, with the three-year limitation period prescribed by Article 10.18.1. **The limitation period clause is written in plain terms and does not contemplate the suspension or \"tolling\" of the three-year period. In this regard, it is consistent with the approach taken in other treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement**. The relevant subparagraphs of Articles 1116 and 1117 of that Agreement are worded similarly and, as pointed out by the Respondent and by the intervenor, the United States of America, **NAFTA tribunals have described NAFTA's limitation period as \"clear and rigid\" and not subject to any \"suspension, prolongation, or other qualification.**\" [Emphasis added.]\n\nLee M. Caplan & Jeremy K. Sharpe, \"United States\" in Chester Brown (ed.), *Commentaries on Selected Model Investment Treaties* (2013), p. 829 (**RLA-19**).\n\n24.\n\nI observe further from my reading of the majority's decision that they do not appear to consider Article 10.18.1 to be ambiguous. (The words \"ambiguous\" or \"ambiguity\" are not used in the course of their reasons.) I agree with the majority in this respect.\n\n25.\n\nArticle 10.18.1 binds not only a would-be claimant, but also the tribunal established to hear a claim. This is well established in the cases; the tribunal's role in construing and applying a limitation period is confined to determining whether measures alleged to breach obligations contained in the Treaty fall *within* or *without* the three-year period. It does not extend to purporting to vary the period.\n\n26.\n\nAccordingly, if a claimant alleges breach(es) of the Treaty, all of which have occurred within the three-year period, all such measures will fall within the tribunal\u2019s temporal jurisdiction. However, sometimes - and a number of tribunals have considered this situation - a claimant will allege treaty breaches which are said to have occurred within the three-year period, but upon examination it is found that some measures fall *within* and others *without* the limitation period. In such circumstances, because the operation of the limitation period clause is so plain and straightforward, tribunals routinely hold that they have jurisdiction to consider the former measures, but not the latter.20 And, of course, it is conceivable that a claimant could allege treaty breaches which are said to all fall within the three-year period, but which are ultimately found to have all occurred outside of that period. Such a case must be dismissed in its entirety.21\n\nSee, for example, *Apotex Inc. v. United States of America* \u00b8 ICSID Case No. UNCT/10/2, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 14 June 2013 (Clifford M. Davidson, Fern M. Smith, Toby Landau (President)) (**CLA-26**) and *Berkowitz (formerly Spence International Investments and others) v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/13/2, Interim Award (Corrected), 30 May 2017 (Mark Kantor, Ra\u00fal E. Vinuesa, Daniel Bethlehem (President)) (**RLA-36**).\n\nThe *Corona Materials* tribunal, applying identical language from the CAFTA-DR Agreement stated, \u00b6 200:  \nThe second step in applying DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 requires the Tribunal to determine the date on which the Claimant \"*first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.1 6.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b) has incurred loss or damage.*\" A comparison of that date with the \u2018critical date' will then enable the Tribunal to decide whether it is competent to hear the claims in this proceeding: **Should the date on which the Claimant acquired actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged breach and of the corresponding damage be earlier than the critical date, the Tribunal would have to conclude that the Claimant's Request for Arbitration was submitted after the expiration of the limitation date and, as a consequence, the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction to hear the Claimant's claims**. [Emphasis added.]\n\n27.\n\nIn my opinion, the present Tribunal is presented with the second of the three possible categories: the Claimant is alleging treaty breaches which fall within and without the Tribunal\u2019s temporal jurisdiction.\n\n28.\n\nThe plain meaning ofArticle 10.18.1 should be sufficient to dispose of the issue. The short answer is that this Tribunal\u2019s temporal jurisdiction cannot reach back to 1 February 2009 and thereby cannot be extended to encompass what would have been the temporal jurisdiction of the *Renco I* tribunal.\n\n29.\n\nHowever, in the interests of a fuller explanation of my position, and given the fact that my learned colleagues have found it necessary to summon rules of treaty interpretation in aid of their conclusion that Article 10.18.1 does not contemplate the situation which is before the present Tribunal and therefore the solution is to be found in general international law, it is appropriate to place the issue into historical context and to consider in some detail the way in which limitation period clauses have been interpreted.\n\n**The Understanding of the Limitation Period Provision at the Time of the TPA's Conclusion**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe *Vienna Convention* Article 31 analysis focuses on the relations between the two States party to the treaty. In this case, it so happens that the limitation period clause which was included in the Treaty has a history, and one of the two States party to this Treaty has consistently included such provisions in its treaties dating back to the NAFTA in 1994. For reasons which will become clear, I do not see the fact that only one of the two States Party to the Treaty had this prior experience to be a bar to considering it. As shall be seen, tribunals comprising highly experienced arbitrators considered such provisions and their view of the clause's meaning was clear before the TPA was signed and ratified and that view has been maintained consistently up to the present day.\n\n31.\n\nI note in this regard that in considering the waiver objection, the *Renco I* tribunal also relied on NAFTA jurisprudence which it found helpful to its interpretation and application of Article 10.18.2. The NAFTA cases on the treatment of jurisdictional issues have been considered by tribunals to be directly relevant to the interpretation of post-NAFTA treaties such as the CAFTA-DR and the present Treaty.22\n\nSee, for example, *Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/AF/14/3, Award on the Respondent's Expedited Preliminary Objections in Accordance with Article 10.20.5 of the DR-CAFTA, 31 May 2016 (Fernando Mantilla-Serrano, J. Christopher Thomas, Pierre-Marie Dupuy (President)) (**RLA-23**) and *Commerce Group and San Sebastian Gold Mine, Inc. v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/17, Award, 14 March 2011 (Horacio Grigera Na\u00f3n and J. Christopher Thomas, Albert Jan van den Berg (President)), and of course, *Renco I.*\n\n32.\n\nThis leads me to a key point: By the time of the entry into force of this Treaty, on 1 February 2009, the operation of virtually identical limitation periods clauses was well established in the case law and, I submit, known to one of the State Parties and clearly knowable to the other. By this I mean that as of the date of the conclusion of the Peru-United States Trade Promotion Agreement, if hypothetically the United States were to be asked whether the limitation period clause was plain in its meaning and effect, the answer would be '*yes*'. Obviously, as a proponent of this very treaty model with extensive prior experience with NAFTA arbitration, the United States well understood what it was doing with Article 10.18. As for Peru, which may not have had prior experience with this sort of treaty model, if it were similarly to be asked, it would have been able to ascertain how the clause had been interpreted and applied in prior cases.\n\n33.\n\nI can say this with confidence because it was demonstrably the case as of 1 February 2009.\n\n34.\n\nFirst, I note what NAFTA provided in Article 1116(2):\n\nAn investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.23\n\nA similar limitation period was included in NAFTA, Article 1117(2), which applies to a claim made by an investor on its own behalf; the same condition applies to a claim made by an investor upon behalf of an enterprise which it owns or controls.\n\n35.\n\nThe thrust of this provision is the same as in Article 10.18.1 of the TPA, although the latter is phrased in slightly more peremptory terms. Two differences can be discerned between the NAFTA and the TPA. First, while NAFTA used the phrase \"*make a claim*\", which had engendered some confusion in some early NAFTA cases, the Treaty employs the phrasing \"*submitted to arbitration*\" in the interests of clarifying when an arbitration is initiated for limitation period purposes.24 Second, while the NAFTA limitation period was included in the two articles which permitted the filing of claims (analogous to Article 10.16, *\"Submission of a Claim to Arbitration*\" of the present Treaty25), in the TPA the limitation period is located in the \"*Conditions and Limitations on Consent*\" provision, a provision which has no analogue in the NAFTA. This provision was introduced in US (and Canadian) treaty-making practice as experience with the arbitral consideration of NAFTA was gained.26\n\nLee M. Caplan & Jeremy K. Sharpe, \"United States\" in Chester Brown (ed.), *Commentaries on Selected Model Investment Treaties* (2013) (**RLA-19**), notes in this regard at footnote 290:  \nThe text is clear that \u2018submitted' refers to submission of a notice of arbitration pursuant to Art 24 [of the US Model BIT]. The language improves on Chapter 11 of the NAFTA, which refers to \u2018make a claim': *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Submission of the United States of America on Preliminary Issues (pursuant to Article 1128) of 6 October 2000, pp 4-6, paras 16-18 (explaining that \u2018make a claim' means submit a notice of arbitration and was included in the NAFTA to accommodate Mexican law).\n\nArticles 1116 and 1117.\n\nCaplan and Sharpe observed in this respect:  \nThe 2012 Model BIT also adopts the innovations of the 2004 Model BIT that improve the process of investor-State arbitration for both States and investors. The recalibrated approach of the 2004 Model BIT, now reflected in the 2012 Model BIT, draws its inspiration from two principal sources: the US Government's experiences as respondent in investor-State arbitration claims under NAFTA Chapter 11, and the FTA negotiating objectives of the US Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002.  \n(Lee M. Caplan & Jeremy K. Sharpe, \"United States\" in Chester Brown (ed.), *Commentaries on Selected Model Investment Treaties* (2013), pp. 755-756 (**RLA-19**).)\n\n36.\n\nIn the years between NAFTA's entry into force and the TPA's entry into force, two important NAFTA arbitrations considered the limitation period provision, specifically whether it could be relaxed or tempered by the circumstances of the case.27 (A third proceeding, the *Methanex* case, also raised limitation issues, but ultimately it was unnecessary for that tribunal to render a decision, for reasons which will be explained below at paragraphs 51-52.)\n\nThe two cases were *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v*. *United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF) */* 99 */* 1, Interim Decision on Preliminary Jurisdictional Issues, 6 December 2000 (Jorge Covarrubias Bravo, David A. Gantz, Konstantinos D. Kerameus (President)) (**RLA-6**) and *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 20 July 2006 (James Anaya, John R. Crook, Fali S. Nariman (President)) (**RLA-10**).\n\n37.\n\nAs at 1 February 2009, the date of the TPA's entry into force, NAFTA tribunals agreed with the NAFTA Parties that the limitation period prescribed in that treaty was \"*clear and rigid*\" and \"*not subject to any suspension \u2026, prolongation or other qualification*\". This was the express finding of the *Feldman* tribunal made in 2002 in a claim against Mexico.28 That award was then in turn relied upon by the United States when defending a claim in the *Grand River* case.29 And the *Feldman* tribunal\u2019s formulation of the meaning and operation of the limitation period was explicitly accepted in terms by the *Grand River* tribunal in 2006:\n\n29. Since Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) introduced a clear and rigid limitation defence - not subject to any suspension, prolongation or other qualification - the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the time limitation issue for trial as a preliminary issue...30 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v*. *United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF) */* 99 */* 1, Interim Decision on Preliminary Jurisdictional Issues, 6 December 2000 (Jorge Covarrubias Bravo, David A.

These decisions were publicly available.\n\n39.\n\nIndeed, that clear understanding has persisted since the TPA\u2019s entry into force. As shall be seen in the review of the cases and non-disputing Party submissions, the *Feldman* tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the limitation period\u2019s meaning and effect has been repeated again and again by tribunals and non-disputing Parties - including in the United States\u2019 Non-Disputing Party Submission filed before the Tribunal in the present case.\n\n40.\n\nI turn now to the way in which tribunals and State Parties have described the effect of a treaty\u2019s limitation period.\n\n**The Treatment of Limitation Periods in the Cases**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nDisputes over the application of treaty limitation periods go back at least to the year 2000 when the *Feldman* Decision on Jurisdiction was issued.31 The limitation period cases have focused on establishing the date when the claimant first acquired (whether on a subjective or objective basis) knowledge of breach and knowledge of loss or damage in order to determine whether the measure(s) alleged to breach the treaty fell within or without the tribunal\u2019s temporal jurisdiction. This has sometimes proved difficult.\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v*. *United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF) */* 99 */* 1, Interim Decision on Preliminary Jurisdictional Issues, 6 December 2000 (Jorge Covarrubias Bravo, David A. Gantz, Konstantinos D. Kerameus (President)) (**RLA-6**).\n\n42.\n\nInsofar as the basic operation and effect of the limitation period is concerned, to my knowledge in all the cases decided to date, *no* tribunal has ever claimed a power to vary or otherwise relax the three-year period. No decision to that effect has been put before this Tribunal.\n\n43.\n\nThis not because a claimant has not sought to advance such arguments. *Feldman* itself dealt with a claimant's attempt to extend the limitation period beyond three years so as to capture alleged breaches of NAFTA Chapter Eleven which fell outside of that period. The tribunal rejected the attempt.32 So too did the *Apotex* tribunal when a similar attempt was made.33\n\nMy colleagues attach importance to a statement made by the *Feldman* tribunal: \"230. \u2026 that very tribunal expressly found it possible, in the same paragraph of its award referred to by the US, that the prescription period provided for at Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) of NAFTA (which is analogous to Article 10.18.1) is \u2018interrupted', i.e. suspended, under certain circumstances.\" Decision, \u00b6 230.  \nIn my respectful submission, this was merely an effort by that tribunal not to rule out the possibility that in some circumstances \u2013 not present in the case before it \u2013 it might be possible for a limitation period to be varied if an agreement or clear understanding was reached between the disputing parties. Indeed, as shall be seen below, the cases do recognize that it is possible that a respondent can allow an otherwise defective arbitration claim to be prosecuted. *But the existence of such a power vested in a respondent is not to be equated to that power being vested in the tribunal*. To the contrary, it is the tribunal's duty to respect and apply the jurisdictional confines prescribed by the States Party to the Treaty. Moreover, notwithstanding the statement on which my colleagues rely, in the decisive point in that case the *Feldman* tribunal held that the NAFTA's limitation period was \"*clear and rigid*\" and \"*not subject to any suspension\u2026, prolongation or other qualification*.\" It is this latter statement that the subsequent tribunals and non-disputing Parties have cited as correctly stating the law.\n\n*Apotex Inc. v. United States of America* \u00b8 ICSID Case No. UNCT/10/2, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 14 June 2013 (Clifford M. Davidson, Fern M. Smith, Toby Landau (President)), \u00b6\u00b6 310-311 (**CLA-26**):  \n310. The FDA decision was administrative in nature, and so not subject to any duty to exhaust judicial remedies. Critically, it occurred more than three years before Apotex brought its Pravastatin Claim under the NAFTA, and is therefore time-barred.  \n311. **Although Apotex seeks to toll the limitation period by linking the FDA measure to later court actions, NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunals have consistently rejected such efforts as contrary to the plain language of the agreement.** The FDA measure thus falls outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction. [Emphasis added.]\n\n44.\n\nVirtually every tribunal that has considered the limitation period issue has recited the *Feldman* formulation. The interventions of non-disputing State parties, principally the United States in various non-NAFTA cases (and Canada, Mexico, and the United States in NAFTA cases), have also consistently done so.34\n\nObviously, prior awards in proceedings to which Renco and Peru were not parties are not binding upon them, but where the jurisprudential trend is as clear and unmistakable as this one is, a tribunal should be loath to depart from it.\n\n45.\n\nTo begin with statements pertaining to the tribunal's lack of power to vary to operation of a limitation period clause, I note *Corona Materials*, where the United States stated:\n\n**A tribunal** **constituted under CAFTA-DR Chapter Ten** **is bound** **by the terms of the agreement**. Article 10.18.1 expressly requires a claimant to submit a claim to arbitration\n\nwithin three years of the date on which the claimant \"first acquired, or should have first acquired\" knowledge of breach and loss.35 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Corona Materials, LLC v. Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3, Submission of the United States of America, 11 March 2016, \u00b6 4 (**RLA-22**).\n\n46.\n\nNote the opening words of this finding: a tribunal is *bound* by the terms of the agreement. It has no power to vary the Treaty\u2019s terms or their operation. The *Corona Materials* tribunal shared this understanding.\n\n47.\n\nThe United States, citing *Corona Materials* and other cases to the same effect, has made the same point to the present Tribunal:\n\n3. **Article 10.18.1 imposes a** ***ratione temporis*** **jurisdictional limitation on the authority of a tribunal to act on the merits of a dispute**. [Footnote reference to *Corona Materials]* **As is made explicit by Article 10.18.1**, the Parties did not consent to arbitrate an investment dispute if \"more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach\" and \"knowledge that the claimant... or the enterprise... has incurred loss or damage.\" Accordingly, **a tribunal must find that a claim satisfies the requirements of,** ***inter alia,*** **Article 10.18.1 in order to establish a Party\u2019s consent to (and therefore the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over) an arbitration claim**. Because the claimant bears the burden of proof with respect to the factual elements necessary to establish jurisdiction under Chapter Ten, including with respect to Article 10.18.1,2 the claimant must prove the necessary and relevant facts to establish that each of its claims falls within the three-year limitations period.\n\n4. **This limitations period is a \"clear and rigid\" requirement that is not subject to any \"suspension,\" \"prolongation,\" or \"other qualification.\"** [Citing *Grand River, Berkowitz* and *Feldman]*\n\nAnd at footnote 7:\n\nThus, although a legally distinct injury can give rise to a separate limitations period, a continuing course of conduct does not extend the limitations period under Article 10.18.1. **Moreover, while measures taken outside of the three-year limitations period may be taken into account as background or contextual facts,** **such measures cannot serve as a basis for a finding of a breach under Article 10 of the U.S.-Peru TPA**. [Citing *Glamis Gold]36* [Emphasis added.]\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.\n\n48.\n\nParagraph 3 of the US Submission filed in the present case is identical to the statement made in a 21 June 2019 Non-Disputing Party Submission filed by the United States in the *Gramercy Funds Management LLC and Gramercy Peru Holdings LLC v. Republic of Peru* case. The sentence quoted above from paragraph 4 of the Submission is also identical to the *Gramercy* submission.37 It goes virtually without saying that Peru has expressly agreed with the United States interpretation.38\n\n*Gramercy Funds Management LLC and Gramercy Peru Holdings LLC v. The Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/18/2, Submission of the US, 21 June 2019, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 (**R-13**).\n\n*See* Respondent's Comments on NDP Submission generally.\n\n49.\n\nWhile it has been well understood by prior tribunals that they have no power to modify a treaty's jurisdictional limits and conditions, tribunals have recognized that a respondent, as the beneficiary of the waiver, for example, could accept a claimant's non-compliance with a condition or limitation specified in the treaty. This is an important point, because the majority places some weight on the fact that there could conceivably be a variation in the application of the limitation period.39 But upon closer examination of the cases, the basis for such a variation is clear.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 232.\n\n50.\n\nThe point was made in *Railroad Development v Guatemala* (a CAFTA-DR case cited by *Renco I*):\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimant's understanding of the Respondent's position is a fair reading of the Respondent's statement in its Reply. In fact, the Respondent even requested the Tribunal to issue an order to permit the Claimant to remedy the defective waiver. But it is also clear from subsequent submissions, confirmed during the hearing, that the Respondent retracted this concession and there is no basis on which the Tribunal could hold that it was precluded from doing so. **This being a matter pertaining to the consent of the Respondent to this arbitration, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction without the agreement of the parties to grant the Claimant an opportunity to remedy its defective waiver****. It is for the Respondent and** **not the Tribunal** **to waive a deficiency under Article 10.18 or to allow a defective waiver to be remedied, as the United States did in** ***Methanex.**40* [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Decision on Objection to Jurisdiction CAFTA Article 10.20.5, 17 November 2008 (Stuart E. Eizenstat, Professor James Crawford, Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda (President)), \u00b6 61 (**Ex. B**), cited in *Renco I* at footnote 5.\n\n51.\n\nThe *Railroad Development* tribunal's reference to *Methanex* was correct. In that case, the tribunal found that the original claim could not be sustained, but that it was open to the claimant to file a fresh pleading on a narrower basis. The United States reserved its right to assert limitation period objections to measures challenged in such a claim. The United States, faced with what it considered to be a non-compliant waiver, stated that:\n\nif this Tribunal were to dismiss Methanex's claim on jurisdictional grounds solely for failure to submit waivers in accordance with Article 1121, Methanex would be free to refile its claim upon the submission of complying waivers. If that were to occur, these proceedings would take longer to conclude... Recognizing this, in the interests of efficiency, if Methanex finally supplies the United States with waivers that fully comply with the requirements of Article 1121, **the United States consents in advance to the reconstitution of this Tribunal to be composed of its current members \u2014 on the condition that this Tribunal issue** **an order****deeming the arbitration to be duly commenced only as of the date that Methanex submits the effective waivers**.41 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of Respondent United States of America, 13 November 2000, p. 77. https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw9111\\_0.pdf\n\n52.\n\nWhen the claimant filed its fresh pleading in *Methanex,* it dropped one of the principal measures which it had previously challenged (the California \"Senate Bill 521\"). That measure would have fallen outside of the cut-off date associated with the revised claim.42\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Partial Award (William Rowley, Warren Christopher, V.V. Veeder (President)), \u00b6 93, noting the agreement between the Parties with respect to the United States' reservation of rights:  \n2. Although it continues to maintain that the waivers it previously submitted complied with the Article's requirements, Methanex does not now claim in this proceeding that California Senate Bill 521 is a measure that violates the NAFTA\u2026\n\n53.\n\n*Renco I* similarly found that it was the respondent *only* who could accept a defective waiver during the course of an arbitration:\n\n152. In the present case, however, the jurisdictional defect (Renco's non-compliance with Article 10.18(2)(b)) remains uncured. This jurisdictional defect could only be cured (a) if Renco took the positive step of withdrawing the reservation of rights, or submitting a new waiver without the reservation of rights, and Peru consented to this by way of a variation of Article 10.18(2)(b) of the Treaty, or (b) if Renco commenced a new arbitration together with a waiver without any reservation of rights.\n\n153. **Option (a) here does not arise, in the absence of consent by Peru**.43 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Renco I*, Partial Award, \u00b6\u00b6 152-153. See also *Resolute Forest Products, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, *v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2016-13, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 January 2018 (Ronald A Cass, C\u00e9line L\u00e9vesque, Judge James R Crawford (President)), \u00b6 153.\n\n54.\n\nI will come back to the *Renco I* tribunal's discussion of its \u2018option (b)' later in this opinion.\n\n55.\n\nFor present purposes, putting to one side the right of a respondent to waive non-compliance with the treaty's jurisdictional requirements, insofar as prior awards are concerned, I am not aware of *any* tribunal's finding that it even had such a power to exercise jurisdiction over measures occurring outside of the three-year limitation period.\n\n56.\n\nThe following is an illustrative list of where tribunals and non-disputing Parties have made the point. Note the consistent repetition of the *Feldman* formulation of the meaning and operation of the limitation period: view of a \"clear and rigid\" requirement is not subject to any \"suspension,\" \"prolongation,\" or \"other qualification\" by a tribunal:\n\n*a. Marvin Roy Feldman v. United Mexican States:*\n\n58. **In substance, in view of the Tribunal, such suspension or \u2018tolling\u2019 of the period of limitation is unwarranted.** NAFTA Article 1117(2) does not provide for any suspension of the three-year period of limitation.\n\n63.... **the Arbitral Tribunal stresses that, like many other legal systems, NAFTA Articles 1117(2) and 1116(2) introduce a** **clear and rigid limitation defense which, as such, is not subject to any suspension** **(see supra, para. 58),** **prolongation or other qualification. Thus the NAFTA legal system limits the availability of arbitration within the clear-cut period of three years****, and does so in full knowledge of the fact that a State, i.e., one of the three Member Countries, will be the Respondent, interested in presenting a limitation defense**.\"44 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*b. Grand River v. United States of America, Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America:*\n\n29. **Since Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) introduced a** **clear and rigid limitation defence -not subject to any suspension, prolongation or other qualification** - the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the time limitation issue for trial as a preliminary issue...45 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*c. Apotex v. United States of America:*\n\n324. Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent\u2019s submission that by reason of NAFTA Article 1116(2), all claims based exclusively upon the FDA decision of 11 April 2006 are time-barred, and so must be dismissed.\n\n325. **Apotex cannot avoid this conclusion by asserting that the FDA measure is part of a \"continuing breach\" by the United States, or \"part of the same single, continuous action,\" in so far as this is intended as a mechanism to use later court proceedings to toll the limitation period** for the earlier FDA measure.\n\n326. **As the Respondent has forcefully argued, nothing in the text or jurisprudence of NAFTA Chapter Eleven suggests that a party can evade NAFTA\u2019s limitation period in this way.**\n\n327. **On the contrary, the rule in NAFTA Article 1116(2) has been described as a** :\n\n**\"****clear and rigid limitation defense, which... is not subject to any suspension, prolongation or other qualification****.\"**\n\n328. Further, there is support in previous NAFTA decisions for the proposition that the limitation period applicable to a discrete government or administrative measure (such as the FDA decision of 11 April 2006) is not tolled by litigation, or court decisions relating to the measure. For example:\n\n(a) In *Mondev,* the tribunal rejected an attempt by the claimant to toll the limitation period through a court action against the underlying measures. At issue in that case were actions of the City of Boston and the Boston Redevelopment Agency (\"BRA\") concerning the development of commercial real estate in Boston, as well as subsequent litigation involving those actions. The tribunal declined to consider actions of the City of Boston and the BRA, as those actions had arisen before 1 January 1994, when the NAFTA entered into force. Relevantly for present purposes, the tribunal noted that: \"if Mondev\u2019s claims concerning the conduct of the City and BRA had been continuing NAFTA claims as at 1 January 1994, they would now be time-barred...46\n\n*d. Corona Materials LLC v. Dominican Republic:*\n\n191. Having regard to the ordinary meaning of the terms, read in their context and in light of the Agreement\u2019s object and purpose, **the DR-CAFTA Parties have plainly conditioned their consents to arbitration. If a claimant does not comply with the conditions and limitations established in Article 10.18, its claim cannot be submitted to arbitration**.\n\n192. The present proceeding concerns the Claimant\u2019s compliance, or not, with the three-year limitation period prescribed by Article10.18.1. **The limitation period clause is written in plain terms and does not contemplate the suspension or \u2018tolling\u2019 of the three-year period****.** In this regard, it is consistent with the approach taken in other treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. The relevant subparagraphs of Articles 1116 and 1117 of that Agreement are worded similarly and, as pointed out by the Respondent and by the intervenor, the United States of America, **NAFTA tribunals have described NAFTA\u2019s limitation period as \u2018clear and rigid\u2019 and not subject to any \u2018suspension, prolongation, or other qualification**.\u2019\"47 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*e.*The Non-Disputing Party submission of the United States of America in *Corona Materials:*\n\n4. **A tribunal constituted under CAFTA-DR Chapter Ten is bound by the terms of the agreement**. Article 10.18.1 expressly requires a claimant to submit a claim to arbitration within three years of the date on which the claimant \"first acquired, or should have first acquired\" knowledge of breach and loss.48 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*f. Resolute Forest Products. Inc. v. Government of Canada:*\n\n153. The relevant language of Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) is identical: \u2018if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage. The triggering event is the knowledge, actual or constructive, that an alleged breach has occurred and that loss or damage has been incurred as a result. **The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent, and with the other NAFTA Parties in their Article 1128 submissions, that** **this time limit is strict, not flexible. There is no provision for the Tribunal to extend the limitation period, and there is no question here of any waiver on the part of the Respondent**...49 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*g. Mobil Investments Canada, Inc. v. Canada:*\n\n146. The Tribunal considers that the requirement, in Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2), that any claim in respect of a breach of Section A of Chapter Eleven must be brought within three years of the investor (or enterprise) first acquiring knowledge of the alleged breach and first acquiring knowledge that it has suffered loss or damage as a result of that breach plays an important role within the scheme of Chapter Eleven. By preventing claims being brought against a NAFTA Party after more than three years, it guarantees for all three States a degree of certainty and finality. **Their submissions in several earlier NAFTA arbitrations make clear the importance which they attach to that guarantee while the awards themselves highlight that the limitation period is \u2018clear and rigid**.\"\n\n147. Moreover, the Tribunal accepts Canada's argument that the fact that the limitation period begins to run when a would-be claimant first acquires (or should first have acquired) the requisite knowledge is significant; as Canada points out, an investor cannot first acquire knowledge of the same matter on more than one occasion.50 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*h. Berkowitz et al v. Republic of Costa Rica:*\n\n162. The Claimants face formidable jurisdictional hurdles. On the face of it, the conduct of which they complain has deep roots in the period before the CAFTA entered into force between Costa Rica and the United States on 1 January 2009. Article 10.1.3 makes it clear that a cause of action under the CAFTA cannot arise in relation to any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the CAFTA entered into force. **The limitation period of Article 10.18.1, which would exclude any claim in respect of which a claimant first acquired, or is deemed to have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and loss before 10 June 2010, presents an equally daunting challenge.**\n\nAnd:\n\n211. For purposes of Article 10.18.1, the relevant date is when the claimant first acquired knowledge not simply of the breach but also that they incurred loss or damage as a result thereof. The Tribunal agrees with the observation of the tribunal in *Corona Materials* that \"knowledge of the breach in and of itself is insufficient to trigger the limitation period's running; subparagraph 1 requires knowledge of breach and knowledge of loss or damage.\" While the text of Article 10.18.1 does not state in terms that the loss or damage in question must be as a consequence of the breach that is alleged, the Tribunal considers that this necessarily follows. **It is a trite observation that a tribunal established under Chapter Ten of the CAFTA does not have competence to award monetary damages other than in respect of a breach that comes within its jurisdiction****.** It follows that the apprehension of loss or damage required by Article 10.18.1 concerns loss or damage that is incurred as a result of an alleged breach that falls within the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. This point has a wider relevance as the converse necessarily follows, namely, that a tribunal does not have competence to award damages arising from a breach in respect of which it does not have jurisdiction. **This is relevant in time-bar circumstances in which a series of associated actions may be divided up into those that meet the time-bar requirement, and are thus justiciable, and those that do not meet the time bar requirement, and are thus not justiciable****.** In such cases, the Tribunal considers that its jurisdiction to award damages will be necessarily linked to and constrained by the breach of which it is seised and over which it has jurisdiction.51 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v*. *United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF) */* 99 */* 1, Interim Decision on Preliminary Jurisdictional Issues, 6 December 2000 (Jorge Covarrubias Bravo, David A.

However, it might be of assistance to further discuss the way in which the waiver objection raised in the previous proceeding was considered by the *Renco I* tribunal and how certain findings made by that tribunal are relevant to the issue before the present Tribunal.\n\n**A Question of Terminology**\n-----------------------------\n\n60.\n\nIt appeared to me as I studied the majority\u2019s opinion further, that it may well be that a difference in terminology clouded our exchanges and obscured the fact that we have focused on two different issues. At paragraph 228 of the Decision, the majority state:\n\nMoreover, despite the US and, subsequently, Peru submitting that the limitation period is \"clear and rigid\", not to be modified by any \"suspension, prolongation or other qualification\", the Tribunal considers that this does not give the terms of the Treaty an ordinary meaning to the effect that a suspension of the prescription period of Article 10.18.1 requires, in addition to a claim being \"submitted to arbitration\" pursuant to Article 10.16.4, the presence of a waiver complying with Article 10.18.2(b).53\n\nDecision, \u00b6 228.\n\n61.\n\nI confess that I struggled to understand what was meant by this sentence. I found it to verge upon a *non sequitur*. That is, how could the majority quote the United States' and Peru's statements repeating that the cases had found that the three-year period is \"*clear and rigid*\" and cannot be modified by \"*suspension* \u2026\" and then turn around and say that this does not \"give the terms of the Treaty an ordinary meaning to the effect that a *suspension* of the prescription period of Article 10.18.1 requires, in addition to a claim being 'submitted to arbitration' pursuant to Article 10.16.4, the presence of a waiver complying with Article 10.18.2(b)\"?\n\n62.\n\nOn reflection, it seems to me that the Decision uses the words \"*suspension*\" in a different sense than the NAFTA and CAFTA-DR cases and the State Parties involved in those cases have used it.\n\n63.\n\nI believe that the majority's thinking goes to the idea that, when *Renco I* was initiated, that tribunal's temporal jurisdiction reached back to 1 February 2009 (the date of the Treaty's entry into force) and therefore there was no question of the limitation period specified by the Treaty not being *satisfied*.54 The idea appears to be that the Respondent was put on notice of the claims advanced in *Renco I* and that this suspends the running of time up to the submission of the present claim.55 This, I believe, explains their focus on what took place in *Renco I* and their discussion of whether that claim could be said to have been \"submitted\" to arbitration because of the defective waiver,56 and their finding that \"the States parties must be taken to accept that Article 10.18.1 *does allow for the prescription period to be suspended* for the pendency of an arbitration\".57 Here they are clearly referring to the suspension of the \"prescription period\" during the pendency of the *Renco I* arbitration.\n\nDecision, \u00b6 249: \"On the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant's notice of arbitration and statement of claim *in Renco I* suspended the prescription period of Article 10.18.1 \u2013 notwithstanding the fact that the Claimant was found, almost five years later, to have submitted a defective waiver.\"\n\nDecision, \u00b6 209: \"As a matter of course, the arbitral proceedings in *Renco I* could only have suspended the prescription period in relation to the Claimant's FET and indirect expropriation claims if these same claims were already submitted in *Renco I*.\"\n\nDecision, \u00b6 249: \"In this vein, what matters is that the notice of arbitration and statement of claim in *Renco I* met the requirements of Articles 3 and 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules and, therefore, amounted to a submission to arbitration within the (identical) meaning of both Articles 10.16.4 and Article 10.18.1.\"\n\nDecision, \u00b6 233: \"In addition, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt that the Contracting Parties would agree that, if an arbitral award rendered under the Treaty is annulled for reasons of improper composition of the tribunal or a violation of due process, the claimant would not be prevented from re-filing the same claim again even though that (re-)\u2018submission to arbitration' will hardly ever take place within three years of the alleged breach. Therefore, despite their general statement that the prescription period is \u2018clear and rigid' and not subject to any \u2018suspension', the States parties must be taken to accept that Article 10.18.1 does allow for the prescription period to be suspended for the pendency of an arbitration, despite its wording not expressly saying anything to this effect. To hold otherwise would not only create perverse incentives for a respondent State to elicit grounds for setting aside, it would frustrate a claimant's due process rights: a successful vindication of those rights would be rewarded with a prescribed claim. Such a manifestly unreasonable result\u2014which flies in the face of the object and purpose of the Treaty under Article 31(1) of the VCLT\u2014also confirms the Tribunal's interpretation under Article 32(b) of the VCLT.\"\n\n64.\n\nTheir analysis thus is bound up with the initiation of the *previous* arbitration which ultimately was dismissed. In contrast, my analysis is bound up with the initiation of the *present* arbitration.\n\n65.\n\nIn contrast to the majority, when I have used the word \"*suspension*\", I have used in the sense that the NAFTA and CAFTA-DR case law and the States party to the various treaties have used it. That is, when establishing *this* Tribunal's jurisdiction to consider measures alleged to breach the TPA, the Tribunal can only work back three years to reach the \"outer limit\" of its temporal jurisdiction (leaving aside the Respondent's agreement to an adjusted date).58 What the other tribunals and the Non-Disputing Party in this case are saying when they use the word \"*suspension*\" is that the three-year period is fixed by the Treaty. No power vests in this Tribunal to pronounce upon any measure that occurred before that temporal limit and more importantly, that limit cannot be changed, i.e. suspended, prolonged, tolled, qualified, etc. based on what a tribunal might see to be extenuating circumstances. But that is precisely what my colleagues are seeking to do here.\n\nA concrete example of this form of analysis can be seen in *Corona Materials* where, after reviewing the record evidence on when the alleged breach arose, the tribunal decided:  \nIt derives from the evidence reviewed above that Claimant concluded well before the critical date that DR-CAFTA had been effectively breached and that such breach had produced substantial loss or damage. As a matter of fact, the Claimant did not submit its Request for Arbitration until June 10, 2014, which is 3 years, 3 months, and 19 days later. As a consequence, its claims are time-barred by DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1. [Emphasis added.]  \nThis is how all of the cases have approached the analysis.  \n(*Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/AF/14/3, Award on the Respondent's Expedited Preliminary Objections in Accordance with Article 10.20.5 of the DR-CAFTA, 31 May 2016 (Fernando Mantilla-Serrano, J. Christopher Thomas, Pierre-Marie Dupuy (President)), \u00b6 238 (**RLA-23**))\n\n66.\n\nFor this reason, I rather doubt the following finding made by my learned colleagues:\n\n\u2026 *the Tribunal has no reason to doubt that the Contracting Parties would agree* that, if an arbitral award rendered under the Treaty is annulled for reasons of improper composition of the tribunal or a violation of due process, the claimant would not be prevented from re-filing the same claim again even though that (re-)\"submission to arbitration\" will hardly ever take place within three years of the alleged breach.59 [Emphasis added.]\n\nDecision, \u00b6 233.\n\n67.\n\nI would say that that is rather unlikely given what both State Parties have said to the Tribunal. In my view, given the consistent way in which tribunals have treated the issue, the way in which the United States has repeatedly expressed its view on the point, and how Peru has argued the present objection, if measures in the \"re-submitted\" claim fall outside the three-year outer limit. It is rather more likely that the Contracting Parties would *not* agree that such measures fall within the tribunal's jurisdiction and instead maintain the long-standing position that there is no power vested in the tribunal to extend the limitation period to encompass measures that were taken outside of that period. I base my opinion on: (i) the plain meaning of Article 10.18.1; (ii) on the uniform case law to date; and (iii) the United States' consistent interpretation in both its own defences (*Grand River*, *Methanex,* and *Apotex*) and in its interventions as a non-disputing Party (in *Corona Materials*, *Gramercy*, and the present case). In short, the analysis must proceed \u2013 not from whatever happened starting in 2011 \u2013 but rather from the date of the submission of the claim in the instant case.\n\n68.\n\nThis is the sense in which the decided cases \u2013 and the State Parties \u2013 have applied the term \"*suspension*\" (and \"prolongation\", \"tolling\", etc.).\n\n69.\n\nTo this, I would add that quite apart from the interaction of Articles 10.17 and 10.18 discussed earlier, it is clear that the Treaty's drafting shows that when the State Parties wished to confer discretionary powers on tribunals established under Chapter Ten, they knew how to do so. For example, a tribunal has the discretion to grant certain types of interim measures of protection, it has the power to determine whether to accept *amicus curiae* interventions, and so on.60 In contrast, Article 10.18 prescribes a three-year limitation period, full stop. Thus, I am unpersuaded by the majority's attempt to graft a power to suspend the *Renco I* prescription period into the Treaty's operation by reference to a \"general principle of international law\" in an attempt to overcome the rigour of Article 10.18.1.61\n\nSee in this respect Articles 10.20.3 and 10.20.8.\n\nDecision, \u00b6\u00b6 235-236.\n\n70.\n\nIn my respectful view, in \"reading in\" a power to undo the operation of the limitation period, the majority has engaged in an excess of jurisdiction by arrogating for itself a power which it clearly does not hold and the resulting holding that the Tribunal\u2019s temporal jurisdiction runs back some 11 years is in error.\n\n71.\n\nUnder Article 10.22, the Treaty\u2019s *\"Governing Law\"* clause, the tribunal \"shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.\" Obviously, this invites an analysis of the interaction between the Agreement and applicable rules of international law, but the primacy of the former over the latter - *as between the United States and Peru for the matters governed by this Treaty* - is clear. I have already adverted to the interaction of Articles 10.17 and 10.18 and have pointed out that the consent is limited to a claim which is submitted \"to arbitration under this Section *in accordance with this Agreement\"* not \"in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law\" and \"*in accordance with this Agreement*\" is in turn a reference to all of the requirements stipulated in Section B of Chapter Ten, especially the \"conditions and limitations\" on consents stipulated in Article 10.18.\"62 The point was made in *Corona Materials,* where having quoted the equivalent language in the CAFTA-DR, it noted:\n\nConsent is thus expressly conditioned on the claimant\u2019s submission of the claim in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. In this respect, the invocation of the investor-State arbitration clause is governed by a *lex specialis*.63\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 3:  \n**As is made explicit by Article 10.18.1,** the Parties did not consent to arbitrate an investment dispute if \u2018more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach' and \u2018knowledge that the claimant... or the enterprise... has incurred loss or damage.' **Accordingly, a tribunal must find that a claim satisfies the requirements of,** ***inter alia*****, Article 10.18.1 in order to establish a Party's consent to (and therefore the tribunal's jurisdiction over) an arbitration claim** \u2026\n\n*Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/AF/14/3, Award on the Respondent's Expedited Preliminary Objections in Accordance with Article 10.20.5 of the DR-CAFTA, 31 May 2016 (Fernando Mantilla-Serrano, J. Christopher Thomas, Pierre-Marie Dupuy (President)), \u00b6 188 (**RLA-23**).\n\n72.\n\nIn my respectful opinion, therefore, only measures taken after 13 November 2013 (the \"Adjusted Treaty Prescription Date\") culminating in the November 2015 decision of the Supreme Court of Peru, which is alleged to have denied justice to the Claimant, can fall within the Tribunal\u2019s temporal jurisdiction. All other measures which occurred prior to 13 November 2013 fall outside of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n73.\n\nBefore completing this opinion, I want to take note of certain findings of the *Renco I* tribunal that are relevant to, and consistent with, my analysis.\n\n**The** ***Renco I*** **Waiver**\n--------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nAs noted, the limitation period issue is presented in the present case because of the dismissal of the *Renco I* claim. The Claimant filed its first Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim on its own behalf and on behalf of its Peruvian enterprise, Doe Run Peru, on 4 April 2011. It then filed an amended Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim on 9 August 2011 wherein it formally dropped Doe Run Peru as a claimant. It provided a waiver on its own behalf, but because its Peruvian affiliate had been dropped from the claim, it did not provide a waiver from the affiliate. It is common ground that after the filing of the Amended Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, Doe Run Peru engaged in administrative and legal proceedings in Peru. Indeed, decisions taken by those bodies have become measures which are now alleged to breach the TPA.\n\n75.\n\nA comparison of the original Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim with the amended version reveals that modest modifications were made in in the wording of the second notice. This formed the basis of one of the Respondent's objections to the waiver. It asserted that although Doe Run Peru was no longer a claimant in a formal sense, the claim remained unchanged and a waiver was still required from the Peruvian affiliate.64 Without attempting to pass upon the merits of that argument, it can be said that this was an arguable point, given that Renco maintained the contractual claim (reformulated in the Amended Statement of Claim as an alleged breach of an \"investment agreement\" rather than as a breach of contract *per se)* as well as the alleged breaches of the substantive obligations contained in Section A of Chapter Ten.\n\nAt the Hearing, counsel for Peru stated in respect of the Amended Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim:  \nWe also objected on the ground that Renco should have included a waiver for DRP. And the basis was that their claim they originally filed did not change from their claim that they filed\u2014the amended claim other than the named Parties. The substance of the Claim did not change. And we argued that that meant that the Claim would still be made on behalf of the Investment DRP and, therefore, they should have submitted a waiver for DRP.  \n(Hearing Transcript, 13 June 2020, 230:16-24)\n\n76.\n\nThe waivers contained in both the original Notice and the Amended Notice were defective. The problematical text is reproduced below in bolded text. In its first Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, the Claimant stated:\n\nFinally, as required by Article 10.18 (2) of the Treaty, Renco and its affiliate DRP waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16, except for proceedings for interim entitled to relief, not involving payment of monetary damages, before a judicial or administrative tribunal of Peru. **To the extent that the Tribunal may decline to hear any claims asserted herein on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds, Claimants reserve the right to bring such claims in another forum for resolution on the merits**.65 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Renco I*, Partial Award, \u00b6 58.\n\n77.\n\nIn its Amended Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, the Claimant stated:\n\nFinally, as required by Article 10.18 (2) of the Treaty, Renco ~~and its affiliate DRP~~ waives their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16, except for proceedings for interim entitled to relief, not involving payment of monetary damages, before a judicial or administrative tribunal of Peru. **To the extent that the Tribunal may decline to hear any claims asserted herein on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds, Claimants reserves the right to bring such claims in another forum for resolution on the merits**.66 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Id*. Edits of the original Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim reflected in this text\n\n78.\n\nIn the first sentence of both waivers, the Claimant tracked the language of Article 10.18.2(b) of the Treaty. However, no doubt due to the fact that the Claimant was involved in legal proceedings in the United States and its Peruvian affiliate was contesting the MEM's assertion of a claim in the Peruvian bankruptcy proceedings, the Claimant hedged by adding the second sentence to the waivers.67\n\nNo criticism of the Claimant or its counsel is intended by the use of the word \"hedged\". The concern to maximize Renco's freedom of action was obvious in the circumstances which it faced at the time of the submission of the *Renco I* claim to arbitration.\n\n79.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, the *Renco I* tribunal issued a Partial Award finding that the Claimant had failed to comply with Article 10.18.2. In doing so, the tribunal then spelled out the consequences of non-compliance:\n\n158. Under Article 10.18, the submission of a valid waiver is a condition and limitation on Peru's consent to arbitrate. **This is a precondition to the initial existence of a valid arbitration agreement and as such leads to a clear timing issue: if no compliant waiver is served with the notice of arbitration, Peru's offer to arbitrate has not been accepted; there is no arbitration agreement; and the Tribunal is without any authority whatsoever\u2026** [Emphasis added.]\n\n80.\n\nAt paragraph 53 above, I noted the *Renco I* tribunal's recognition that a defective waiver could be accepted by a respondent (\u2018option (a)'). The tribunal then considered whether it had the power to cure the situation by itself (\u2018option (b)').\n\n81.\n\nIn this respect, the Claimant had directed the tribunal's attention to the *Case of the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions,* a decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice, in support of the proposition that with the waiver amended to remove the offending qualification, it would be open to the tribunal to accept that and carry on the arbitration.68\n\n*Renco I*, Partial Award, \u00b6\u00b6 145-146:  \n145. Renco places reliance upon the decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Case of the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions*. In this case, Greece had commenced proceedings against the United Kingdom under the Treaty of Lausanne before the Treaty had been ratified by the States Parties. The Treaty was subsequently ratified shortly after proceedings were commenced. However, the United Kingdom contended that the Permanent Court lacked jurisdiction at the time when proceedings were commenced.  \n146. The Court rejected the submission of the United Kingdom and held as follows:  \nEven assuming that before that time the Court had no jurisdiction because the international obligation referred to in Article II was not yet effective, it would always have been possible for the applicant to re-submit his application in the same terms after the coming into force of the Treaty of Lausanne, and in that case, the argument in question could not have been advanced. Even if the grounds on which the institution of proceedings was based were defective for the reason stated, this would not be an adequate reason for the dismissal of the applicant's suit. The Court, whose jurisdiction is international, is not bound to attach to matters of form the same degree of importance which they might possess in municipal law. Even, therefore, if the application were premature because the Treaty of Lausanne had not yet been ratified, this circumstance would now be covered by the subsequent deposit of the necessary ratifications.\n\n82.\n\nHowever, the tribunal found it was *not* possible for it to cure the defect, giving two reasons for this. First, it considered (as I do) that Article 10.18 forms a *lex specialis* that precludes resort to general principles of international law that are inconsistent with its terms. The tribunal stated in this regard:\n\n157. the Tribunal is faced with an apparent conflict between the interpretation of Article 10.18 adopted by the United States and Peru and the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice as evidenced in the *Mavrommatis* doctrine. **Having given careful consideration to the matter, the Tribunal has felt constrained to conclude that the clear and express language of** **Article 10.18 of the Treaty, as well as its object and purpose, establishes a** ***lex specialis*** **which must prevail over, or in any event precludes, the** ***Mavrommatis*****doctrine****.** (This conclusion is made by a majority of the Tribunal as one member is not persuaded that Renco could not unilaterally cure its defective waiver.)69 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Renco I*, Partial Award, \u00b6 157.\n\n83.\n\nThis finding is consistent with my view of the *lex specialis* nature of Chapter Ten of the Treaty.70 Just as the *Renco I* tribunal considered that it was not appropriate to look to approaches taken in general international law because of the detailed provisions of the applicable Treaty, I too do not subscribe to the view that it is appropriate to refer to a general principle of international law or to a decision of an international court or tribunal which has decided a limitation issue in the context of a different treaty framework.71\n\nThe same view was expressed by the *Corona Materials* tribunal:  \n188. The DR-CAFTA's \"*Investor-State Dispute Settlement*\" section (Section B) contains the consent of each DR-CAFTA Party to this form of arbitration. Article 10.17, \"*Consent of Each Party to Arbitration*\", provides in relevant part:  \n*\"1. Each Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration under this Section in accordance with this Agreement [\u2026].\" [Emphasis added.]*  \nConsent is thus expressly conditioned on the claimant's submission of the claim in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. In this respect, the invocation of the investor-State arbitration clause is governed by a *lex specialis*.\"  \n(*Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/AF/14/3, Award on the Respondent's Expedited Preliminary Objections in Accordance with Article 10.20.5 of the DR-CAFTA, 31 May 2016 (Fernando Mantilla-Serrano, J. Christopher Thomas, Pierre-Marie Dupuy (President)), \u00b6 188 (**RLA-23**))\n\nMajority Decision, \u00b6 213. The majority's reference to the statement of Umpire Ralston in the *Gentini* Case, for example, that \"the presentation of a claim to competent authority within proper time will interrupt the running of prescription\" does not advance the analysis. I agree that had Renco submitted its first claim in compliance with Article 10.18, it would have interrupted the running of time, but it is a fact, determined by the *Renco I* tribunal, that due to the Claimant's non-compliance with the waiver requirement the tribunal was not competent to hear the claim. Likewise, the majority's references, at paragraphs 214-215, to Article 13 of the *1974 United Nations Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods* and Article 10.5 of the *UNIDROIT Principles on International Commercial Contracts* are similarly inapposite to the interpretation and application of the Treaty which governs this proceeding.\n\n84.\n\nSecond, citing the *Detroit International Bridge* decision, the *Renco I* tribunal found that, as a matter of fundamental logic, the agreement to arbitrate had not been formed and the tribunal therefore did not exist in a juridical sense. If it did not exist, it could not cure the defect:\n\n158. If the Tribunal applied the *Mavrommatis* doctrine, the Tribunal would be exercising powers it simply does not have (because there is no arbitration agreement, and so the Tribunal is not a tribunal). **In effect, it would be creating, retrospectively, an arbitration agreement for the Parties when no agreement had ever come into existence.** **To put it colloquially, the Tribunal would be \"pulling itself up by its own boot-straps\" in order to create jurisdiction when none existed**. In the Tribunal's considered opinion, this would be entirely unprincipled and obviously impermissible.\n\n159. The Tribunal observes that the conclusion it has reached is consistent with the decision in *Detroit International Bridge Company v Canada.* In this case, the claimant's waiver expressly carved out claims pending between the parties in the so-called \"Washington Litigation\". The tribunal found that the claims in the W ashington Litigation covered the same grounds as the measures challenged in the NAFTA arbitration. The claimant's waiver was therefore held to be defective. The claimant then withdrew its claim for damages in the Washington Litigation and filed a second waiver but still purported to carve out the Washington Litigation from the scope of its waiver. The tribunal found that the submission of the new waiver could not:\n\n... retroactively validate several months of proceedings during which the Tribunal wholly lacked jurisdiction but had some kind of potential existence that might have been realized if it had acquired jurisdiction at some subsequent date. **The lack of a valid waiver precluded the existence of a valid agreement between the disputing parties to arbitrate; and the lack of such an agreement deprived the Tribunal of the very basis of its existence**.\n\n160. For all of the reasons set out above, therefore, the Tribunal has concluded that Renco cannot unilaterally cure its defective waiver by withdrawing the reservation of rights. (This conclusion is made by a majority of the Tribunal as one member is not persuaded that Renco could not unilaterally cure its defective waiver.)72 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Renco I*, Partial Award, \u00b6\u00b6 158-160.\n\n85.\n\nI agree with both propositions articulated by *Renco I:* (i) Article 10.18 is a *lex specialis* conditioning and limiting of consent - in my view not only for the waiver provision, but for the limitation period provision as well - and it is not open to a tribunal to use decisions of other courts and tribunals established under other treaties or general rules of international law to attempt to dislodge the plain meaning of that text; and (ii) just as the *Renco I* and the *Detroit International Bridge* tribunals were governed by the Treaty's jurisdictional terms and had no power to vary them, so too is the present Tribunal.\n\n86.\n\nThe States Party to this Treaty included Articles 10.17 and 10.18, and their titles, precisely to give would-be claimants and tribunals textual guidance as to what the Parties considered to be the critical importance of compliance with such conditions.73\n\nI note that at footnote 289 of the Decision, the majority, in connection with its application of Article 31(3)(a) and (b) of the *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*, notes that the Treaty \"expressly allows the Contracting Parties to the Treaty to adopt, through the Free Trade Commission, interpretations that are expressly binding upon the Tribunal.\" It is of course open to the States Party to the Treaty to agree an interpretation at any time.\n\n87.\n\nIn the end, in my respectful opinion, Article 10.18 says what it says and there is simply no warrant for departing from it. It follows that the \"Adjusted Treaty Prescription Date\" which redounds to the Claimant's benefit by lengthening the Tribunal's temporal period further to 13 November 2013 defines the temporal jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Any measure that occurred prior to that date falls outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction."}], "Content": "Decision on Expedited Preliminary Objections\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**GLOSSARY OF DEFINED TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Centromin** | Empresa Minera Del Centro Del Peru S.A. |\n| **Claimant (or Renco)** | The Renco Group, Inc. |\n| **Claimant's Comments on NDP Submission** | Claimant's Comments on the Non-Disputing State Party Submission of the United States of America, dated 20 March 2020 |\n| **Consultation Agreement** | Consultation Agreement, dated 10 November 2016 |\n| **Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections** | Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections dated 21 February 2020 |\n| **DR-CAFTA** | Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement, dated 5 August 2004 |\n| **DRP (or Doe Run)** | Doe Run Peru S.R.LTDA |\n| **DRRC** | Doe Run Resources Corporation |\n| **Facility** | Smelting and refining complex in La Oroya, Peru |\n| **FET** | Fair and equitable treatment |\n| **Framework Agreement** | Framework Agreement, dated 14 March 2017 |\n| **Guaranty Agreement** | Guaranty Agreement executed on 21 November 1997 |\n| **ICSID** | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| **ILC Articles on State Responsibility** | International Law Commission Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts |\n| **INDECOPI** | National Institute for the Defence of Free Competition and the Protection of Intellectual Property |\n| **Memorial on Preliminary Objections** | Respondent's Memorial on Preliminary Objections dated 20 December 2019 |\n| **MEM** | Ministry of Energy and Mines |\n| **Metaloroya** | Empresa Minera Metaloroya La Oroya S.A. |\n| **NDP Submission** | Non-Disputing State Party Submission of the United States of America, dated 7 March 2020 |\n| **NAFTA** | North American Free Trade Agreement, entered into force on 1 January 1994 |\n| **Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim** | Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated 23 October 2018 |\n| **PAMA** | *Programa de Adecuaci\u00f3n y Manejo Ambiental* or Environmental Adjustment and Management Program |\n| **PCA** | Permanent Court of Arbitration |\n| **Procedural Agreement** | Procedural Agreement between The Renco Group, Inc. and the Republic of Peru, dated 10 June 2019 |\n| ***Renco I*** | *The Renco Group v.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant in this arbitration is The Renco Group, Inc. (the \"**Claimant**\" or \"**Renco**\"), a legal entity incorporated under the laws of the State of New York, the United States of America, with its registered office at One Rockefeller Plaza, 29th Floor, New York, NY 10020, U.S.A.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in these proceedings by Mr. Edward Kehoe, Ms. Isabel Fernandez de la Cuesta, Mr. Aloysius Llamzon, Mr. Cedric Soule, and Mr. David Weiss of King & Spalding LLP, 1185 Av. of the Americas, 34th Floor, New York, NY 10036, U.S.A.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Peru (the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**Peru**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in these proceedings by Mr. Jonathan Hamilton, Ms. Andrea Menaker, and Mr. Francisco Jij\u00f3n, of White & Case LLP, 701 Thirteenth Street, NW Washington, D.C. 20005-3807, U.S.A.\n\n5.\n\nA dispute has arisen between the Claimant and Respondent (collectively, the \"**Parties**\") concerning the Claimant's alleged investment in Doe Run Peru S.R.LTDA, a company incorporated under the laws of Peru. According to the Claimant, the Government of Peru breached the Trade Promotion Agreement between the Republic of Peru and the United States of America, dated 12 April 2006, entered into force on 1 February 2009 (hereafter, the \"**Treaty**\"), with respect to the Claimant's investment, causing damages to the Claimant.1 The Respondent denies the Claimant's allegations as to the violations of the Treaty and damages in their entirety.2\n\nNotice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, dated 23 October 2018.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, 20 December 2019, \u00b6 2.\n\n6.\n\nThe merits of such allegations are not the subject of the present decision. This decision addresses certain preliminary matters, namely the Respondent's application of 20 December 2019 that the Tribunal dismiss the Claimant's claims pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty on the basis that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over them.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Commencement of the Arbitration and Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 12 August 2016, the Claimant served upon the Government of the Republic of Peru two notices of its intention to submit a claim to arbitration (the \"**Notices of Intent**\") to bring arbitration proceedings against the Respondent, one under the Treaty and the other containing related claims arising under the Contract of Stock Transfer executed on 23 October 1997 (the \"**Stock Transfer Agreement**\"), and the Guaranty Agreement executed on 21 November 1997 (the \"**Guaranty Agreement**\").\n\n8.\n\nOn 10 November 2016, 90 days following the Respondent's receipt of the two Notices of Intent, the Parties executed a Consultation Agreement. On 14 March 2017, the Parties executed a subsequent Framework Agreement to facilitate the negotiated settlement of the disputes during a specific timeframe. The Framework Agreement was first extended to 31 March 2018 and subsequently extended indefinitely until 10 October 2018 when the Respondent informed the Claimant of its intent to terminate the Agreement.\n\n9.\n\nBy Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated 23 October 2018 (\"**Notice of Arbitration****and Statement of Claim**\"), the Claimant commenced arbitration proceedings against the Respondent, pursuant to Article 10.16 of the Treaty and Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n10.\n\nIn its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, the Claimant appointed Professor Horacio A. Grigera Na\u00f3n as the first arbitrator. Professor Grigera Na\u00f3n's contact details are as follows:\n\n**Professor Horacio A. Grigera Na\u00f3n**  \n5224 Elliott Road  \nBethesda, Maryland 20816  \nUnited States of America\n\n11.\n\nIn its Response to the Notice of Arbitration dated 14 January 2019, the Respondent appointed as arbitrator Mr. J. Christopher Thomas QC, whose contact details are as follows:\n\n**Mr. J. Christopher Thomas QC**  \n1200 Waterfront Centre  \n200 Burrard Street, PO Box 48600  \nVancouver, British Columbia V7X 1T2  \nCanada\n\n12.\n\nOn 10 June 2019, Renco, Doe Run Resources Corporation, Peru, and Activos Mineros S.A.C. executed a Procedural Agreement (the \"**Procedural Agreement**\"), by which the Parties agreed that (i) the instant arbitration would be coordinated with the arbitration brought under the Stock Transfer Agreement and Guaranty Agreement, *The Renco Group, Inc. and Doe Run Resources Corp. v. Republic of Peru and Activos Mineros S.A.C.*, PCA Case No. 2019-47 (\"***Renco III***\" or the \"**Contract Case**\"), (ii) the same tribunal would be constituted to hear both arbitrations, and (iii) both arbitrations would be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (as revised in 2010, with new article 1, paragraph 4, as adopted in 2013) (the \"**UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 17 October 2019, the Parties appointed as presiding arbitrator Judge Bruno Simma, whose contact details are as follows:\n\n**Judge Bruno Simma**  \nIran-United States Claims Tribunal  \nParkweg 13  \n2585 JH The Hague  \nThe Netherlands\n\n14.\n\nOn 3 December 2019, the Parties agreed to the administration of the proceedings by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"**PCA**\").\n\n**B. The Respondent's Preliminary Objections**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nOn 4 December 2019, the Respondent submitted a two-page letter dated 3 December 2019, by which it \"notifie[d] its request for the Tribunal to decide on an expedited basis certain objections that the dispute is not within the Tribunal's competence\", pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty. The Respondent's letter reads in full as follows:\n\nThe Parties to the referenced proceedings have agreed to hold a procedural session on January 14, 2020, with respect to (1) *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru* (the \"Treaty Case\"), and (2) *The Renco Group, Inc. and Doe Run Resources Corp. v. Republic of Peru and Activos Mineros S.A.C.* (the \"Contract Case\") (collectively, the \"Cases\" or the \"Arbitrations\"). The Parties, through counsel, are engaged in discussions related to comprehensive procedural agreements. In this context, Respondents, as applicable, hereby give notice regarding certain objections, and will continue discussions regarding procedural matters, including with respect to such objections.\n\n**A. Treaty Case**\n\nWith respect to the Treaty Case, in its initial Response dated January 14, 2019, although under no obligation to do so and subject to a reservation of rights, Respondent referenced various jurisdictional objections, including without limitation that the claims were precluded because they do not meet temporal requirements. Respondent hereby notifies its request for the Tribunal to decide on an expedited basis certain objections that the dispute is not within the Tribunal's competence, pursuant to the Peru-United States Trade Promotion Agreement (the \"Treaty\").\n\nArticle 10.20.5 of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\nIn the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days.\n\nRespondent's objections directly relate to the Tribunal's competence, which is subject to rigid temporal requirements. Pursuant to Article 10.1.3, \"this Chapter does not bind any Party in relation to any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Agreement.\" Here, the Treaty entered into force on February 1, 2009. In addition, pursuant to Article 10.18.1, \"[n]o claim may be submitted to arbitration under the Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage.\" Here, Claimant filed its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim in the Treaty Case (the \"Treaty Statement of Claim\") on October 23, 2018. The Parties also have entered into certain relevant agreements.1 [FN1: *See, e.g.*, Framework Agreement (as Amended), March 14, 2017 (Doc. R-10).]\n\nTaking into account the foregoing, as Respondent will plead in further detail, Claimant's claims do not meet the Treaty's temporal requirements. As set forth in the Treaty Statement of Claim, the measures that Claimant alleges to have breached the Treaty occurred either before the Treaty's entry into force and Claimant first acquired or should have first acquired, knowledge concerning a breach and loss or damage arising therefrom before the relevant prescription period. To the extent that the Treaty Statement of Claim references allegations that arose after the relevant time period, claims based thereon appear to be impermissible as well for related reasons. To the extent that Claimant argues, despite the Treaty, that Respondent should not be allowed to make such objections, Respondent will address such argument at the appropriate time.\n\n**B. Contract Case**\n\nWith respect to the Contract Case, in the initial Response to the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim in the Contract Arbitration dated January 14, 2019, although under no obligation to do so and subject to a reservation of rights, Respondents referenced deficiencies and set forth certain threshold objections, including without limitation with respect to the relevant parties and scope of the agreement to arbitrate. Respondents seek to be heard on such issue as a preliminary matter in the Contract Case in order to resolve or define the scope of the proceeding.\n\n**C. Procedural Implications**\n\nCounsel to the Parties have been engaged in discussions regarding procedural matters and have agreed to continue such discussions with respect to the foregoing in the days ahead. Respondents will continue to endeavor to advance on procedural matters before the anticipated procedural session. For the avoidance of doubt, Respondents reserve the right to articulate and expand upon the issues set forth herein at the appropriate time in accordance with applicable instruments, laws and rules, and reserve all rights with respect to these proceedings.3\n\nRespondent's Letter to the Tribunal, 3 December 2019 (**C-13**).\n\n16.\n\nOn 6 December 2019, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit its comments in respect of the Respondent's letter.\n\n17.\n\nBy letter dated 10 December 2019, the Claimant asserted that \"Respondent's December 3, 2019 communication does not satisfy the pleading requirements necessary to trigger the application of Article 10.20.5 of the [Treaty]. Accordingly, Claimant respectfully requests that the Tribunal find that Peru has failed to\u2014and can no longer\u2014invoke the expedited review procedure under Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty.\"4 In the alternative, the Claimant proposed a schedule for written submissions and a hearing on the Respondent's preliminary objections.\n\nClaimant's Letter to the Tribunal, 10 December 2019 (**C-14**).\n\n18.\n\nOn 17 December 2019, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to submit a Memorial by 20 December 2019 \"setting forth its Article 10.20.5 objections in full, with all supporting evidence and legal authorities\" and provided the Claimant until 21 February 2020 to submit a Counter-Memorial responding to the Respondent's objections.\n\n19.\n\nOn 20 December 2019, the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty (the \"**Memorial on Preliminary Objections**\").\n\n20.\n\nOn 2 January 2020, the PCA, acting on behalf of the Tribunal, circulated drafts of the Terms of Appointment and Procedural Order No. 1 for the Parties' comments.\n\n21.\n\nOn 10 January 2020, the Parties submitted their joint comments on the Draft Terms of Appointment and Draft Procedural Order No. 1, together with a proposed intermediate timetable to the Tribunal. The Claimant proposed that the Tribunal establish the procedural calendar for the entire arbitration, while the Respondent proposed that the procedural calendar for additional phases, if any, be established following a Hearing on Article 10.20.5 Objections and Bifurcation. The Parties also agreed to the appointment of Dr. Heiner Kahlert as Assistant to the Tribunal.\n\n22.\n\nOn 14 January 2020, a first procedural meeting was held via telephone conference during which the Parties agreed, and the Tribunal confirmed, that the procedural calendar for subsequent phases, if any, would be decided at the conclusion of the initial phase.\n\n23.\n\nOn 19 January 2020, having considered the Parties' comments, the Tribunal circulated revised drafts of the Terms of Appointment and Procedural Order No. 1 to the Parties.\n\n24.\n\nOn 28 January 2020, the Parties submitted their comments on outstanding issues with respect to Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n25.\n\nOn 3 February 2020, the Tribunal issued the Terms of Appointment and Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n26.\n\nOn 21 February 2020, the Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on Article 10.20.5 Objections (the \"**Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections**\").\n\n27.\n\nOn 27 February 2020, following consultation with the Parties as to their availability, the Tribunal set the date of 13 June 2020 for a Hearing on Article 10.20.5 Objections in Washington, D.C.\n\n28.\n\nOn 7 March 2020, the United States of America (the \"**US**\") made a non-disputing State party submission (the \"**NDP Submission**\").\n\n29.\n\nOn 20 March 2020, the Parties each submitted their respective comments on the US non-disputing State party submission (the \"**Respondent's Comments on NDP Submission**\" and the \"**Claimant's Comments on NDP Submission**\", respectively).\n\n**C. Hearing on Preliminary Objections**\n----------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nBy respective letters dated 15 May 2020, the Parties proposed that the Hearing on Preliminary Objections take place by videoconference over two days rather than in person in Washington, D.C.\n\n31.\n\nOn 19 May 2020, the Tribunal confirmed that the Hearing on Preliminary Objections would take place by videoconference on 12-13 June 2020 and circulated a Draft Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the organization of the hearing for the Parties' comments.\n\n32.\n\nBy their respective communications of 28 May, 1 June, and 2 June 2020, the Parties submitted their comments on Draft Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n33.\n\nOn 3 June 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n34.\n\nOn 5 June 2020, a pre-hearing videoconference was held in order to discuss the organization of the Hearing on Preliminary Objections.\n\n35.\n\nThe hearing on Respondent's preliminary objections under Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty (the \"**Hearing on Preliminary Objections**\") was held by videoconference over two days, 12 to 13 June 2020.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. Background of the Dispute**\n--------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe instant dispute arises with respect to Renco's alleged investment in Doe Run Peru S.R.LTDA (**\"DRP**\"), a mining and mineral processing company incorporated under the laws of Peru, which in 1997 acquired a smelting and refining complex in La Oroya, Peru (the \"**Facility**\").5\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 12; Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 13. *See also* Memorandum of Understanding between Peru, Doe Run Peru, Doe Run Cayman Ltd., and Doe Run Cayman Holdings LLC, 27 March 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 1.1-1.3 (**C-41**); Michael Fumento, \"Green Activists Threaten Peruvian Golden Goose\" 18 March 2004 (**C-5**); Hearing Transcript, 12 June 2020, 15:5-8.\n\n38.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Peru decided to privatize the Facility, which at that time was held by State-owned Empresa Minera Del Centro Del Per\u00fa S.A.

(\"**Metaloroya**\"), created to facilitate the privatization of the Facility.10\n\nContract of Stock Transfer executed on 23 October 1997, Clause 5 (**R-1**). *See also* Michael Fumento, \"Green Activists Threaten Peruvian Golden Goose\" 18 March 2004 (**C-5**).\n\nResponse to Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 6; Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 19.\n\nResponse to Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 7. *See also* Memorandum of Understanding between Peru, Doe Run Peru, Doe Run Cayman Ltd., and Doe Run Cayman Holdings LLC, 27 March 2009, \u00b6 1.1 (**C-41**).\n\n40.\n\nOn 10 July 1997, Renco and its affiliate, Doe Run Resources Corporation (\"**DRRC**\"), were awarded a public tender for Metaloroya. To facilitate the acquisition of the Facility, they established DRP and DRP acquired the Facility pursuant to the Stock Transfer Agreement of 23 October 1997 and DRP's subsequent merger with Metaloroya on 30 December 1997.11 The acquisition was predicated on shared, but distinct, responsibilities between DRP and Centromin with respect to the PAMA established to mitigate existing environmental issues associated with the Facility.12\n\nContract of Stock Transfer executed on 23 October 1997 (**R-1**). *See also Renco I*, Witness Statement of Dennis Sadlowski, 19 February 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 20 (**C-42**); Memorandum of Understanding between Peru, Doe Run Peru, Doe Run Cayman Ltd., and Doe Run Cayman Holdings LLC, 27 March 2009, \u00b6 1.1 (**C-41**); Response to Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 7; Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 20.\n\nContract of Stock Transfer executed on 23 October 1997, \u00b6\u00b6 3.1-4.2 (**R-1**). *See also* Response to Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 12; Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 21-23.\n\n41.\n\nOn 19 October 1999,13 10 April 2001,14 25 January 2002,15 and 29 May 2006,16 DRP requested and was granted modifications and extensions with respect to the requirements set out in the PAMA.\n\nDirectorial Resolution No. 17 8-99-EM/DG concerning the amendment of the action and investment schedule of the PAMA dated 19 October 1999.\n\nDirectorial Resolution No. 133-2001-EM-DGAA concerning modifying the PAMA for La Oroya Metallurgical Complex dated 10 April 2001.\n\nDirectorial Resolution No. 28-2002-EM/DGAA.\n\nMinisterial IW.

According to the Claimant, despite this legislation, MEM repeatedly refused to provide an extension for the completion of the final PAMA project, obstructed DRP's ability to secure financing, and launched a \"smear campaign\" against Renco and DRP to damage DRP's reputation and prevent it from security financing.21\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 33-38. In support of its claims that the Government of Peru launched a \"smear campaign\", the Claimant refers to a series of statements made by Peruvian government officials in press releases and public interviews. *See, e.g.*, Terry Wade and Patricia Velez, \"Peru's Garcia says Doe Run license being canceled\" *Reuters*, 28 July 2010 (**C-8**) (in which then-President of Peru Alan Garcia stated that Doe Run Peru \"plays games\" and \"abuses the country\"); \"Peru Cancels Doe Run's operating license\" *Agencia Peruana de Noticias Andina*, 28 July 2010 (**C-9**) (in which then-President Garcia is reported to have said that the Government of Peru would \"not allow a firm to blackmail the country\" in reference to Doe Run Peru).\n\n48.\n\nIn February 2010, DRP's creditors placed DRP into involuntary bankruptcy before Peru's National Institute for the Defence of Free Competition and the Protection of Intellectual Property (\"**INDECOPI**\").22\n\nResponse to Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 19, *referring to, e.g.*, Cormin Notice Regarding Doe Run Peru's Bankruptcy to INDECOPI, 18 February 2010. *See also* Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 39.\n\n49.\n\nOn 16 August 2010, INDECOPI publicly announced the commencement of DRP's bankruptcy, guided by a board of creditors.23\n\nResponse to Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 19.\n\n50.\n\nOn 14 September 2010, MEM asserted a US$ 163 million claim as creditor against DRP on the basis of DRP's \"unfulfilled PAMA investments\".24 The credit claim endowed MEM with one third of all voting rights on the board of creditors.25\n\nResponse to Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 21; Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 39.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 40.\n\n51.\n\nDRP opposed MEM's request to INDECOPI for recognition of its credit against DRP in a challenge brought before INDECOPI.26 Thereafter, DRP filed a constitutional *amparo* suit with the Superior Court of Justice of Lima in 2010, followed by two subsequent appeals in 2011.\n\nResponse to Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 21; Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 42.\n\n52.\n\nIn 2012, DRP filed a contentious administrative action with the Specialized Administrative Contentious Tribunal of Lima and filed a cassation action in 2014.27\n\nResponse to Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 21; Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 43.\n\n53.\n\nIn April 2012, DRP submitted a restructuring plan to the board of creditors, which was subsequently rejected.28 Thereafter, the board voted to place DRP into liquidation, which is ongoing.29\n\nResponse to Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 20.\n\nResponse to Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6 20. *See also* Doe Run Peru S.R.L.

In their Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, Renco and DRP made the following waiver:\n\nFinally, as required by Article 10.18(2) of the Treaty, Renco and its affiliate DRP waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16, except for proceedings for interim entitled to relief, not involving payment of monetary damages, before a judicial or administrative tribunal of Peru. To the extent that the Tribunal may decline to hear any claims asserted herein on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds, Claimants reserve the right to bring such claims in another forum for resolution on the merits.31 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Renco I*, Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, 4 April 2011, \u00b6 78 (**R-12**).\n\n56.\n\nOn 9 August 2011, Renco submitted an Amended Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim in *Renco I*, in which it withdrew DRP as second claimant and made the following waiver in equivalent terms as in its prior Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim:\n\nFinally, as required by Article 10.18(2) of the Treaty, Renco waives its right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16, except for proceedings for interim entitled to relief, not involving payment of monetary damages, before a judicial or administrative tribunal of Peru. To the extent that the Tribunal may decline to hear any claims asserted herein on jurisdictional or admissibility grounds, Claimant reserves the right to bring such claims in another forum for resolution on the merits.32 [Emphasis added.]\n\n*Renco I*, Amended Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, 9 August 2011, \u00b6 67 (**R-12**).\n\n57.\n\nOn 3 October 2014, Peru raised an objection to the *Renco I* tribunal's jurisdiction based on Renco's failure to properly fulfil the waiver requirement established in Article 10.18.2 of the Treaty.33\n\n*Renco I*, Peru's Comments on the Non-Disputing Party Submission, 3 October 2014 (**C-31**); Peru's Submission on Matters Arising from the Hearing on Waiver, 23 September 2015 (**C-38**). *See also* Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 132.\n\n58.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, the tribunal in *Renco I* issued a Partial Award dismissing Renco's claims for lack of jurisdiction on account of the reservation of rights contained in Renco's waiver rendering it non-compliant with the requirements of Article 10.18.2 of the Treaty.34 The tribunal further held as follows:\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that Renco failed to comply with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2) and that it has no power to allow Renco to cure this defect (as noted above, one member of the Tribunal did not join in this conclusion) or to sever the reservation of rights. However, the consequences for Renco may be extreme in the following scenario. If Renco should decide to file a new Notice of Arbitration accompanied by a \"clean\" waiver, Peru may be minded to argue that Renco's claims have become time-barred because more than three years have elapsed since Renco first acquired knowledge of the breaches alleged under Article 10.16(1) of the Treaty.\n\nIn these circumstances, while the possible operation of a 3 year time bar on the facts of this case cannot change the analysis of Article 10.18(2)(b) (i.e. the analysis must be the same, even if the objection had been raised at the outset of the arbitration), the question which arises is whether Peru's conduct with regard to the late raising of its waiver objection rises to the level of an abuse of rights. The test to be applied is whether Peru has sought to raise this objection for an improper motive or \u2014 as Renco puts it, whether Peru is seeking to evade its duty to arbitrate Renco's claims under the Treaty rather than ensure that its waiver rights are respected or that the waiver provision's objectives are served.\n\nHaving considered the issue with great care, the Tribunal has concluded that, in raising its waiver objection, Peru has sought to vindicate its right to receive a waiver which complies with the formal requirement of Article 10.18(2)(b) and a waiver which does not undermine the object and purpose of that Article. In so finding, the Tribunal does not accept the contention that Peru's waiver objection is tainted by an ulterior motive to evade its duty to arbitrate Renco's claims. Indeed, Peru has no duty to arbitrate Renco's claims under the Treaty unless Renco submits a waiver which complies with Article 10.18(2)(b).\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal does not wish to rule out the possibility that an abuse of rights might be found to exist if Peru were to argue in any future proceeding that Renco's claims were now time-barred under Article 10.18(1). To date, Peru has suffered no material prejudice as a result of the reservation of rights in Renco's waiver. However, Renco would suffer material prejudice if Peru were to claim in any subsequent arbitration that Renco's claims were now time-barred under Article 10.18(1).\n\nWhile this Tribunal cannot prevent Peru from exercising in the future what it then considers to be its legal rights, the Tribunal can, and it does, admonish Peru to bear in mind, if that scenario should arise, Renco's submission that Peru's conduct with respect to its late raising of the waiver objection constitutes an abuse of rights. In the unanimous view of the Tribunal, justice would be served if Peru accepted that time stopped running for the purposes of Article 10.18(1) when Renco filed its Amended Notice of Arbitration on August 9, 2011.35\n\n*The Renco Group v.

The Instant Arbitration**\n------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nOn 12 August 2016, while the *Renco I* proceedings were still underway, Renco served Peru with a new Notice of Intent.39\n\nNotice of Intent to Commence Arbitration, 12 August 2016 (**C-10**).\n\n62.\n\nOn 10 November 2016, Renco and Peru entered into a Consultation Agreement, which included a provision that, during the consultation period, the Article 10.18.1 prescription period would be suspended.40\n\nConsultation Agreement, 10 November 2016 (**R-9**).

KEY LEGAL PROVISIONS**\n----------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Treaty was signed on 12 April 2006 and entered into force on 1 February 2009.\n\n66.\n\nArticles 10.20.4, 10.20.5, and 10.20.6 of the Treaty pertain to preliminary objections by respondent parties:\n\n**Article 10.20**\n\n*Conduct of the Arbitration*\n\n[...]\n\n4. Without prejudice to a tribunal's authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, such as an objection that a dispute is not within the tribunal's competence, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.\n\n(a) Such objection shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial (or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment).\n\n(b) On receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor.\n\n(c) In deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant's factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute.\n\n(d) The respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 5.\n\n5. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days.\n\n6. When it decides a respondent's objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant's claim or the respondent's objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.\n\n67.\n\nArticle 10.1.3 establishes a non-retroactivity requirement:\n\n**Article 10.1.3** *Scope and Coverage*\n\n[...]\n\n3. For greater certainty, this Chapter does not bind any Party in relation to any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Agreement.\n\n68.\n\nArticle 10.18 establishes limitations on the Contracting Parties' consent to arbitration, including a temporal prescription:\n\n**Article 10.18**\n\n*Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party*\n\n1. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage.\n\n[...]\n\n69.\n\nPursuant to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"**VCLT**\"),42 the foregoing provisions of the Treaty are to be interpreted as follows:\n\n**Article 28**\n\n*Non-retroactivity of treaties*\n\nUnless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.\n\n[...]\n\n**Article 31**\n\n*General rule of interpretation*\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n**Article 32**\n\n*Supplementary means of interpretation*\n\n1. Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\nPeru is a party to the VCLT. While the US is not, it has recognized since at least 1971 that the Convention is the \"authoritative guide\" to treaty law and practice.

BULL. 684, 685 (1971).\n\n70.\n\nIn addition, the Treaty is to be applied in accordance with the rules set forth in the International Law Commission Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the \"**ILC Articles on State Responsibility**\"), Articles 13 and 14 of which read as follows:\n\n**Article 13**\n\n*International obligation in force for a State*\n\nAn act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs.\n\n**Article 14**\n\n*Extension in time of the breach of an international obligation*\n\n1. The breach of an international obligation by an act of a State not having a continuing character occurs at the moment when the act is performed, even if its effects continue.\n\n2. The breach of an international obligation by an act of a State having a continuing character extends over the entire period during which the act continues and remains not in conformity with the international obligation.\n\n3. The breach of an international obligation requiring a State to prevent a given event occurs when the event occurs and extends over the entire period during which the event continues and remains not in conformity with that obligation.\n\n**V. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Summary of Respondent's Preliminary Objections**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent raises preliminary objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction in accordance with procedures established under Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty, which provides an expedited mechanism for resolving disputes as to a tribunal's competence. The Respondent raises its objections pursuant to Articles 10.1.3 and 10.18.1 of the Treaty, requesting that the Tribunal dismiss these proceedings in their entirety.43\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 2.\n\n72.\n\n**First**, the Respondent raises an objection under Article 10.1.3 (\"Scope and Coverage\") of the Treaty, which precludes any Party from raising claims relating \"to any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of [the Treaty]\".44\n\nTreaty, Art. 10.1.3.\n\n73.\n\n**Secondly**, the Respondent raises an additional objection under Article 10.18.1 (\"Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party\") of the Treaty, which precludes a claimant from raising claims later than three years following \"the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged\" and knowledge that the claimant \"has incurred loss or damage\". In the present case, the Respondent submits that this prescription period bars any claims by the Claimant under the Treaty based on alleged breaches arising before 13 November 2013, even if construed \"in the manner most favorable to Claimant\".45\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 42.\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant raises its claims in violation of the aforementioned Treaty provisions, contending that, in its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, the Claimant has alleged only facts which predate the entry into force of the Treaty or the earliest dates for which claims would not be prescribed. Consequently, the Respondent argues that all three of the Claimant's claims violate the Treaty's temporal requirements and should be dismissed.46\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 21.\n\n75.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent submits that the Claimant failed to adhere to Treaty requirements in *Renco I*, resulting in its dismissal, and is not entitled, in the present proceedings, \"to benefit from its improper submission of claims [in *Renco I*] to improperly extend the prescription period\".47\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 2.\n\n**B. Respondent's Request for Relief**\n--------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nIn its Memorial on Preliminary Objections, Respondent requests that the Tribunal find that \"Renco has [...] violated the Treaty and failed to establish the requirements for Peru's consent to arbitrate under the Treaty\" and \"render an award dismissing Renco's claims, with an award of costs in favor of Peru, and such further and other relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.\"48\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 106-107.\n\n**C. Summary of Claimant's Position on Respondent's Preliminary Objections**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's preliminary objections in their entirety.\n\n78.\n\n**First**, the Claimant contends that the Respondent failed to properly invoke the expedited review procedure available under Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty. The Claimant advances that \"Article 10.20.5 requires a respondent to make and brief its objections within 45 days of the tribunal's constitution\" and that this deadline fell on 3 December 2019.49 According to the Claimant, the Respondent's 3 December 2019 Letter to the Tribunal was insufficient to trigger the expedited review mechanism as it provided only a \"vague and unclear\" notice of intent to raise \"certain objections\" and was \"devoid of any factual bases or legal analysis\".50 Consequently, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's objections are inadmissible.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 3.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 3, *referring to* Respondent Letter to the Tribunal, 3 December 2019 (**C-13**).\n\n79.\n\n**Secondly**, the Claimant advances that the Respondent's objections arising under Article 10.1.3, that the Claimant's claims are \"deeply rooted\" in facts and acts predating the entry into force of the Treaty and therefore fall outside of this Tribunal's jurisdiction, are meritless.51 The Claimant contends that each of its claims arises out of facts and events that occurred during or after March 2009 and therefore do not violate the non-retroactivity principle.52\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 4.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 5.\n\n80.\n\n**Thirdly**, the Claimant contends that the Respondent's objections that the Claimant's claims are time-barred by the three-year prescription period under Article 10.18.1 lack merit. The Claimant notes that the text of the Article is silent on whether the pendency of timely arbitration proceedings suspends the time limitation period with respect to any later resubmission to arbitration following a dismissal without prejudice. However, according to the Claimant, a \"good faith interpretation\" of the Article in accordance with principles of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties \"leads to the undeniable conclusion that the three year limitations period under Article 10.18.1 was suspended during the pendency of the *Renco I* arbitration\".53\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 7.\n\n81.\n\n**Fourthly**, the Claimant argues, in the alternative, that the Respondent is not entitled to rely on its Article 10.18.1 objections because, in light of its conduct in *Renco I*, its objections constitute an \"abuse of rights\".54 The Claimant emphasizes that, despite multiple opportunities to raise its waiver objection throughout the proceedings, Peru waited three and a half years to raise this objection. The Claimant further points out that the *Renco I* tribunal unanimously condemned this conduct as prejudicial to the Claimant should the Respondent proceed to raise a prescription defence in subsequent arbitration proceedings.55\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 8.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.\n\n82.\n\n**Finally**, the Claimant advances that its denial of justice claim is not time-barred. According to the Claimant, it is \"well settled that a denial of justice claim arises when local remedies are exhausted\".56 Therefore, the Claimant submits that the breach underpinning the claim did not occur until 3 November 2015, within three years of the initiation of this arbitration, when the Supreme Court of Peru denied DRP's appeal with respect to its claims that the Ministry of Energy and Mines asserted an improper US$ 163 million credit against DRP when it entered bankruptcy.57\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 11.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 11.\n\n**D. Claimant's Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, Claimants request that the Tribunal render an interim award ordering the following relief:\n\n1. Declare that Peru's 10.20.5 objections are not admissible, and permit Renco to submit its full Memorial in this case\n\n2. In the alternative, deny Peru's 10.20.5 objections, and permit Renco to submit its full Memorial in this case.\n\n3. In all cases, order Peru to pay for Renco's costs in connection with this phase of the proceeding, including legal fees.58\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 180.\n\n**VI. THE NON-DISPUTING PARTY SUBMISSION**\n------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nOn 7 March 2020, the US, as a non-disputing State party to the Treaty, made a written submission pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the Treaty. The US notes that it does not take a position on how its interpretation of the relevant Treaty provisions applies to the facts of this case and that \"no inference should be drawn from the absence of comment on any issue not addressed\".59\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\n85.\n\n**First**, the US proffers its interpretation of Article 10.18.1, according to which the limitation period within which a claimant must bring a claim is three years after the date on which \"claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach\".60\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 3.\n\n86.\n\nThe US avers that the Claimant bears the burden of proof to establish jurisdiction and must present relevant facts to establish that each of its claims falls within the three-year period.61 Additionally, the US describes this limitation period as \"clear and rigid\", not to be modified by any \"suspension, prolongation or other qualification\", and that the knowledge that triggers the limitation period can only occur on a single date, when the breach first occurs.62\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 3.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 4.\n\n87.\n\nThe US defines knowledge of \"incurred loss or damage\" to mean knowledge of the existence of such loss or damage, even if it cannot be quantified until a later date, and \"incur\" to mean \"to become liable or subject to\", which includes losses or damages that are not immediate.63\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 5.\n\n88.\n\nThe US defines \"breach\" as an act of a State \"not in conformity with what is required of it by that obligation\", and because responsibility of a State cannot be invoked for non-final judicial acts unless domestic remedies are \"obviously futile or manifestly ineffective\" then \"non-final judicial acts have not ripened into the type of final act that is sufficiently definite to implicate state responsibility\".64 As such, the US submits that the three-year limitation period does not begin to run until the date the \"claimant acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge that either the breach has occurred\u2014 *i.e.*, when all available domestic remedies have been exhausted, unless obviously futile or manifestly ineffective\u2014or the claimant or enterprise has incurred loss or damage, whichever is later.\"65\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 6.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 7.\n\n89.\n\n**Secondly**, in relation to non-retroactivity under Article 10.1.3 of the Treaty, the US states that a State's conduct prior to entry into force of the Treaty may be relevant to determining if said State breached an obligation, but that there must exist conduct after the date of entry into force that itself constitutes a breach.66 Pre-entry into force conduct alone, even if left unremedied, does not suffice.67\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 9.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL'S REASONING**\n---------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed all of the arguments and evidence presented by the Parties during the preliminary phase of these proceedings. Although the Tribunal may not address all such arguments and evidence in full detail in its reasoning below, the Tribunal has nevertheless considered and taken them into account in arriving at its decision.\n\n**A. The Sufficiency of Respondent's Submissions to Trigger the Article 10.20.5 Expedited Review Mechanism**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nArticle 10.20.5 of the Treaty provides that a respondent wishing to exercise the expedited review mechanism must so request no later than 45 days after the constitution of the tribunal.\n\n92.\n\nOn 19 October 2019, Judge Simma accepted his appointment as President of the Tribunal and the Tribunal was fully constituted,68 triggering the Article 10.20.5 time limits.69\n\n*See* Email from Judge Simma, 19 October 2019 (**C-12**).\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 50.\n\n93.\n\nOn 3 December 2019, forty-five days following Judge Simma's appointment as President of the Tribunal, the Respondent sent a letter to the Tribunal in which it gave \"notice regarding certain objections\".70\n\nRespondent's Letter to the Tribunal, 3 December 2019 (**C-13**).\n\n94.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent's 3 December 2019 letter to the Tribunal failed to satisfy the requirements to trigger the Article 10.20.5 expedited review mechanism as the Respondent did not provide the necessary factual bases or legal analysis to invoke this review procedure until it submitted its Memorial on Preliminary Objection on 20 December 2019.71 On the other hand, the Respondent argues that its \"notice\" was all that was required to trigger the Article 10.20.5 expedited review mechanism.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 50.\n\n**1. Claimant's position**\n--------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent's 3 December 2019 letter failed to trigger the expedited review mechanism, because it failed to clearly articulate its objections and their legal bases.72 Rather, according to the Claimant, the Respondent's letter provided only \"vague notice of objections\".73 The Claimant contends that, as a result of this failure, the Respondent is unable now to avail itself of this expedited review procedure.74\n\nHearing Transcript, 12 June 2020, 127:9-22; Hearing Transcript 13 June 2020, 190:2-5.\n\nClaimant's Letter to the Tribunal, 10 December 2019, p. 2 (**C-14**).\n\nClaimant's Letter to the Tribunal, 10 December 2019, p. 1 (**C-14**).\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent mischaracterizes the Claimant's position and clarifies that it does not argue that, in order to trigger the Article 10.20.5 mechanism, the Respondent was required to submit a full Memorial, but rather that the Respondent failed to meet even the lower bar required for a \"request\" for such proceedings.75 To this end, the Claimant emphasizes that the Respondent's 3 December 2019 letter \"giv[ing] notice regarding certain objections\" did not constitute a \"request\" to trigger the expedited review mechanism under Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty.76\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 51.\n\nRespondent's Letter to the Tribunal, 3 December 2019 (**C-13**).\n\n97.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, according to an interpretation of Article 10.20.5 \"in good faith and in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms, in the context of the Treaty as a whole\",77 the Respondent was required to make a request that clearly articulated and briefed its objections.78 The Claimant notes that the provision \"does not establish a procedure by which the respondent may give notice of an objection before submitting it to the tribunal\", but rather requires the Respondent to issue its request for expedited review of its objections within a narrow time limit of 45 days, upon which the Tribunal is thereafter required to issue a decision within 150 days.79\n\nClaimant's Letter to the Tribunal, 10 December 2019, p. 2 (**C-14**). *See also* Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 51.\n\n*See* Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 97.\n\nClaimant's Letter to the Tribunal, 10 December 2019, p. 2 (**C-14**). *See also* Hearing Transcript, 12 June 2020, 127:24-128:9.\n\n98.\n\nRelying on the finding in *Feldman v. Mexico*, the Claimant argues that \"delivery of a notice of intent to submit a claim to arbitration does not satisfy the requirement of having to 'make a claim'.\"80 The Claimant rejects the Respondent's contention that there exists a fundamental difference between initiating an arbitration and issuing an objection in an already initiated arbitration. According to the Claimant, in either event, a Party raising an objection must provide a basis for the objection it submits.81 The Claimant further notes that, when the Respondent has previously filed objections under expedited review mechanisms analogous to the Article 10.20.5 mechanism, it briefed its objections clearly and within the limitation period, as required.82 The Claimant notes that the US NDP Submission did not contradict this interpretation of Article 10.20.5.83\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 52, *referring to Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v*. *United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Submission of the United States of America on Preliminary Issues, 6 October 2000, \u00b6 14 (**CLA-1**).\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 52.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 53.\n\nClaimant's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n\n99.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant contends that it would be \"severely prejudiced\" should the Respondent be able to trigger the expedited review \"without actually submitting its objections to the tribunal for decision\" as the Article requirements already shorten the amount of time within which the Claimant must respond to the Respondent's objections and the Tribunal must issue its decision -a total of 150 days from the Respondent's request.84 The Claimant argues that the drafters of the Treaty would not have \"intended to give the respondent such an unfair procedural advantage\" in a review mechanism that may result in the dismissal of the Claimant's entire case.85\n\nClaimant's Letter to the Tribunal, 10 December 2019, p. 2 (**C-14**).\n\nClaimant's Letter to the Tribunal, 10 December 2019, p. 3 (**C-14**).\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimant proffers that it was not until the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Preliminary Objections on 20 December 2019, more than two weeks following the expiry of the limitation period, that it fully presented its objections.86 The Claimant additionally notes that the Respondent had more than one year to prepare an adequate submission to trigger the Article 10.20.5 procedure, since the Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim on 23 October 2018.87\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 50.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 54.\n\n101.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that the object and purpose of Article 10.20.5 supports its interpretation of the provision's language. Referring to *Jin Hae Seo v. Republic of Korea*, the Claimant notes that the US explained that clauses identical to Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty were included in all of its recent trade agreements in order \"to efficiently and cost-effectively address certain preliminary objections\".88 The Claimant submits that the object and purpose of the provision therefore supports the requirement that the Respondent \"is meant to submit and fully brief all of its objections within the 45-day deadline\".89\n\nClaimant's Letter to the Tribunal, 10 December 2019, p. 3 (**C-14**).\n\nClaimant's Letter to the Tribunal, 10 December 2019, p. 3 (**C-14**). The Claimant further highlights that in a number of cases within which the expedited review mechanism, identical to that available under the Treaty, was exercised, the respondents in those cases fully briefed all of their objections within the 45-day deadline. *See* Claimant's Letter to the Tribunal, 10 December 2019, p. 3 (**C-14**), *referring to* *Jin Hae Seo v.

Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n102.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, in its 3 December 2019 letter to the Tribunal, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal decide on its preliminary objections in accordance with the expedited review procedure available under Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty.90 According to the Respondent, the language of the provision requires only that the Respondent submit a \"request\" within the prescribed period in order to invoke the expedited review mechanism. The Respondent submits that the language in its 3 December 2019 letter to the Tribunal clearly indicates that it was issuing such a request, stating that \"Respondent hereby notifies its request for the Tribunal to decide on an expedited basis certain objections that the dispute is not within the Tribunal's competence\".91\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 93.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 96, *citing* Respondent's Letter to the Tribunal, 3 December 2019 (**C-13**).\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant errs in arguing that the Respondent is required to submit a full brief in the first instance in order to trigger Article 10.20.5 procedures. According to the Respondent, no language indicating that a full brief is required is present in the Treaty text.92\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 97.\n\n104.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the *RDC v. Guatemala* case, upon which the Claimant relies, actually cuts in favour of the Respondent, as in that case Guatemala successfully initiated expedited review of its preliminary objections by first filing a three-page letter containing its request and submitting a full brief thereafter.93 The Respondent further contends that the Claimant improperly relies on *Feldman v. Mexico*, which is inapposite to the present dispute as its holding relates to requirements for submitting claims, not to requirements for submitting objections pursuant to an expedited procedure.94 In this connection, the Respondent considers it noteworthy that the US maintained its silence in its NDP Submission on the question of the sufficiency of the Respondent's submission to trigger the Article 10.20.5 expedited review mechanism, including with respect to the relevance of the *Feldman v. Mexico* tribunal under the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"**NAFTA**\").95\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 101, *referring to Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Letter from Guatemala to ICSID, 29 May 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3 (**RLA-12**).\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 102.\n\nRespondent's Comments, \u00b6\u00b6 107-108.\n\n105.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that it is irrelevant that Peru has had \"more than a year\" to prepare a submission on its preliminary objections, as the Treaty sets the relevant timeframe based on the date of the Tribunal's constitution and not on the date on which the Claimant issued its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim.96 The Respondent submits that the Claimant's objections are not aimed at efficiency or cost-effectiveness but rather represent an attempt to \"prolong the pacing of objections for its own tactical purposes\".97\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 99.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 94, 103.\n\n106.\n\nConsequently, the Respondent argues that it properly raised its Article 10.20.5 objections, and the Tribunal has the authority to decide on these objections.98\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 104.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of the Parties' contentions regarding the admissibility of the Respondent's objections under Article 10.20.5 of the Treaty. The Treaty's terms require a \"request [that] the tribunal [...] decide on an expedited basis [...] any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal's competence.\" The Treaty also imposes a deadline for the Tribunal to \"issue a decision or award on the objection(s)\" counted in \"days after the date of the request.\"\n\n108.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, and as accepted by the Claimant, a \"request\" under this provision need not be equated to a full \"memorial\" on the objections to be decided. However, the Claimant also argues\u2014and the Tribunal concurs\u2014that mere \"notice\" does not constitute a \"request\" under this article, either. Naturally, a request to decide an objection must state the objection to be decided.\n\n109.\n\nThe question is nevertheless where in this spectrum the Respondent's 3 December 2019 letter falls. Beyond excerpting Articles 10.20.5, 10.1.3, and 10.1.8 of the Treaty and noting the 1 February 2009 date of the Treaty's entry into force, the elaboration of the Respondent's objections is limited to the following five sentences:\n\nHere, Claimant filed its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim in the Treaty Case (the \"Treaty Statement of Claim\") on October 23, 2018. The Parties also have entered into certain relevant agreements.1 [FN1: See, e.g., Framework Agreement (as Amended), March 14, 2017 (Doc. R-10).] [...] Claimant\u2019s claims do not meet the Treaty's temporal requirements. As set forth in the Treaty Statement of Claim, the measures that Claimant alleges to have breached the Treaty occurred either before the Treaty's entry into force and Claimant first acquired or should have first acquired, knowledge concerning a breach and loss or damage arising therefrom before the relevant prescription period. To the extent that the Treaty Statement of Claim references allegations that arose after the relevant time period, claims based thereon appear to be impermissible as well for related reasons.\n\n110.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, it is clear that the Respondent's letter did not comport with existing practice under this type of provision in other treaties based on the same model. Nor does it fit well with the expedited nature of the process which follows.\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal need not decide, however, whether prior practice under this provision accurately reflects the required content for a \"request\" to be admissible. Given the context surrounding the Respondent's letter, and in particular the prior proceedings in *Renco I*, the Claimant cannot reasonably plead ignorance of the nature and content of the objections that were being submitted for expedited determination under Article 10.20.5. In any event, the Tribunal has decided to dismiss the Respondent's objections on their substance, such that no ruling on the admissibility of the objections is ultimately required.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Preliminary Objections to the Tribunal's Jurisdiction Pursuant to the Treaty's Temporal Requirements**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nAccording to Article 10.1.3 of the Treaty, it \"does not bind any Party in relation to any act or fact that took place before the date of entry into force\" and therefore, the Treaty may not be applied retroactively.99\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 2; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 55-56. *See also* Hearing Transcript, 12 June 2020, 24:2-12.\n\n113.\n\nArticle 10.18.1 of the Treaty additionally proscribes the submission of claims to arbitration following three years after a claimant acquired, or ought to have acquired knowledge, of the respondent's alleged breach and the existence of loss or damage resulting from such breach.100\n\nHearing Transcript, 12 June 2020, 24:15-20.\n\n114.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant's fair and equitable treatment (**\"FET**\") and indirect expropriation claims arise out of alleged facts and events that predate the Treaty's entry into force.101 In addition, the Respondent submits that, in initiating the present arbitration on 23 October 2018, the Claimant has failed to abide by the Treaty's three-year prescription period, which began either on 23 October 2015 or, if \"adjusted in the manner most favourable to the Claimant\", on 13 November 2013.102 Consequently, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's claims are time-barred under both Articles 10.1.3 and 10.18.1 of the Treaty, resulting in \"the concomitant lack of jurisdiction of the tribunal\".103 The Respondent contends that it is incumbent upon the Claimant to prove \"that it has complied with all requirements for submitting a claim under the Treaty\" and that the Claimant has failed to meet this burden as to the Treaty's temporal requirements.104\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 2.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 2.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 22, *quoting Renco I*, Second Non-Disputing Party Submission of the United States, 1 September 2015 (**R-12**), \u00b6 15.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 24. The Respondent further submits that the Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim fails to provide sufficient evidence of its compliance with the Treaty's temporal requirements, and the Claimant cannot now, as it has signaled it intends to do, submit a more comprehensive factual account of its case in order to cure these defects. The Respondent points out that the Claimant was not required but chose to designate its original submission as a \"Notice of Arbitration *and* Statement of Claim\" which under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Article 20(2), \"shall include\" a statement of facts in support of a claimant's claim, and \"should, as far as possible, be accompanied by all documents and other evidence relied upon by the claimant, or contain references to them. Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 40, *quoting* UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2013, Art. 20(2).\n\n115.\n\nFor its part, the Claimant first submits that all of its claims arise out of facts or events that arose after the Treaty entered into force.105 The Claimant also notes that it submitted its FET and indirect expropriation claims in *Renco I* within three years of first becoming aware of the Respondent's breaches of the Treaty and argues that, upon initiating the first arbitration proceedings, the limitation period was suspended, \"such that Claimant's resubmission of its FET and indirect expropriation claims in *this* arbitration also is timely\".106 The Claimant contends that its denial of justice claim is also timely because the Supreme Court of Peru rendered its decision on DRP's appeal on 3 November 2015, within three years of the Claimant's initiation of the present arbitration on 23 October 2018.107 Thus, the Claimant argues that all of its claims satisfy the temporal requirements prescribed by the Treaty and are therefore within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.108\n\nHearing Transcript, 12 June 2020, 106:19-22.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 76 [emphasis in original].\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 78.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 55.\n\n**1.

Schwebel, Ninian Stephen (President)), \u00b6 70 (**RLA-8**).\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the tribunal in *Berkowitz v. Costa Rica*,111 applying an identical provision under the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (\"**DR-CAFTA**\"), held that the non-retroactivity rule enshrined in Article 10.1.3 equally applies to \"later measures that are so intertwined with pre-Treaty acts and facts that they cannot be detached and adjudicated independently\".112 The Respondent notes that, similar to the circumstances from which the present dispute arises, the tribunal in *Berkowitz v. Costa Rica* declined to extend its jurisdiction to breaches occurring after the DR-CAFTA's entry into force because it found that these breaches were enacted in accordance with a regulatory regime\n\nimplemented by Costa Rica prior to the treaty's adoption.113 The Respondent notes that, although the US kept its silence on whether the Claimant's claims violated the non-retroactivity requirement found in the Treaty, the US approvingly cited *Berkowitz v. Costa Rica* for the same standard which underpins its own arguments on the issue.114\n\n*Berkowitz (formerly Spence International Investments and others) v.

In light of the foregoing considerations, the Respondent submits that this Tribunal's jurisdiction does not extend over alleged breaches occurring prior to this date or such breaches occurring thereafter that are \"rooted in, and not independently actionable from the earlier alleged acts or facts\".115\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 29. *See also* Hearing Transcript, 12 June 2020, 33:15-34:1.\n\n120.\n\nTo this end, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's FET claim116 and indirect expropriation claim are time-barred as they are \"predicated on a dispute on DRP's compliance with its environmental obligations that predates the entry into force of the Treaty, and Renco has not alleged any measures in this regard later than 2009\".117 The Respondent contends that these claims were time-barred during the *Renco I* arbitration as well as in the present proceedings.118\n\nSpecifically, that Per\u00fa breached the Treaty by imposing additional environmental regulations on the DRP, requiring it to spend increased time and financial resources, but simultaneously denying sufficient extra time to comply.

The Respondent emphasizes that the Claimant's articulation of its FET and indirect expropriation claims in its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim \"is practically identical\" to that which it presented in its Statement of Claim in *Renco I*, dated 9 August 2011 (**C-16**). *See also* Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 59.\n\n(1) The Claimant's FET claim\n----------------------------\n\n121.\n\n**First**, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's FET claims that are predicated on facts or events which occurred prior to the Treaty's entry into force are automatically time-barred.\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the majority of the Claimant's Statement of Facts section of its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim presents facts and events which occurred prior to 1 February 2009.119 The Respondent highlights the following relevant facts as presented in the Claimant's Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, all of which took place prior to the entry into force of the Treaty:120\n\n- \"Early 1970s - Early 1990s\" : the Peruvian Government's operation of \"One of the Most Polluted Smelter Sites in the World.\"121\n\n- \"Early 1990s\" and \"[in] 1994\" : lack of interest in the Facility due to environmental concerns.122\n\n- In 1996, 1996, and 1997 : Peru's alleged commitment to developing the PAMA for the facility.123\n\n- From 1999 to 2003 : following DRP's acquisition of the facility, the ensuing challenges to compliance with increasing environmental obligations imposed by MEM.124\n\n- From 2003 to 2005 and in 2006 : following DRP's realization that in the development of the Facility and sulfuric acid plants that significant additional work would be required to conform to environmental regulations, and the company's subsequent request for a five-year extension to complete the PAMA, MEM's grant of just under three years-extension and imposition of 14 new required projects.125\n\n- By January 2007, January 2008, and December 2007 : DRP's completion of all but one PAMA project.126\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 43.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6

\u00b6\u00b6 36-37.\n\n123.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent avers that the Claimant's FET claims that are predicated on allegations regarding MEM's imposition of new environmental obligations on DRP must be time-barred because these events occurred between 1999 and 2002.127 Additionally, the Respondent emphasizes that any alleged breach by the Respondent with respect to MEM's grant of a PAMA extension in 2006 or DRP's efforts to comply with its environmental obligations by 2007 cannot be arbitrated in the present proceedings.128\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 61.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 51.\n\n124.\n\n**Secondly**, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's FET claims based on allegations of fact occurring after the Treaty's entry into force are also time-barred as they arise out of a dispute that predates the adoption of the Treaty and are \"rooted in, and not independently actionable from the earlier alleged acts or facts\".129\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 29.\n\n125.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's remaining FET claims are based on (i) allegations regarding MEM's denial of an additional extension and (ii) allegations regarding the public comments of Peruvian government officials disparaging DRP.130\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 61-64.\n\n126.\n\nIn respect of the first set of allegations, the Respondent notes that, upon failing to complete the final PAMA project, DRP requested a second extension on 5 March 2009, which the Claimant claims was unreasonably rejected by MEM in May 2009.131 The Respondent additionally notes that the Claimant argues that, despite that in September 2009 the Congress of Peru passed legislation permitting such an extension, the Government of Peru undermined the benefits of this law by passing additional onerous regulations.132\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 62, *referring to* Notice of

respect to the second set of allegations, the Respondent notes that the Claimant claims that Peruvian government officials breached the Treaty FET standard by issuing disparaging public statements in May 2009, July 2010, and August 2010, allegedly made to discredit DRP vis-\u00e0-vis its creditors.133\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 64, *referring to* Notice of Arbitration and

the 2009 PAMA extension and public statements by officials are intrinsically linked to Peru's efforts of more than a decade to enforce DRP's compliance with the obligations it acquired in 1997\".134 Consequently, according to the Respondent, while the above set of facts occurred after the entry into force of the Treaty, they each \"have deep roots in the pre-entry conduct\" and are time-barred.135\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 66.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\n(2) Claimant's claims of indirect expropriation\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's claim of indirect expropriation is also time-barred by Article 10.1.3 as \"[t]he facts alleged by Renco relevant to this claim predate or are deeply rooted in facts that predate the Treaty's entry into force\".136\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 69.\n\n130.\n\n**First**, according to the Respondent, the Claimant contends that the Government of Peru breached the Treaty's protections by imposing increasingly onerous environmental obligations on DRP, while concurrently failing to provide DRP with reasonable extensions to fulfil these obligations or otherwise impeded the completion of these tasks when extensions were granted, by disparaging DRP's reputation and frustrating its efforts to obtain financing.137 The Respondent submits that the Claimant applies the same factual support for these claims as it employed with respect to its FET claim.138 Consequently, the Respondent argues that this claim of breach is time-barred for the same reasons articulated above.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 70, *citing* Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, \u00b6 68.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 70.\n\n131.\n\n**Secondly**, the Respondent notes that the Claimant asserts that Peru violated the Treaty's protections against indirect expropriation by \"assert[ing] large and baseless credits that gave it unjustified, creditor voting rights in DRP's bankruptcy proceeding\" so that it might impede DRP's reasonable restructuring efforts, force the company to liquidate, and divest Renco of \"control of its investment, indirect ownership of its investment's assets, and the entire economic value of its investment in Peru\".139 The Respondent argues that, because the Claimant alleges that DRP filed for bankruptcy due to the alleged unfair treatment it suffered from Peru, the basis for its indirect expropriation claims in respect of DRP's bankruptcy are \"deeply rooted in pre-entry into force conduct\" and are thus time-barred for the same reasons articulated above.140\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 71, *citing* Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, \u00b6 68.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 73.\n\n***b) Claimant's position***\n----------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimant argues that its claims in the present arbitration arise out of breaches by the Respondent that occurred after the Treaty entered into force.\n\n133.\n\n**First**, the Claimant contends that its FET claim that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the Treaty \"is based on Respondent's refusals, starting on March 10, 2009 (after the Treaty came into effect), to grant contractually required PAMA extensions to DRP, and Peru's actions thereafter; as well as Peru's ensuing disparaging public campaign against Claimant and DRP\".141\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 57.\n\n134.\n\n**Secondly**, the Claimant advances that its indirect expropriation claims that the Respondent breached Article 10.7 of the Treaty are based on the Respondent's actions with respect to DRP's bankruptcy proceedings, all of which took place in 2012, after the entry into force of the Treaty.142\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 58.\n\n135.\n\n**Thirdly**, the Claimant challenges the Respondent's argument that the facts underpinning the Claimant's claims that arose after the entry into force of the Treaty are \"deeply rooted\" in Peru's conduct and policies that predate the Treaty and that, for this reason, Claimant's claims are time-barred pursuant to Article 10.1.3.143 The Claimant notes that the US NDP Submission supports the Claimant's position that the Tribunal may consider facts prior to the Treaty's entry into force to determine whether the Respondent committed a breach at a point after the Treaty entered into force.144\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 60.\n\nClaimant's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.\n\n136.\n\nThe Claimant points out that it bases its claims solely on Peru's conduct occurring on or after 10 March 2009, a full month after the Treaty's entry into force. The Claimant emphasizes that while DRP agreed to assume additional PAMA-imposed obligations and while MEM only partially granted DRP's extension request in May 2006, the Claimant does not consider these facts to constitute wrongful conduct by Peru.145 According to the Claimant, the Respondent's violations of the Treaty began on 10 March 2009, when Peru rejected DRP's request for an extension to complete the final PAMA project and began a campaign to disparage and inequitably treat DRP and the Claimant.146\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 61.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 62.\n\n137.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Interim Award in *Berkowitz v. Costa Rica*, upon which the Respondent exclusively relies, is inapposite, as in that case the claimant sought to apply processes mandated by DR-CAFTA for providing compensation to the claimant for expropriations which had taken place before the treaty entered into force.147 The Claimant submits that, in *Berkowitz v. Costa Rica*, the tribunal distinguished between completed acts with lingering effects (not protected by the treaty) and continuing wrongful acts (which do receive protection), when it found that the compensation question was not \"separable from the measures of direct expropriation\" that had taken place prior to the treaty's entry into force and therefore constituted the lingering effects of a completed act.148\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 64, *referring to Berkowitz (formerly Spence International Investments and others) v.

However, as pointed out by the US in its NDP Submission, the opening phrase \"[f]or greater certainty\" serves to clarify that the provision does not purport to be a *lex specialis* : it stipulates a rule that the contracting parties to the Treaty already understood to be applicable. That general rule of non-retroactivity of treaties is found in Article 28 of the VCLT, which provides in almost identical fashion:\n\nUnless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.\n\n141.\n\nArticle 28 of the VCLT must also be read in conjunction with Articles 13 and 14(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which read as follows:\n\nAn act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs.\n\n[...]\n\nThe breach of an international obligation by an act of a State not having a continuing character occurs at the moment when the act is performed, even if its effects continue.\n\n142.\n\nThe foregoing provisions reflect the general principle that the lawfulness of State conduct must be assessed contemporaneously with that conduct. Since a State is not bound by a conventional obligation it has assumed under a treaty until such treaty enters into force, that treaty obligation cannot be breached until the treaty giving rise to that obligation has come into force.\n\n143.\n\nIn this case, the Treaty entered into force on 1 February 2009. Therefore, the Treaty cannot be applied to acts or facts that took place before 1 February 2009.\n\n144.\n\nThis much is uncontroversial between the Parties. However, the Respondent, referring to the application of non-retroactivity to dismiss the claim in *Berkowitz*, appears to extrapolate a further subsidiary rule that, in order not to run afoul of the rule on non-retroactivity, acts or facts which are relied upon by the Claimant to establish a breach of the Treaty arising after the entry into force of the Treaty also must not be \"so deeply rooted in pre-entry into force conduct as not to be meaningfully separable from that conduct.\"152\n\nHearing Transcript, 12 June 2020, 24:2-12, 26:19, 33:2-35:4, 45:14-25; Hearing Transcript, 13 June 2020, 157:21-158:5; Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 28-29, 58, 69, 73; Respondent's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20, 26, 31-32, 36, 44, c *iting Berkowitz (formerly Spence International Investments and others) v.

Vinuesa, Daniel Bethlehem (President)), \u00b6 269 (**RLA-26**).\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal does not understand the tribunal in *Berkowitz* to purport to modify or supplement the applicable test for non-retroactivity of treaties, notwithstanding its frequent use of the apposite but imprecise phrase \"deeply rooted\".153 Rather, the *Berkowitz* tribunal154\u2014just as almost every other pertinent decision cited by the Parties and the US155\u2014affirms and relies on the authoritative restatement of the law made by the *Mondev* tribunal, which this Tribunal equally endorses and adopts:\n\nThe basic principle is that a State can only be internationally responsible for breach of a treaty obligation if the obligation is in force for that State at the time of the alleged breach. The principle is stated both in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and in the ILC's Articles on State Responsibility, and has been repeatedly affirmed by international tribunals. There is nothing in NAFTA to the contrary. Indeed Note 39 to NAFTA confirms the position in providing that \"this Chapter covers investments existing on the date of entry into force of this Agreement as well as investments made or acquired thereafter\". Thus, as the *Feldman* Tribunal held, conduct committed before 1 January 1994 cannot itself constitute a breach of NAFTA.\n\nOn the other hand, it does not follow that events prior to the entry into force of NAFTA may not be relevant to the question whether a NAFTA Party is in breach of its Chapter 11 obligations by conduct of that Party after NAFTA's entry into force. To the extent that the last sentence of the passage from the *Feldman* decision, quoted in para. 67 above, appears to say the contrary, it seems to the present Tribunal to be too categorical, as indeed the United States conceded in argument.\n\nThus events or conduct prior to the entry into force of an obligation for the respondent State may be relevant in determining whether the State has subsequently committed a breach of the obligation. But it must still be possible to point to conduct of the State after that date which is itself a breach. In the present case the only conduct which could possibly constitute a breach of any provision of Chapter 11 is that comprised by the decisions of the SJC and the Supreme Court of the United States, which between them put an end to LPA's claims under Massachusetts law. Unless those decisions were themselves inconsistent with applicable provisions of Chapter 11, the fact that they related to pre-1994 conduct which might arguably have violated obligations under NAFTA (had NAFTA been in force at the time) cannot assist Mondev. The mere fact that earlier conduct has gone unremedied or unredressed when a treaty enters into force does not justify a tribunal applying the treaty retrospectively to that conduct. Any other approach would subvert both the intertemporal principle in the law of treaties and the basic distinction between breach and reparation which underlies the law of State responsibility.156\n\n*Berkowitz (formerly Spence International Investments and others) v.

The Respondent may yet convince the Tribunal that MEM did nothing but uphold its prior decisions and hold DRP to its existing contractual and environmental obligations.

The Respondent notes that while the Notice of Arbitration was filed on 23 October 2018 and the three-year prescription period would, therefore, normally lead to 23 October 2015 being the cut-off date, the Parties agreed to suspend the prescription period during their consultations in 2016-2018, which lasted for 709 days.

Dominican Republic*, and *Waste Management v. Mexico* as well as by the positions taken by the US and Peru in *Gramercy v. Peru* and by the US in *Feldman v.

Memorial, n. 72.\n\n165.\n\nThe Respondent contends that each of these events occurred earlier than the cut-off date of 13 November 2013, and as such they are time-barred from arbitration in the present proceedings.194 The Respondent posits that the fact that the Claimant's submissions in the present arbitration are substantially identical to those which were alleged in *Renco I*, with only minimal edits and deletions, provides further support to the Respondent's argument that the Claimant's claims are now time-barred, years following the initiation of the *Renco I* proceedings.195\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 52.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 59, 67. *See also* Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \"Figure C\", p. 18.\n\n166.\n\nSpecifically, with respect to the Claimant's FET claim, the Respondent notes that the most recent conduct of the Respondent on which the Claimant relies took place in 2009, i.e. years before the cut-off date.196\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b667.\n\n167.\n\nAs regards the Claimant's indirect expropriation claim, the Respondent submits that all relevant events likewise occurred far in advance of the cut-off date and the Claimant had or should have had knowledge of any alleged breach of the Treaty.197 The Respondent emphasizes that the Claimant's indirect expropriation claim rests on (1) MEM's refusal to reasonably provide DRP with extensions necessary to prevent the termination of operations of the facility; (2) the alleged disparaging comments by Peruvian government officials aimed at undermining DRP;198 and (3) \"DRP['s] bankruptcy in 2009, the recognition of a MEM credit, and the decision by a committee of creditors to reject restructuring and place DRP in liquidation\" in 2012.199\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 74.\n\nFor further discussion of these claims, s *ee supra* \u00b6\u00b6 125-128.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 56, 70-75.\n\n168.\n\nAlso, the Respondent highlights that in *Renco I* the Claimant's notice of arbitration and statement of claim dated 9 August 2011 already stated that the Respondent's treatment of DRP \"has the potential to culminate in an expropriation\", describing the Respondent's assertion of a credit in the DRP bankruptcy as \"patently bogus\". According to the Respondent, this shows that the Claimant had knowledge of the alleged breach in August 2011, since only a first appreciation that loss or damage will be incurred is needed to trigger the limitation period.200\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 74.\n\n169.\n\nRegarding the Claimant's denial of justice claim, which relates to local proceedings initiated by the Claimant in an attempt to challenge the MEM credit, the Respondent asserts that the only alleged fact that post-dates the cut-off date is the Peruvian Supreme Court's rejection of DRP's appeal on 3 November 2015.201 However, the Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot rely on this decision to circumvent the limitation periods202 because of prior rulings in these local proceedings (culminating in the Supreme Court ruling) whose dates show that the claim materialized prior to the cut-off date.203\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 55.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 76.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 56(iii). *See also* Memorial on Preliminary Objections, n. 74, where the Respondent states that in *Renco I* the Claimant had indicated dates for those prior rulings, namely 18 October 2012 for a decision of the Fourth Administrative Court and 25 July 2014 for a decision of the Superior Court of Lima.\n\n170.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, if recognition of the MEM credit was patently absurd, as contended by the Claimant, a respective breach would have materialized already on 22 November 2010 when the Claimant opposed the recognition of this credit before INDECOPI or, at the very latest, when the first-instance administrative court rendered its decision on the Claimant's challenge on 18 October 2012.204\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 79-80.\n\n171.\n\nThe Respondent argues that this position is supported in particular by the rulings in *ATA v. Jordan* and *Mondev v. United States*, where the tribunals held that the relevant point in time to the prescription analysis for a denial of justice claim is when the dispute arose, not when remedies were exhausted.205 Also, the Respondent argues that following the decision in *Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic*, the Tribunal should not accept the Claimant's treating the alleged denial of justice as distinct from its claim that the credit should not have been recognized by INDECOPI in the first place.206\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 80, *referring to ATA Construction v.

Respondent cites *Mondev v. United States*, *ATA v. Jordan*, *Corona Materials v.

The Respondent points out that, on the contrary, the tribunal ruled that Respondent's raising of the waiver defence was not an abuse of rights.211 The Respondent acknowledges that *dicta* in the *Renco I* Interim Award suggested that justice would be served if Respondent accepted that prescription was tolled as of 9 August 2011 (the date on which the Claimant files its amended notice of arbitration in *Renco I*). However, the Respondent argues that those were incidental comments on issues that were not arbitrated and have no binding or preclusive effect in the present proceeding, and notes that the tribunal in *Renco I* expressly stated that it \"cannot prevent Peru from exercising in the future what it then considers to be its legal rights\".212\n\nHearing Transcript, 12 June 2020, 66:3-5.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 86f. *See also* Respondent's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 77-80. The quote is from *Renco I*, Partial Award, \u00b6188.\n\n176.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent denies the Claimant's assertion that Respondent \"ran the clock\" by delaying the first arbitration, arguing that it exercised its Treaty rights reasonably.213 According to the Respondent, it was the Claimant who attempted to protract the *Renco I* proceedings by refusing to amend its non-compliant waiver and opposing Peru's request that the tribunal hear its preliminary objections on an expedited basis.214 The Respondent rejects the Claimant's insinuation that the Respondent acted abusively in the *Renco I* proceedings by not raising its objection to the non-compliant waiver in its Statement of Claim, noting that, pursuant to Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Peru had no obligation to raise such an objection until its Counter-Memorial on Liability, and in fact raised its claims much earlier.215\n\nRespondent's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 99-105. Respondent outlines its arguments based on the specific facts of the case to demonstrate it was not \"running-out-the-clock\", with particular reference to *Renco I*.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 89; Hearing Transcript, 12 June 2020, 19:24-20:3, 20:18-20.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 88-89. *See also* UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Art. 23(2) (\"A plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised no later than in the statement of defence.\").\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant seeks to rely on its own non-compliance with Treaty requirements during *Renco I* to circumvent the Treaty's temporal requirements barring its claims in the present proceedings.216 The Respondent insists that a claimant must meet all of the Treaty's preconditions in order to submit a claim to arbitration, meaning that the Claimant cannot comply partially with the Treaty's requirements in *Renco I*, do the same in the present proceeding, and then somehow argue that the cumulative effect of the two deficient proceedings is that it has properly submitted claims to arbitration.217\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 83.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 67.\n\n178.\n\nFor these reasons, the Respondent concludes that the Claimant has failed to submit any claims complying with Article 10.18.1, and its claims consequently should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the Respondent has not consented to arbitrate the m.218\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 82.\n\n***b) Claimant's position***\n----------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimant argues that its claims are not time-barred by the prescription period under Article 10.18.1.\n\n180.\n\n**First**, the Claimant notes that its FET and indirect expropriation claims in the present arbitration arise out of acts and facts occurring within three years of submitting these claims to arbitration in *Renco I*. The Claimant claims that, on 10 March 2009, Peru first breached the Treaty's Article 10.5 FET requirements when MEM denied DRP's request for an extension to complete the final (sixteenth) PAMA project on the basis of the economic *force majeure* provision contained in the Stock Transfer Agreement, in contravention of legislation passed by the Congress of Peru permitting a 30-month extension.219 The Claimant submits that this was the first of a series of failures to permit an extension and was followed by a \"smear campaign\" against the Claimant and DRP.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 79.\n\n181.\n\nThe Claimant further claims that, on 14 September 2010, the Respondent committed the first act in contravention of the Treaty's Article 10.7 protections against indirect expropriation, when MEM asserted a credit against DRP that endowed Peru with nearly one third of all voting rights on the creditors' committee of DRP's bankruptcy. According to the Claimant, this preceded further actions by Peru to force DRP's liquidation in July 2012 and deny the Claimant the control over and enjoyment of its investment in Peru.220\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 80.\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimant notes that Renco initiated the *Renco I* proceedings on 9 August 2011, within the three-years of the aforementioned dates of breach, the earliest of which was 10 March 2009.221\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 81.\n\n183.\n\n**Secondly**, the Claimant argues that the initiation of the *Renco I* proceedings suspended the Treaty's Article 10.18.1 prescription period with respect to its FET and indirect expropriation claims.\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimant notes that Article 10.18.1 of the Treaty is silent as to whether a timely submission of claims to arbitration, which must later be resubmitted due to a dismissal on jurisdictional grounds without prejudice, will suspend the three-year limitation period.222 The Claimant submits that the Respondent's argument of the Treaty containing a *lex specialis* on the issue of a suspension of the prescription period is meritless and finds no support in the NDP Submission of the US.223 In particular, the Claimant notes that Articles 10.16 and 10.18 relied on by the Respondent in this regard each deal with different things, the latter pertaining to conditions and limitations on consent, rather than to the timing of when a claim is submitted.224 Moreover, the Claimant argues that if the respective Treaty provision were a *lex specialis* so as to exclude any suspension, it would not have been possible for the Parties to repeatedly agree to a suspension after the conclusion of *Renco I*, as they did.225\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 110. Hearing Transcript, 12 June 2020, 74:13-78:5. The Claimant further argues that the Treaty cannot be *lex specialis* on this matter, for the Parties have already paused the prescription period in entering into the Framework Agreement.

According to the Claimant, this object and purpose was satisfied by the Claimant timely submitting its FET and indirect expropriation claims in *Renco I*, without any negligent delay, thus putting the Respondent on notice of the need to secure sufficient and reliable evidence to defend itself, which it did.227\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 113-116, *referring to Corona Materials, LLC v.

In support of this claim, the Claimant refers to the holdings in various international arbitral awards as well provisions in multiple civil codes and common law doctrines that similarly provide that limitations periods toll when notification to a respondent of a complaint or dispute occurs. *See, e.g. Gentini Case*, Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Vol. X, pp. 551-561, at 561 (**CLA-10**); *Case of John H.

Peru* with respect to the North American Free Trade Agreement.230 The Claimant notes that in the cases cited by the US' non-disputing party submission in that case, as well as in the NDP Submission of the US in the present case, the claimants failed to initiate any arbitration proceedings in the three-year window, inapposite to the present case.231 The Claimant emphasizes that in the instant case, \"Peru has been aware of Claimant's claims since 2011 and is suffering no limitations prejudice as a result of Claimant's resubmission of its claims in this arbitration\".232\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 126, *citing* Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 23, *referring to* *Gramercy Funds Management LLC et al. v.

The Claimant argues that the Respondent acknowledged the Claimant's claims in *Renco I* by participating in that arbitration without ever questioning that it was aware of the dispute and of its obligation to retain documents and defend itself, and by subsequently negotiating with the Claimant to settle the dispute.233\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130.\n\n190.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Claimant submits that the limitation period was suspended from 9 August 2011 (submission of the amended notice of arbitration in *Renco I*) to 9 November 2016 (final award in *Renco I*).234\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 105.\n\n191.\n\n**Thirdly**, the Claimant notes that as of 10 November 2016, i.e. the day after the final award in *Renco I* was issued, the Parties entered into several agreements under which they agreed on consultations pertaining to the Notice of Intent. These agreements, which were in force until 20 October 2018, provided that the time during which they were in effect would not count towards the limitation period of Article 10.18.1.235\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 102-103.\n\n192.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that the only added time to be counted towards the limitation period after the Claimant's submission of its claims in *Renco I* is three days, from 20 October 2018 until its submission of the Notice of Arbitration on 23 October 2018. The Claimant contends that, as a result, its claims were filed in compliance with the three-year limitation period.236\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 104-105, 131.\n\n193.\n\n**Fourthly**, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's objections to Claimant's FET and indirect expropriation claims on the basis of Article 10.18.1 constitute an abuse of rights.\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimant notes that, on 4 April 2011, it submitted a notice of arbitration i *n Renco I* with a waiver including reservation of rights language. The Claimant further notes that despite \"countless opportunities to raise its objection relating to Claimant's waiver\", including the expedited review mechanism under Article 10.20.5, it was not until three and one half years later, on 3 October 2014, that Peru objected for the first time to the additional reservation of rights language in the waiver - after having previously made ambiguous statements on its waiver objection in multiple submissions. The Claimant adds that had the Respondent raised its objection to the additional reservation of rights language in a timely fashion, the Claimant could have removed it from its waiver within three years of the breaches alleged as a basis for the FET and indirect expropriation claims. In fact, the Claimant asserts that it repeatedly offered during *Renco I* to strike the contentious reservation of rights language in its waiver, provided that the Respondent gave assurance that it would not then object to the claims being prescribed, but the Respondent failed to accept this.237 According to the Claimant, one may reasonable conclude that the Respondent purposefully delayed raising its waiver objection in a bad faith effort to allow the limitations period to expire, and if it prevailed on its belated waiver objection, to raise a limitations objection in a refiled arbitration.238\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 138, 159; Hearing Transcript, 13 June 2020, 175:19-177:24.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 82, 84-90, 98, 132, 136-150.\n\n195.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, while the *Renco I* tribunal dismissed the case because of this technical error with Renco's written waiver, the tribunal noted and \"unanimously condemned\" that the Respondent waited three and a half years to raise its waiver objections.239 The Claimant contends that the Respondent now seeks to prejudice the Claimant by asserting that the time elapsed during those arbitration proceedings, due to the Respondent's own delay tactics, should count against the prescription period set by Article 10.18.1.240\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 100.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 84-99.\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimant further notes that the tribunal in *Renco I* held that \"an abuse of rights might be found to exist if Peru were to argue in any future proceeding that Renco's claims were now time-barred until Article 10.18(1)\" as the Respondent does now, and unanimously found that \"justice would be served if Peru accepted that time stopped running for the purposes of Article 10.18(1) when Renco filed its Amended Notice of Arbitration on August 9, 2011\".241 The Claimant also points out that the tribunal in *Renco I* acknowledged that \"Renco would suffer material prejudice if Peru were to claim in any subsequent arbitration that Renco's claims were now time-barred under Article 10.18(1)\".242\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 101, *citing Renco I*, Partial Award, \u00b6\u00b6 187-188.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 134, *citing Renco I*, Partial Award, \u00b6\u00b6 187.\n\n197.\n\nThe Claimant proffers that \"[i]t is well-settled that a right may be refused recognition on the ground that it is being abused\", when exercising the right is purposed toward prejudicing the interests of the other party.243 The Claimant notes that it is unnecessary to prove bad faith for a Tribunal to find abuse of rights and proscribe the Respondent's exercise of any rights arising under Article 10.18.1.244 The Claimant further notes that the tribunal in the 1903 *Stevenson Case* specifically found that a State could not invoke a defence of prescription when it was responsible for causing the delay.245\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 135. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 152-156.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 135, 151, 157.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 158, *referring to Stevenson Case*, Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Vol. IX, pp. 385-387, at 385 (**CLA-35**).\n\n198.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the US did not contradict its contention that a party may be prevented from exercising rights wherein the exercise thereof would constitute an abuse of rights.246\n\nClaimant's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6 15.\n\n199.\n\nIn sum, the Claimant submits that, given the Respondent's own conduct in *Renco I*, Respondent's objections under Article 10.18.1 constitute an abuse of rights and should therefore be dismissed by the Tribunal.247\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 160.\n\n200.\n\n**Fifthly**, the Claimant claims that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the Treaty when, on 3 November 2015, the Supreme Court of Peru failed to nullify a \"patently improper credit by the Peruvian Ministry of Energy and Mines\" and rejected DRP's appeal on the issue.248 The Claimant argues that, having initiated the present arbitration on 23 October 2018, within three years of the Supreme Court decision, this claim satisfies the Article 10.18.1 temporal requirement.249\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 161.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 161.\n\n201.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Parties agree as to the facts of DRP's submission of a claim to trial and subsequent appeal before the Peruvian judiciary regarding MEM's improper assertion of a claim for US$ 163 million against DRP when it entered bankruptcy in February 2010.250 However, the Claimant notes that the Parties differ in that the Respondent argues that the denial of justice claim is time-barred because it arose out of the 2010 bankruptcy proceedings and, at the latest, in 2012, when \"Renco's affiliate(s) initiated and pursued the contentious administrative challenge\".251\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 162.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 164, *citing* Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 80.\n\n202.\n\nThe Claimant submits that \"[i]t is axiomatic that when a court decision is not final and binding, and can be corrected by internal appellate mechanisms, a denial of justice cannot have arisen\".252 Relying on *Chevron v. Ecuador*, the Claimant advances that the \"finality\" requirement mandates that all local remedies be exhausted before a denial of justice claim may be asserted.253\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 166.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 166, *referring to* *Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v.

The Claimant asserts that this \"finality\" requirement is echoed in the holdings of various tribunals. *See, e.g.* *Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3, Award, 26 June 2003 (Michael Mustill, Abner J.

In the context of a claim of denial of justice, therefore, the three-year limitations period set out in Article 10.18.1 will not begin to run [...] when all available domestic remedies have been exhausted, unless obviously futile or manifestly ineffective.\"254\n\nClaimant's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6 17.\n\n204.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent misapplies *Mondev v. United States*255 and *ATA v. Jordan*256 when it argues that \"the moment in time that is relevant to the prescription analysis for a denial of justice claim is when the dispute arose, not when remedies were exhausted\".257 The Claimant submits that these holdings do not apply to the issue of prescription, but rather to instances in which the alleged breach occurred prior to the entry into force of the investment treaty.258 Thus, the Claimant contends that these holdings do not apply to the present arbitration.259\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v.

Accordingly, as the Claimant accepts that it acquired knowledge of the breach on that day,263 the three-year prescription period pursuant to Article 10.18.1 began to run on 10 March 2009 insofar as the Claimant's claim rests on this asserted breach. The Tribunal finds it useful to focus its analysis of the prescription issue on this portion of the claim because, logically, if the first breach alleged by the Claimant is not time-barred under Article 10.18.1, the same holds true for all other breaches asserted in this arbitration.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 106.\n\n207.\n\nWhen the Claimant filed its original and amended notices of arbitration in *Renco I* on 4 April 2011 and 9 August 2011, respectively, less than three years had elapsed since the alleged breach on 10 March 2009. Accordingly, and having already determined above that this alleged breach is actionable independently from earlier conduct of the Respondent,264 the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant's FET and indirect expropriation claims brought in the instant proceeding were not yet time-barred when the Claimant submitted its notices of arbitration in *Renco I*.\n\n*See supra* section VII.B.1(c).\n\n208.\n\nIn addition, it is undisputed between the Parties that between the conclusion of *Renco I* and the filing of the Notice of Arbitration in the present case, only three days elapsed in respect of which the Parties had not agreed on a suspension of the prescription period. These three days do not make any material difference because the notices of arbitration in *Renco I* were filed several months before the three-year period elapsed. Therefore, unless Peru is precluded from invoking Article 10.18.1 due to an abuse of rights, the decisive question is whether the prescription period was suspended in relation to the Claimant's FET and indirect expropriation claims during the pendency of *Renco I*. If it was not, the claim resting on MEM's refusal to grant an extension would have become prescribed on 11 March 2012. The same holds true for all other claims resting on breaches alleged to have occurred before 13 November 2013 (i.e. the cut-off date calculated by the Respondent).\n\n209.\n\nAs a matter of course, the arbitral proceedings in *Renco I* could only have suspended the prescription period in relation to the Claimant's FET and indirect expropriation claims if these same claims were already submitted in *Renco I*. The Tribunal notes that the Parties agree this is the case,265 and does not see any reason to find otherwise. In particular, while certain facts invoked in relation to the indirect expropriation claim post-date the notices of arbitration in *Renco I* (notably MEM's vote in support of DRP's liquidation, which occurred in July 2012), the Respondent accepts, as does this Tribunal, that these developments were already anticipated by the Claimant in its amended notice of arbitration in *Renco I*.266 In addition, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant introduced these additional facts in its Memorial on Liability in *Renco I* and expanded the scope of its FET and indirect expropriation claims accordingly.267 Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that if *Renco I* resulted in a suspension of the limitations period for all claims subject to that arbitration, the Claimant's FET and indirect expropriation claims would benefit in their entirety from such suspension.\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 59 (\"Renco's articulation of [the FET claim] is practically identical to a claim submitted by Renco in its Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim [in *Renco I*]\"), \u00b6 70 (\"Renco purports to support its [expropriation] argument [in relation to extensions, new environmental obligations and public comments] based on the same factual allegations as for Renco's unfair treatment claim\").\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 74.\n\n*Renco I*, Memorial on Liability, in particular \u00b6\u00b6 196-208, 340-344, 381, 388 (**R-12**).\n\n210.\n\nIn view of the Parties' arguments on the suspension issue, the Tribunal finds it useful to divide its analysis into two questions as follows:\n\n(a) First, is there a general principle of law recognized under international law pursuant to which prescription periods are suspended during the pendency of an arbitration?\n\n(b) Secondly, what is the Treaty's position on the question of whether the prescription period in Article 10.18.1 is suspended pending arbitral proceedings?\n\n211.\n\nThe Tribunal will analyse both questions in turn.\n\n(1) Does arbitration suspend prescription periods under general principles of law recognized under international law?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nIn the first prong of its argument that the *Renco I* proceedings suspended the prescription period, the Claimant submits that it is a \"general principle of law recognized by civilized nations\" under Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute that prescription periods are suspended for the duration of relevant judicial or arbitral proceedings. The Tribunal concurs.\n\n213.\n\nWhile international law generally holds individual States' internal law to be irrelevant to a State's obligations under international law,268 it nevertheless acknowledges that issues may arise in respect of which there is no clearly applicable treaty or customary international law obligation, but also no clear inference to be derived from the silence thereof. In this domain, and especially where the international rule to be applied finds its origin in analogous national law, the \"rules generally accepted by municipal legal systems\" may be invoked in order that the ultimate result not \"lose touch with reality\".269 Accordingly, the \"general principles of law recognized by civilized nations\" may be resorted to in a gap-filling capacity as one of the sources of international law authoritatively enumerated in Article 38(1) of the ICJ Statute.\n\n*See* ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Art. 32; VCLT, Art. 27.\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain)*, ICJ, Judgment, 5 February 1970, [1970] ICJ 1, \u00b6 50 *cited in Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Decision on Italy's Request for Immediate Termination and Italy's Jurisdictional Objection based on Inapplicability of the Energy Charter Treaty to intra-EU Disputes, 7 May 2019 (Guido S. Tawil, Brigitte Stern, Jean E. Kalicki (President)), \u00b6 119 (**CLA-9**).\n\n214.\n\nThe existence of such principles is not lightly presumed. In order for a principle to rise to the level of a \"general principle of law\" under Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute, it must be \"generally accepted\" across national legal systems. The exact degree of acceptance required remains a subject of debate. However, no such difficulty arises in this case. The Claimant has pointed to the laws of Peru, Argentina, France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.270 The Claimant also cites early arbitral decisions from which the rules of prescription in international law originated as a general principle adopted by analogy from national legal systems and Roman law, including most notably the *Gentini Case*, which held that \"the presentation of a claim to competent authority within proper time will interrupt the running of prescription.\"271\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 117-121; Civil Code of Peru, Art. 1996 (**CLA-11**); Civil Code of Argentina, Art. 2546 (**CLA-12**); Civil Code of France, Art. 2241 (**CLA-13**); Civil Code of Germany, Art. 204(1) (**CLA-14**); Civil Code of Portugal, Art. 323(1) (**CLA-17**); Civil Code of Spain, Art. 1973 (**CLA-16**); *Henderson v.

For instance, Article 13 of the 1974 United Nations Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods provides as follows:\n\nThe limitation period shall cease to run when the creditor performs any act which, under the law of the court where the proceedings are instituted, is recognized as commencing judicial proceedings against the debtor or as asserting his claim in such proceedings already instituted against the debtor, for the purpose of obtaining satisfaction or recognition of his claim.\n\n216.\n\nThis provision was later endorsed and adopted as the basis for Article 10.5 of the UNIDROIT Principles on International Commercial Contracts, which provides that \"[t]he running of the limitation period is suspended [...] when the obligee performs any act, by commencing judicial proceedings or in judicial proceedings already instituted, that is recognized by the law of the court as asserting the obligee's right against the obligor.\"272 The official commentary to this latter provision reads as follows:\n\nIn all legal systems judicial proceedings affect the running of a limitation period in either of two manners. Judicial proceedings can cause an interruption of the limitation period, so that a new limitation period begins when the judicial proceedings end. Alternatively, judicial proceedings can cause only a suspension, so that a period that has already lapsed before the judicial proceedings began will be deducted from the applicable period, the remaining period starting at the end of the judicial procedure.273\n\nInternational Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT), *UNIDROIT Principles on International Commercial Contracts 2016* (integral version), p. 361. Per their Preamble, the UNIDROIT Principles intend to reflect general principles of transnational law.\n\nInternational Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT), *UNIDROIT Principles on International Commercial Contracts 2016* (integral version), p. 362.\n\n217.\n\nThe existence of such a general principle is not seriously disputed by the Respondent, who has not referred the Tribunal to a single jurisdiction in which prescription periods are not suspended during the pendency of legal proceedings. Instead, the Respondent submits that the Treaty's three-year prescription period establishes a *lex specialis* that wholly excludes the application of general principles.274 It is to this argument that the Tribunal turns next.\n\nRespondent's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6 72 (\"Renco's references to local jurisdictions that allow for suspension of the limitations period where a claim is procedurally defective cannot change the fundamental fact that the Treaty prohibits it.\"). Hearing Transcript, 12 June 2020, 59:11-14 (\"one cannot suspend the prescription period as Renco has asked [this Tribunal] to do because that is [\u2026] contrary to the express terms of the Treaty\"), 61:7-15 (\"none of that jurisprudence is applicable here at all because domestic law just simply doesn't apply [\u2026] the Treaty is clear that what applies here, what the Tribunal must apply is the Agreement itself and only applicable rules of international law, not international law that overrides the express terms of the Agreement, and certainly not municipal law.\").\n\n(2) What is the Treaty's position regarding a suspension of the Article 10.18.1 deadline pending arbitral proceedings?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nWhile the Parties diverge as to whether the Treaty is silent or conversely contains a *lex specialis* on the question of whether the three-year prescription period is suspended during arbitral proceedings, the Tribunal understands that there is no dispute between the Parties about the fact that neither Article 10.18.1 nor any other provision of the Treaty expressly addresses this question. Indeed, the Tribunal has no difficulty in finding that the Treaty does not expressly deal at all with the issue of a suspension of the prescription period - neither whether such a suspension may occur at all nor, if so, whether submitting a claim to arbitration is a circumstance that could trigger such suspension.\n\n219.\n\nConsequently, it is for the Tribunal to interpret the Treaty so as to ascertain whether one can infer from it an implicit position on the possibility of suspending the prescription period provided for in Article 10.18.1 for the pendency of arbitral proceedings, in particular in the presence of a defective waiver.\n\n220.\n\nThe articles of the Treaty invoked by the Respondent in support of its position that the Treaty contains a *lex specialis* regarding a suspension of the prescription period read, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n10.16.2 At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under this Section, a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its intention to submit the claim to arbitration [...]\n\n10.16.3 Provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim, a claimant may submit a claim [to arbitration].\n\n10.16.4 A claim shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section when the claimant's notice of or request for arbitration [...] referred to in Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, together with the statement of claim referred to in [then] Article 18 [now Article 20] of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, are received by the respondent.\n\n10.18.1 No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant [...] has incurred loss or damage.\n\n10.18.2 No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless [...] (b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied [...] by the claimant's written waiver of any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.\n\n221.\n\nThe Respondent submits that a combined reading of the above Articles makes clear that a notice of arbitration accompanied by a defective waiver as to local proceedings does not suspend the running of the prescription period. Rather, the Respondent argues that the relevant event suspending the Treaty's prescription period is the \"submission of a claim to arbitration\", which in the Respondent's view requires, amongst other things, a waiver conforming with Article 10.18.2. Therefore, according to the Respondent, the prescription period continues running if a notice of arbitration is filed with an invalid waiver because, in such case, the claim was \"never submitted to arbitration\".275\n\nRespondent's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 57, 59, 68.\n\n222.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the prescription period is suspended once the claim is \"submitted to arbitration\". The Tribunal further agrees with the Respondent that the term \"submitted to arbitration\" should be taken to have the same meaning in Article 10.18.1 as it has in the other provisions quoted in paragraph 220 above. Indeed, these provisions provide context to Article 10.18.1 within the meaning of Article 31(1) and (2) of the VCLT.\n\n223.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal is unable to accept the Respondent's contention that the text of the Articles invoked indicate that no claim was ever \"submitted to arbitration\" if the notice of arbitration did not include a waiver conforming with Article 10.18.2 (as was found to have been the case in *Renco I*). In fact, the plain language of Article 10.16.4, referred to by the Respondent itself, suggests the opposite: If a notice of arbitration and statement of claim is filed in accordance with Articles 3 and 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules, this is the point in time at which the claim \"shall be deemed to be submitted to arbitration\". In other words, once a notice of arbitration and statement of claim conforming with the formal filing requirements of the UNCITRAL Rules is submitted, Article 10.16.4 requires the Tribunal to treat the claim as having been \"submitted to arbitration\", with the necessary consequence that the prescription period under Article 10.18.1 ceases to run as of this point in time (this consequence being acknowledged by the Respondent itself in the event that a claim is \"submitted to arbitration\"276).\n\nRespondent's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 57, 68.\n\n224.\n\nThe texts of the other Articles of the Treaty invoked by the Respondent either do not add anything to this textual analysis (Article 10.16.2) or merely stipulate, just like Article 10.18.1 itself, under which circumstances a claim \"may\" be submitted to arbitration (Articles 10.16.3 and 10.18.2). However, the fact that a notice and statement of claim filed in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules \"may [not] be submitted to arbitration\" in a given case (and therefore stands to be dismissed, at least if corresponding objections are raised) because the requirements of Articles 10.16 or 10.18 are not met, does not call into question that such a claim is in fact (deemed to be) \"submitted to arbitration\" based on Article 10.16.4 and, therefore, stops the prescription period from running. This is further confirmed by the final paragraph of Article 10.16.4, which again refers to the date of receipt under the applicable arbitration rules for the determination of the effective date on which a claim asserted subsequently to the notice of arbitration has been submitted.277\n\nTreaty, Art. 10.16.4 (\"A claim asserted by the claimant for the first time after such notice of arbitration is submitted shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section on the date of its receipt under the applicable arbitral rules.\").\n\n225.\n\nNor does any other context (none is invoked by the Parties) or the object and purpose of the Treaty, give the terms \"shall be deemed\", \"may\", and \"submitted to arbitration\" an ordinary meaning to the effect that the prescription period continues running if a notice of arbitration is filed in accordance with Article 10.16.4 but fails to include a valid waiver.\n\n226.\n\nThe Parties seem to agree, as does this Tribunal, that one of the objectives of the Treaty is to provide a predictable legal framework, and that Article 10.18.1 in particular aims at providing legal predictability by protecting State respondents against l ate278 claims, not least to ensure that claims will be resolved when evidence is reasonably available and fresh.279\n\nWhile the Respondent suggests that the objective of prescription periods is also to protect respondent States from \"recurring\" claims (Respondent's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6 65), the Respondent has not offered any support for this suggestion and the Tribunal does not agree with it. By their very nature, prescription periods are only concerned with claims that are made after a certain point in time. They do not protect a respondent against recurrent claims for as long as they are filed within the prescription period.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 133-134; Respondent's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 63-65; *referring to Vannessa Ventures v.

Contrary to the Respondent's argument, the object and purpose of both the Treaty and the prescription period in its Article 10.18.1 are not inconsistent at all with the prescription period being suspended during arbitral proceedings, irrespective of whether there is a defective waiver. The existence and length of such suspension can be easily and clearly established by reference to the dates of the notice of arbitration and the final award (or termination order), thus not calling into question legal predictability. Furthermore, if an arbitration is filed within the prescription period, this will prompt a diligent respondent State to find and secure evidence, such that sufficient evidence will be available to it even if a second arbitration is filed after the conclusion of the first one. This applies with special force if, as in the present case, the respondent State must reasonably expect, upon or shortly after the conclusion of the first arbitration, that the same claim will be re-filed.280 In such a case, the respondent State is aware of the need to preserve its evidence beyond the duration of the first arbitration. In addition, the Tribunal notes that in most, if not all, legal systems, prescription periods pursue the same objectives as Article 10.18.1, but are nonetheless subject to possible suspensions,281 thus confirming that suspensions are generally compatible with the objectives underlying prescription periods.\n\nThe Claimant filed its notice of intent in the present arbitration almost three months before the final award in *Renco I* was even rendered, *see* \u00b6\u00b6 60-61 *supra*.\n\n*See* the examples in Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6\u00b6 118-123.\n\n228.\n\nMoreover, despite the US and, subsequently, Peru submitting that the limitation period is \"clear and rigid\", not to be modified by any \"suspension, prolongation or other qualification\", the Tribunal considers that this does not give the terms of the Treaty an ordinary meaning to the effect that a suspension of the prescription period of Article 10.18.1 requires, in addition to a claim being \"submitted to arbitration\" pursuant to Article 10.16.4, the presence of a waiver complying with Article 10.18.2(b).282\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 4; Respondent's Comments on NDP Submission, in particular \u00b6\u00b6 3, 45, 49.\n\n229.\n\nAs \"clear and rigid\" as this general statement of the Contracting Parties purports to be, the Tribunal notes that both Contracting Parties do qualify it in their submissions in the instant proceedings.\n\n230.\n\nThe US, for its part, refers in its NDP Submission to *Feldman v. Mexico*283 as the source for its general statement that the prescription period is \"clear and rigid\" and not subject to any \"suspension, prolongation or other qualification\".284 However, that very tribunal expressly found it possible, in the same paragraph of its award referred to by the US, that the prescription period provided for in Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) of NAFTA (which is analogous to Article 10.18.1) is \"interrupted\", i.e. suspended, under certain circumstances.285 In addition, the Tribunal notes that in its non-disputing party submissions in *Gramercy* and *Corona Materials*, the US specifically stated that a claim was not \"submitted to arbitration\" within the meaning of Article 10.18.1 (or the analogous provision in Article 10.18.1 of DR-CAFTA) unless it was accompanied by a valid waiver of local proceedings.286 Such statement is notably absent from the NDP Submission in the present case.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the non-disputing party submission of the US in that case does not help the Respondent, contrary to what is asserted in Respondent's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6 58. The US merely stated that the NAFTA prescription period is not satisfied by a mere notice of intent to submit a claim to arbitration, but rather requires a notice of arbitration. *See Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v*. *United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF) */* 99 */* 1, Submission of the United States of America on Preliminary Issues, 6 October 2000, \u00b6 14 (**CLA-1**).\n\nNDP Submission, n. 4. The other award cited by the US merely reproduces the general statement made in *Feldman v. Mexico* to justify bifurcation of the issue of prescription. *See* *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 20 July 2006 (James Anaya, John R. Crook, Fali S.

But any other state behavior short of such formal and authorized recognition would only under exceptional circumstances be able to either bring about interruption of the running of limitation [\u2026]\").\n\n*Gramercy Funds Management LLC and Gramercy Peru Holdings LLC v.

Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/AF/14/3, Submission of the US, 11 March 2006, \u00b6 9 (**RLA-22**).\n\n231.\n\nThe Respondent, in turn, expressly confirmed in its pleadings that a notice of arbitration that conforms with all requirements of the Treaty \"suspend[s] the prescription period\".287 Indeed, it could hardly be any different because, otherwise, a claim could become time-barred during a pending arbitration.\n\nRespondent's Comments on NDP Submission, \u00b6 68.\n\n232.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent itself accepts that the prescription period was in fact suspended for almost the entire period between the conclusion of *Renco I* and the filing of the Notice of Arbitration in the present case, based on the Parties having so agreed. In this regard, the Tribunal has carefully considered the Respondent's argument that this agreed suspension merely confirms the general principle that the respondent State can waive its jurisdictional objections, but that this is irrelevant to the question of whether the Claimant or the Tribunal can suspend the prescription period. The Tribunal finds that this argument ignores a decisive difference. It is one thing for a respondent State simply to choose not to raise a prescription objection in the arbitration (which it undoubtedly can, even if the Treaty did not allow for any suspension of the prescription period). It is quite another thing, however, for a respondent State to agree, outside of an arbitration, to a suspension of the prescription period, which is effectively the same as it agreeing not to raise a prescription objection in a subsequent arbitration in relation to that period of time. This latter course of action presupposes that the Tribunal could enforce this agreement, be it on the basis of an estoppel argument or otherwise, in case the Respondent ultimately raises a prescription objection in the arbitration in contravention of the agreement (on the basis of the time for which it previously agreed the prescription period would be suspended). The Respondent's position seems to be that the Tribunal could in fact do so and reject the respondent State's prescription objection despite more than three years having alleged since the alleged breach. Thus, the Respondent implicitly acknowledges that the prescription period of Article 10.18.1 is in fact subject to a suspension in such a scenario, despite no such (or other) suspension being expressly provided for in the Treaty.\n\n233.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt that the Contracting Parties would agree that, if an arbitral award rendered under the Treaty is annulled for reasons of improper composition of the tribunal or a violation of due process, the claimant would not be prevented from re-filing the same claim again even though that (re-)\"submission to arbitration\" will hardly ever take place within three years of the alleged breach. Therefore, despite their general statement that the prescription period is \"clear and rigid\" and not subject to any \"suspension\", the States parties must be taken to accept that Article 10.18.1 does allow for the prescription period to be suspended for the pendency of an arbitration, despite its wording not expressly saying anything to this effect. To hold otherwise would not only create perverse incentives for a respondent State to elicit grounds for setting aside, it would frustrate a claimant's due process rights: a successful vindication of those rights would be rewarded with a prescribed claim.288 Such a manifestly unreasonable result\u2014which flies in the face of the object and purpose of the Treaty under Article 31(1) of the VCLT\u2014also confirms the Tribunal's interpretation under Article 32(b) of the VCLT.\n\nIn very similar circumstances, the *Waste Management II* tribunal stated that such an interpretation \"should be avoided if possible\". *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Mexico's Preliminary Objection concerning the Previous Proceedings, 26 June 2002 (Benjamin R. Civiletti, Eduardo Magall\u00f3n G\u00f3mez, James Crawford (President)), \u00b6 33 (**RLA-78**).\n\n234.\n\nIn any case, even if the Tribunal were to regard the coincident use of the phrase \"clear and rigid\" by the Respondent and the US in their respective submissions as constituting or establishing an agreement on the interpretation or application of the Treaty in the sense of Article 31(3)(a) or (b) of the VCLT\u2014a point on which the Tribunal need not pronounce itself\u2014the VCLT merely requires the Tribunal to take such agreement \"into account, together with the context\". In other words, such agreement on questions of interpretation is not binding on the Tribunal.289 Instead, it is merely one (albeit an important) factor in the interpretative process, together with all others mentioned in Article 31 of the VCLT.\n\n*Renco I*, Partial Award, \u00b6 156 (\"Although the Tribunal must 'take into account' any subsequent agreement between the State Parties pursuant to Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT, the proper interpretation of Article 10.18 and how it should be applied to the facts of this case are tasks which reside exclusively with this Tribunal.\"). This is all the more poignant under a Treaty that expressly allows the Contracting Parties to the Treaty to adopt, through the Free Trade Commission, interpretations that are expressly binding upon the Tribunal. *See* Treaty, Article 10.22(3). *See also* International Law Commission, *Draft conclusions on subsequent agreements and subsequent practice in relation to the interpretation of treaties, with commentaries*, (2008) II (Part Two) Yearbook of the ILC, \u00b6 52.\n\n235.\n\nOne other such factor is recourse to \"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties\", pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT. As shown above, international law\u2014and, more specifically \"the general principles of law\" recognized under international law\u2014does provide for a suspension of the prescription period during the pendency of an arbitration. This, and the necessity of avoiding a claim from becoming prescribed during a pending arbitration, in particular to allow for resubmission after annulment of a first arbitral award, squarely confirms what is already suggested by the term \"submitted to arbitration\" in Article 10.18.1.\n\n236.\n\nThe Contracting Parties could have drafted Article 10.18.1 in a way that requires more than a claim being \"submitted to arbitration\" (which term necessarily refers back to Article 10.16.4) for the prescription period to be suspended, thereby expressly departing from general principles of law in this regard. However, they chose not to do so. The Tribunal is not prepared to conclude that a claim \"submitted to arbitration\" within the meaning of Article 10.16.4 does not suspend the prescription period merely because the Contracting Parties made coinciding submissions to the effect that Article 10.18.1 is a \"clear and rigid\" requirement that is not subject to any \"suspension, prolongation or other qualification\", in circumstances where (i) the Contracting Parties themselves qualify this general statement; (ii) the plain language of the Treaty does not address the issue of suspension at all and suggests that the prescription period is satisfied by a claim that meets the requirements set out in the UNCITRAL Rules; (iii) if at all, the context and object and purpose of the treaty militate in favor of such a suspension of the prescription period, in particular to avoid manifestly unreasonable results in case an arbitral award is annulled; and (iv) general principles of law, which are to be read into the Treaty pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT,290 provide for such a suspension.\n\n*Georges Pinson Case (France v. Mexico)*, Award, 19 October 1928, V UNRIAA 327, p. 422 (\"Every international convention must be deemed tacitly to refer to general principles of international law for all questions which it does not itself resolve in express terms and in a different way\"; in the original French: \"Toute convention internationale doit \u00eatre r\u00e9put\u00e9e s'en r\u00e9f\u00e9rer tacitement au droit international commun, pour toutes les questions qu'elle ne r\u00e9sout pas elle-m\u00eame en termes expr\u00e8s et d'une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente.\"); *Case Relating to the Territorial Jurisdiction of the International Commission of the River Oder* (UK, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Germany & Sweden v.

Christopher Thomas, Pierre-Marie Dupuy (President)), \u00b6 199 with n. 186 (**RLA-23**).\n\n240.\n\nWith respect to *Waste Management*, it is true, as contended by the Respondent, that the Tribunal in that case found that a notice of arbitration containing a defective waiver did not amount to a \"submission of a claim\" within the meaning of Article 1121 of NAFTA. However, this finding does not support the Respondent's case for at least three reasons as follows.\n\n241.\n\n**First**, Article 1121 of NAFTA has nothing to do with prescription. In fact, the decision in *Waste Management* did not concern prescription at all, but rather whether a claim could be submitted to arbitration for a second time after it was dismissed in a first arbitration for lack of jurisdiction due to a defective waiver.\n\n242.\n\n**Secondly**, Article 1121 of NAFTA uses a terminology (\"submit a claim\") that is different from that in Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) of NAFTA (\"make a claim\"), which are the provisions dealing with prescription. Hence, contrary to Articles 10.16 and 10.18 of the Treaty in the present case, which use identical terminology (\"submit to arbitration\"), it is not at all clear whether the meaning of those terms in NAFTA must be the same when it comes to the presence of a defective waiver.\n\n243.\n\n**Thirdly**, none of the three reasons that the tribunal in *Waste Management* gave for its interpretation of Article 1121 of NAFTA support the Respondent's position that filing a claim with a defective waiver does not suspend the prescription period of Article 10.18.1.\n\n244.\n\nThe first reason given by that Tribunal was very specific language in Article 1121 of NAFTA, *viz.* the terms \"condition precedent\" and \"only if\",296 none of which is present in Article 10.18.1 of the Treaty.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Mexico's Preliminary Objection concerning the Previous Proceedings, 26 June 2002 (Benjamin R. Civiletti, Eduardo Magall\u00f3n G\u00f3mez, James Crawford (President)), \u00b6 33 (**RLA-78**).\n\n245.\n\nThe second reason was the underlying purpose of the arbitration provisions in Chapter 11, which was to 'create effective procedures. for the resolution of disputes'. An investor in the position of the Claimant, who had eventually waived any possibility of a local remedy in respect of the measure in question but found that there was no jurisdiction to consider its claim at the international level either, might be forgiven for doubting the effectiveness of the international procedures. The Claimant has not had its NAFTA claim heard on the merits before any tribunal, national or international; and if the Respondent is right, that situation is now irrevocable. Such a situation should be avoided if possible.297 (footnote omitted)\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Mexico's Preliminary Objection concerning the Previous Proceedings, 26 June 2002 (Benjamin R. Civiletti, Eduardo Magall\u00f3n G\u00f3mez, James Crawford (President)), \u00b6 35 (**RLA-78**).\n\n246.\n\nWhile, contrary to NAFTA, the Treaty does not explicitly mention as one of its objections the creation of effective dispute resolution procedures, there can be no doubt that the Contracting Parties, acting in good faith, must have intended for the Treaty's dispute resolution mechanism to be effective. Applying the above reasoning of the Tribunal in *Waste Management*, it would seem to run counter to the effectiveness of the system if the Claimant in the present case, after having eventually submitted a valid waiver (without any relevant time having passed for prescription purposes after the conclusion of *Renco I*), is still denied in its request to have its Treaty claim heard on the merits. In the words of the Tribunal in that case, such a situation should be avoided if possible.\n\n247.\n\nThe third reason given by the Tribunal in *Waste Management* for its interpretation of Article 1121 of NAFTA was that general international law, which forms part of the governing law under Article 1131(1) of NAFTA, did not contain any rule in support of the respondent State's position that the claim could not be re-filed.298 In the present case, Respondent's position does not only lack support in general international law, it even stands in contrast to it.299\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Decision of the Tribunal on Mexico's Preliminary Objection concerning the Previous Proceedings, 26 June 2002 (Benjamin R. Civiletti, Eduardo Magall\u00f3n G\u00f3mez, James Crawford (President)), \u00b6\u00b6 36-37 (**RLA-78**) (the \"third\" reason in the line of argument employed by that Tribunal).\n\n*See* section VII.B.2(c)(1) *supra*.\n\n248.\n\nIn summary, therefore, the Respondent's position on the suspension of the prescription period is not supported by the case-law it relied upon in that context. In fact, the precise issue before this Tribunal has not arisen in any prior case.300\n\nIn the *Waste Management* saga, Mexico did not raise a prescription objection in the resubmitted arbitration, even though it arguably could have done so in respect of the majority of the measures invoked by the claimant. The key measures invoked, however, still fell within three years of the date of the resubmission. Similarly, in *Methanex*, the US did not raise a prescription objection following an agreement that the claimant did not claim any violation of NAFTA on the basis of the only measure that potentially ran afoul of the prescription period. While *Apotex* did purport to hold that \"there is support in previous NAFTA decisions for the proposition that the limitation period applicable to a discrete government or administrative measure (such as the FDA decision of 11 April 2006) is not tolled by litigation, or court decisions relating to the measure\", the decisions referred to do not support that conclusion. Both *Mondev* and *Grand River* dealt only with the question of the date on which the investor acquired knowledge of the alleged breaches and loss or damage arising therefrom, i.e. the starting date for the prescription period in respect of the measures alleged\u2014a denial of justice in *Mondev* and a series of related statutory measures subject to litigation in *Grand River* \u2014not any potential suspension of the prescription period. In any event, it is manifest that a submission to a national court does not constitute a \"submission to arbitration\" under Articles 10.16.4 and 10.18.1 of the Treaty or \"making a claim\" or \"submitting a claim\" under NAFTA for the purposes of Articles 1116(2), 1117(2), and 1121 thereof. *Apotex Inc. v. United States of America* \u00b8 ICSID Case No. UNCT/10/2, Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 14 June 2013 (Clifford M. Davidson, Fern M. Smith, Toby Landau (President)), \u00b6 328 (**CLA-26**).\n\n249.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant's notice of arbitration and statement of claim *in Renco I* suspended the prescription period of Article 10.18.1 - notwithstanding the fact that the Claimant was found, almost five years later, to have submitted a defective waiver. In this vein, what matters is that the notice of arbitration and statement of claim in *Renco I* met the requirements of Articles 3 and 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules301 and, therefore, amounted to a submission to arbitration within the (identical) meaning of both Articles 10.16.4 and Article 10.18.1.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that this is not disputed between the parties.\n\n250.\n\nThe Tribunal does not need to decide whether the suspension was triggered on 4 April 2011 (when the original notice of arbitration and statement of claim was filed) or 9 August 2011 (when the amended notice of arbitration and statement of claim was filed), because even the latter date was several months before three years elapsed from the alleged first breach on 10 March 2009.\n\n251.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant's claims are not time-barred pursuant to Article 10.18.1.As a result, the Tribunal does not need to pronounce itself on whether, based on the Respondent's behaviour in *Renco I*, the Respondent would have been precluded from objecting to the Claimant's claims being prescribed.\n\n**C. Costs of the Preliminary Phase**\n-------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nAs a final matter, the Tribunal turns to consider the issue of costs of this preliminary phase of the proceedings.\n\n253.\n\nBoth Parties have requested the Tribunal to order the other Party to bear the full costs of this preliminary phase.302\n\nMemorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 107; Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00b6 180.\n\n254.\n\nThe Tribunal has discretion to award costs under Article 10.20.6 of the Treaty, which provides:\n\nWhen it decides a respondent's objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant's claim or the respondent's objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.\n\n255.\n\nNotwithstanding its discretion to award costs at this juncture, the Tribunal considers it more appropriate to defer any decision on costs to a later phase of these proceedings.\n\n**VIII. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n---------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal:\n\n(a) **dismisses** the Respondent's preliminary objections under Articles 10.1.3 and 10.18.1 of the Treaty; and\n\n(b) **reserves** its decision on costs for a future decision."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Bifurcation)", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2020-09-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Bifurcation)\n------------------------------------\n\n**1 Procedural History**\n------------------------\n\n1.1.\n\nPursuant to the agreement of the Parties, this arbitration is being coordinated with *The Renco Group, Inc. and Doe Run Resources Corp. v. Republic of Peru and Activos Mineros S.A.C.*, PCA Case No. 2019-47 (the \"**Contract Case**\").\n\n1.2.\n\nOn 30 June 2020, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on Expedited Preliminary Objections dismissing the Respondent's Article 10.20.5 objections in this arbitration.\n\n1.3.\n\nOn 29 July 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (Decision on Bifurcation) in the Contract Case and invited the parties to confer regarding the further timetable for the proceedings for both arbitrations.\n\n1.4.\n\nOn 18 August 2020, the Respondents informed that the Parties had agreed only that the two cases would have parallel schedules with filing dates two weeks apart and concurrent hearings.\n\n1.5.\n\nBy letter dated 20 August 2020, the Claimants submitted their proposal for the timetable of the proceedings in both cases. Additionally, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal only address jurisdiction and liability in the present phase, and bifurcate quantum into a separate phase to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.\n\n1.6.\n\nBy letter dated 21 August 2020, the Respondents confirmed that the Parties had agreed to parallel timetables for the cases and hearings to be held around October 2022. However, the Respondents insisted on a single phase and proposed a different schedule. The Respondents further requested that the Tribunal deny the Claimant's bifurcation request. The Respondents also requested a decision on an early document production phase, including in particular with respect to documents relating to the St. Louis lawsuits.\n\n1.7.\n\nBy letter dated 27 August 2020, the Claimants replied to the Respondents' letter.\n\n1.8.\n\nBy letter dated 31 August 2020, the Respondents submitted a further reply of their own.\n\n**2 Bifurcation**\n-----------------\n\n2.1.\n\nThe Claimants request that the present phase of both the Contract Case and this case address issues of jurisdiction and liability only, and that quantum issues be bifurcated to a separate phase, in the event that the Claimants prevail on jurisdiction and liability. The Respondent opposes this request.\n\n2.2.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the Claimants' proposed bifurcation. The Tribunal considers that the various issues to be decided on jurisdiction and liability are *prima facie* serious and substantial and stand to dispose of, or at least significantly narrow, the issues to be decided in respect of remedies even if the Claimants should prevail.\n\n2.3.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal recalls the concern expressed regarding the volume of evidence from and relating to the St. Louis lawsuits that might have to be brought into the record of these proceedings, and the Respondent's warning in this regard. Bifurcation appears to be an efficient way to circumscribe the amount of evidence from those proceedings which needs to be produced at this stage of these proceedings, and to narrow it for any subsequent phase of proceedings on remedies, if any. It also thereby obviates the need for the contested preliminary document production phase requested by the Respondent.\n\n**3 Procedural Calendar**\n-------------------------\n\n3.1.\n\nThe procedural calendar for the arbitration adopted by the Tribunal is set forth in **Annex 1** to this Procedural Order.\n\n3.2.\n\nOn or before the date of the deadline for any written submission, the Party in question shall send the submission to the Tribunal, PCA, and opposing counsel, by e-mail or secure file-sharing platform, in accordance with the Terms of Appointment, in accordance with the rules and definitions set forth in Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n**So ordered by the Tribunal.**\n\n**Annex 1: Procedural Calendar**\n--------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Event** | **Date** |\n| Preliminary Document Production | N/A (Denied) |\n| Claimant's Memorial | Thursday, 25 January 2021 |\n| Respondent's Counter-Memorial | Monday, 26 July 2021 |\n| Non-Disputing State Party Submission | Friday, 1 October 2021 |\n| Potential Document Production Phase | 26 July-31 October 2021 |\n| Claimant's Reply on Liability and Response on Jurisdiction | Thursday, 25 November 2021 |\n| Respondent's Rejoinder on Liability and Reply on Jurisdiction | Monday, 25 April 2022 |\n| Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction | Monday, 25 July 2022 |\n| Hearing | October 2022 |"}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 9", "Type": "Preliminary Issues", "Date": "2023-12-21T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 9\n----------------------\n\n**1 Procedural History**\n------------------------\n\n1.1.\n\nPursuant to the agreement of the Parties, this arbitration (the \"**Treaty Case**\") is being coordinated with *The Renco Group, Inc. and Doe Run Resources Corp. v. Republic of Peru and Activos Mineros S.A.C.*, PCA Case No. 2019-47 (the \"**Contract Case**\").\n\n1.2.\n\nBy letter dated 1 September 2023, the Respondent (i) asserted that the Claimant had not responded to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections in the Claimant's Reply on Liability and Response on Jurisdiction and, thus, allowing it to do so \"for the first time in a subsequent pleading or at the hearing would violate [the Respondent's] due process rights and would be a manifest and fundamental departure from the rules of procedure\"; and (ii) requested the Tribunal to preclude the Claimant \"from responding to [the Respondent's] objections to jurisdiction in [the Claimant's] final written submission or presenting new arguments at hearing [it] could have raised (but chose not to raise) in [its Reply].\"\n\n1.3.\n\nBy letter dated 8 September 2023, the Claimant objected to the Respondent's request, (i) noting that it had properly responded to all the objections and that any purported absence of an argument was due to the Claimant not considering it necessary to restate the arguments of its Memorial; and (ii) agreeing \"conceptually that both sides should not be allowed to wait to make arguments in a later submission that properly should have been made part of an earlier submission\" but that this consideration should be made \"on a case-by-case basis with the benefit of all the submissions, evidence, and argument that the final hearing will afford.\"\n\n1.4.\n\nBy letter dated 14 September 2023, the Tribunal stated the following:\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties agree that a Party cannot make new arguments in a later submission that properly should have been made part of an earlier one. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not consider that any order is required at this stage. The Parties may apply to the Tribunal if and when they consider that the aforementioned rule has been breached, or they may address the timeliness and admissibility of any given submission in oral argument, as necessary, at the hearing.\n\n1.5.\n\nBy letter dated 14 November 2023, the Respondent (i) argued that the Claimant raised, in the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \"inappropriate and untimely liability arguments and jurisdictional arguments that [it] could have presented earlier but chose not to;\" and (ii) requested the Tribunal to strike the \"offending paragraphs\" of the Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and of the third expert report of Professor Payet submitted in the Contract Case (the \"**Third Payet Report**\"), and to order \"Renco and DRRC to clarify [\u2026] whether Peru remains a Respondent in the Contract Case.\"\n\n1.6.\n\nBy letter dated 21 November 2023, the Claimant (i) opposed the Respondent's request and disputed the assertions raised therein; and (ii) clarified that \"Renco continues to pursue claims against Peru in the Treaty [C]ase but is no longer pursuing claims against Peru in the Contract [C]ase.\"\n\n**2 Analysis**\n--------------\n\n2.1.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction violates the Tribunal's procedural orders and letters, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, and the Respondent's due process rights.1 According to the Respondent, the Claimant raised arguments regarding jurisdictional objections in the Treaty Case that it could have raised before but chose not to, breaching the previously agreed rule that \"a Party cannot make new arguments in a later submission that properly should have been made part of an earlier one.\"2 Regarding both cases, the Respondent considers that the Claimant addressed liability when it should have confined its arguments to jurisdiction.3\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 14 November 2023, pp. 1-2.\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 14 November 2023, p. 2, *citing* the Tribunal's Letter to the Parties dated 14 September 2023.\n\n*See generally* Respondent's Letter dated 14 November 2023.\n\n2.2.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent submits five requests, disputed by the Claimant,4 which the Tribunal addresses as follows.\n\n*See generally* Claimant's Letter dated 21 November 2023.\n\n*Striking of paragraphs 4-27 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.3.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal strike paragraphs 4-27 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, since they inappropriately address liability in relation to the fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\") claim in the Treaty Case without any relation to the Respondent's jurisdictional objections.5 According to the Claimant, those paragraphs simply answer the Respondent's argument in its Reply on Jurisdiction that the Claimant \"had not made its *prima facie* case under the Treaty.\"6\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 14 November 2023, pp. 3, 5.\n\nClaimant's Letter dated 21 November 2023, p. 2.\n\n2.4.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent has not raised a jurisdictional objection on the grounds that the Claimant failed to establish a *prima facie* case on its FET claim. Annex A of the Respondent's letter of 1 September 2023 confirms as much. Moreover, in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Claimant characterizes the disputed paragraphs not as a reply to any specific objection, but as addressing \"jurisdictionally based issues\"7 to show that \"the facts alleged by Renco would be capable of constituting a FET violation of the Treaty.\"8\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 2.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 4.\n\n2.5.\n\nHence, the Tribunal strikes paragraphs 4-27 from the record as they are unrelated and do not respond to any jurisdictional objection raised by the Respondent.\n\n*Striking of paragraphs 28-29 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.6.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal strike paragraphs 28-29 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, since they present arguments that the Claimant could have made before but did not regarding the Respondent's jurisdictional objection grounded on the Claimant's failure to establish a *prima facie* case on its expropriation claim.9 The Claimant makes the same argument that these paragraphs reply to the Respondent's objection that the Claimant \"had not made its *prima facie* case under the Treaty.\"10\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 14 November 2023, pp. 3, 5.\n\nClaimant's Letter dated 21 November 2023, p. 2.\n\n2.7.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that paragraphs 28-29 directly address the Respondent's jurisdictional objection that the Claimant failed to establish a *prima facie* case on its expropriation claim, citing facts, exhibits, and legal authorities already on the record and elaborating on arguments concerning the indirect expropriation claim already submitted in the Memorial. The Respondent has not explained how this constitutes a \"new argument\" or indicated any prejudice that would justify striking these submissions, especially considering that it may still respond to them at the hearing or in post-hearing submissions (if any are requested by the Tribunal). The Tribunal thus admits paragraphs 28-29.\n\n*Striking of paragraphs 55-77 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.8.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal strike paragraphs 55-77 of the Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction as they inappropriately address issues of liability in the Contract Case.11 In response, the Claimant submits that \"the line between jurisdiction and merits is reasonably debatable\" and, therefore, if the Tribunal deems that any of the Claimant's arguments are related to merits more than jurisdiction, the Tribunal may treat such arguments accordingly.12\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 14 November 2023, p 3.\n\nClaimant's Letter dated 21 November 2023, p. 3.\n\n2.9.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that paragraphs 55-65 and 74-77 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction deal with the merits of the case, as they relate to questions of contract interpretation concerning liability. The Tribunal therefore decides to strike these paragraphs.\n\n2.10.\n\nThe same is not true for paragraphs 66-73, as they relate to issues of admissibility. There is nothing on the record to show that the Parties agreed or the Tribunal decided to treat matters concerning admissibility as an issue of liability. While the Tribunal's orders have spoken of a division to be observed between issues of \"jurisdiction\" and \"liability\", it has never been clarified where issues of admissibility fall as between the two. The Claimant cannot therefore be regarded as having been on notice that it was precluded from raising any arguments on admissibility in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction. Paragraphs 66-73 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction are therefore admitted.\n\n*Striking of paragraphs 7, 9, 10(vii\u2013x), and 98-126 of the Third Payet Report*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.11.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal strike paragraphs 7, 9, 10(vii\u2013x), and 98-126 of the Third Payet Report submitted by the Claimant as they address liability in the Contract Case.13 The Claimant did not advance any further argument on this matter beyond those set forth above in relation to paragraphs 55-77 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction where those portions of the Third Payet Report are cited.\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 14 November 2023, p 3.\n\n2.12.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the disputed paragraphs of the Third Payet Report relate to the issues raised in paragraphs 66-73 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, which concern admissibility. Thus, having admitted paragraphs 66-73 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal also admits paragraphs paragraphs 7, 9, 10(vii\u2013x), and 98-126 of the Third Payet Report.\n\n*Clarification regarding the Contract Case*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n2.13.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal order Renco and DRRC \"to clarify whether they have dropped their minimum standard of treatment claim in the Contract Case, and as a corollary whether Peru remains a Respondent in the Contract Case.\"14 Given that the Claimant confirmed that it is \"no longer pursuing claims against Peru in the Contract [C]ase,\"15 the Tribunal considers that the issue has been resolved and makes no determination on the matter.\n\nRespondent's Letter dated 14 November 2023, p 5.\n\nClaimant's Letter dated 21 November 2023, p. 3.\n\n**3 Decision**\n--------------\n\n3.1.\n\nHaving considered the views expressed by the Parties and for the reasons given above, the Tribunal hereby decides to:\n\n3.1.1. strike paragraphs 4-27 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction;\n\n3.1.2. admit paragraphs 28-29 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction;\n\n3.1.3. strike paragraphs 55-65 and 74-77 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction;\n\n3.1.4. admit paragraphs 66-73 of the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction; and\n\n3.1.5. admit paragraphs 7, 9, 10(vii\u2013x), and 98-126 of the Third Payet Report.\n\n3.2.\n\nGiven the confirmation that claims are no longer pursued against the Republic of Peru in the Contract Case, the Contract Case shall henceforth be referred to as \"PCA Case N\u00b0 2019-47 \u2013 The Renco Group, Inc. & Doe Run Resources, Corp. v. Activos Mineros S.A.C.\".\n\n**So ordered by the Tribunal.**"}]}
