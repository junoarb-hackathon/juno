Pursuant to this principle, which lies at the very heart of the ICSID institution and mechanism, once the parties have consented to ICSID arbitration, they must refrain from initiating or pursuing proceedings in any other forum in respect of the subject matter of the dispute before ICSID. As stated in paragraph 32 of the Report of the Executive Directors:\n\nIt may be presumed that when a State and an investor agree to have recourse to arbitration, and do not reserve the right to have recourse to other remedies or require the prior exhaustion of local remedies, the intention of the parties is to have recourse to arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy.\n\n2.\n\nAccording to this basic principle, ICSID tribunals have repeatedly ruled:\n\n(a) that the parties to a dispute over which ICSID has jurisdiction must refrain from any measure capable of having a prejudicial effect on the rendering or implementation of an eventual ICSID award or decision, and in general refrain from any action of any kind which might aggravate or extend the dispute or render its resolution more difficult; and\n\n(b) that the parties must withdraw or stay any and all judicial proceedings commenced before national jurisdictions and refrain from commencing any further such proceedings in connection with the dispute before the ICSID tribunal.\n\n3.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides that\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that in the present instance the circumstances require that provisional measures be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party. The Ukrainian authorities \u2013 whether judicial or other \u2013 are, therefore, under the legal obligation to abstain from, and to suspend and discontinue, any proceedings before any domestic body, whether judicial or other, which might in any way jeopardize the principle of exclusivity of ICSID proceedings or aggravate the dispute before it. It is for the ICSID Tribunal, and for this Tribunal only, to determine whether there has been a breach of the 1994 Agreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Ukraine and Lithuania.\n\n4.\n\nIt is to be recalled that, according to a well-established principle laid down by the jurisprudence of the ICSID tribunals, provisional measures \"recommended\" by an ICSID tribunal are legally compulsory; they are in effect \"ordered\" by the tribunal, and the parties are under a legal obligation to comply with them.\n\n5.\n\nIt is also to be recalled that under paragraph 3 of Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules the Tribunal \"may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations\".\n\n6.\n\nIt is finally to be recalled that, as ICSID tribunals have repeatedly stated, the \"recommendation\" of provisional measures does not in any way prejudge the question of jurisdiction. It is, therefore, independently of the present Order on provisional measures that this Tribunal will have to rule on the jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent.\n\n7.\n\nConsequently, *the Tribunal unanimously decides* that:\n\n(a) Pending the resolution of the dispute now before the Tribunal, both parties shall refrain from, suspend and discontinue, any domestic proceedings, judicial or other, concerning Tokios Tokel\u00e9s or its investment in Ukraine, namely Taki Spravy \u2013 including those noted in the request for provisional measures and in the Claimant's letter of June 24, 2003 \u2013 which might prejudice the rendering or implementation of an eventual decision or award of this Tribunal or aggravate the existing dispute; and\n\n(b) Within 30 days hereof, each party shall notify the Tribunal about the actions taken in implementation of the present Order."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2004-04-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion by Mr. Prosper Weil (Decision on Jurisdiction)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2004-04-29T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Dissenting Opinion by Mr. Prosper Weil (Decision on Jurisdiction)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe chairman of an arbitral tribunal dissenting from a decision drafted by his two colleagues: this is not a frequent occurrence. If I have decided to dissent, it is because the approach taken by the Tribunal on the issue of principle raised in this case for the first time in ICSID\u2019s history is in my view at odds with the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention and might jeopardize the future of the institution. In other words, my dissent does not relate to any particular aspect of this brilliantly drafted Decision, or to any particular assessment of the facts, but rather to what I would call the philosophy of the Decision. I would fail in my duty if I were to conceal my doubts out of friendship for my colleagues.\n\n2.\n\nThe ICSID system rests on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States signed on 18 March 1965 (hereafter: the Convention), which had been formulated by the Executive Directors of the World Bank and to which both Lithuania and Ukraine are parties. The object and purpose of the Convention are set out in the *Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention* as well as in the provisions of the Convention itself.\n\n3.\n\nThe *Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention* explains that the creation of ICSID was \"designed to facilitate the settlement of disputes between States and foreign investors\" with a view to \"stimulating a larger flow of private international capital into those countries which wish to attract it.\"1 The *Report* explains that, while \"investment disputes are as a rule settled under the laws of the country in which the investment concerned is made,... both States and investors frequently consider that it is in their mutual interest to agree to resort to international methods of settlement\"2 It states that \"adherence to the Convention by a country would... stimulate a larger flow of private international investment into territories, which is the primary purpose of the Convention\",3 and adds that \"the broad objective of the Convention is to encourage a larger flow of private international investment\"4 The object of the Convention, so the *Report* explains, is to \"offer international methods of settlement designed to take account of the special characteristics of the disputes covered, as well as of the parties to whom it would apply.\"5\n\n*Report of the Executive Directors,* para. 9.\n\n*Op. cit.,* para 10.\n\n*Op. cit.,* para. 12.\n\n*Op. cit.,* para. 13.\n\n*Op. cit.,* para. 11.\n\n4.\n\nThe Convention, for its part, refers in its Preamble to \"the possibility that from time to time disputes may arise in connection with... investment between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States\". \"[W]hile such disputes, so the Preamble states, would usually be subject to national legal processes, international methods of settlement may be appropriate in certain cases\"; that is why it has been regarded as appropriate to establish \"facilities for international arbitration... to which Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting States may submit such disputes if they so desire.\" Accordingly, Article 25(1) of the Convention establishes the jurisdiction of the Centre over disputes \"between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State...\" Over other disputes the Centre has no jurisdiction.\n\n5.\n\nFrom this it appears that the ICSID arbitration mechanism is meant for *international* investment disputes, that is to say, for disputes between States and *foreign* investors. It is because of their ***international*** character, and with a view to stimulating private ***international*** investment, that these disputes may be settled, if the parties so desire, by an ***international*** judicial body. The ICSID mechanism is not meant for investment disputes between States and their own nationals. This is in effect not disputed by the Claimant since in its Opening Statement it declared that\n\n... this Convention has as its express purpose the encouragement of international private investment. We can agree with the Respondent that the ICSID Convention prohibits a host State from being sued by its own nationals with the single exception of the circumstances foreseen by the second clause of Article 25(2)(b).6\n\n*Opening Statement* of Tokios Tokeles, p. 5.\n\n6.\n\nThe Decision rests on the assumption that the origin of the capital is not relevant and even less decisive. This assumption is flying in the face of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention and system as explicitly defined both in the Preamble of the Convention and in the *Report of the Executive Directors.*\n\n7.\n\nThis, however, is not the only key feature of the ICSID mechanism that, in my view, the Decision ignores. Another one is that once this mechanism comes into play it is exclusive of any other remedy. As the *Report of the Executive Directors* states, \"[i] t may be presumed that when a State and an investor agree to have recourse to arbitration, and do not reserve the right to have recourse to other remedies..., the intention of the parties is to have recourse to arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy.\"7 That is why Article 26 of the Convention decides that consent to arbitration under the Convention \"shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy\". In particular, as provided for by Article 27, such consent shall be exclusive of diplomatic protection.\n\n*Report of the Executive Directors,* para. 32.\n\n8.\n\nIt appears, therefore, that because of its specific object and purpose - namely, the protection of international investments - the ICSID Convention imposes strict obligations and limitations on both the Contracting States and the investors who are nationals of other Contracting States. It prohibits the use of diplomatic protection and excludes the jurisdiction of domestic courts, for which it substitutes the recourse to its own, specific international arbitration mechanism. It follows that ICSID arbitral tribunals have to be particularly cautious when they determine their jurisdiction. An unwarranted extension of the ICSID arbitral jurisdiction would entail an unwarranted encroachment on both the availability of diplomatic protection and the jurisdiction of domestic courts.\n\n9.\n\nThe instant case opposes a Lithuanian corporation, Tokios Tokel\u00e9s, to Ukraine on measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against its wholly owned subsidiary, the Ukrainian corporation Taki Spravy, in alleged violation of the bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between Ukraine and Lithuania. As stated in the Decision, \"[t]here is no dispute that nationals of Ukraine own ninety-nine percent of the outstanding shares of Tokios Tokel\u00e9s and comprise two-thirds of its management\".8 Assuming that the dispute brought before the Tribunal meets the condition of \"arising directly out of an investment\" laid out in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, a question thus arises: Does the dispute fall into the category of \"disputes between States and nationals of other States\", as required by the very title of the Convention? Does it qualify as a dispute \"between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State\", as required by Article 25 of the Convention? In the affirmative, the Tribunal has to affirm its jurisdiction. In the negative, it has to deny it.\n\n*Decision,* para. 21.\n\n10.\n\nIt is, I think, the first time that an ICSID tribunal has to address the specific problem of a dispute opposing to State A (Ukraine) a corporation which has the nationality of State B (Lithuania) but which is controlled by citizens of State A (Ukraine) - so much so that the dispute, while formally meeting the condition of being between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State, is in actual fact between a Contracting State and a corporation controlled by nationals of that State. In some instances, there may be doubts about whether the corporation is, or is not, to be regarded as being controlled by nationals of the respondent State, and a choice will then have to be made between various possible criteria. In the present case, however, where Tokios Tokel\u00e9s is indisputably and totally in the hands of, and controlled by, Ukrainian citizens and interests, there is no evading the issue of principle.\n\n11.\n\nThe Decision rests on the idea that the Ukrainian origin of the capital invested by Tokios Tokel\u00e9s in Taki Spravy and the Ukrainian nationality of Tokios Tokel\u00e9s\u2019 shareholders and managers are irrelevant to the application of both the Convention and the BIT. What is relevant and decisive, according to the Decision, is the fact that the investment has been made by a corporation of Lithuanian nationality, whatever the origin of its capital and the nationality of its managers. The Decision dismisses any \"origin-of-capital requirement\", which, so it maintains, \"is plainly absent from the text\" of the relevant instruments and \"is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Treaty which... is to provide broad protection to investors and their investments in the territory of either party\":9\n\nThe origin of the capital is not relevant to the existence of an investment... [T]he ICSID Convention does not require an \u2018investment\u2019 to be financed from capital of any particular origin... The origin of the capital used to acquire these assets is not relevant to the question of jurisdiction under the Convention.10\n\nThe Decision goes so far as to state that\n\nEven assuming, *arguendo,* that all of the capital used by the Claimant to invest in Ukraine had its ultimate origin in Ukraine, the resulting investment would not be outside the scope of the Convention.11\n\n*Decision,* para. 77.\n\n*Decision,* paras. 80-81.\n\n*Decision,* para. 80. - This is what the Claimant has argued all along in its written pleadings. For example: \"...Nowhere in the relevant international treaties or national legislation is there exposed or implied the condition that the Claimant realize investments from non-Ukrainian sources... [T]he Respondent incorrectly attempts to impose the *sui generis* condition that the investment sources not originate from Ukraine...For an investment to be foreign it is sufficient to be made by a foreign juridical person, regardless of the funds used to realize the investment\" (Tokios Tokel\u00e9s\u2019 *Rejoinder,* p. 136, paras. 248-249; p. 139, para. 253.)\n\n12.\n\nThe Decision states that the Tribunal was \"guided by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention as well as Articles 1 and 8 of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT\".12 Insofar as the relations *inter partes* under the BIT are concerned, so the Decision maintains, the Contracting Parties are \"free to define their consent to jurisdiction in terms that are broad or narrow\";13 and \"it is not for tribunals to impose limits on the scope of BITs not found in the text\".14 As to the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunals, the provisions of the BIT are governing, so the Decision writes, \"as long as the dispute satisfies the objective requirements set forth in Article 25 of the Convention\"; therefore, tribunals should give effect to the consent of the Contracting Parties as expressed in the BIT \"unless doing so would allow the Convention to be used for purposes for which it clearly was not intended\".15 As a consequence, so the Decision concludes, \"[t]ribunals shall exercise jurisdiction over all disputes that fall within the scope of the Contracting Parties\u2019 consent as long as the dispute satisfies the objective requirements set forth in Article 25 of the Convention\".16\n\n*Decision,* para. 14.\n\n*Decision,* para. 39.\n\n*Decision,* para. 36.\n\n*Decision,* paras. 19 and 39.\n\n*Decision,* para. 19.\n\n13.\n\nThe Decision thus accepts, as a matter of principle, that the provisions of the BIT governing the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunals can be given effect only within the limits of the jurisdiction defined in the Convention. It refers to that effect to Broches\u2019 well-known phrase that the Convention determines the \"outer limits\"17 of the jurisdiction of the ICSID and its tribunals. In other words, it is within the limits determined by the basic ICSID Convention that the BITs may determine the jurisdiction and powers of the ICSID tribunal, and it is not for the Contracting Parties in their BIT to extend the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunal beyond the limits determined by the basic ICSID Convention. From this it follows that, while the Contracting Parties to the BIT are free to confer to the ICSID tribunal a jurisdiction narrower than that provided for by the Convention, it is not for them to extend the jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunal beyond its determination in the Convention.\n\nA. Broches, as quoted in para. 25 of the Decision.\n\n14.\n\nTo decide the jurisdictional issue the Decision should, therefore, have checked *first* whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction under Article 25 of the Convention - interpreted, as the Decision recalls, in light of its object and purpose18 - and *then,* in a second stage, whether it has jurisdiction *also* under the bilateral investment treaty. It is only if the tribunal had reached the conclusion that it has jurisdiction under the Convention that it would have had to examine whether it has jurisdiction *also* under the BIT. This, however, is not how the Decision proceeds. It states that \"we begin our analysis of this jurisdictional requirement by underscoring the deference this Tribunal owes to the definition of corporate nationality contained in the agreement between the Contracting Parties, in this case, the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT.\"19 And this is what it does: it begins with the \"Definition of \u2018investor\u2019 in Article 1(2) of the BIT\", and then in a second stage it turns to the \"Consistency of Article 1(2) of the BIT with the ICSID Convention\"20\n\n*Decision,* para. 27.\n\n*Decision,* para. 25.\n\n*Decision,* paras. 27 ff. and 42 ff.\n\n15.\n\nI now turn to what, in my view, should have been the first leg of the reasoning, namely, the question whether the basic requirements of Article 25 of the Convention are met. According to paragraph 1 of Article 25 the jurisdiction of the Centre extends to legal disputes \"between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State\". While Ukraine is beyond doubt a \"Contracting State\", the question arises whether for the purposes of this provision Tokios Tokel\u00e9s is to be regarded as \"a national of another Contracting State.\" Article 25(2)(b) defines this concept as\n\nany juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to... arbitration, and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\nThus, the question boils down to determining whether Tokios Tokel\u00e9s, even though undisputedly under Ukrainian control, is to be regarded as having \"the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute\", i.e., the nationality of Lithuania, or whether, because undisputedly under Ukrainian control, it is to be regarded, for the purposes of the Convention, as having the nationality of Ukraine.\n\n16.\n\nThe Decision states that \"[t]he Convention does not define the method for determining the nationality of juridical entities, leaving this task to the reasonable discretion of the Contracting Parties\"21, and it begins its analysis, as already mentioned, \"by underscoring the deference this Tribunal owes to the definition of corporate nationality contained in the agreement between the Contracting Parties.\"22 While it is true that no definition of the nationality of corporations is to be found in the Convention, it cannot be the case that this definition is left to the discretion of the Parties, because it is not for the Parties to extend the jurisdiction of ICSID beyond what the Convention provides for. It is the Convention which determines the jurisdiction of ICSID, and it is within the limits of the ICSID jurisdiction as determined by the Convention that the Parties may in their BIT define the disputes they agree to submit to an ICSID arbitration.\n\n*Decision,* para. 24.\n\n*Decision,* para. 25.\n\n17.\n\nThe central question before the Tribunal was thus as follows: Does Tokios Tokel\u00e9s meet the requirement of having, for the purposes of the Convention, the nationality of Lithuania - in which case the Tribunal has to affirm its jurisdiction -, or is it to be regarded for the purposes of the Convention as being an Ukrainian corporation because it is indisputably under Ukrainian control - in which case the Tribunal has no jurisdiction?\n\n18.\n\nThis question is answered by the Decision in the following way:\n\n... [I]n light of the object and purpose of the [BIT], the only relevant consideration is whether the Claimant is established under the laws of Lithuania. We find that it is. Thus, the Claimant is an investor of Lithuania under Article 1 (2)(b) of the BIT... We decline to look beyond (or through) the Claimant to its shareholders or other juridical entities that may have an interest in the claim... [T]he nationality of a corporation is determined on the basis of its *siege social* or place of incorporation... [T]he Claimant is an \"investor\" of Lithuania under Article 1 (2)(b) of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT based on its state-of-incorporation.23\n\n*Decision,* paras. 38, 40, 42, 43.\n\n19.\n\nThis raises the single most important issue which lies at the heart of my dissent. As observed earlier, the silence of the Convention on the criterion of corporate nationality does not leave the matter to the discretion of the Parties. According to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which the International Court of Justice has repeatedly described as the expression of customary international law, \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted... in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context and *in the light of its object and purpose\"24* It is indisputable, and indeed undisputed, that the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention and, by the same token, of the procedures therein provided for are not the settlement of investment disputes between a State and its own nationals. It is only the *international* investment that the Convention governs, that is to say, an investment implying a transborder flux of capital. This appears from the Convention itself, in particular from its Preamble which refers to \"the role of private international investment\" and, of course, from its Article 25. This appears also from the passages in the *Report of the Executive Directors* quoted above.25 As Professor Schreuer writes,\n\nThe basic idea of the Convention, as expressed in its title, is to provide for dispute settlement between States and foreign investors... Disputes between a State and its own nationals are settled by that State\u2019s domestic courts...  \nThe Convention is designed to facilitate the settlement of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States. It is not meant for disputes between States and their own nationals. The latter type of dispute is to be settled by domestic procedures, notably before domestic courts.26\n\nThe ICSID mechanism and remedy are not meant for investments made in a State by its own citizens with domestic capital through the channel of a foreign entity, whether preexistent or created for that purpose. To maintain, as the Decision does, that \"the origin of the capital is not relevant\" and that \"the only relevant consideration is whether the Claimant is established under the laws of Lithuania\"27 runs counter to the object and purpose of the whole ICSID system.\n\nItalics supplied\n\n*Supra,* para. 3.\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,* Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 158, para. 165, and p. 290, para. 496.\n\nSee *supra,* paras. 11 and 18.\n\n20.\n\nContrary to what the Decision maintains, when it comes to ascertaining the **international** character of an investment, the origin of the capital *is* relevant, and even decisive. True, the Convention does not provide a precise and clear-cut definition of the concept of **international** investment - no more than it provides a precise and clear-cut definition of the concept of *investment* and it is therefore for each ICSID tribunal to determine whether the specific facts of the case warrant the conclusion that it is before an international investment. Given the indisputable and undisputed Ukrainian character of the investment the Tribunal does not, in my view, give effect to the letter and spirit, as well as the object and purpose, of the ICSID institution.\n\n21.\n\nThe Decision stresses that \"none of the Claimant\u2019s conduct with respect to its status as an entity of Lithuania constitutes an abuse of legal personality\". The Claimant, so it observes, \"made no attempt whatever to conceal its national identity from the Respondent\" and \"manifestly did not create Tokios Tokel\u00e9s for the purpose of gaining access to ICSID arbitration under the BIT against Ukraine, as the enterprise was founded six years before the BIT between Ukraine and Lithuania entered into force. Indeed, there is no evidence in the record that the Claimant used its formal legal nationality for any improper purpose\"28\u00a0I agree; but this is beside the point, as is beside the point the issue of the \u2018lifting of the veil\u2019 under the *Barcelona Traction* judgment of the International Court of Justice.29 What *is* decisive in our case is the simple, straightforward, objective fact that the dispute before this ICSID Tribunal is not between the Ukrainian State and a foreign investor but between the Ukrainian State and an Ukrainian investor - and to such a relationship and to such a dispute the ICSID Convention was not meant to apply and does not apply. There is in this conclusion a merely objective, legal appreciation without any criticism of Tokios Tokel\u00e9s\u2019 or Taki spravy\u2019s way of organizing and handling their relations.\n\n*Decision,* para. 56.\n\n*Decision,* para. 54.\n\n22.\n\nIn support of the view it takes, the Decision refers to the provision in Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention according to which the concept of a \"national of a Contracting State\" extends to any juridical person \"which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\" The Decision maintains that\n\nThis exception to the general rule [of the *si\u00e8ge social]* applies only in the context of an agreement between the parties... [I]t limits the use of the control-test to the circumstances it describes, *i.e.,* when Contracting Parties agree to treat a national of the host State as a national of another Contracting Party because of foreign control. In the present case, the Claimant is not a national of the host State nor have the parties agreed to treat the Claimant as a national of a State other than its state of incorporation.30\n\nThe provision in Article 25(2)(b), so the Decision states, was meant \"to *expand* the jurisdiction of the Centre\"; to use the control-test \"to *restrict* the jurisdiction of the Centre would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of Article 25(2)(b)\".31\n\n*Decision,* paras. 44-45\n\n*Decision,* para. 46.\n\n23.\n\nI am unable to concur with this reading of Article 25(2)(b). The object and purpose of this provision is, provided the parties so agree, to have the reality of foreign investment prevail for the purposes of the Convention over its legally domestic character when - because the law of the host State so requires or for whatever other reason - this investment was made through the channel of a domestic corporation, whether preexistent or created for that purpose. The object and purpose of this provision is to give effect to the genuinely international character of an apparently national investment and, therefore, as Broches\u2019 comment cited in paragraph 46 of the Decision highlights, to prevent a genuinely foreign investment from being deprived of the protection of the ICSID mechanism because of its legally domestic structure. It is this very same rationale of giving effect to the economic reality over and above the legal structure that should have led the Tribunal to decide that an investment made in Ukraine by Ukrainian citizens with Ukrainian capital - albeit through the channel of a Lithuanian corporation - cannot benefit from the protection of the ICSID mechanism and, as a consequence, to deny Tokios Tokel\u00e9s, for the purposes of the Convention, the character of a \u2018foreign investor\u2019 in Ukraine. Since the object and purpose of this provision - and, for that matter, of the whole ICSID Convention and mechanism - is to protect *foreign* investment, it should not be interpreted so as to allow domestic, national corporations to evade the application of their domestic, national law and the jurisdiction of their domestic, national tribunals.\n\n24.\n\nThis is not a question of extending the control test at the expense of the rule of the *si\u00e8ge social.* This is simply giving effect to a provision the rationale of which is to grant the protection of the ICSID procedures to *all* genuinely international investments but, by the same token, *only* to genuinely international investments. Insofar as business law and issues of business liability are involved, there is no reason for denying effect to the corporate structure chosen by the economic agents. When it comes to mechanisms and procedures involving States and implying, therefore, issues of public international law, economic and political reality is to prevail over legal structure, so much so that the application of the basic principles and rules of public international law should not be frustrated by legal concepts and rules prevailing in the relations between private economic and juridical players. The object and purpose of the ICSID Convention is not - and its effect, therefore, should not be - to afford domestic, national corporations the means of evading the jurisdiction of their domestic, national tribunals.\n\n25.\n\nThis is borne out by previous ICSID cases which have upheld jurisdiction where the request had been made by a company member of a group of companies while the consent to arbitration had been expressed in an instrument concluded by another company of that group.32 In the words of the award in *Banro,*\n\n... in general, ICSID tribunals do not accept the view that their competence is limited by formalities, and rather they rule on their competence based on a review of the circumstances surrounding the case, and, in particular, the actual relationships among the companies involved. This jurisprudence reveals the willingness of ICSID tribunals to refrain from making decisions on their competence based on formal appearances, and to base their decision on a realistic assessment of the situation before them...\n\nThe problem... is not a choice between a flexible and realistic attitude or a formalistic and rigid attitude with respect to private law relationships between companies of the same group. The problem before the Tribunal involves considerations of international public policy and is governed by public international law.33\n\nAs Schreuer observes, the cases\n\n... show that the tribunals take a realistic attitude when identifying the party on the investor\u2019s side. They look for the actual foreign investor... The operation of ICSID clauses will not be frustrated through a narrow interpretation of the investor\u2019s identity.34\n\nOnce again, this is not a question of alleging, or sanctioning, any misconduct or fraud of either Tokios Tokel\u00e9s or its subsidiary Taki Spravy, or their management. This is only and exclusively a question of giving effect to the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention and, if I may say so, of preserving its integrity.\n\nSee for example *Holiday Inns v.

This does not mean that, in my view, ICSID tribunals should in each and every case, and as a matter of principle, set out to identify the \u2018real\u2019 investor in a situation involving multiple players. This does not mean that I would be inclined to ignore or put into question the flexible approach adopted in previous ICSID cases - in particular the *Holiday Inns* v. *Morocco* and *Fedax* v. *Venezuela* cases - to the overall issue of the extent and limits of the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, and more particularly to the key concepts of \u2018investment\u2019 or \u2018dispute arising directly out of an investment\u2019. No more is at issue in the instant case the sometimes difficult identification of the corporation within a group of corporations which has specifically to be taken into account for the purposes of determining the jurisdiction of ICSID. The situation in the instant case is crystal clear and in effect undisputed: it is a situation where there is simply no question of any foreign - whether Lithuanian or other -investment in Ukraine, and where there is a question only, and indisputably, of an Ukrainian investment in Ukraine. And to such a situation the ICSID Convention and the ICSID procedures are not meant to apply.\n\n28.\n\nParagraph 82 the Decision states that\n\nUkraine, Lithuania and other Contracting Parties chose their methods of defining corporate nationality and the scope of covered investment in BITs with confidence that ICSID arbitrators would give effect to those definitions. That confidence is premised on the ICSID Convention itself, which leaves to the reasonable discretion of the parties the task of defining key terms. We would be loathe to undermine it.\n\nWhile it may be for private parties within the framework of a private, purely commercial, contractual relationship \"to chose their methods of defining corporate nationality\", this does not hold true to the same extent when the application of the ICSID Convention is involved. The restrictions imposed on, and the rights accorded to, the parties by the Convention are based on the nationality of the party other than the \u2018Contracting State\u2019, and it cannot be assumed that the parties are free to dispose at will of these restrictions and rights by playing with the definition of corporate nationality. In particular, Article 26 provides that, unless otherwise stated, consent of the parties to arbitration under the Convention is exclusive of any other remedy, and Article 27 prohibits a Contracting State from giving diplomatic protection, or bringing an international claim, in respect of a dispute which one of its nationals and another Contracting State have consented to submit, or have submitted, to arbitration under the Convention, unless the State party to the dispute fails to honor the award rendered in that dispute.36 Chapter II of the Convention (\"Jurisdiction of the Centre\"), which, in the words of the *Report of the Executive Directors,* defines \"the limits within which the provisions of the Convention will apply and the facilities of the Centre will be available\",37 is the cornerstone of the system. Even assuming that the definition of these \"limits\" - in particular, the definition of the key term \"national of another Contracting Party\" - is left to the discretion of the Parties, this, as the Decision recognizes, holds true only insofar as this discretion is \"reasonable\".38 There can be no question of leaving unconditionally to the parties the task of determining the scope of application of the Convention along with the rights and duties it places upon both parties. This would frustrate the system by putting its extent in the hands of the parties and at their discretion, thus making the provisions of its Chapter II, and more particularly of its central and crucial Article 25, a purely optional clause. This, in my view, is unacceptable. This, however, is what the Decision does.\n\nSee *Report of the Executive Directors,* paras. 32-33.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 22.\n\n*Decision,* paras. 24, 25, 26, 82. - Cf. *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* Decision on Jurisdiction, Case No. ARB/00/5 (Sept. 27, 2001), 16 ICSID Review-FILJ 465 (2001), at para. 99 (\".... [T]o determine whether these objective requirements are met in a given case, one needs to refer to the parties\u2019 own understanding or definition. As long as the criteria chosen by the parties to define those requirements are reasonable, i.e. as long as the requirements are not deprived of their objective significance, there is no reason to discard the parties\u2019 choice.\")\n\n29.\n\nAs mentioned above, the provisions of the BIT have to be applied and interpreted within the limits of the Convention. The BIT cannot bestow jurisdiction on an ICSID tribunal beyond the jurisdiction bestowed on it by the ICSID Convention. As a consequence, once the conclusion is reached -as in my view it should have been - that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction under Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, the question whether Article 1(2) of the BIT is to be read as giving it jurisdiction becomes moot. I can, therefore, dispense with discussing paragraphs 27 to 41 of the Decision.\n\n30.\n\nTo sum up: The ICSID mechanism and remedy are not meant for, and are not to be construed as, allowing - and even less encouraging - nationals of a State party to the ICSID Convention to use a foreign corporation, whether preexistent or created for that purpose, as a means of evading the jurisdiction of their domestic courts and the application of their national law. It is meant to protect - and thus encourage - *international* investment. It is regrettable, so it seems to me, to put the extraordinary success met by ICSID at risk by extending its scope and application beyond the limits so carefully assigned to it by the Convention. This might dissuade Governments either from adhering to the Convention or, if they have already adhered, from providing for ICSID arbitration in their future BITs or investment contracts."}], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\nI. **The Dispute**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant, Tokios Tokeles, is a business enterprise established under the laws of Lithuania. It was founded as a cooperative in 1989, and, since 1991, has been registered as a \"closed joint-stock company.\" The Claimant is engaged primarily in the business of advertising, publishing and printing in Lithuania and outside its borders.\n\n2.\n\nIn 1994, Tokios Tokeles created Taki spravy, a wholly owned subsidiary established under the laws of Ukraine. Taki spravy is in the business of advertising, publishing, and printing, and related activities in Ukraine and outside its borders. The Claimant made an initial investment of USD 170,000 in Taki spravy in 1994, consisting of office furniture, printing equipment, and the construction of and repairs to office facilities. Since that time, the Claimant has reinvested the profits of Taki spravy in the subsidiary, purchasing additional printing equipment, computer equipment, bank shares, and automobiles. The Claimant asserts that it has invested a total of more than USD 6.5 million in its Ukrainian subsidiary in the period 1994-2002.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant, Tokios Tokeles, alleges that governmental authorities in Ukraine engaged in a series of actions with respect to Taki spravy that breach the obligations of the bilateral investment treaty between Ukraine and Lithuania (\"Ukraine-Lithuania BIT\" or \"Treaty\").1 The Claimant contends that, beginning in February 2002, the Respondent engaged in a series of unreasonable and unjustified actions against Taki spravy that adversely affected the Claimant\u2019s investment. The Claimant alleges that governmental authorities of the Respondent: (1) conducted numerous and invasive investigations under the guise of enforcing national tax laws; (2) pursued unsubstantiated actions in domestic courts, including actions to invalidate contracts entered into by Taki spravy; (3) placed the assets of Taki spravy under administrative arrest; (4) unreasonably seized financial and other documents; and (5) falsely accused Taki spravy of engaging in illegal activities. The Claimant argues that the governmental authorities took these actions in response to the Claimant\u2019s publication in January 2002 of a book that favorably portrays a leading Ukrainian opposition politician, Yulia Tymoshenko.\n\nAgreement between the Government of Ukraine and the Government of the Republic of Lithuania for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, Feb. 8, 1994 (entered into force on Feb. 27, 1995) (\"Ukraine-Lithuania BIT\"). The Treaty was done in the \"Ukrainian, Lithuanian and English languages, both texts being equally authentic. In case of devergency [sic] of interpretation the English text shall prevail.\" *Id.* at 11.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it objected to this treatment by the governmental authorities of the Respondent and made multiple unsuccessful efforts to settle the dispute. These efforts included meeting with local tax officials, sending written complaints to tax and law enforcement officials, and sending a letter of appeal to the President of Ukraine. In each case, the Claimant contends, these efforts were unsuccessful and the governmental action complained of by the Claimant continued.\n\nII. **Procedural History**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant initiated this proceeding on 14 August 2002, when it filed a Request for Arbitration (\"RFA\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") along with its wholly owned subsidiary, Taki spravy. The RFA included letters of consent to arbitration from Tokios Tokeles and Taki spravy dated August 7 and August 9, respectively. In the RFA, the Claimants alleged that various actions by Ukrainian governmental authorities during 2002 constituted violations of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT.\n\n6.\n\nThe requesting parties filed a supplement to their request on September 4, 2002, seeking, among other damages, just and adequate compensation for the losses sustained by Tokios Tokeles and Taki spravy for the requisitioning and destruction of their property by Ukraine\u2019s forces or authorities.\n\n7.\n\nOn October 15, 2002, ICSID notified the requesting parties that the dispute had not been subject to negotiation for a period of six months as required by Article 8 of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT. On October 17, 2002, the requesting parties withdrew their RFA until such time as it \"may be renewed and resubmitted for consideration to the Centre.\" The RFA was reinstated by Tokios Tokeles and Taki spravy on November 22, 2002.\n\n8.\n\nOn December 6, 2002, ICSID notified the requesting parties that Ukraine and Lithuania had not agreed that Taki spravy, an entity organized under the laws of Ukraine, should be treated as national of Lithuania under Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\" or \"Convention\"2) and Article 1 (2)(c) of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT. In response, Tokios Tokeles removed Taki spravy as a requesting party on December 9, 2002, which ICSID acknowledged in a letter on the same date.\n\nUkraine and Lithuania became parties to the ICSID Convention on July 7, 2000, and Aug. 5, 1992, respectively. *See* ICSID, \"List of Contracting States and other Signatories of the Convention (as of November 3, 2003)\" *available at* http://www.worldbank.org/icdis/constate/c-states-en.htm\n\n9.\n\nOn December 9, 2002, Ukraine requested of ICSID the opportunity to present preliminary observations on jurisdiction prior to the registration of the RFA. In Ukraine\u2019s view, the content of the RFA might have prompted the Secretary-General not to register the same because, pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of the Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings, \"the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre.\" After receiving the views of both Ukraine and the requesting party, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the RFA on December 20, 2002.\n\n10.\n\nTo constitute the Tribunal, the Claimant chose the option provided in Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention to constitute the Tribunal, which provides for each party to appoint one arbitrator and the two parties to agree on the third arbitrator to serve as President of the Tribunal. In March 2003, the Claimant appointed Mr. Daniel Price, a national of the United States, and Ukraine appointed Professor Piero Bernardini, a national of Italy. When the parties were unable to agree on the President of the Tribunal, the Claimant requested that the Chairman of the Administrative Council appoint the presiding arbitrator, pursuant to Article 38 of the Convention and Rule 4(1) of the Arbitration Rules. After consultation with the parties, Professor Prosper Weil, a national of France, was appointed to serve as President of the Tribunal. The Tribunal was officially constituted on April 29, 2003 and Ms. Martina Polasek was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal held its first session on June 3, 2003, in Paris, France. At this session, the Respondent raised objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and requested that the proceeding be bifurcated so that jurisdiction could be addressed first and separately from the merits of the case. The Claimant opposed this request, arguing that the merits of the case are inextricably linked to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. In addition, the Claimant submitted a request for provisional measures, namely, the suspension of parallel court proceedings in Ukraine and investigations being conducted by Ukrainian tax authorities, which the Claimant argued could seriously impact its rights. The Respondent opposed this request.\n\n12.\n\nAfter receiving written submissions from the parties, on July 1, 2003, the Tribunal granted the Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures and the Respondent\u2019s request to bifurcate the proceedings.\n\n13.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s order, the Respondent filed its memorial on jurisdiction on July 29, 2003, and the Claimant filed its counter-memorial on August 25, 2003. The Respondent\u2019s reply and the Claimant\u2019s rejoinder were filed on September 9 and September 24, 2003, respectively. On December 10, 2003, the Tribunal held an oral hearing on jurisdiction in Paris, France.\n\nIII. **Relevant Legal Provisions**\n----------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn reaching its majority decision on jurisdiction,3 this Tribunal is guided by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention as well as Articles 1 and 8 of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT.\n\nThe dissenting opinion of Professor Weil is attached to this Decision.\n\n15.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention sets forth the objective criteria for ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction and provides in relevant part:\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State...and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) National of another Contracting State means:\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\n16.\n\nArticle 8 of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT sets forth the disputes that may be submitted to international arbitration:\n\n(1) Any dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party in connection with an investment on the territory of that other Contracting Party shall be subject to negotiations between the parties in dispute.\n\n(2) If any dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party can not be thus settled within a period of six months, the investor shall be entitled to submit the case to:\n\n(a) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)....\n\n17.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the BIT defines \"investment\" as \"every kind of asset invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter....\" The definition includes a non-exhaustive list of the forms that an investment may take, such as \"(a) movable and immovable property...(b) shares [and] stocks...(c) claims to money....\" Article 1(1) further provides that \"[a]ny alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their character as investment provided that such an alteration is made in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the investment has been made.\"\n\n18.\n\nArticle 1(2) defines \"investor\" as:\n\n(a) in respect of Ukraine:\n\n- natural person [sic] who are nationals of the Ukraine according to Ukrainian laws;\n\n- any entity established in the territory of the Ukraine in conformity with its laws and regulations;\n\n(b) in respect of Lithuania:\n\n- natural person [sic] who are nationals of the Republic of Lithuania according to Lithuanian laws;\n\n- any entity established in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania in conformity with its laws and regulations;\n\n(c) in respect of either Contracting Party - any entity or organization established under the law of any third State which is, directly or indirectly, controlled by nationals of that Contracting Party or by entities having their seat in the territory of that Contracting Party; it being understood that control requires a substantial part in the ownership.\n\n19.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre depends first and foremost on the consent of the Contracting Parties, who enjoy broad discretion to choose the disputes that they will submit to ICSID.4 Tribunals shall exercise jurisdiction over all disputes that fall within the scope of the Contracting Parties\u2019 consent as long as the dispute satisfies the objective requirements set forth in Article 25 of the Convention.\n\n*See* Report of the Executive Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, 1 ICSID Reports 28, at para. 23 (stating that \"[c]onsent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre\") (\"Executive Directors\u2019 Report\").\n\n20.\n\nBased on Article 25 of the Convention and the BIT, this Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute if the following requirements are met: (1) the Claimant is an investor of one Contracting Party; (2) the Claimant has an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party; (3) the dispute arises directly from the investment; and (4) the parties to the dispute have consented to ICSID jurisdiction over it. We turn now to examine the Respondent\u2019s arguments that these requirements have not been met.\n\nIV. **Analysis of Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. First Objection: Claimant Is Not a Genuine \"Investor\" of Lithuania**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Arguments of the Respondent**\n----------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute that the Claimant is a legally established entity under the laws of Lithuania. The Respondent argues, however, that the Claimant is not a \"genuine entity\" of Lithuania first because it is owned and controlled predominantly by Ukrainian nationals. There is no dispute that nationals of Ukraine own ninety-nine percent of the outstanding shares of Tokios Tokeles and comprise two-thirds of its management.5 The Respondent also argues, but the Claimant strongly contests, that Tokios Tokeles has no substantial business activities in Lithuania and maintains its *si\u00e8ge social,* or administrative headquarters, in Ukraine. The Respondent contends, therefore, that the Claimant is, in terms of economic substance, a Ukrainian investor in Lithuania, not a Lithuanian investor in Ukraine.\n\nMessrs. Sergiy Danylov and Oleksandr Danylov, who are nationals of Ukraine, own ninety-nine percent of the shares in Tokios Tokeles, and Ms. Ludmilla Zhyltsova, a national of Lithuania, owns the remaining one percent. *See* Request for Arbitration, at Annex 6, \"Statute of the Closed Joint-Stock Company \u2018Tokios Tokeles\u2019\" at para. 3.6. Messrs. Danylov and Ms. Zhyltsova serve as managers of Tokios Tokeles. *See id.* at Annex 7.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent argues that to find jurisdiction in this case would be tantamount to allowing Ukrainian nationals to pursue international arbitration against their own government, which the Respondent argues would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention.6 To avoid this result, the Respondent asks the Tribunal to \"pierce the corporate veil,\" that is, to disregard the Claimant\u2019s state of incorporation and determine its nationality according to the nationality of its predominant shareholders and managers, to what the Respondent contends is the Claimant\u2019s lack of substantial business activity in Lithuania, and to the alleged situs of its *si\u00e8ge social* in Ukraine.\n\n\"The Convention is designed to facilitate the settlement of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States. It is not meant for disputes between States and their own nationals.\" Christoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary 290 (2001).\n\n23.\n\nIn support of its request to \"pierce the corporate veil,\" the Respondent makes three arguments, which we encapsulate as follows:\n\n\u2022 The context in which the ICSID Convention and the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT reference and define corporate nationality allows the Tribunal to disregard the Claimant\u2019s state of incorporation and determine its corporate nationality based on the nationality of its controlling shareholders, i.e., to pierce the corporate veil;\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal should pierce the corporate veil of the Claimant in this case because allowing an enterprise that is established in Lithuania but owned and controlled predominantly by Ukrainians to pursue ICSID arbitration against Ukraine is contrary to the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention and the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT, namely, to provide a forum for the settlement of *international* disputes; and\n\n\u2022 The jurisprudence of ICSID arbitration supports the use of a \"control-test\" rather than state of incorporation to define the nationality of juridical entities and it also supports piercing the corporate veil in certain circumstances that apply in the present case.\n\n**2. Nationality of Juridical Entities under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nArticle 25 of the Convention requires that, in order for the Centre to have jurisdiction, a dispute must be between \"a Contracting State... and *a national of another Contracting State..*.,\"7 Article 25(2)(b) defines \"national of another Contracting State,\" to include \"any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute....\" The Convention does not define the method for determining the nationality of juridical entities, leaving this task to the reasonable discretion of the Contracting Parties.8\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n*See* Aron Broches, \"The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States,\" 136 Recueildes Cours 331, 359-60 (1972-11).\n\n25.\n\nThus, we begin our analysis of this jurisdictional requirement by underscoring the deference this Tribunal owes to the definition of corporate nationality contained in the agreement between the Contracting Parties, in this case, the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT. As Mr. Broches explained, the purpose of Article 25(2)(b) is not to define corporate nationality but to:\n\n...indicate the outer limits within which disputes may be submitted to conciliation or arbitration under the auspices of the Centre with the consent of the parties thereto. Therefore *the parties should be given the widest possible latitude to agree on the meaning of \u2018nationality \u2019 and any stipulation of nationality made in connection with a conciliation or arbitration clause which is based on a reasonable criterion\"9*\n\n*Id.* at 361 (emphasis added); *see also* C.F. Amerasinghe, \"Interpretation of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention,\" in International Arbitration in the 21st Century: Towards \"Judicialization\" and Uniformity 223, 232 (R. Lillich and C. Brower eds. 1993).\n\n26.\n\nIn the specific context of BITs, Professor Schreuer notes that the Contracting Parties enjoy broad discretion to define corporate nationality: \"[d]efinitions of corporate nationality in national legislation or in treaties providing for ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction will be controlling for the determination of whether the nationality requirements of Article 25(2)(b) have been met.\"10 He adds, \"[a]ny reasonable determination of the nationality of juridical persons contained in national legislation or in a treaty should be accepted by an ICSID commission or tribunal.\"11\n\nSchreuer, at 286.\n\n*Id.*\n\n**3. Definition of \"Investor\" in Article 1(2) of the BIT**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nAs have other tribunals, we interpret the ICSID Convention and the Treaty between the Contracting Parties according to the rules set forth in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, much of which reflects customary international law.12 Article 31 of the Vienna Convention provides that \"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.\"13\n\n*See, e.g., Mondev Int \u2019I Ltd v. United States of America,* Award, Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2 (Oct. 11, 2002) 42 I.L.M. 85 (2003), at para. 43; *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain,* Decision on Jurisdiction, Case No. ARB/97/7 (Jan. 25, 2000), at para. 27; *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States,* Award, Case No. ARB(AF)/98/2 (June 2, 2000), 40 I.L.M. 56 (2001), at n. 2.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, art. 31(1) (May 22, 1969).\n\n28.\n\nArticle 1 (2)(b) of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT defines the term \"investor,\" with respect to Lithuania, as \"any *entity established* in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania in conformity with its laws and regulations.\"14 The ordinary meaning of \"entity\" is \"[a] thing that has a real existence.\"15 The meaning of \"establish\" is to \"[s]et up on a permanent or secure basis; bring into being, found (a...business).\"16 Thus, according to the ordinary meaning of the terms of the Treaty, the Claimant is an \"investor\" of Lithuania if it is a thing of real legal existence that was founded on a secure basis in the territory of Lithuania in conformity with its laws and regulations. The Treaty contains no additional requirements for an entity to qualify as an \"investor\" of Lithuania.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\nThe New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 830 (Thumb Index Edition 1993).\n\n*Id.* at 852.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimant was founded as a cooperative in 1989 and was registered by the municipal government of Vilnius, Lithuania on August 9 of that year.17 In 1991, the founders of Tokios Tokeles agreed to reorganize the cooperative into a closed joint-stock company, which the municipal government of Vilnius, Lithuania registered on May 2, 1991.18 According to the Certificate of Enterprise, the address of Tokios Tokeles is Vilnius, vul. Seskines, 13-3. On August 11, 2000, the Ministry of the Economy of the Republic of Lithuania re-registered the Claimant as an enterprise and re-registered the Claimant\u2019s governing statute, both of which note the company\u2019s location as Sheshkines, 13-3 (or d. 13 kv. 3), Vilnius.19 The Claimant, therefore, is a thing of real legal existence that was founded on a secure basis in the territory of Lithuania. The registration of Tokios Tokeles by the Lithuanian Government indicates that it was founded in conformity with the laws and regulations of that country. According to the ordinary meaning of Article 1 (2)(b), therefore, the Claimant is an investor of Lithuania.\n\nClaimant\u2019s June 20, 2003 Submission of Documents, Vol. V, Annex 10.\n\n*Id.* at Annex 13.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at Annexes 5-6.\n\n30.\n\nArticle 1 (2)(c) of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT, which defines \"investor\" with respect to entities not established in Ukraine or Lithuania, provides relevant context for the interpretation of Article 1 (2)(a) and (b). Article 1 (2)(c) extends the scope of the Treaty to entities incorporated in third countries using other criteria to determine nationality\u2014namely, the nationality of the individuals who control the enterprise and the *si\u00e8ge social* of the entity controlling the enterprise. The Respondent argues that the existence of these alternative methods of defining corporate nationality to *extend* the benefits of the BIT in Article 1 (2)(c) should also allow these methods to be used to *deny* the benefits of the BIT under Article 1 (2)(b). If the Contracting Parties had intended these alternative methods to apply to entities legally established in Ukraine or Lithuania, however, the parties would have included them in Article 1(2)(a) or (b) respectively as they did in Article 1 (2)(c). However, the purpose of Article 1 (2)(c) is only to extend the definition of \"investor\" to entities established under the law of a third State provided certain conditions are met. Under the well established presumption *expressio unius est exclusio alterius,* the state of incorporation, not the nationality of the controlling shareholders or *si\u00e8ge social,* thus defines \"investors\" of Lithuania under Article 1 (2)(b) of the BIT.\n\n31.\n\nThe object and purpose of the Treaty likewise confirm that the control-test should not be used to restrict the scope of \"investors\" in Article 1 (2)(b). The preamble expresses the Contracting Parties\u2019 intent to \"intensify economic cooperation to the mutual benefit of both States\" and \"create and maintain favourable conditions for investment of investors of one State in the territory of the other State.\" The Tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines* interpreted nearly identical preambular language in the Philippines-Switzerland BIT as indicative of the treaty\u2019s broad scope of investment protection.20 We concur in that interpretation and find that the object and purpose of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT is to provide broad protection of investors and their investments.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA. v. Republic of the Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction, Case No. ARB/02/6 (Jan. 29, 2004), at para. 116 (\"The BIT is a treaty for the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments. According to the preamble it is intended \u2018to create and maintain favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other.\u2019 It is legitimate to resolve uncertainties in its interpretation so as to favour the protection of covered investments.\") (\".SGS, *v. Philippines'\").*\n\n32.\n\nThe object and purpose of the Treaty are also reflected in the Treaty text. Article 1, which sets forth the scope of the BIT, defines \"investor\" as *\"any* entity\" established in Lithuania or Ukraine as well as *\"any* entity\" established in third countries that is controlled by nationals of or by entities having their seat in Lithuania or Ukraine. Thus, the Respondent\u2019s request to *restrict* the scope of covered investors through a control-test would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Treaty, which is to provide broad protection of investors and their investments.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that jurisdiction should be denied because, in its view, the Claimant does not maintain \"substantial business activity\" in Lithuania. The Respondent correctly notes that a number of investment treaties allow a party to deny the benefits of the treaty to entities of the other party that are controlled by foreign nationals and that do not engage in substantial business activity in the territory of the other party.\n\n34.\n\nFor example, the Ukraine-United States BIT states, \"[e]ach Party reserves the right to deny to any company the advantages of this treaty if *nationals of any third* *country* control such company and, in the case of a company of the other Party, that company has no substantial business activities in the territory of the other Party... \"21 Similarly, the Energy Charter Treaty, to which both Ukraine and Lithuania are parties, allows each party to deny the benefits of the agreement to \"a legal entity if *citizens or nationals of a third state* own or control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized.\"22\n\nTreaty between the United States of America and Ukraine Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, Mar. 4, 1994, at art. 1(2) (entered into force Nov. 16, 1996) (emphasis added).\n\nThe Energy Charter Treaty, Annex 1 to the Final Act of the European Energy Charter Conference, at art. 17(1), Dec. 16-17, 1994, Lisbon, Portugal, available at http://www.encharter.0rg/upl0ad/l/TreatyB00k-en.pdf (emphasis added).\n\n35.\n\nIn addition, a number of investment treaties of other States enable the parties to deny the benefits of the treaty to entities of the other party that are controlled by nationals of the denying party and do not have substantial business activity in the other party. For example, the BIT between the United States and Argentina provides that \"[e]ach Party reserves the right to deny to any company of the other Party the advantages of this Treaty if (a) nationals of any third country, *or nationals of such Party,* control such company and the company has no substantial business activities in the territory of the other Party....\"23\n\nTreaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment, Nov. 14, 1991, at art. 1(2).\n\n36.\n\nThese investment agreements confirm that state parties are capable of excluding from the scope of the agreement entities of the other party that are controlled by nationals of third countries or by nationals of the host country. The Ukraine-Lithuania BIT, by contrast, includes no such \"denial of benefits\" provision with respect to entities controlled by third-country nationals or by nationals of the denying party. We regard the absence of such a provision as a deliberate choice of the Contracting Parties. In our view, it is not for tribunals to impose limits on the scope of BITs not found in the text, much less limits nowhere evident from the negotiating history. An international tribunal of defined jurisdiction should not reach out to exercise a jurisdiction beyond the borders of the definition. But equally an international tribunal should exercise, and indeed is bound to exercise, the measure of jurisdiction with which it is endowed.24\n\n*See, e.g., Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal (formerly Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux) v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on Annulment, Case No. ARB/97/3 (July 3, 2002). \"In the Committee\u2019s view, the Tribunal, faced with such a claim and having validly held that it had jurisdiction, was obliged to consider and to decide it.\" *Id.* at para. 112. \"[T]he Committee concludes that the Tribunal exceeded its powers in the sense of Article 52(1)(b), in that the Tribunal, having jurisdiction over the Tucuman claims, failed to decide those claims.\" *Id.* at para. 115.\n\n37.\n\nWe note that the Claimant has provided the Tribunal with significant information regarding its activities in Lithuania, including financial statements, employment information, and a catalogue of materials produced during the period of 1991 to 1994.25 While these activities would appear to constitute \"substantial business activity,\" we need not affirmatively decide that they do, as it is not relevant to our determination of jurisdiction.\n\nClaimant\u2019s December 30, 2003 Submission of Documents, Annexes 1-11, Catalogues of Publications of Tokios Tokeles for 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994.\n\n38.\n\nRather, under the terms of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT, interpreted according to their ordinary meaning, in their context, and in light of the object and purpose of the Treaty, the only relevant consideration is whether the Claimant is established under the laws of Lithuania. We find that it is. Thus, the Claimant is an investor of Lithuania under Article 1 (2)(b) of the BIT.\n\n39.\n\nWe reach this conclusion based on the consent of the Contracting Parties, as expressed in the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT. We emphasize here that Contracting Parties are free to define their consent to jurisdiction in terms that are broad or narrow; they may employ a control-test or reserve the right to deny treaty protection to claimants who otherwise would have recourse under the BIT. Once that consent is defined, however, tribunals should give effect to it, unless doing so would allow the Convention to be used for purposes for which it clearly was not intended.\n\n40.\n\nThis Tribunal, by respecting the definition of corporate nationality in the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT, fulfills the parties\u2019 expectations, increases the predictability of dispute settlement procedures, and enables investors to structure their investments to enjoy the legal protections afforded under the Treaty. We decline to look beyond (or through) the Claimant to its shareholders or other juridical entities that may have an interest in the claim. As the tribunal in *Amco Asia Corp. v. Indonesia* said in rejecting the respondent\u2019s request to attribute to the claimant the nationality of its controlling shareholder, the concept of nationality in the ICSID Convention is:\n\n...a classical one, based on the law under which the juridical person has been incorporated, the place of incorporation and the place of the social seat. An exception is brought to this concept in respect of juridical persons having the nationality, thus defined, of the Contracting state party to the dispute, where said juridical persons are under foreign control. *But no exception to the classical concept is provided for when it comes to the nationality of the foreign controller, even supposing\u2014which is not at all clearly stated in the Convention\u2014that the fact that the controller is the national of one or another foreign State is to be taken into account....26*\n\n*Amco Asia Corp, and Others v. Republic of Indonesia,* Decision on Jurisdiction, Case No. ARB/81/1 (Sept 25, 1983), 1 ICSID Reports 389, 396 (emphasis added) (\"Amco\").\n\n41.\n\nThus, the decision of this Tribunal with respect to the nationality of the Claimant is consistent with *Amco Asia* and other ICSID jurisprudence, as will be discussed further below.\n\n**4. Consistency of Article 1(2) of the BIT with the ICSID Convention**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nIn our view, the definition of corporate nationality in the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT, on its face and as applied to the present case, is consistent with the Convention and supports our analysis under it. Although Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention does not set forth a required method for determining corporate nationality, the generally accepted (albeit implicit) rule is that the nationality of a corporation is determined on the basis of its *si\u00e8ge social* or place of incorporation.27 Indeed, \"ICSID tribunals have uniformly adopted the test of incorporation or seat rather than control when determining the nationality of a juridical person.\"28 Moreover, \"[t]he overwhelming weight of the authority...points towards the traditional criteria of incorporation or seat for the determination of corporate nationality under Art. 25(2)(b).\"29 As Professor Schreuer notes, \"[a] systematic interpretation of Article 25(2)(b) would militate against the use of the control test for a corporation\u2019s nationality.\"30\n\nSchreuer, at 278-79; *see also* G.R. Delaume, \"ICSID Arbitration and the Courts,\" 77 Amer. J. Int\u2019l Law 784, 793-94 (1983); M. Hirsch, The Arbitration Mechanism of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes 85 (1993).\n\nSchreuer, at 279-80 (citing *Kaiser Bauxite Company v. Jamaica,* Decision on Jurisdiction, Case No. ARB/74/3 (July 6, 1975), 1 ICSID Reports 296, 303 (1993); *SOABI v. Senegal,* Decision on Jurisdiction, Case No. ARB/82/1 (Aug. 1, 1984), 2 ICSID Reports 175, 180-81; *Amco,* at 396); *see also* *Autopista Concesionada de Venezuela, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* Decision on Jurisdiction, Case No. ARB/00/5 (Sept 27, 2001), 16 ICSID Review-FILJ 469 (2001), at para. 108 (\u2018 *Autopista\").*\n\nSchreuer, at 281.\n\n*Id.* at 278.\n\n43.\n\nAs discussed above, the Claimant is an \"investor\" of Lithuania under Article 1 (2)(b) of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT based on its state-of-incorporation. Although not required by the text of the Treaty, an assessment of the *si\u00e8ge social* of the Claimant leads to the same conclusion. Among the relevant evidence of *si\u00e8ge social,* the Claimant\u2019s registration certificate (issued by the Ministry of the Economy of Lithuania),31 its statute of incorporation,32 and each of the Claimant\u2019s \"Information Notices of Payment of Foreign Investment\" (registered by Ukrainian governmental authorities),33 all record the Claimant\u2019s address as Vilnius, Lithuania. Contrary to the assertion of the Respondent, a nationality test of *si\u00e8ge social* leads to the same result as one based on state of incorporation.34\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at Annex 5.\n\n*Id.* at Annex 6.\n\n*Id.* at Annex 13.\n\nThis is not a surprising result. *See* D.P. O\u2019Connell, 2 International Law 1041 (2d. ed. 1970) (stating, \"[u]nder French law it is not possible for a corporation to have a *si\u00e8ge social* at a place other than that of incorporation....The corporation laws of Continental countries provide that the charter of incorporation must designate this central office, and the inference is that it must be in the country of incorporation.\").\n\n44.\n\nThe second clause of Article 25(2)(b) provides that parties can, by agreement, depart from the general rule that a corporate entity has the nationality of its state of incorporation. It extends jurisdiction to \"any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on [the date on which the parties consented to submit the dispute to arbitration] and which, *because of foreign control,* the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State...,\"35 This exception to the general rule applies only in the context of an agreement between the parties. The Respondent asks the Tribunal to apply this exception in the present case, not to give effect to an agreement between the Contracting Parties, but, rather, to create an additional exception to the general state-of-incorporation or state-of-seat rule\u2014in the absence of an agreement to that effect between the Parties.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n45.\n\nWe find no support for the Respondent\u2019s request in the text of the Convention. The second clause of Article 25(2)(b) limits the use of the control-test to the circumstances it describes, *i.e.,* when Contracting Parties agree to treat a national of the host State as a national of another Contracting Party because of foreign control. In the present case, the Claimant is not a national of the host State nor have the parties agreed to treat the Claimant as a national of a State other than its state of incorporation.\n\n46.\n\nThe use of a control-test to define the nationality of a corporation to *restrict* the jurisdiction of the Centre would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of Article 25(2)(b). Indeed, as explained by Mr. Broches, the purpose of the control-test in the second portion of Article 25(2)(b) is to *expand* the jurisdiction of the Centre:\n\n[t]here was a compelling reason for this last provision. It is quite usual for host States to require that foreign investors carry on their business within their territories through a company organized under the laws of the host country. If we admit, as the Convention does implicitly, that this makes the company technically a national of the host country, it becomes readily apparent that there is need for an exception to the general principle that that the Centre will not have jurisdiction over disputes between a Contracting State and its own nationals. *If no exception were made for foreign-owned but locally incorporated companies, a large and important sector of foreign investment would be outside the scope of the Convention36*\n\nBroches, at 358-59 (emphasis added).\n\n47.\n\nICSID tribunals likewise have interpreted the second clause of Article 25(2)(b) to expand, not restrict, jurisdiction. In *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Egypt,* the respondent argued that Wena, though incorporated in the United Kingdom, should be treated as an Egyptian company because it was owned by an Egyptian national.37 Egypt relied on Article 8.1 of the U.K.-Egypt BIT provision, which states:\n\n[s]uch a company of one Contracting Party in which before such dispute arises a majority of shares are owned by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party shall in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention be treated for the purposes of the Convention as a company of the other Contracting Party.38\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* Summary Minutes of the Session of the Tribunal held in Paris on May 25, 1999, Case No. ARB/98/4, 411.L.M. 881, 886 (2002).\n\n*Id.* at 887.\n\n48.\n\nEgypt argued that this provision could be used to deny jurisdiction over disputes involving companies of the non-disputing Contracting Party that are owned by nationals or companies of the Contracting Party to the dispute. Wena, on the other hand, argued that this provision could be used only to extend jurisdiction over disputes involving companies of the Contracting Party to the dispute that are owned by nationals or companies of the non-disputing Contracting Party. Although the tribunal found that both interpretations of the BIT provision were plausible, it decided to adopt Wena\u2019s interpretation as the more consistent with Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention.\n\n49.\n\nAs the *Wena* tribunal stated, \"[t]he literature rather convincingly demonstrates that Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention\u2014and provisions like Article 8 of the United Kingdom\u2019s model bilateral investment treaty\u2014are meant to expand ICSID jurisdiction.\"39 The tribunal in *Autopista v. Venezuela* reached a similar result, concluding that the object and purpose of Article 25(2)(b) is not to limit jurisdiction, but to set its outer limits.40\n\n*Id.* at 888.\n\n*Autopista,* at para. 109 (quoting Broches).\n\n50.\n\nICSID jurisprudence also confirms that the second clause of Article 25(2)(b) should not be used to determine the nationality of juridical entities in the absence of an agreement between the parties. In *CMS v. Argentina,* the tribunal states, \"[t]he reference that Article 25(2)(b) makes to foreign control in terms of treating a company of the nationality of the Contracting State party as a national of another Contracting State *is precisely meant to facilitate agreement between the parties...*,\"41 In the present case, there was no agreement between the Contracting Parties to treat the Claimant as anything other than a national of its state of incorporation, *i.e.,* Lithuania.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Republic of Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, Case No. ARB/01/8 (July 17, 2003), 42 I.L.M. 788 (2003), at para. 51 (emphasis added) (\"CATS\").\n\n51.\n\nThe second clause of Article 25(2)(b) does not mandatorily constrict ICSID jurisdiction for disputes arising in the inverse context from the one envisaged by this provision: a dispute between a Contracting Party and an entity of another Contracting Party that is controlled by nationals of the respondent Contracting Party.\n\n52.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant is an \"investor\" of Lithuania under Article 1 (2)(b) of the BIT because it is an \"entity established in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania in conformity with its laws and regulations.\" This method of defining corporate nationality is consistent with modern BIT practice and satisfies the objective requirements of Article 25 of the Convention. We find no basis in the BIT or the Convention to set aside the Contracting Parties\u2019 agreed definition of corporate nationality with respect to investors of either party in favor of a test based on the nationality of the controlling shareholders. While some tribunals have taken a distinctive approach,42 we do not believe that arbitrators should read in to BITs limitations not found in the text nor evident from negotiating history sources.\n\n*See, e.g., SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction, Case No. ARB/01/13 (Aug. 6, 2003), 42 I.L.M. 1290 (2003). In this case, a Swiss company asserted claims against the Government of Pakistan for breach of contract and for breach of the BIT between the Swiss Confederation and Pakistan. Article 9 of that BIT provides for ICSID arbitration of \"disputes with respect to investments....\" **Id.** at para. 149. The provision does not in any manner restrict the scope of such disputes. Although the Tribunal recognized that BIT claims and contract claims \"can both be described as \u2018disputes with respect to investment,\u2019\" it nonetheless decided\u2014without support from the text or evidence of the parties\u2019 intent\u2014to exclude contract claims from the scope of \"disputes\" that could be submitted to ICSID arbitration. **Id.** at paras. 161-62.\n\n**5. Equitable Doctrine of \"Veil Piercing\"**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nFinally, we consider whether the equitable doctrine of \"veil piercing,\" to the extent recognized in customary international law, should override the terms of the agreement between the Contracting Parties and cause the Tribunal to deny jurisdiction in this case.43\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention states, \"[t]he Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) *and such rules of international law as may be applicable\"* Emphasis added.\n\n54.\n\nThe seminal case, in this regard, is *Barcelona Traction.44* In that case, the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") stated, \"the process of lifting the veil, being an exceptional one admitted by municipal law in respect of an institution of its own making, is equally admissible to play a similar role in international law.\"45 In particular, the Court noted, \"[t]he wealth of practice already accumulated on the subject in municipal law indicates that the veil is lifted, for instance, to *prevent the misuse of the privileges of legal personality,* as in certain cases of *fraud* or *malfeasance,* to *protect third persons* such as a creditor or purchaser, or to *prevent the evasion of legal requirements or of obligations\"46*\n\nFor the sake of clarity, the Tribunal notes that *Barcelona Traction,* which held that incorporation is the only criterion for nationality in cases of diplomatic protection, is inapplicable with respect to agreements between the parties to treat companies of the host State as a national of the other Party under the second clause of Article 25(2)(b). *See* Broches, at 360-361.\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co., Ltd. (Belg. v. Spain),* 1970 I.C.J. 3 (Feb. 5), at para. 58 (\" *Barcelona Traction\").*\n\n*Id.* at para. 56 (emphases added).\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent has not made a prima facie case, much less demonstrated, that the Claimant has engaged in any of the types of conduct described in *Barcelona Traction* that might support a piercing of the Claimant\u2019s corporate veil. The Respondent has not shown or even suggested that the Claimant has used its status as a juridical entity of Lithuania to perpetrate fraud or engage in malfeasance. The Respondent has made no claim that the Claimant\u2019s veil must be pierced and jurisdiction denied in order to protect third persons, nor has the Respondent shown that the Claimant used its corporate nationality to evade applicable legal requirements or obligations.\n\n56.\n\nThe ICJ did not attempt to define in *Barcelona Traction* the precise scope of conduct that might prompt a tribunal to pierce the corporate veil. We are satisfied, however, that none of the Claimant\u2019s conduct with respect to its status as an entity of Lithuania constitutes an abuse of legal personality. The Claimant made no attempt whatever to conceal its national identity from the Respondent. To the contrary, the Claimant\u2019s status as a juridical entity of Lithuania is well established under the laws of both Lithuania and Ukraine and well known by the Respondent. The Claimant manifestly did not create Tokios Tokeles for the purpose of gaining access to ICSID arbitration under the BIT against Ukraine, as the enterprise was founded six years before the BIT between Ukraine and Lithuania entered into force. Indeed, there is no evidence in the record that the Claimant used its formal legal nationality for any improper purpose.\n\n**6. Other Considerations Regarding Corporate Nationality**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nAlthough not necessary elements of our Decision, the section below addresses the relevant ICSID jurisprudence and the views of ICSID scholars raised by the parties that relate to the issue of defining corporate nationality.\n\na. *ICSID Jurisprudence*\n------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe arbitral awards cited by the Respondent do not support a decision by this Tribunal to set aside the definition of nationality agreed to by the Contracting Parties. Among the awards cited, the Respondent quotes the following passage from *Banro American Resources Inc. v. Congo* in support of its request to pierce the corporate veil of the Claimant:\n\nThese few examples demonstrate that in general, ICSID tribunals do not accept the view that their competence is limited by formalities, and rather they rule on their competence based on a review of the circumstances surrounding the case, and, in particular, the actual relationship among the companies involved. This jurisprudence reveals the willingness of ICSID tribunals to refrain from making decisions on their competence based on formal appearances, and to base their decisions on a realistic assessment of the situation before them.47\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, at 2.1.9 (citing *Banro American Resources, Inc. and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Aurif\u00e8re du Kivu et du Maniema S.A.R.L. v. Democratic Republic of Congo,* Award, Case No. ARB/98/7 (Sept. 1, 2000), at para. 11 (\" *Banro\")).*\n\n59.\n\nThe \"few examples\" to which the **Banro** Tribunal refers, however, are cases in which the Claimant, as the party that requested arbitration, was not the same entity as the party that consented to arbitration48 The **Banro** Tribunal suggests that, in these cases, the tribunals have been willing to consider the nationalities of the consenting party and the Claimant when making their determinations of jurisdiction.\n\n*Banro,* at para. 10 (\"This was the case, in particular, in two situations: when the request was made by a member company of a group of companies while the pertinent instrument expressed the consent of another company of this group; and when, following the transfer of shares, the request came from the transferee company while the consent had been given by the company making the transfer.\").\n\n60.\n\nIn *Banro* itself, the Claimant\u2019s parent, Banro Resources (Canada), transferred shares in its Congolese investment to its subsidiary, Banro American (U.S.). The Tribunal stated that the Claimant, Banro American, could not avail itself of the consent expressed by its parent, Banro Resources, because Banro Resources, as a national of a non-Contracting Party, could not have validly consented to ICSID arbitration and, thus, could not transfer any valid consent to its U.S. subsidiary.49 Although the *Banro* Tribunal indicated that it \"could have addressed the issue of *jus standi* of Banro American in a flexible manner,\"50 in the end, the Tribunal did not deny jurisdiction by piercing the Claimant\u2019s corporate veil. Instead, the *Banro* Tribunal denied jurisdiction to prevent Banro Resources from availing itself of diplomatic protection while its U.S. subsidiary pursued ICSID arbitration, which, if allowed, would contravene the object and purpose of Article 27 the Convention.51\n\n*Id.* at para. 5.\n\n*Id.* at para. 13.\n\n*Id.* at paras. 13, 24. Article 27 states, \"[n]o Contracting State shall give diplomatic protection, or bring an international claim, in respect of a dispute which one of its nationals and another Contracting State shall have consented to submit or shall have submitted to arbitration under this Convention, unless such other Contracting State shall have failed to abide by and comply with the award rendered in such dispute.\"\n\n61.\n\nThus, the issue before the Tribunal in ***Banro*** and in the cases discussed briefly therein was not, as it is here, the proper method of defining the nationality of the claimant. In *Banro,* there was no dispute that the claimant was a national of the United States and Banro Resources was a national of Canada, both by virtue of their incorporation in those countries. The issue in ***Banro*** was whether the claimant of one nationality could benefit from the consent given by its parent company of another nationality. In the present case, it is undisputed that the Claimant made the request for arbitration and expressed consent to ICSID jurisdiction. Accordingly, the decision in ***Banro*** provides no justification for looking beyond the nationality of the Claimant, Tokios Tokeles, to other related parties or to its controlling shareholders.\n\n62.\n\nThe decision in *Autopista v. Venezuela* is similarly unhelpful to the Respondent. The Respondent\u2019s Memorial in the case before this Tribunal cites, in isolation, the following passage: \"[a]s a general matter, the arbitral Tribunal accepts that economic criteria often better reflect reality than legal ones.\"52 Although seemingly helpful, the text of the decision that follows the quoted passage directly undermines the Respondent\u2019s objection. In particular, the Tribunal states,\n\n\"[h]owever, in the present case, such *arguments of an economic nature are irrelevant.* Indeed, exercising the discretion granted by the Convention, *the parties have specifically identified* majority shareholding *as the criterion to be applied. They have not chosen to subordinate their consent to ICSID arbitration to other criteria.*\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal must respect the parties\u2019 autonomy and may not discard the criterion of direct shareholding, *unless it proves unreasonable. \"53*\n\nMemorial, para. 2.1.9 (citing *Autopista,* para. 119).\n\n*Autopista,* at paras. 119-120 (emphases added).\n\n63.\n\nIn the present case, as in **Autopista,** \"arguments of an economic nature are irrelevant\" where \"the parties have specifically identified\" the country of legal establishment \"as the criterion to be applied\" and \"have not chosen to subordinate their consent to ICSID arbitration to any other criteria.\" This Tribunal, like the tribunal in **Autopista,** is obliged to respect the parties\u2019 agreement \"unless it proves unreasonable.\" Far from unreasonable, reference to the state of incorporation is the most common method of defining the nationality of business entities under modern BITs and traditional international law.54\n\nSchreuer, at 277.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent also cites *Loewen v. United States of America* to support its position.55 In that case, the Canadian claimant declared bankruptcy during the arbitration proceedings and, immediately before going out of business, assigned its claim to a newly created Canadian corporation whose sole asset was the claim against the United States.56 The newly created corporation was wholly owned and controlled by the U.S. enterprise that emerged from the earlier bankruptcy proceeding. Although the claim remained at all times in the possession of a Canadian enterprise, the *Loewen* tribunal held that the assignment of the claim changed the nationality of the claimant from Canadian to U.S. origin. Accordingly, the tribunal denied jurisdiction because the claimant\u2019s nationality was not continuous from the date of the events giving rise to the claim through the date of the resolution of the claim, as the tribunal believed was required by customary international law.57\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, at 2.1.5.\n\n*Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond Loewen v. United States of America,* Award, Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3 (June 26, 2003), 42 I.L.M. 811 (2003), at paras. 220, 240.\n\n*Id.* at para. 225.\n\n65.\n\nAlthough the **Loewen** tribunal denied that it pierced the claimant\u2019s corporate veil,58 in reality, the tribunal did exactly that. Indeed, the tribunal could not have concluded that the nationality of the claimant had changed from Canadian to U.S. origin without piercing the claimant\u2019s corporate veil. Although one may debate whether veil piercing was justified in that case, the **Loewen** decision does not clarify the jurisprudence of veil piercing because the tribunal did not admit to, much less explain its reasons for, piercing the claimant\u2019s corporate veil.\n\n*Id.* at para. 237.\n\n66.\n\nAs *Loewen* provides no additional guidance on the doctrine of veil piercing, we refer instead to the jurisprudence of *Barcelona Traction.* As noted above, we are convinced that the equitable doctrine of veil piercing does not apply to the present case.\n\nb. *Views of ICSID Scholars*\n----------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that some ICSID scholars encourage the application of the control-test to determine corporate nationality in the first clause of Article 25(2)(b) as well as the second, citing the views of Dr. Amerasinghe and Mr. Broches as discussed by Professor Schreuer.59 The Respondent, however, misinterprets the views of these scholars.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, at 2.1.10 (citing Schreuer, at 278-79).\n\n68.\n\nDr. Amerasinghe does argue that Article 25 of the Convention allows tribunals to be \"extremely flexible\" in using various methods to determine the nationality of juridical entities, including the control-test.60 He advocates this flexible approach, however, in the context of a challenge to jurisdiction where, unlike here, the parties to the dispute have not agreed on a particular method of determining the nationality of juridical entities. In addition, the Respondent fails to mention Dr. Amerasinghe\u2019s corollary rule of interpretation, that is, \"every effort should be made to give the Centre jurisdiction by the application of the flexible approach.61\n\nC.F. Amerasinghe, \"The Jurisdiction of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes,\" 19 Indian J. Int\u2019l Law 166, 214 (Apr.-June 1979).\n\n*Id.* at 214-215.\n\n69.\n\nLikewise, Mr. Broches states that the text of Article 25(2)(b) \"implicitly assumes that incorporation is a criterion of nationality.\"62 He argues, however, that this provision does not preclude *an agreement between parties* to define juridical entities by methods other than state of incorporation, including ownership and control.63 In other words, the Convention permits deviation from the general rule for defining the nationality of juridical entities, but only if there is an agreement between the Contracting Parties to do so. Here, there is no such agreement providing for deviation. On the contrary, the agreement under the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT confirms that the standard rule (incorporation) applies.\n\nBroches, at 360.\n\n*Id.* at 360-61.\n\nc. *Traditional Approach under International Law*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nAs with the Convention, the definition of corporate nationality in the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT is also consistent with the predominant approach in international law. As the International Court of Justice has explained, \"[t]he traditional rule attributes the right of diplomatic protection of a corporate entity to the States under the laws of which it is incorporated and in whose territory it has its registered office. The two criteria have been confirmed by long practice and by numerous international instruments.\"64 According to *Oppenheim\u2019s International Law,* \"[i]t is usual to attribute a corporation to the state under the laws of which it has been incorporated and to which it owes its legal existence; to this initial condition is often added the need for the corporation\u2019s head office, registered office, or its *si\u00e8ge social* to be in the same state.\"65 Thus, the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT uses the same well established method for determining corporate nationality as does customary international law.\n\n*Barcelona Traction,* at para. 70.\n\n1 Oppenheim\u2019s International Law 859-60 (Sir Robert Jennings and Sir Arthur Watts eds., 9th ed. 1996) (footnotes omitted)\n\n**7. Conclusion of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Claimant is an \"investor\" of Lithuania under Article 1 (2)(b) of the BIT and a \"national of another Contracting State,\" under Article 25 of the Convention.\n\n**B. Second Objection: The Claimant Did Not Make an \"Investment\" \"in Accordance with the Laws and Regulations\" of Ukraine**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Argument of the Respondent: Claimant Has Not Shown that the Source of Capital Is Non-Ukrainian**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, even if the Tribunal determines that the Claimant is an investor of Lithuania, the Claimant did not make an \"investment\" in Ukraine as defined by the Treaty. More specifically, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has not proved that it had sufficient capital to make the initial investment in its subsidiary, Taki spravy, nor that the capital otherwise originated outside Ukraine. According to the Respondent, the investment in Taki spravy therefore falls outside the scope of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT and the ICSID Convention, as the purpose of both agreements is to protect international, *i.e.,* cross-border, investment. The Respondent also argues that, even if the Claimant is judged to have made investments in Ukraine, those investments were not made in accordance with Ukrainian law and thus are not covered by the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT.\n\n**2. \"Investment\" under Article 25 of Convention**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nArticle 25 of the Convention requires that, in order for the Centre to have jurisdiction, a dispute must arise from \"an investment.\" As with corporate nationality, the parties have broad discretion to decide the \"kinds of investment they wish to bring to ICSID.\"66 Indeed, \"[p]recisely because the Convention does not define \u2018investment\u2019, it does not purport to define the requirements that an investment should meet to qualify for ICSID jurisdiction.\"67 Parties have a \"large measure of discretion to determine for themselves whether their transaction constitutes an investment for the purposes of the Convention.\"68 Here, that discretion is exercised in the BIT.\n\nSchreuer, at 124.\n\nCMS, at para. 51.\n\n*See* *Fedax N. V. v. Republic of Venezuela,* Decision on Jurisdiction, Case No. ARB/96/3 (July 11, 1997), 37 I.L.M. 1378 (1998), at para. 22 (quoting Carolyn B. Lamm and Abby Cohen Smutny, \"The Implementation of ICSID Arbitration Agreements,\" 11 ICSID Review-FILJ 64, 80 (1996)) (\" *Fedax\").*\n\n**3. Definition of \"Investment\" in Article 1(1) of the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nAs mentioned above, Article 1(1) of the BIT defines \"investment\" as \"every kind of asset invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter....\" In addition, Article 1(1) provides that \"[a]ny alteration of the form in which assets are invested shall not affect their character as an investment....\" The Treaty contains no requirement that the capital used by the investor to make the investment originate in Lithuania, or, indeed, that such capital not have originated in Ukraine.\n\n75.\n\nTo phrase the Respondent\u2019s objection in the terms of the Treaty, it maintains that the assets of Taki spravy in the territory of Ukraine were not \"invested by\" the Claimant because the Claimant has not shown that it used non-Ukrainian capital to finance the investment. To assess the Respondent\u2019s objection, we follow the standard rule of interpretation: we apply to the terms of the Treaty their ordinary meaning, in their context, in light of the object and purpose of the Treaty. The ordinary meaning of \"invest\" is to \"expend (money, effort) in something from which a return or profit is expected... \"69 The ordinary meaning of \"by\" is \"indicating agency, means, [or] cause... \"70 Thus, an investment under the BIT is read in ordinary meaning as \"every kind of asset\" for which \"an investor of one Contracting Party\" caused money or effort to be expended and from which a return or profit is expected in the territory of the other Contracting Party. In other words, the Claimant must show that it caused an investment to be made in the territory of the Respondent.\n\nThe New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, at 1410.\n\n*Id.* at 310.\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimant has provided substantial evidence of its investment in Ukraine, beginning with its initial investment of USD 170,000 in 1994, and continuing reinvestments71 each year until 2002, for a total investment of more than USD 6.5 million.72 Moreover, although the Treaty does not require the Contracting Parties to acknowledge the investments of entities of the other Contracting Party in order for such investments to fall within the scope of the Treaty, in this case, the Respondent has done so. In particular, the Claimant has produced copies of twenty-three \"Informational Notice(s) of Payment of Foreign Investment,\" in which the Claimant\u2019s investments were registered by Ukrainian governmental authorities.73\n\nThe definition \"investment\" in Article 1(1), \"every kind of asset invested by an investor\" certainly includes reinvestments of the profits generated by the initial investments.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Claimant\u2019s June 20, 2003 Submission of Documents, Vols. II-IV.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at Annex 13.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to infer, without textual foundation, that the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT requires the Claimant to demonstrate further that the capital used to make an investment in Ukraine originated from non-Ukrainian sources. In our view, however, neither the text of the definition of \"investment,\" nor the context in which the term is defined, nor the object and purpose of the Treaty allow such an origin-of-capital requirement to be implied. The requirement is plainly absent from the text. In addition, the context in which the term \"investment\" is defined, namely, *\"every* kind of asset invested by an investor,\" does not support the restriction advocated by the Respondent.74 Finally, the origin-of-capital requirement is inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Treaty, which, as discussed above, is to provide broad protection to investors and their investments in the territory of either party. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds no basis on which to impose the restriction proposed by the Respondent on the scope of covered investments.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n78.\n\nWe conclude that, under the terms of the BIT, both the enterprise Taki spravy and the rights in the property described in the above-referred \"Informational Notices,\" are assets invested by the Claimant in the territory of Ukraine. The investment would not have occurred but for the decision by the Claimant to establish an enterprise in Ukraine and to dedicate to this enterprise financial resources under the Claimant\u2019s control. In doing so, the Claimant caused the expenditure of money and effort from which it expected a return or profit in Ukraine.\n\n**4. Consistency of Article 1(1) of the BIT with the ICSID Convention**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding under the BIT is also consistent with the ICSID Convention. The broad definition of \"investment\" in the Lithuania-Ukraine BIT is typical of the definition used in most contemporary BITs.75 Because the Convention leaves the definition of the term to the Contracting Parties, which in general have defined it broadly, there have been few cases in which the Respondent has challenged the underlying transaction as not being an \"investment\" under the Convention.76 One such case was *Fedax N. V. v. Republic of Venezuela.* The treaty under which that dispute was arbitrated, the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT, defines \"investment,\" like the Ukraine- Lithuania BIT, as \"every kind of asset.\" In that case, the Respondent argued that the government-issued promissory notes held by the Claimant were not \"investment(s)\" because the Claimant had acquired the notes by way of endorsement from a Venezuelan company.77 The Respondent argued that the Claimant had not made a \"direct\" investment in Venezuela, which the Respondent argued was required by the ICSID Convention.78 In the following passage, the *Fedax* tribunal rejected the Respondent\u2019s argument and also underscored the broad definition of investment contemplated by the Convention:\n\n[T]he text of Article 25(1) establishes that the \"jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment.\" It is apparent that the term \"directly\" relates in this Article to the \"dispute\" and not the \"investment.\" It follows that jurisdiction can exist even in respect of investments that are not direct, so long as the dispute arises directly from such transaction. This interpretation is also consistent with the broad reach that the term \"investment\" must be given in light of the negotiating history of the Convention79\n\n*See* *Fedax,* at para. 34 (citing Antonio Parra, \"The Scope of New Investment Laws and International Instruments,\" in Economic Development, Foreign Investment and the Law 27, 35-36 (Robert Pritchard ed. 1996)); *see also* Rudolph Dolzer and Margaret Stevens, Bilateral Investment Treaties, 26-31 (1995).\n\n*Fedax,* at para. 25.\n\n*Id.* at para. 18.\n\n*Id.* at para. 24.\n\n*Id.*\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent in the present case also asks the Tribunal to narrow the scope of covered investments by adding a condition\u2014in this case, an origin-of-capital requirement\u2014not found in the instrument of consent or the Convention. The Respondent alleges that the Claimant has not proved that the capital used to invest in Ukraine originated from non-Ukrainian, sources, and, thus, the Claimant has not made a direct, or cross-border, investment. Even assuming, *arguendo,* that all of the capital used by the Claimant to invest in Ukraine had its ultimate origin in Ukraine, the resulting investment would not be outside the scope of the Convention. The Claimant made an investment for the purposes of the Convention when it decided to deploy capital under its control in the territory of Ukraine instead of investing it elsewhere. The origin of the capital is not relevant to the existence of an investment.\n\n81.\n\nThat the ICSID Convention does not require an \"investment\" to be financed from capital of any particular origin was confirmed by the tribunal in *Tradex Hellas S.A. v. Republic of Albania.* In that case, the tribunal considered a definition of \"foreign investment\" under Albanian law that is substantially similar to the definition of \"investment\" in the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT: \"every kind of investment in the territory of the Republic of Albania owned directly or indirectly by a foreign investor.\"80 The tribunal found that the definition, \"nowhere requires that the foreign investor has to finance the investment from his own resources...the law provides for a broad interpretation of \u2018investment.\u2019\"81 As in *Tradex,* the Claimant in the present case owns and controls the assets in Ukraine that have given rise to this dispute. The origin of the capital used to acquire these assets is not relevant to the question of jurisdiction under the Convention.\n\n*Tradex Hellas SA. v. Republic of Albania,* Award, Case No. ARB/94/2 (Apr. 29, 1999) 14 ICSID Review-FILJ 161, at para. 105 (citing Albanian law).\n\n*Id.* at para. 109.\n\n82.\n\nIn our view, the ICSID Convention contains no inchoate requirement that the investment at issue in a dispute have an international character in which the origin of the capital is decisive. Although the Convention contemplates disputes of an international character, we believe that such character is defined by the terms of the Convention, and in turn, the terms of the BIT. Were we to accept the origin of capital as transcending the textual definition of the nationality of the Claimant and the scope of covered investment in the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT, we would override the explicit choice of the Contracting Parties as to how to define these terms. Ukraine, Lithuania and other Contracting Parties chose their methods of defining corporate nationality and the scope of covered investment in BITs with confidence that ICSID arbitrators would give effect to those definitions. That confidence is premised on the ICSID Convention itself, which leaves to the reasonable discretion of the parties the task of defining key terms. We should be loathe to undermine it.\n\n**5. Argument of the Respondent: Investment Not Made \"in Accordance with Laws and Regulations\" of Ukraine**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, even if the Claimant were found to have made investments, those investments were not made in accordance with Ukrainian law as required by Article 1(1) of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT. For example, the Respondent argues that the full name under which the Claimant registered its subsidiary, \"The Lithuanian subsidiary private enterprise The Publishing, Informational and Advertising Agency Taki Spravy,\"82 is improper because \"subsidiary enterprise\" but not \"subsidiary *private* enterprise\" is a recognized legal form under Ukrainian law.83 The Respondent also alleges that it has identified errors in the documents provided by the Claimant related to asset procurement and transfer, including, in some cases, the absence of a necessary signature or notarization.84 The Claimant disputes the Respondent\u2019s allegations.85\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at Annex 8.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, at 2.2.2. Although the Certificate Regarding the State Registration of a Subject of Entrepreneurial Activity includes the phrase \"The Lithuanian subsidiary private enterprise,\" as part of the name of the Claimant\u2019s subsidiary, the \"organizational form\" is recorded as \"subsidiary enterprise.\" Request for Arbitration, at Annex 8.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, at Section 4.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder, at 48, 86-134.\n\n84.\n\nThe requirement in Article 1(1) of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT that investments be made in compliance with the laws and regulations of the host state is a common requirement in modern BITs.86 The purpose of such provisions, as explained by the Tribunal in *Salini Costruttori S.p.A and Italstrade S.p.A v. Morocco,* is \"to prevent the Bilateral Treaty from protecting investments that should not be protected, particularly because they would be illegal.\"87\n\nSchreuer, at 130.\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.p.A and Italstrade S.pA v. Kingdom of Morocco,* Decision on Jurisdiction, Case No. ARB/00/4 (July 23, 2001), 42 I.L.M. 609 (2003), at para. 46.\n\n85.\n\nThus, the question before the Tribunal is whether the alleged violations establish that the assets invested by the Claimant were invested not \"in accordance with the laws and regulations of\u2019 Ukraine. Under the Vienna Convention, the ordinary meaning of these terms \"must emerge in the context of the treaty as a whole and in the light of its objects and purposes.\"88 As discussed above, the object and purpose of the BIT is to provide broad protection for investors and their investments.\n\nIan Brownlie, Principles of International Law 634 (5th ed. 1998) (footnotes omitted).\n\n86.\n\nIn the present case, the Respondent does not allege that the Claimant\u2019s investment and business activity\u2014advertising, printing, and publishing\u2014are illegal *per se.* In fact, as discussed above, governmental authorities of the Respondent registered the Claimant\u2019s subsidiary as a valid enterprise in 1994, and, over the next eight years, registered each of the Claimant\u2019s investments in Ukraine, as documented in twenty-three Informational Notices of Payment of Foreign Investment.89 The Respondent now alleges that some of the documents underlying these registered investments contain defects of various types, some of which relate to matters of Ukrainian law. Even if we were able to confirm the Respondent\u2019s allegations, which would require a searching examination of minute details of administrative procedures in Ukrainian law, to exclude an investment on the basis of such minor errors would be inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Treaty. In our view, the Respondent\u2019s registration of each of the Claimant\u2019s investments indicates that the \"investment\" in question was made in accordance with the laws and regulations of Ukraine.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, Annex 13.\n\n**C. Third Objection: The Dispute Does Not Arise from the Investment**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nIn order for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction over a dispute, there must be an adequate nexus between the dispute and the Claimant\u2019s investment in the territory of the Contracting Party.\n\n88.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention extends jurisdiction to any dispute \"arising directly out of an investment.\" In order for the directness requirement to be satisfied, the dispute and investment must be \"reasonably closely connected.\"90 As Professor Schreuer notes, \"[disputes arising from ancillary or peripheral aspects of the investment operation are likely to give rise to the objection that they do not arise directly from the investment \u2026\"91\n\nSchreuer, at 114.\n\n*Id.*\n\n89.\n\nArticle 8 of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT, in turn, provides that an investor of one Contracting Party may submit to arbitration a dispute \"in *connection with\"* an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.92 It may be held that the scope of arbitrable disputes under the Treaty is broader than that contemplated by Article 25(1) of the Convention which refers to any \"dispute arising directly out of an investment.\"93 Even if based only on the language of the Convention, however, the Respondent\u2019s contention is in any case bound to fail.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n90.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the present dispute does not \"arise directly out of an investment\" because the allegedly wrongful acts by Ukrainian governmental authorities (including unwarranted and unreasonable investigations of the Claimant\u2019s business, unfounded judicial actions to invalidate the Claimant\u2019s contracts, and false, public accusations of illegal conduct by the Claimant) were not directed against the physical assets owned by the Claimant, *i.e.,* its facilities and equipment.94\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, at 12-16.\n\n91.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent misapprehends the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25. For a dispute to arise directly out of an investment, the allegedly wrongful conduct of the government need not be directed against the physical property of the investor. The requirement of directness is met if the dispute arises from the investment itself or the operations of its investment, as in the present case. The scope of this requirement was addressed by the first ICSID tribunal, *Holiday Inns S.A. v. Morocco,* which found jurisdiction over loan contracts that were separate but related to the investment agreement, emphasizing \"the general unity of an investment operation.\"95\n\nSchreuer, at 116 (citing P. Lalive, \"The First World Bank Arbitration (*Holiday Inns v.* *Morocco)\u2014* Some Legal Problems,\" 1 ICSID Reports 645).\n\n92.\n\nThus, the Respondent\u2019s obligations with respect to \"investment\" relate not only to the physical property of Lithuanian investors but also to the business operations associated with that physical property. States\u2019 obligations with respect to \"property\" and \"the use of property\" are well established in international law. For example, the *Draft Convention on the International Responsibility of States for Injuries to Aliens,* defines a \"taking of property\" to include \"not only an outright taking of property but also any such unreasonable interference with the use, enjoyment, or disposal of property as to justify an inference that the owner thereof will not be able to use, enjoy or dispose of the property within a reasonable period of time after the inception of such interference.\"96 Further, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal found that \"[a] deprivation or taking of property may occur under international law through interference by a state in the use of that property or with the enjoyment of its benefits.\"97\n\nL. Sohn and R. Baxter, \"Responsibility of States for Injuries to the Economic Interests of Aliens, 55 Am J. Int\u2019l L. 545, 553 (1961) (Article 10.3 *of Draft Convention on the International Responsibility of States for Injuries to Aliens).*\n\n*Tippetts, Abbott, McCarthy, Stratton v. TAMS-AFFA,* Award No. 141-7-2, 6 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 219, 225 (June 22, 1984).\n\n93.\n\nIn the present case, each of the allegedly wrongful government actions\u2014 investigations, document seizures, public accusations of illegal conduct, and judicial actions to invalidate contracts and seize assets\u2014involved the operations of the Claimant\u2019s subsidiary enterprise in Ukraine. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the present dispute arises directly from the Claimant\u2019s investment.\n\n**V. Objections to Admissibility**\n----------------------------------\n\n**A. First Objection: Claimant\u2019s Written Consent Was Improper and Untimely**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nArticle 25(1) states, \"jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute... which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\" The consent of the Ukraine is found in Article 8(2) of the Treaty, which provides that \"the investor shall be entitled to submit the case to [arbitration],..\" It is well established that, \"formulations [in a BIT] to the effect that a dispute \u2018shall be submitted\u2019 to the Centre\u2019... leave no doubt as to the binding character of these clauses.\"98 The Respondent does not contest that it has consented to ICSID arbitration.\n\nSchreuer, at 213.\n\n95.\n\nThe Respondent does argue, however, that the Claimant\u2019s consent was improper and untimely, and, thus, its claim should be inadmissible. As discussed above, the Claimant attached an unaddressed document entitled, \"Letter of Consent to Arbitration,\" dated August 7, 2002, to its Request for Arbitration, which was received by ICSID on August 14, 2002.99 The Claimant withdrew its request on October 17, 2002, and resubmitted it on November 22, 2002.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at Annex 1.\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s consent was improper because its Letter of Consent was not addressed and sent directly to the Respondent.100 In addition, the Respondent argues that the consent was untimely because it was not given before the initiation of ICSID proceedings, which, according to the Respondent, is required by the Convention.101 Finally, the Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s consent was untimely because it was expressed before the expiration of the six-month negotiating period required by Article 8 of the BIT.102\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, at 3.1.3.\n\n*Id.* at 3.1.4.\n\n*Id.*\n\n97.\n\nEach of the Respondent\u2019s arguments fails. First, the Convention does not stipulate the form that written consent must take, much less to whom it must be addressed and sent. As Dr. Amerasinghe explains,\n\n[t]he Convention requires *only* that the consent be in writing. Thus, it is not necessary that the consent of both parties be included in a single instrument. The consents may, indeed, be expressed in instruments of completely diverse character, and *not necessarily addressed to the other party* or made with particular reference to any dispute of arrangement with it.103\n\nC.F. Amerasinghe, \"The Jurisdiction of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes,\" at 224 (emphases added).\n\n98.\n\nIn fact, the Claimant need not have expressed its consent in a document separate from the RFA itself. As Professor Schreuer notes, \"[i]t is established practice that an investor may accept an offer of consent contained in a BIT by instituting ICSID proceedings.\"104 Thus, not only the Claimant\u2019s letter but also the RFA itself satisfy the requirement to \"consent in writing\" to the jurisdiction of the Centre. As the Convention contemplates \"no requirement that the consent[] either precede or follow the incidence of a particular dispute,\" neither does it require consent to precede or follow negotiations concerning a dispute.105\n\nSchreuer, at 218. As stated by the Tribunal in **SGS v. Philippines,** \"the Claimant relies upon the consent to ICSID arbitration given by the Philippines in the BIT, combined with its own written consent contained in the Request for Arbitration. It is well established that the combination of these forms of consent can constitute \u2018consent in writing\u2019 within the meaning of Article 25(1), provided that the dispute falls within the scope of the BIT.\" **SGS v. Philippines,** at para. 31.\n\nAmerasinghe, \"The Jurisdiction of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes,\" at 224.\n\n99.\n\nFurther, the Claimant was not required to submit its consent prior to initiating ICSID proceedings. The Executive Directors\u2019 Report addresses the timing of parties\u2019 consent in paragraph 24: \"[c]onsent of the parties must exist when the Centre is seized (Articles 28(3) and 36(3)) but the Convention does not otherwise specify the time at which consent should be given.\"106 When an investor accepts a State\u2019s general offer of consent in a BIT, as in the present case, the timing of such an acceptance is proper as long as it occurs not later than the time at which the Claimant submits its request for arbitration.107 There is no requirement that the Claimant\u2019s consent precede the request. Similarly, neither the BIT nor the Convention requires the Claimant to wait until after the requisite six-month negotiating period has ended before expressing its consent to ICSID jurisdiction. Article 8 of the BIT merely requires that there be a negotiating period of six months after a dispute arises before a claim may be submitted to arbitration. We are confident that this requirement has been fulfilled.\n\nExecutive Directors\u2019 Report, at para. 24.\n\nSchreuer, at 225.\n\n100.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Claimant\u2019s written consent satisfies the requirements of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. Second Objection: Claimant and Respondent Were Not \"Parties\" to the Negotiation Required by Article 8 of the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, to the extent that negotiations occurred, they involved Taki spravy and local governmental authorities in Kyiv, not the Claimant and Respondent themselves.108 Accordingly, the Respondent contends that the requirement in Article 8 of the BIT that negotiations occur between \"an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party\" has not been met.109 The Respondent further argues that the governmental authorities in Kyiv were not duly authorized to negotiate on behalf of Ukraine. In addition, the Respondent argues that officials acting on behalf of Taki spravy, not Tokios Tokeles, engaged governmental officials in negotiation.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, at 3.2.5-3.2.6; Transcript of Oral Hearing on Jurisdiction, at 57-59.\n\nUkraine-Lithuania BIT, at art. 8.1 - 8.2.\n\n102.\n\nWe are satisfied that the Claimant and the Respondent participated to the extent necessary in the negotiations concerning this dispute. The Claimant did bring this dispute to the attention of the central government authorities, including the President of Ukraine.110 In addition, the Claimant has provided evidence of its negotiations with federal officials in the form of letters that the Claimant exchanged with the General Procurator of Ukraine and the Chairman of the State Tax Administration of Ukraine.111 There is, in addition, evidence of extensive negotiations between the Claimant and municipal government authorities.112 While the *actions* of municipal authorities are attributable to the central government,113 we need not decide whether the *negotiations* by those authorities may count toward the six-month \"cooling off\u2019 period prescribed by the Treaty, as the direct negotiations with central government authorities satisfy the jurisdictional requirement. Moreover, whether the President authorized any of these negotiations is irrelevant, as \"[a] state cannot plead the principles of municipal law, including its constitution, in answer to an international claim.\"114\n\nRequest for Arbitration, at Annex 20.\n\n*Id.* at Annexes, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 21.\n\n*See* Supplement to the Request for Arbitration, at 3-8.\n\n*See* Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, in Report of the International Law Commission, Fifty-third session, U.N. GAOR, 56th Sess., Supp. No. 10, at 47, U.N. Doc. A.56/10 (2001) (Article 17, \"Conduct of organs of a State,\" provides that [t]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central government or of a territorial unit of the State\").\n\nBrownlie, at 451.\n\n103.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant\u2019s participation in the negotiation, it is immaterial whether the Claimant\u2019s representatives negotiated as agents of the parent enterprise, Tokios Tokeles, or its wholly owned subsidiary, Taki spravy. In either case, the Claimant was a party to the negotiation.\n\n104.\n\nThus, the present dispute was the subject of negotiation between \"an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party\" in accordance with Article 8 of the BIT.\n\n**C. Third Objection: The \"Dispute\" Was Not the Subject of Negotiation as Required by Article 8 of the BIT**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the claim is inadmissible even if the Claimant and Respondent did negotiate because the \"dispute\" was not the subject of their negotiations.115 In particular, the Respondent argues that the governmental actions complained of by the Claimant did not crystallize into a dispute until August 16, 2002, the date on which the Respondent received the Request for Arbitration. Accordingly, the Respondent argues that the parties did not negotiate \"the dispute\" for the requisite six months before the case was registered on December 20, 2002.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, at 3.3.2.\n\n106.\n\nIn the *Mavrommatis Case,* the International Court defined dispute \"as a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between two persons.\"116 Professor Schreuer described the requirements of a \"dispute\" in the following passage:\n\nThe dispute must relate to clearly identified issues between the parties and must not be merely academic. This is not to say that a specific action must have been taken by one side or that the dispute must have escalated to a certain level of confrontation, but merely that it must be of immediate interest to the parties. The dispute must go beyond general grievances and must be susceptible of being stated in terms of a concrete claim.117\n\n*Mavrommatis Case* 1924 P.C.I.J. Ser. A, No. 2, at 11-12.\n\nSchreuer, at 102.\n\n107.\n\nWe are convinced that the dispute was sufficiently defined for negotiations to occur at least six months prior to the date upon which the Centre registered the claim. The Claimant notified governmental authorities of the Respondent of specific grievances, including allegedly unwarranted investigations, unreasonable seizures of documents, unfounded judicial actions, and publicly stated accusations by governmental authorities of the Respondent that the Claimant had engaged in illegal conduct. Although we reserve judgment as to merits of the Claimant\u2019s allegations, we find at this point that the claims constitute a \"dispute\" for the purpose of satisfying jurisdictional requirements.\n\nVI. **Decision**\n----------------\n\n108.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, and after taking notice of the President\u2019s Dissenting Opinion, the Tribunal decides by a majority of its members that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 3", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2005-01-18T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 3\n----------------------\n\nI. SUMMARY\n----------\n\n1.\n\nThe Tribunal has pending before it several requests from the parties: a request by Claimant for provisional measures; a request by Respondent to decide whether a continuance of the proceedings is consistent with the ICSID Convention in view of what it regards as Claimant's recourse to diplomatic protection; and a request by Claimant for the production of various documents by Respondent. In addition, in response to the Tribunal's invitation, the parties have communicated their views on the appropriate number of written pleadings on the merits and the time limits within which they must submit those pleadings.\n\nII. REQUESTS OF THE PARTIES\n---------------------------\n\nA. Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1. Submissions of the Parties\n-----------------------------\n\n2.\n\nOn September 14, 2004, Claimant filed a Request for Provisional Measures (\"Claimant's Request\"), requesting the Tribunal to \"reaffirm\" Order No. 1 of July 1, 2003, and to \"issue a procedural Order\" that would call on Respondent to \"refrain from, suspend, and discontinue\": (i) the criminal proceedings against O.V. Danylov, General Director of Claimant's subsidiaries in Ukraine; (ii) the \"arrest\" of assets of Claimant's subsidiaries in Ukraine; and (iii) tax investigations of Claimant's subsidiaries in Ukraine. Respondent filed observations in opposition to Claimant's Request on September 24, 2004; Claimant submitted its reply on October 7, 2004, followed by Respondent's response on October 22, 2004.\n\na. *Criminal Proceedings against O.V. Danylov*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nAccording to information obtained by Claimant from the database of the Information Center of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, the Tax Police of the Solomiansky raion of Kyiv initiated criminal proceedings against O.V. Danylov on March 13, 2002.1 The information indicates that Danylov has been \"wanted\" for arrest in Ukraine since June 27, 2002, and \"wanted internationally\" since August 6, 2003.2 The State Tax Administration (\"STA\") of Ukraine, in a letter to Counsel for Claimant dated October 23, 2003, confirmed that Ukrainian authorities initiated criminal proceedings against Danylov as the head of Claimant's subsidiary.3 Respondent does not deny that criminal proceedings against Danylov remain open.\n\nClaimant's Request for Provisional Measures, September 14, 2004, at Annex 4 (\"Claimant's Request\").\n\n*Id.* According to Claimant, the Republic of Lithuania granted O.V. Danylov political asylum on May 13, 2003. *Id.* at 6. It is the Tribunal's understanding that O.V. Danylov presently resides in Lithuania.\n\n*Id.* at Annex 3.\n\nb. *\"Arrest\" of Assets of Taki Spravy II*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nAccording to the State Register of Collateral of Non-Real Property, Ukrainian tax authorities \"registered\" as \"tax collateral\" all assets of Claimant's subsidiary, Taki Spravy II (\"TS II\"), as of September 1, 2003.4 These authorities issued a \"tax demand\" on October 8, 2003, indicating that TS II had an outstanding tax obligation of 400.31 hyrvnia,5 which Claimant contends was paid in full by December 2003.6 The parties disagree as to the legal effect of the registration of assets on Claimant's control of those assets and the date on which Claimant's subsidiary satisfied the outstanding tax obligation. According to the State Register, however, the registration of TS II's assets as tax collateral was terminated on May 5, 2004.7\n\n*Id.* at Annex 6.\n\n*Id.* at Annex 7.\n\nClaimant's Reply to Respondent's Observations, at 13, Annex 5.\n\nClaimant's Request, at Annex 6.\n\nc. *Tax Investigations of TS II*\n--------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Ukrainian tax authorities initiated a \"planned documentary investigation\" of TS II on June 14, 2004.8 STA, after considering objections raised by Claimant, notified Claimant's subsidiary on June 17, 2004, that it determined the investigation to be \"unnecessary.\"9 However, on August 30, 2004, STA initiated a \"non-planned documentary investigation,\" of TS II, to begin on September 7, 2004, and \"lasting 30 work days.\"10 According to Claimant, two STA employees arrived at the premises of TS II on September 7, 2004, to conduct the investigation.11\n\nId at para. 21.\n\n*Id.* at Annex 8.\n\n*Id.* at Annex 9.\n\n*Id.* at para. 22.\n\n2. Order of the Tribunal\n------------------------\n\n6.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention grants the Tribunal authority to \"recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party\" if the Tribunal \"considers that the circumstances so require.\"12 The corresponding Arbitration Rule 39(1) provides that either party may request that the Tribunal recommend provisional measures \"for the preservation of its rights,\" and that such request must \"specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\"\n\nAs stated in Order No. 1, it is \"a well-established principle laid down by jurisprudence of the ICSID tribunals\" that \"provisional measures 'recommended' by an ICSID tribunal are legally compulsory.\" Order No. 1 at para. 4. *See also Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain*, Procedural Order No. 2, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7 (October 28, 1999), at para. 9 (\"*Maffezini v. Spain*\").\n\n7.\n\nAmong the rights that may be protected by provisional measures is the right guaranteed by Article 26 to have the ICSID arbitration be the exclusive remedy for the dispute to the exclusion of any other remedy, whether domestic or international, judicial or administrative.13 A provisional measure may also be granted to protect a party from actions of the other party that threaten to aggravate the dispute or prejudice the rendering or implementation of an eventual decision or award.14\n\n*See* Christoph H. Schreuer, THE ICSID CONVENTION: A COMMENTARY 368-69, 387-88, 780-81 (2001).\n\n*See Amco Asia Corporation et al. v.

Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on the Request for Provisional Measures, September 25, 2001, 6 ICSID REPORTS 373, 397 (2004).\n\n8.\n\nThe circumstances under which provisional measures are required under Article 47 are those in which the measures are necessary to preserve a party's rights and that need is *urgent*.15 The international jurisprudence on provisional measures indicates that a provisional measure is necessary where the actions of a party \"are capable of causing or of threatening irreparable prejudice to the rights invoked.\"16 A measure is urgent where \"action prejudicial to the rights of either party is likely to be taken before such final decision is taken.\"17\n\nSee Schreuer, at 751-57.\n\nAegean Sea Continental Shelf Case (Greece v. Turkey), Request for the Indication of Interim Measures of Protection, Order, September 11, 1976, 15 ILM 985, 997 (1976) (Separate Opinion of President Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga).\n\nCase Concerning Passage Through the Great Belt (Finland v. Denmark), Request for the Indication of Provisional Measures, July 29, 1991, at para. 23.\n\na. *Criminal Proceedings against O.V. Danylov*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nClaimant argues that the criminal proceedings against O.V. Danylov constitute recourse to a remedy other than this ICSID proceeding, in violation of Claimant's rights under Article 26. Claimant further contends that the criminal proceedings have forced Danylov, a founder and key manager of Taki Spravy (\"TS\"), to leave Ukraine, which has harmed the operations of TS, reduced its profits, inhibited Claimant's ability to finance the present proceeding, and, thus, Claimant argues, jeopardized the rendering of an ultimate ICSID award.\n\n10.\n\nRespondent contends that the criminal proceedings do not constitute part of a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\" under Article 25; that Claimant has not cited, nor is Respondent aware of, any case in which an ICSID tribunal has imposed a provisional measure with respect to a criminal proceeding; and that Claimant has not shown a causal link between Danylov's absence from Ukraine and the financial difficulties of TS.\n\n11.\n\nRespondent is incorrect when it argues that the criminal proceedings against\n\nDanylov cannot be subject to a provisional measure because the proceedings are not part of a \"legal dispute arising directly out of\" Claimant's investment.18 It is not necessary for a tribunal to establish that the actions complained of in a request for provisional measures meet the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25. A tribunal may order a provisional measure if the actions of the opposing party \"relate to the subject matter of the case before the tribunal and not to separate, unrelated issues or extraneous matters.\"19 Respondent is also incorrect when it argues that a request for provisional measures must be supported by precedent in ICSID jurisprudence.20\n\nRespondent's Observations to Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, September 24, 2004, at para. 3.1.3 (quoting Article 25 of the Convention).\n\n*Maffezini v. Spain*, at para. 23. The *Maffezini* Tribunal held that Respondent's request for a provisional measure requiring Claimant to post \"a guarantee or bond to ensure payment of additional costs\" of the proceeding was a separate issue from the dispute over the Claimant's investment. *Id.* at paras. 24-25.\n\n*See, e.g., Maffezini v. Spain*, at para. 5 (stating that \"the lack of precedent is not necessarily determinative of our competence to order provisional measures in a case where such measures fall within the purview of the Arbitration Rules and are required under the circumstances\").\n\n12.\n\nIn the present case, however, provisional measures are unwarranted with respect to the proceedings against O.V. Danylov. Assuming *arguendo* that the criminal proceedings implicate Claimant's rights in this proceeding, Claimant has failed to show that a provisional measure is either necessary or urgent to protect those rights. We agree with Respondent that Claimant has not demonstrated that O.V. Danylov's absence from Ukraine caused TS's decline in profits, or, certainly, that it has caused a decline in profits of such magnitude as to impair Claimant's ability to finance the present ICSID proceeding. The provisional measure requested by Claimant, therefore, is not necessary to preserve its right to have this proceeding be the exclusive remedy for the dispute or, under the facts adduced, to be free from action by Respondent that aggravates the dispute.\n\n13.\n\nMoreover, the circumstances underlying the provisional measure requested do not appear urgent. Although the criminal proceedings against O.V. Danylov were initiated in March 2002\u2014nine months before ICSID registered Claimant's Request for Arbitration\u2014 Claimant did not include these proceedings in its first Request for Provisional Measures dated June 3, 2003, or its letter of June 24, 2003, to which Order No. 1 refers. Claimant cannot credibly claim that circumstances it did not consider urgent 18 months ago are urgent now. Accordingly, we deny Claimant's request for a provisional measure that would effectively enjoin the criminal proceedings against O.V. Danylov.\n\nb. *\"Arrest\" of Assets of TS II*\n--------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe parties do not dispute that Ukrainian tax authorities took action in September 2003 to encumber the assets of TS II for the purpose of securing payment of an outstanding tax obligation. Nor do the parties disagree that this action ended in May 2004. As such, even if the encumbrance of assets infringed Claimant's rights in the present dispute, such infringement ceased once the encumbrance was removed. Thus, Claimant presently has no right in need of preservation by a provisional measure. Accordingly, the Tribunal denies Claimant's request for a provisional measure with respect to the \"arrest\" of assets of TS II.\n\nc. *Tax Investigation of TS II*\n-------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nClaimant argues that the tax investigation of TS II infringes Claimant's right to have this ICSID proceeding exclude all other remedies and the right to have Respondent refrain from actions that aggravate the dispute. Respondent argues the investigation does not implicate those rights, and that, even if it did, Claimant has not shown that a provisional measure is necessary or urgent. Although the Tribunal agrees that provisional measures may be recommended by a tribunal to ensure exclusivity under Article 26 and to prevent the parties from aggravating the dispute, the Tribunal finds that (1) the requested relief is not, as asserted by Claimant, within the scope of the Tribunal's prior Order, and (2) Claimant has, quite apart from its argument in respect of Order No. 1, failed to establish the necessity or urgency of such measures with respect to the tax investigation of TS II.\n\n16.\n\nOrder No. 1, which directs the parties to \"refrain from, suspend and discontinue, any domestic *proceedings*, judicial or other\" does not apply to the tax investigation of TS II.21 We reach this conclusion based on the ordinary meaning of \"proceedings,\" which is \"[t]he fact or manner of taking legal action,\"22 whereas \"investigation\" is defined as \"[t]he action or process of investigating; systematic examination.\"23 An investigation typically precedes the institution of proceedings. As the two words have distinct meanings that do not overlap, we conclude that \"investigations\" are not covered by Order No. 1, and Respondent, therefore, is not presently in violation of that Order.\n\nWe reach the conclusion that Order No. 1 by its terms does not apply to the tax investigation of TS II without deciding the question of whether TS II is properly part of the present dispute. *See infra* Part IV.\n\nTHE NEW SHORTER OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY 2364 (1993).\n\n*Id.* at 1410.\n\n17.\n\nWe do not rule out that investigations may give rise to a need for provisional measures. Here, however, the Tribunal sees no grounds on which to order a new provisional measure with respect to the tax investigation, as requested by Claimant. In its written submission, Claimant indicates that the \"non-planned\" tax investigation of TS II began on September 7, 2004, and was scheduled to be completed within thirty business days. Thus, although the investigation was ongoing at the time Claimant filed its Request for Provisional Measures, the investigation apparently has now concluded. Even if we assume that the investigation infringed Claimant's right of non-aggravation or exclusivity, the infringement ceased when the investigation ended.\n\n18.\n\nMoreover, even if the tax investigation of TS II were ongoing, a provisional measure to halt the investigation would not be necessary and urgent, based on Claimant's description of the investigation. Claimant did not show, for example, that the investigation threatened or caused irreparable harm or that Respondent's action had to be addressed prior to the resolution of this ICSID dispute on the merits. Accordingly, the Tribunal denies Claimant's request for a provisional measure with respect to the tax investigation of TS II.\n\nB. Respondent's Objection Regarding Diplomatic Protection\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Submissions of the Parties\n-----------------------------\n\n19.\n\nRespondent informed the Tribunal in a letter dated September 1, 2004, of the existence of written correspondence between Claimant and its home government, the Republic of Lithuania, and between Lithuania and Respondent regarding the STA's June 2004 planned documentary investigation of TS II discussed above. Respondent submitted to the Tribunal a copy of Claimant's letter to the Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs dated June 10, 2004, which urged the Minister to protect \"Lithuanian investments in Ukraine\" by calling on the Ukrainian tax authorities to justify their planned investigation of Claimant's subsidiary.24 Respondent also submitted a copy of a letter from the Lithuanian Embassy in Ukraine to the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated June 26, 2004, asserting that the tax investigation violated the rights of Claimant's subsidiary under Ukrainian law and Claimant's rights under Order No. 1 of this Tribunal, and requesting the Ministry to explain the competence of the tax authorities to take such action. Based on the foregoing, Respondent requested the Tribunal \"to decide whether a continuation of the given arbitration proceeding is in line with the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention (especially Articles 26 and 27 of Chapter II 'Jurisdiction of the Centre').\"\n\nAlthough the letter from Claimant to the Lithuanian Minister refers only to \"Taki Spravy,\" not \"Taki Spravy II,\" the target of the investigation is the latter, as the investigation is the same as the one contained in Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n20.\n\nClaimant filed observations in response to Respondent's letter on September 7, 2004, arguing that its request to the Government of Lithuania did not violate Articles 26 and 27 of Convention because the Tribunal's proceeding was suspended at the time of the request.25 Claimant also argued that the request of the Government of Lithuania did not violate the Convention because the subject of the request was the provisional measures order and not the underlying dispute before this Tribunal. Finally, Claimant argued that even if the request violated the Convention, such violation would not affect the continuation of these proceedings. Respondent replied to Claimant's observations on September 13, 2004, which was followed by a response from Claimant on October 8, 2004, and a reply from Respondent on October 21, 2004.\n\nSee Letter from Martina Polasek, Secretary to the Tribunal, to Tokios Tokel\u0117s (Claimant) and the Government of Ukraine (Respondent), (May 4, 2004) (notifying the parties of the resignation of Tribunal President Prosper Weil and the suspension of the proceeding); Letter from Antonio R. Parra, Acting-Secretary-General, to Tokios Tokel\u0117s (Claimant) and the Government of Ukraine (Respondent), (Aug. 23, 2004) (notifying the parties of the appointment of Lord Mustill as Tribunal President and the resumption of the proceeding).\n\n2. Decision of the Tribunal\n---------------------------\n\n21.\n\nArticle 27 of the ICSID Convention prohibits Contracting States from giving diplomatic protection in respect of a dispute involving one of its nationals if the dispute has been submitted to arbitration. Although Article 27 is directed to Contracting States, investors have a corresponding obligation under Article 26 not to pursue diplomatic protection.26 The term \"diplomatic protection\" includes not only espousing the claim of a national, but also a variety of other actions\u2014such as formal diplomatic interventions of the type at issue here\u2014that may be undertaken by a State to protect its national's interests in respect of a matter in dispute.\n\n*See Banro American Resources, Inc. and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Aurif\u00e8re du Kivu et du Maniema S.A.R.L. v. Democratic Republic of the Congo*, Award, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/7 (September 1, 2000) (excerpts), at paras. 15-20; *see also* Schreuer, at 387-88.\n\n22.\n\nWe find that Claimant's request to the Government of Lithuania was a request for diplomatic protection inconsistent with Claimant's obligation under Article 26. Claimant's explanation for its request is unpersuasive. The suspension of an arbitral proceeding does not suspend the obligations of the parties under the Convention, including the obligation to respect ICSID arbitration as the sole and exclusive remedy for the dispute. Once parties consent to arbitration, they are bound by the obligations of the Convention until an award is rendered or the case is terminated. Claimant's recourse to diplomatic protection was inconsistent with its obligations under Article 26 even though at the time of such recourse this proceeding was suspended pending the appointment of a replacement arbitrator. That recourse, however, appears to have ceased and there is no record of further diplomatic interventions and requests.\n\n23.\n\nThus, although Claimant's actions were inconsistent with Article 26, the appropriate response is not to discontinue the proceedings as suggested by Respondent. Abstention from diplomatic protection is not, in fact, a condition for the Centre's jurisdiction or the Tribunal's competence.27 Should Claimant hereafter transgress its obligations under Article 26, the Tribunal would entertain appropriate requests from Respondent.\n\nSee Schreuer, at 399, para. 6.\n\nC. Claimant's Request for Production of Documents\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nIn a letter dated September 8, 2004, Claimant requested the Tribunal to call upon Respondent to produce documents related to six different subject areas. Respondent delivered its response on September 13, 2004, which was followed by correspondence from Claimant on September 27, 2004, and October 8, 2004, and from Respondent on October 21, 2004.\n\n25.\n\nUnder Article 43 of the Convention and Arbitration Rule 34(2)(a), the Tribunal may \"call upon the parties to produce documents\" if the Tribunal \"deems it necessary\" to do so.\n\n1. Documents Related to January 2002 Announcement of Chairman of State Tax Administration\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nClaimant requests copies of \"[t]he order and any and all other written or verbal instructions, normative acts or other documents\" on which the Chairman of the State Tax Administration based his January 2002 announcement that STA would not conduct tax examinations of the mass media until after the elections on March 31, 2002. Claimant argues that it would use such documents, if they exist, to show that Respondent acted against government policy when it undertook examinations of Claimant's subsidiary during this period. Respondent argues that the temporary suspension of tax examinations did not apply to Claimant's subsidiary because it is not a member of \"printed mass media,\" and, therefore, Respondent should not be required to produce such documents.\n\n27.\n\nRespondent's assertion that Claimant's subsidiary is not a member of the mass media \u2013 an assertion on which we take no view \u2013 does not justify withholding the requested documents. Claimant's request for the production of verbal as well as written instructions, however, is overbroad. Accordingly, the Tribunal calls upon Respondent to produce within 30 days all written documents prepared by Respondent, if any, on the basis of which then Chairman of the State Tax Administration Mykola Azarov announced in January 2002 that there would be no tax investigations of the mass media in the first quarter of 2002.\n\n2. Documents Related to Alleged Violations of Election Law\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nClaimant requests copies of any documents related to an authorization issued by the Central Election Commission of Ukraine to the tax authorities regarding alleged violations of election law during the production of printed materials by opposition political parties. Claimant apparently wishes to establish that the tax investigations initiated by Respondent were without proper legal justification. Respondent indicates that it has tried but thus far has been unable to find responsive documents.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the efforts of Respondent to find the requested documents and calls on Respondent to continue searching for the documents and to produce them within 30 days from the date of this Order or to report by the same time limit about the result of its search.\n\n3. Documents Related to Violations of Tax Laws\n----------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant withdrew this request in a letter to the Tribunal dated October 8, 2004.\n\n4. Documents Related to Criminal Proceedings against O.V. Danylov\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nIn its letter dated October 8, 2004, Claimant requests that Respondent produce \"key pieces of specific evidence based on which Ukraine initiated the criminal case\" against O.V. Danylov. Respondent argues that Ukrainian law does not permit the materials underlying a criminal case to be disclosed. Claimant states that Respondent has mistranslated the relevant provision of Ukrainian law, which Claimant contends merely prohibits such materials from being announced or published. Respondent also argues that the criminal proceedings are unrelated to the dispute over Claimant's investment in Ukraine. Respondent notes that Claimant has not provided the Tribunal with any examples of a dispute arbitrated under the ICSID Convention that involved a criminal proceeding in the host State.\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal encourages Claimant to prepare its submission on the merits with the materials at its disposal with respect to the proceedings against Danylov on this subject. The Tribunal recommends Respondent to produce all documents that it is required by Ukrainian law to disclose to a defendant in this type of criminal proceeding, if it has not done so already.\n\n5. Documents Related to Surveillance of Claimant's Employees\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nClaimant initially requested \"all documents, audio-recordings, video-recordings or other evidence of eavesdropping, listening into telephone or other conversations as well as other forms of surveillance of employees\" of Claimant and its subsidiary. In its letter to the Tribunal dated October 8, 2004, however, Claimant modified its initial request and now asks the Respondent simply to \"affirm or deny\" whether it has conducted any surveillance of Claimant's employees since February 2002.\n\n34.\n\nAs modified, Claimant's request is not a request for documents within the scope of Article 43 but an interrogatory addressed to Respondent. There is thus no action requested of this Tribunal.\n\n6. Respondent's Internal Documents Related to the Dispute\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nClaimant initially requested \"all communications \u2026 which mention or are in any way related to Tokios Tokel\u0117s, Taki spravy, their employees or the given ICSID arbitration case which the Respondent does not have specific and reliable grounds to know are in fact already in the Claimant's possession.\" In response to Respondent's contention that the request must be more specific, Claimant modified its initial submission to request only \"internal memoranda regarding the dispute\" and \"the results of any internal investigations regarding complaints submitted by Claimant to the Ukrainian authorities.\"\n\n36.\n\nEven as modified, Claimant's request remains overbroad. The Tribunal notes that Respondent has expressed its willingness to respond to a more narrowly tailored request, and the Tribunal invites Claimant to submit such a request.\n\nIII. SUBMISSIONS ON THE MERITS\n------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nIn a letter dated October 1, 2004, the Tribunal invited the parties to communicate their views as to the number of and time limits for the submission of written pleadings on the merits. The parties agreed to two rounds of written pleadings but did not agree on time limits for their submissions. Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the parties to adhere to the following schedule: (1) Claimant's memorial is due on March 21, 2005; (2) Respondent's counter-memorial is due on May 20, 2005; (3) Claimant's reply is due on June 20, 2005; and (4) Respondent's rejoinder is due on July 20, 2005.\n\nIV. STATUS OF CLAIMANT'S INVESTMENT IN TS II\n--------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nIn this Order, the Tribunal finds that it is able to dispose of the pending requests without deciding the question raised by Respondent of whether Claimant's investment in TS II is within the scope of the present dispute. This question must be decided, however, if Claimant seeks to recover damages for alleged injury to TS II in the merits phase of this proceeding. In that event, we invite the parties to include in their opening written pleadings their views on whether TS II is within the scope of the present dispute."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2007-07-26T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion by Mr. Daniel M. Price (Award)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion by Mr. Daniel M. Price (Award)\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI join my colleagues in sections A through K and M through O of this Award. I dissent from section L and the decision of my colleagues that Respondent did not breach its obligation to accord Claimant fair and equitable treatment.\n\n2.\n\nMy colleagues find that \"a deliberate campaign to punish Taki spravy for its impertinence in printing materials opposed to the regime, or to expose Taki spravy as an example to others who might be tempted to do the same,\" if proved, \"must surely be the clearest infringement one could find of the provision and aims of the Treaty.\"1 I agree. There could be no serious debate that the fair and equitable treatment obligation set forth in Article 3 of the Treaty is breached where a State exercises its sovereign powers - investigatorial, prosecutorial, regulatory or otherwise - to harass, intimidate, or retaliate against an investor for political purposes.\n\n*See* Award at paragraph 123.\n\n3.\n\nThe majority and I are thus in apparent agreement on the content of the applicable legal standard. Where we disagree is in our assessment of the evidentiary record and on the central question of whether Claimant has established that the Respondent engaged in the type of activity that we all agree is proscribed by the Treaty. My colleagues find that Claimant has failed to meet that burden. I disagree and therefore respectfully dissent from the finding of the majority that the Respondent did not breach the obligations to accord Claimant fair and equitable treatment.\n\n4.\n\nAs the majority noted, there is relatively little disagreement between the parties over the basic facts at issue in this dispute.2 The parties do dispute whether the actions of the State against Taki spravy were motivated by legitimate governmental interests or by a desire to harass or punish the company for publishing campaign materials for BYT. As the majority also noted, the evidence to support this type of claim will in most cases be circumstantial, because government actions against an investor will rarely be taken for overtly political purposes.3\n\n*See* Award at paragraph 125.\n\n*See* Award at paragraph 126.\n\n5.\n\nIn my view, the evidence does establish that the State engaged in a deliberate and targeted course of conduct against Taki spravy that was triggered by the company's production of campaign materials for the BYT. That the State's actions were politically motivated can be ascertained most readily by: (i) the time period in which those actions occurred, beginning shortly after Taki spravy delivered campaign materials to the BYT and six weeks before a strongly contested parliamentary election; and (ii) the lack of a convincing or, in some cases, any legal justification for the State's actions that would rebut the rather clear inference that those actions were politically motivated. I further believe that the severity and duration of the State's actions against Taki spravy, described in paragraphs 35 to 72 of the Award, lends support to Claimant's argument that the State was engaged in an effort to harass and intimidate Taki spravy.\n\n*1. Timing of the State's Actions*\n----------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThis dispute between Taki spravy and the State's tax authorities arose during the political campaign leading up to Ukraine's parliamentary elections on 31 March 2002. In November 2001, Taki spravy entered into an agreement with Produkt BVO to supply printing and publishing services.4 Pursuant to that agreement, in the last quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, Taki spravy printed more than two million campaign-related documents.5 The most controversial of these documents was \"Unfulfilled Order,\" a brochure harshly critical of then-President Kuchma and laudatory of opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko, delivered on 31 January 2002.6 Although the State has questioned whether Produkt BVO actually ordered and paid for these materials and whether Taki spravy undercharged for its services, it has not disputed that Taki spravy produced the documents and delivered them in January 2002.7\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits at paragraph 20.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits at paragraph 22.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits at paragraph 21.\n\nDeclaration from the Press Service of the State Tax Administration of Ukraine at 2 (\"DP \u2018Taki spravy' realized the manufacture of such printed production: the brochure \"Unfulfilled Order\"... leaflets-calendars \u2018I know injustice\u2014I want to save you from injustice'. [and] brochures \u2018the Team of the Block of Yulia Tymoshenko\") (submitted as Annex 25 to Claimant's Memorial on the Merits); *see also id.* at 3 (\"[a]ccording to the act of transfer-acceptance by the printers DP \u2018Taki spravy' on 31.01.2002 there were printed and unloaded 440,000 copies of the brochure \u2018Unfulfilled Order'\"); *id*. at 4 (on 14 February 2002 Taki spravy \"concludes a contract for the already printed agitation materials. \u2018The Team of the Block of Yulia Tymoshenko'\"); Hearing on the Merits, Transcript, Volume III, at 43:25 to 44:3 (Counsel for Respondent stated that \"there is no evidence that Produkt BVO ordered either, \"Unfulfilled Order\", or the official campaign materials of bloc of Yulia Tymoschenko. That is the point\".).\n\n7.\n\nOn 14 February 2002, two weeks after Taki spravy produced and delivered \"Unfulfilled Order,\" the State's tax authorities arrived at the offices of Taki spravy to begin their investigation. Over the next six weeks leading up to the election, and for several months thereafter, the tax authorities engaged in on-site inspections of Taki spravy, made public allegations of criminal conduct, seized documents and computer hardware from the company, investigated its clients and suppliers, pursued criminal investigations of the company's management, froze the company's assets, issued demands for tax payments, and pursued court actions to nullify the company's contracts. I will address several of these events below but, for present purposes, will focus on the unrebutted inferences to be drawn from when they occurred.\n\n8.\n\nMy colleagues find that the timing of the State's actions is inconsistent with a political motive, which, in their estimation, \"could be expected to produce an immediate and intense burst of hostile activity, dying down quite rapidly once the election had terminated in favour of the existing regime.\"8 In the present case, they conclude that \"the intensity of the attack seems to have grown with time, rather than diminishing.\"9 At the same time, however, they suggest that if the State officials had been politically motivated, they would have waited until after the election to act to avoid \"the risk of promoting a campaign of injustice against the supporters of their political opponents, when within a very few weeks the outcome of the election might have installed those opponents in the high places themselves.\"10\n\n*See* Award at paragraph 135.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n9.\n\nFirst, I agree with my colleagues that the presence of a political motive would be expected to produce an immediate and intense burst of hostile activity. But in my view, such a period of activity clearly did occur. In fact, after the initial inspection of Taki spravy on 14 February 2002, the State's tax authorities entered the company's premises no less than six times over a three-week period from 22 February to 15 March to search for and seize documents.11 The nature of these inspections was described in the written testimony of Taki spravy's chief accountant in which he described one episode \"when more than 10 men intruded my office... I unwillingly recalled the terrible times of Stalin's repressions. They ransacked and searched all over: turned everything upside down.\"12\n\nThe documentation of the searches and seizures of documents from Taki spravy can be found at Annexes 11, 14, 15, 16, 21, and 23 (submitted with Claimant's Memorial on the Merits).\n\nWitness Statement by Taki spravy's Chief Accountant Halyna Rozora, Annex 20 (submitted with Claimant's Reply on the Merits).\n\n10.\n\nThe initial \"burst\" of activity also included STA's 25 March Press Statement containing the allegations of money laundering and election law violations that the State acknowledged at the hearing were not being investigated at the time the release was distributed. Further, Taki spravy was subject to at least three written demands for the production of documents during this early period of the disputes.13 Thus, in my view, the record shows that there was an immediate and intense burst of hostile action toward Taki spravy that supports Claimant's argument that actions were politically motivated.\n\nLetter from Solomiansky Tax Service to Taki spravy from 14 February 2002, Annex 4 (submitted with Claimant's Memorial on the Merits); List of Questions Attached to Certificate of Investigation from 14 February 2002, Annex 7 (submitted with Claimant's Memorial on the Merits); Letter from Solomiansky Tax Service to Taki Spravy from 18 February 2002, Annex 8 (submitted with Claimant's Memorial on the Merits).\n\n11.\n\nSecond, I agree with my colleagues that the State's actions did not die down rapidly after the election but disagree that this weakens Claimant's argument. Once the investigation was launched, it is not at all surprising that it would continue rather than suddenly cease after the election, if only because of bureaucratic zeal and the desire to avoid the appearance of political motivation. But more importantly, the State's political incentive to continue its actions against Taki spravy hardly diminished after the 31 March 2002 election. That is because, as we noted above, BYT's parliamentary campaign was understood to be a challenge to President Kuchma himself and a prelude to the presidential election that would occur two years later.14 Thus, even after the pro-government coalition retained power in March 2002, the State had a continuing reason to punish the supporters and commercial suppliers of its political opponents in anticipation of the next election.\n\n*See* Award at paragraph 8.\n\n12.\n\nI also disagree that if the State's officials were politically motivated they would have waited until after the election to act against Taki spravy in order to avoid the risk of retaliation in the event that the BYT gained power. I believe that the opposite is true. A political motive would prompt State officials to act when they did\u2014before the election\u2014in order to influence the outcome in their favour, maintain power, and prevent their opponents from obtaining positions of authority.\n\n*2. Absence of Justification for the State's Actions*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe State's failure to provide justification for many of its actions against Taki spravy, either at the time the actions were taken or during these arbitral proceedings, also supports Claimant's contention that those actions were politically motivated. The STA Press Statement of 25 March 2002 is the most glaring example. It states that \"there was discovered an active participant of illegal activity, namely... \u2018Taki spravy'\" and accuses the company of \"active participation in the activities of a diversified network for the legalization of \u2018dirty' money.\"15 It adds that Central Election Commission of Ukraine had \"authorized the tax service to check information about violations of election legislation.\"16 On the same day that STA issued the release, it directed local tax authorities to obtain widespread media coverage of the release,17 which was ultimately published in at least 124 newspapers across Ukraine.18\n\nDeclaration from the Press Service of the State Tax Administration of Ukraine, Annex 25, at 1 (submitted with Claimants Memorial on the Merits) (emphasis added).\n\nDeclaration from the Press Service of the State Tax Administration of Ukraine, Annex 25, at 2 (submitted with Claimant's Memorial on the Merits) (emphasis added).\n\nLetter from the State Tax Administration of Ukraine to Local Tax Administrations of 25 March 2002, Annex 26 (submitted with Claimant's Memorial on the Merits).\n\nClaimant submitted a compilation of these newspaper articles as Annex Volume II of its Memorial on the Merits.\n\n14.\n\nDuring the hearing on the merits, the State's tax officials acknowledged that STA had decided not to investigate Taki spravy for money laundering three weeks before it issued the Press Statement accusing the company of that crime.19 The officials also conceded that STA could not have investigated election law violations as it had no authority to do so.20 A State tax official also conceded in his testimony that the allegations in the Press Statement were inaccurate.21 Despite this acknowledgement, the STA never issued a press release to correct these errors and in fact never withdrew the press release, which remains on the STA website as of the date of this Award.22 In my view, the STA Press Statement demonstrates both an absence of a legitimate justification for the State's actions and an intent to harm the business reputation of Claimant's enterprise.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript, Volume III, at 240:15 to 241:5; Hearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume IV at 102:14-23.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript, Volume III, at 245:4-11.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript, Volume IV, at 105:9-18.\n\n*See* State Tax Administration of Ukraine, Declaration of the Press Service, at http://www.sta.gov.ua/news.php3?1439.\n\n15.\n\nThus, I agree with the observation of my colleagues that it is \"disturbing\" that the State made no attempt to explain why the STA made these inaccurate statements or why they were not corrected. I agree with them that \"[t]he episode casts a shadow over the entire behaviour and standards of the tax authorities.\"23 My colleagues further state that if the Press Statement had been \"entirely unprompted\" then \"there might have been grounds\" to find that it is \"evidence of a conspiracy being put into effect.\"24 They reject such finding, however, because the Press Statement \"was a response to criticisms published on the website of the Bloc some days previously.\"25 I fail to see how the BYT release mitigates responsibility for the unfounded allegations in the Press Statement or disproves the existence of a political motive. If my colleagues are suggesting that the errors were the product of a hastily written document, I cannot agree because the BYT release was issued on March 6, two-and-half weeks before the STA release. Moreover, whether or not the STA release was a response to the BYT's criticisms, why did the Release not state any accurate legal grounds for an investigation?\n\n*See* Award at paragraph 128.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n16.\n\nThe record contains additional evidence that the State's actions lacked legal justification. For example, on 1 April 2002, STA brought a complaint against Produkt BVO and Taki spravy in Economic Court, alleging that the companies were evading taxes and that one of the companies was pursuing objectives \"in conflict with the interests of the state.\"26 The Court invited STA to provide \"explanations and requisite proofs,\" which STA declined to do and the Court thus dismissed the complaint for lack of evidence.27 This case demonstrates the State's inclination to bring even unsubstantiated actions against Taki spravy thus lending support to Claimant's contention that the intent was to harass and impede the business of the company.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits at Annex 32.\n\nClaimant's Memorial on the Merits at Annex 67.\n\n17.\n\nIn addition, the \"tax demands\" that the authorities \"mistakenly\" issued in July and August of 2002, like the Press Statement, demonstrate the lack of justification for the State's actions and its refusal to correct erroneous allegations that it publicly broadcast against Taki spravy.28 Two weeks after the company challenged these demands in court,29 the tax authorities informed Taki spravy that the demands had been \"formed in an automatic regime... and were mistakenly sent to your address.\"30 In response, Taki spravy brought an action in court requesting that the tax authorities be ordered to issue a public correction of the erroneously issued demands.31 That is because the demands had been published in the media, including their dire warnings that all of the assets of Taki spravy were under tax mortgage and would be sold at auction in the event of non-payment. Notwithstanding the tax authorities' acknowledgment of its error, the Court dismissed Taki spravy's complaint.32\n\nFirst Tax Demand from the Solomiansky Tax Service to Taki spravy from 22 July 2002, Annex 128 (submitted with Claimant's Memorial on the Merits); Second Tax Demand from the Solomiansky Tax Service to Taki spravy from 7 August 2002, Annex 137 (submitted with Claimant's Memorial on the Merits).\n\nClaim from Taki spravy to the Economic Court of Ukraine from 19 August 2002, Annex 150 (submitted with Claimant's Memorial on the Merits).\n\nLetter from the Solomiansky Tax Service to Taki spravy from 3 September 2002, Annex 158 (submitted with Claimant's Memorial on the Merits).\n\nClaimant Statement from Taki spravy to the Solomiansky District Court in Kyiv from 11 November 2001, Annex 201 (submitted with Claimant's Memorial on the Merits).\n\nDecision from the Solomiansky District Court in Kyiv to Danylov S.V. from 5 December 2002, Annex 210 (submitted with Claimant's Memorial on the Merits).\n\n18.\n\nMy colleagues note that the warrants for the searches of Taki spravy's premises and seizures of the company's documents failed clearly to identify the legal grounds on which they were issued, as acknowledged by the State's witness.33 They find, however, that \"it is hard to see\" how the absence of legal justification \"can have caused additional damage to Taki spravy.\"34 I respectfully submit that this is not the point. Claimant does not argue that the lack of legal justification adds to its damages but rather that it provides evidence that the State lacked a valid motive and its actions could not be characterized as *bona fide* exercises of investigatory authority. My colleagues, however, conclude that the lack of justification actually argues against political motive because \"if the tax authorities were willing to lend themselves to a secret, dishonest and oppressive misuse of their power they would surely have taken the trouble to cover their tracks by making their paperwork look right.\"35 A more plausible explanation, in my view, is that the searches and seizures in fact lacked legal justification.\n\n*See* Award at paragraph 131.\n\n*Id*.\n\n*Id*.\n\n19.\n\nFinally, with respect to the criminal proceedings against Mr. Danylov, Claimant presented evidence that the proceeding was first initiated to punish Taki spravy for assisting BYT and later reopened to coerce Claimant into withdrawing its treaty claim.36 In my view, this evidence shifted the burden to Respondent to demonstrate the existence of a legal justification consistent with applicable treaty norms. It refused to do so. Indeed, when the Tribunal posed the question to counsel for Respondent,37 counsel referred the Tribunal to its earlier statement that \"Respondent sees no justifying reason to conduct, in an international investment arbitration proceeding a detailed discussion regarding closure of a criminal case and cancellation of such closure, whatever the motives and/or reasons for them..\"38\n\n*See* Direct Examination of O. Danylov, Hearing on the Merits, Transcript, Volume II, at 15:1-17; 17:1 to 18:6; 29:24 to 30:23; 32:21 to 33:25.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript, Volume I, at 265:24 to 266:12.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript, Volume I, at 171:20 to 172:1.\n\n20.\n\nMy colleagues \"accept that a manifest and gross failure to comply with the elementary principles of justice in the conduct of criminal proceedings, when directed towards an investor in the operation of his investment, may be a breach, or an element in a breach, of an investment treaty.\"39 They are unable to conclude, however, that the State's repeated openings and closings of the case against Mr. Danylov transgress that standard. Even assuming that a departure from elementary principles of justice must be manifest and gross in order to give rise to a breach of Article 3 - a standard I believe to set the bar too high40 -that standard is surely met where the State refuses to provide any justification for acts which, on the evidence, appear arbitrary or to raise serious questions about their motivation. If an ICSID tribunal may consider whether the conduct of criminal proceedings has breached the provisions of a treaty - a competence which all members of this Tribunal maintain exists in this case - then a respondent state must offer an explanation or justification for the acts called into question. If it fails to do so, a tribunal must decide the issue based on the credible evidence submitted by the claimant.\n\n*See* Award at paragraph 133.\n\nIf there is in fact a \"failure to comply with elementary principles of justice,\" it is unclear why such failure must be manifest *and* gross.\n\n21.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, I find that Respondent has breached Article 3 of the Treaty and must therefore, respectfully, dissent from the majority's decision that Claimant has failed to establish such a breach."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Award is made in an arbitration between the above-captioned parties in accordance with the dispute-resolution mechanism of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereafter \"ICSID\"). The arbitration is brought to enforce various provisions of a bilateral investment treaty, dated 8 February 1994 and entitled *Agreement Between the Government of Ukraine and the Government of the Republic of Lithuania for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments* (hereafter \"the Treaty\"), between the Republic of Lithuania and Ukraine.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant in the arbitration is Tokios Tokeles, a corporation registered in 1989 as a cooperative enterprise under the laws of Lithuania, and subsequently reorganised as a joint-stock company. Although Tokios Tokeles is the Claimant, the companies most immediately involved in the events giving rise to this arbitration were its two wholly-owned Ukrainian subsidiaries: Subsidiary Enterprise \u2018Taki spravy\u2019 and II Subsidiary Enterprise \u2018Taki spravy\u2019 (hereafter respectively \"Taki spravy\" and \"TSII\"). By the beginning of the year 2002, Taki spravy had for some years carried on a prospering business in Ukraine in the advertising, printing, publishing and allied trades, under the control and management of two brothers, **Mr. Oleksandr V. Danylov** and **Mr. Serhiy V. Danylov.** Both are citizens of Ukraine and resident in that country, apart from a period of some years commencing in May 2002, when Mr. O. Danylov left Ukraine for Lithuania, where he sought and obtained refugee status.\n\n3.\n\nThis has proved to be a difficult case, so much so that after prolonged and intensive discussions the Tribunal with regret finds itself unable unanimously to agree on the central issue in the dispute. In addition, depending on the outcome of that issue, several major questions of principle have arisen, some of them fundamental to the developing jurisprudence on investor/state arbitrations of the present kind. The parties\u2019 legal representatives have explored these issues with the greatest diligence, in written submissions extending over hundreds of pages, reinforced by oral argument. No line of enquiry has been neglected, no assertion by one has escaped contradiction by the other. This diligence is commendable, but it has tended to submerge in a mass of detail the central feature of the case, which is whether an inference favourable to the Claimant\u2019s complaint can be drawn from a course of events which is largely undisputed. Unlike many ICSID arbitrations this does not require the Tribunal to master and rule on complex technical matters, or to evaluate conflicting oral testimony on primary facts. The task is simple - simple to state, that is, not simple to decide - to see whether the facts speak for themselves, when placed in context, both as evidence of wrongdoing by the State and as to the outcome of that wrongdoing, so that they are sufficient to prove, with the requisite degree of conviction, the proposition of fact on which the Claimant bases its claim.\n\n4.\n\nThis proposition is that Taki spravy was the target of a long-running campaign of oppression by State agencies, instigated for political reasons by a person or persons in high authority, and taking the shape of numerous episodes of unjustified interference with Taki spravy\u2019s activities and management, largely by the Kiev tax administration but with the connivance of prosecution and judicial organs, under the guise of investigations into breaches of Ukrainian economic laws. It is alleged that the effect on Taki spravy\u2019s business, customer relations and staff welfare was so great as to constitute a wrongful \"expropriation\" of the investment made by the Claimant in Ukraine via Taki spravy, and was also a breach of Ukraine\u2019s obligations under the Treaty to accord fair and equitable treatment to that investment. The same conduct is asserted to be a breach of the internal laws of Ukraine which the Claimant invokes to support its Treaty claims. The Claimant seeks in this arbitration monetary compensation amounting to nearly USD 65,000,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\n\n5.\n\nOn 29 April 2004 the Panel of Arbitrators, as then constituted,1 issued a formal document (\"the Decision on Jurisdiction\") which contained rulings on various procedural issues, including a challenge by Ukraine to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which was dismissed. Subsequently, after the re-constitution of the Tribunal,2 the challenge was revived, partly on grounds substantially the same as those already rejected in the Decision on Jurisdiction, and partly in reliance on facts which, wrongfully, had not been disclosed by the Claimant to the former Tribunal. Justice required that the issue of jurisdiction should be reassessed in the light of this new information, and it was decided that the submissions and conclusions upon it would be incorporated, together with the issues of liability and quantum, in the present Award.\n\nProfessor Prosper Weil (President), Professor Piero Bernardini and Mr Daniel M. Price.\n\n*See infra* at paragraph 26.\n\n**B. THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE**\n-------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nIt would be impossible to achieve, and hazardous to attempt, a full account of contemporary Ukrainian history, even in the respects most closely relevant to the present dispute. Something must however be said about two aspects of it, in order to place in context the dispute, and the rival interpretations of events.\n\n*1. The Political Situation in Brief*\n-------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe long history of suffering and oppression endured by Ukraine and its peoples forms an inescapable background to the dispute between Tokios Tokeles, its subsidiaries and the State. The declaration of independence in 1991 marked the formal emancipation of the country, and the adoption of a new constitution five years later, establishing a pluralistic parliamentary system and protection for human rights and liberties, promised a real break with the past, and hope for the future. In practice, the changes did not happen overnight. Many familiar faces were still to be seen in public positions, and the presence of powerful neighbours continued to be felt. The building of national unity was hampered by deep geographical, ethnic and cultural divides; and these factors also underpinned lasting controversy about the positioning of Ukraine in its political and economic relations with external powers.\n\n8.\n\nIn consequence, the events of 2001-2003 which form the substance of the present dispute were played out against a backdrop of volatility and fragmentation in Ukrainian political life. In November 2001, when so far as the evidence goes the Ukraine State authorities and the various corporate and natural persons who feature in this dispute began to intersect, a general Parliamentary Election was only a few months away. This was distinct, in principle, from the next election of a President, which was not due until 2004, when (as later events were to show) it would be the occasion of a convulsion in Ukrainian political life. Meanwhile, the position of the long-serving President, **Mr. Leonid Kuchma,** was not directly under threat. In reality, however, his personality, record, methods and policies were widely identified with the interests of the political alliance holding power in Parliament at that time. It was inevitable that efforts to unseat the existing majority would involve a challenge to Mr. Kuchma himself, and this is what duly happened. One of the most conspicuous elements campaigning for a change of government was a \"Bloc\", a loose grouping identified by the name of **Ms. Yulia Tymoshenko,3** a charismatic and outspoken politician, strongly opposed to Mr. Kuchma and his policies. As the Parliamentary elections drew close, this Bloc (referred to in some of the documentary evidence as \"the **BYT\")** set about the production and distribution of written electioneering materials in considerable quantities. Samples of these were deposited, as required by law, with the Electoral Commission. Also in widespread distribution was a volume entitled (in translation) \"Unfulfilled Order\", which was as hostile to Mr. Kuchma as it was laudatory of Ms. Tymoshenko. Whilst it has been asserted that this was printed by Taki spravy on the instructions of BYT, some press reports suggested that the BYT and Ms. Tymoshenko had each repudiated the volume, attributing it to a private venture. The Tribunal cannot resolve this problem, but will assume for present purposes that \"Unfulfilled Order\" had come to the attention of those in power in some way which associated it with Taki spravy.\n\nThe transliteration of Ukrainian names is not consistent.\n\n9.\n\nIn the event, the results of the poll held on 31 March 2002 were announced as showing that the ruling party, backed by President Kuchma, had obtained a majority of the votes cast, but insufficient to constitute an absolute majority. The adherents of the old regime thereafter continued in power, albeit in circumstances of increasing stress, throughout almost the entire duration of the events relied upon by the Claimant as instances of the hostile campaign commenced against Taki spravy in February 2002. It was not until the closing months of 2004, when Mr. Kuchma\u2019s tenure as President was due to expire, that popular upheavals and a re-run Presidential election forced the existing regime from power. We do not describe these, or their aftermath, since they are not relevant to the present dispute, beyond noting for future reference that for several months during the year 2005 Ms. Tymoshenko was Prime Minister of Ukraine.\n\n2. *The Economic Situation in Brief*\n------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nIt is plain that by the start of the current millennium the Government of Ukraine had become seriously concerned by two unlawful practices which were believed to be exacerbating the already serious economic situation then prevailing. First, \"money-laundering\", and secondly \"tax-evasion\". These practices, common enough world-wide, need no definition here, but there is one feature common to both which plays an important part in the present dispute, namely the use of \"fictitious enterprises\". We have not seen any official definition of this term4, in its Ukrainian usage, or indeed any precise account of its meaning. But the general idea is clear enough. The \"enterprise\" - i.e. firm, or company or business - is not fictitious in the sense of having no existence at all, but is a sham, a falsehood, a \"front\", a dummy, or whatever word one may choose to describe something which is not what it purports to be, and whose real functions are not what they purport to be. Such entities can perform a variety of functions in wrongful economic dealings. In this particular context, they can be used to record spurious indebtedness to be netted-off against earnings for tax purposes, or they can be introduced into circular transactions in which money changes its exchange value; and so on. If the existence of such an entity is detected as an apparent participant in a transaction, it can be assumed that it is there for a reason; and that the reason may be nefarious. Thus, the authorities are instructed to be on the lookout for signs of fictitiousness; and \"signs\" are established as the criterion: not, at this first stage, concrete evidence. Then, if signs of fictitiousness are detected the authorities are entitled to investigate further, and in particular to pursue third-party investigations. So, if scrutiny of a transaction between A and B reveals signs that B may be fictitious, then the authorities may look beyond that transaction into the wider dealings of B, and perhaps move on to scrutinise its relations with C, who will then itself become a subject of investigation.\n\nAs distinct from \"Fictitious entrepreneurship\", which was defined by Art. 148-4 of the Criminal Code, as the \"creation or acquisition of subjects of entrepreneurial activity (juridical persons) without intention to carry out charter activity, if it has inflicted material damage upon the State, a bank, a credit institution, other juridical persons or citizens\".\n\n11.\n\nNo doubt several agencies of the State were alert for signs of fictitiousness, but the one with which this dispute is most closely concerned was the State Tax Inspectorate, of which at the outset of the events **Mr. V.P. Furlet,** was then (before his promotion to a more senior post in the State Tax Administration (\"STA\")) the Senior Investigator of the Inspectorate in the Solomanskaya district of Kiev. Mr Furlet\u2019s assistant in these matters was **Mr. M.V.** **Vasyuk.** These two officials were in charge of the actions taken by the tax authorities which form the heart of the Claimant\u2019s case against the State under the Treaty.\n\n**C. THE CLAIMANT\u2019S CASE**\n--------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe theme of the Claimant\u2019s complaint is unmistakable, even if the language used is not always exactly the same. The following extracts from its written submissions will make this clear:\n\n\"The requesting parties TT and TS allege that, in the year 2002, state bodies of Ukraine committed a series of unfounded, illegitimate and unlawful acts directed against the investments made by TT into TS\".5\n\n...\n\n\"Tokios Tokeles\u2019 claims in the given case concern actions committed by state agencies of Ukraine which are connected by a unity of wrongful intent and purpose on the part of government officials of interfering with the business of Tokios Tokeles\u2019 wholly-owned subsidiary in Ukraine, Taki spravy. This goal of intentionally damaging Taki spravy was realised through various measures implemented by state agencies of Ukraine in order to ultimately achieve an illegitimate political goal, namely to punish Taki spravy for supporting an opposition politician, Yulia Tymoshenko.\n\nSimilar practices of a concerted campaign against a particular company or individual have an established history in Ukraine. Such practices have received their own nomenclature - \u2018nayizd\u2019\".6\n\n...\n\n\"The \u2018nayizd\u2019 practice is relevant to the given case in that it ties together the many actions, which may otherwise seem disparate, committed by the Respondent with regard to Taki spravy. The practice of \u2018nayizd\u2019 helps to characterise and assists in understanding the relevant facts concerning Taki spravy which form the factual basis of the given dispute\".7\n\n...\n\n\"The entire series of acts by state agencies of Ukraine with regard to Tokios Tokeles\u2019 investments in Ukraine, specifically in its investment vehicle Taki spravy, is rife with violations of the BIT, Ukraine\u2019s laws and international law. These acts and their attendant violations comprise a single whole, which consists of the intentional, premeditated, destruction of Taki spravy\u2019s business operations and its reputation.\n\nThat this wave of repressive actions against Taki spravy began immediately after Taki spravy printed a large amount of campaign material for Yulia Tymoshenko provides convincing circumstantial evidence that the authorities vented their wrath on Taki spravy precisely for its support of an opposition politician. This conclusion is supported by the focus of the state agencies\u2019 activities: companies which executed work on behalf of or supported the Block of Yulia Tymoshenko\".8\n\nIn order to ensure that it had correctly understood the nature of the Claimant\u2019s case the Tribunal addressed the following questions to Mr. O. Danylov in the course of his oral evidence:9\n\n\"PRESIDENT: And what you are asking, or your company is asking us to infer is that all the way through to the end, or nearly the end of 2004 there was a continuous nayizd persecution of the company because of its association with Madame Tymoshenko. Is that what your company is alleging?\n\nANSWER: Yes.\n\nPRESIDENT: And that is all part of - of course, up to that point at least, all part of one continuous nayizd?\n\nANSWER: In the extent you described at the beginning of your question in 2002 it was more often, and it was more powerful, so to say. Later, especially in view of the order by ICSID Tribunal10 it was not that often\".\n\nRequest for Arbitration at paragraph 12.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraphs 16 and 17.\n\n*Ibid,* paragraph 19.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraph 684.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume III, pages 68 *et seq.*\n\n*Viz.* Order No. 1, granting interim protective measures.\n\n13.\n\nThe message is quite clear. The Claimant was the victim of a conspiracy, inspired by political rancour, put into effect through the State authorities, and carried through for years as a single course of conduct from shortly after the Claimant\u2019s activities gave offence to the regime. Whether this is proved is what the dispute is about. Equally clear is what the dispute is not about. For example, the Claimant does not contend that this is a case where a single instance of blameworthy conduct reached the level of being in itself an international wrong. This is not surprising, since although (as we shall record) there were such instances, none could on its own have caused damage to Taki spravy on a scale remotely approximating to the amount claimed. Nor is it said that this is a case where numerous individual episodes, separately arising, can be agglomerated to make an international delict. Nor still is it suggested that law enforcement authorities failed to take reasonable measures to protect the Claimant from unlawful or harmful actions by third parties. Instead the Claimant has chosen (and there may well have been no other available choice) to express its complaint in the way we have summarised. It is on this that the Tribunal must focus its attention.\n\n14.\n\nBefore leaving this topic one important point must be emphasised. The Claimant has, very reasonably, made much of the personal antagonisms rife in Ukrainian politics, with a view to explaining the alleged nayizd in terms of President Kuchma\u2019s adverse reaction to the Bloc election materials. To bring the persecution home to Mr. Kuchma himself is not however an essential element in the cause of action. What does matter, for the purposes of the Treaty, is whether there was a malicious campaign, and if so whether it can be attributed to the respondent State. For this purpose the Tribunal must in practice form an idea, necessarily based on secondary and circumstantial evidence since direct evidence is out of reach, not so much about the identity of the prime mover but about whether it was a person or group of persons whose actions were, for the purposes of the Treaty, those of the State.\n\n**D. SUMMARY OF PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nSince the procedural history of the dispute has some bearing on the issues which remain for decision it is convenient to set it out at this stage in a compressed form, as follows.\n\n*1. The Request for Arbitration*\n--------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nOn 16 August 2002 Tokios Tokeles and Taki spravy filed at the Centre a Request for Arbitration dated 14 August 2002 against the Government of Ukraine. The requesting parties maintained that Tokios Tokeles was properly to be regarded as an investor for the purposes of both the ICSID Convention and the Treaty. It was claimed that, since 1994, Tokios Tokeles had invested more than USD 6.5 million in the territory of Ukraine, and that these investments were duly registered with the Ukrainian authorities. In the Request, it was further asserted that Taki spravy should be treated as a national of another Contracting State on the basis that, \"it is a wholly owned subsidiary of Tokios Tokeles, it was created expressly for the purpose of realizing investments by Tokios Tokeles in the territory of Ukraine and because of the close and extensive measure of control exercised by Tokios Tokeles over its subsidiary..,\"11 The Claimants further noted that, \"[i]n any event, TS lies at the heart of the dispute between the parties and should be included in the arbitration proceedings on that basis\".\n\nRequest for Arbitration at paragraph 6.\n\n17.\n\nAmongst other items, the Request for Arbitration identified the complaints against the State in terms quoted above at paragraph 12. The Request was accompanied by a Letter of Consent dated 7 August 2002, signed by Mr. Serhiy Danylov as Chairman of the Board of Tokios Tokeles expressing the consent of that company to the jurisdiction of ICSID over the dispute therein identified.\n\n2. *Withdrawal and Resubmission*\n--------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nOn 15 October 2002, however, ICSID notified the requesting parties that a condition for submitting a dispute to ICSID had not been fulfilled, namely the requirement under Article 8 of the Treaty, under which the investor is only entitled to submit a case to ICSID if a dispute between the parties cannot be settled through negotiations within a period of six months. Accordingly, on 17 October 2002, the requesting parties informed ICSID that they withdrew their Request for Arbitration until such time as it \"may be renewed and resubmitted for consideration to the Centre\". The Request for Arbitration was resubmitted by Tokios Tokeles and Taki spravy on 22 November 2002.\n\n19.\n\nOn 6 December 2002, the Centre alerted the requesting parties to the fact that, \"the parties have not agreed that [ Taki spravy ] should be treated as a national of another Contracting State under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and Article 1(2) of the bilateral investment treaty between the Government of Ukraine and the Government of the Republic of Lithuania\". In response, on 9 December 2002, Tokios Tokeles informed the Centre that, in view of the absence of such an agreement, Taki spravy would be removed as a requesting party. However, Tokios Tokeles reserved \"the right to introduce Taki spravy as well as other potential claimants, including legal as well as physical persons, to the cause at some future date\". In the event, no subsequent attempt has been made to re-introduce Taki spravy as a party to the arbitration, or to add TSII.\n\n*3. Notice of Registration*\n---------------------------\n\n20.\n\nAfter re-submission of the Request for Arbitration, the State initiated exchanges with ICSID and the Claimant on an endeavour to cause the Secretary-General of ICSID to exercise his power under Rule 6(b) of the \"Institution Rules\" to refuse to register the Request. The Secretary-General nevertheless proceeded to notify the parties that the Request had been registered.\n\n*4. Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal*\n------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn 20 February 2003, sixty days having passed since the registration of the Request for Arbitration, the Claimant notified the Centre that it had chosen the formula established in Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention. Accordingly the Tribunal was to be composed of three arbitrators, one appointed by each party and the third, who would be the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n22.\n\nOn 5 March 2003, the Claimant notified the Centre of its appointment of Mr. Daniel M. Price, a national of the United States of America, as arbitrator. On 24 March 2003, the Respondent notified the Centre of its appointment of Professor Piero Bemardini, a national of Italy, as arbitrator. The parties being unable to agree on the appointment of the President of the Tribunal, the Claimant by letter dated 25 March 2003 requested, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 4(1), that the appointment be made by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council. Thereupon the Chairman of the Administrative Council, in consultation with the parties, appointed Professor Prosper Weil, a national of France, as an arbitrator and designated him as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal held its first session in Paris on 3 June 2003, the outcomes of which were Orders No.l and No.2 made on 1 July 2003 whereby the Tribunal granted interim protective measures and decreed that the proceedings would be bifurcated to permit certain issues of jurisdiction to be heard and determined before the remainder.\n\n*5. Hearing on Jurisdiction: Reconstitution of the Tribunal*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nAccordingly, after the filing of written submissions, the Tribunal held an oral hearing in Paris on 10 December 2003 to receive the objections to its jurisdiction. Thereafter the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction. The members were divided in their opinions. Contrary to the submissions of the State, Professor Bernardini and Mr. Price concluded that the Claimant is an \"investor\" of Lithuania within the meaning of Article 1 (2)(b) of the Treaty and a \"national of another Contracting State\" for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. These arbitrators went on to hold that the Claimant had made an \"investment\" in Ukraine as defined by the Treaty, and that the dispute arose from that investment. Accordingly, they held that the objections to jurisdiction should be rejected.\n\n25.\n\nProfessor Weil recorded his dissent from this conclusion in an opinion attached to the Decision on Jurisdiction. Conceiving that it would be inappropriate in the circumstances for him to play a further part in the arbitration, Professor Weil notified the Centre of his resignation as arbitrator and President of the Tribunal.\n\n26.\n\nBy letter dated 23 August 2004, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties of the appointment of the Rt. Hon. Lord Mustill as President of the Tribunal, in substitution for Professor Weil. The proceedings, which had been suspended pending the new appointment, then resumed.\n\n27.\n\nThere would be little point in listing the successive written submissions filed by the parties, nor with one exception attempting to reduce to a reasonable compass the numerous and extended contentions which they advanced. The substance of these can be sufficiently gathered from the account given in this Award. The exception relates to information disclosed for the first time by the Claimant in its Second Request for Provisional Measures of 14 September 2004. This was to the effect that on 6 April 2002, four months before the Claimant\u2019s first Request for Arbitration, Taki spravy had transferred to its fellow subsidiary TSII a \"unitary property complex\" leaving behind with Taki spravy only 10 or 11 items of assets. This disclosure formed one of the grounds on which the State submitted, on 30 June 2005 Additional Objections to Jurisdiction. The Tribunal declined to rule immediately on this objection, and postponed argument and a decision upon it until the full oral hearing and the resulting Award.\n\n*6. The Substantive Oral Hearing*\n---------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Tribunal conducted a hearing in Paris from 16 to 19 January 2006. The parties were represented by counsel who presented their respective cases to the Tribunal and also examined witnesses from their side and put questions to witnesses from the opposing side. Transcripts were made of the hearing and distributed to the parties. Present at the hearing were:\n\nMembers of the Tribunal:\n\nLord Mustill, President. Professor Piero Bernardini and Mr. Daniel Price\n\nSecretary of the Tribunal:\n\nMs. Martina Polasek\n\nAssistant to the President of the Tribunal:\n\nMs. Jessica Wells\n\nAttending on behalf of the Claimant:\n\nMr. Ivan Lozowy, Mr. Oleksandr Danylov, Mr. Serhiy Danylov, Ms. Ludmilla Zhyltsova\n\nAttending on behalf of the Respondent:\n\nMr. Kostyantyn Krasovsky, Mr. Dmitri Grischenko, Dr. Sergei Voitovich, Mr. Oleg Shevchuk, Mr. Andriy Alexeyev, Mr. Oleg Vysochynskyy, Ms. Yulia Konyuskenko, Ms. Larisa Lischynks and Mr. Vsevolod Chentsov\n\nThe following witnesses were called by the Claimant:\n\nMr. Oleksandr Danylov, Mr. Serhiy Danylov\n\nThe following witnesses were called by Ukraine:\n\nMr. Volodymyr Furlet, Mr. Mykola Vasyuk and Ms. Olena Volska.\n\n29.\n\nIn the course of the hearing, the Tribunal addressed a series of questions to the parties with a view to elucidating their respective submissions. These were subsequently reduced to writing, and were the subject of answers from each side in the closing written exchanges.\n\n30.\n\nAt all stages of the proceedings, the Members of the Tribunal deliberated extensively by various means of communication, taking into account all pleadings, documents and testimony adduced, whether or not specifically referred to in this Award. The proceeding was declared closed on 27 June 2007.\n\n**E. THE CLAIMANT\u2019S NARRATIVE**\n-------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThis is essentially a case on the facts, and although a number of important and difficult issues of principle were thoroughly explored by the parties and discussed within the Tribunal, it can be seen that, with the sole exception of the separate issue of \"expropriation\", the outcome of the dispute is dictated by the view taken on a single question whether the Claimant has established according to the relevant standard of proof that the events complained of were the product of a nayizd. This is a question of inference, requiring a choice between two fundamentally different narratives. One, presented by the Claimant, describes the interaction between Taki spravy, its officers and the STA. The other views the history in the context of investigations carried on by State agencies at and around the time in question, and whilst not directly challenging the Claimant\u2019s bare recital of events, treats it as incomplete and potentially misleading.\n\n32.\n\nApart from the question of quantum, which raises quite separate issues, the heart of the Claimant\u2019s case consists of the account which follows of the dealings between the STA and Taki spravy. There is, in addition, a quantity of written and oral evidence from the Messrs. Danylov giving personal accounts of interviews with officials, both in the year 2002 and again in 2005, in which they describe pressures allegedly applied to extort admissions, false evidence against Mr. Romanov, and the dropping of the present ICSID arbitration. For economy of space the Tribunal abstains from setting this out, since it reinforces but does not enlarge the case built upon the largely undisputed course of events. It has however been fully taken into account when at a later stage the implications of fact are discussed.\n\n33.\n\nThe way in which the Claimant has formulated its case requires the Tribunal to reach conclusions on (a) What happened as between the STA and Taki spravy, and (b) Why did it happen? The answer to the first question calls for little evidence, since the fact that the events relied upon by the Claimant both to found the inference of a political persecution and to display the persecution in progress actually happened is scarcely in dispute. Thus, for example, where the Claimant\u2019s Memorials assert that tax officials visited its offices on a particular date, or that a demand for documents was made on another date, or that identified criminal proceedings were set in motion against Taki spravy, there is very often no contest that this is what happened, although in a number of instances the description of the incident is not accepted. The real controversy is about why these events took place. On this, the Claimant\u2019s case is ultimately very simple. One only has to look at the events, their volume, their timing, their absence of legal justification, and the political context to conclude that there could be no other reason for them but political spite thinly disguised as a tax inspection. *Res ipsa loquitur.*\n\n34.\n\nThere are problems with this approach, quite apart from the existence of materials which point the other way. One is simply a question of perspective. The Claimant presents its data in a dense mass of more than two hundred instances, undifferentiated in terms of type and significance, and simply unmanageable as it stands. To draw any reliable inference from it a perspective must be achieved, and for this purpose the episodes must be reduced to some kind of order, without descending to an over-analysis which would smother the central issue in detail. The Tribunal has approached this from two angles. First, it has prepared for the purposes of its deliberations, and now appends as Annex A, an extensive summary of the allegations, which have been divided broadly according to subject matter. Secondly, to enable a more simplified view it has compressed the complaints into a graphic in the form of a chart showing the variation with time of the numbers of events about which complaints are made (Annex B). The Tribunal draws particular attention to these Annexes, which are integral parts of this Award, and which display in perhaps a more accessible format the data on which to a large extent the Claimant\u2019s case is based, but for the moment it will simply set out a narrative account of the allegations, largely as formulated in the claims and supported by contemporaneous documents submitted by Claimant with its memorials and by testimony at the hearing on the merits.\n\n*1. Taki Spravy Produces Campaign Materials for BYT*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Taki spravy entered into a series of agreements in late 2001 to print campaign-related materials for the BYT in connection with the parliamentary elections scheduled for 31 March 2002.12 The following month and in the first quarter of 2002, Taki spravy produced approximately 2.5 million of these campaign documents, including 440,400 copies of the volume described above, \"Unfulfilled Order,\" which were delivered on 31 January 2002.13\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraph 20, Annex 1.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraphs 21-22.\n\n36.\n\nThe tax authorities initiated their investigation of Taki spravy on 14 February 2002, which will be discussed further below. In response to the investigation, BYT issued a press statement on 6 March 2002, which stated in part: \"[i]mmediately after the Electoral Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko...had delivered to the Central Election Commission the samples of agitation materials of the Bloc printed at the publishing house \u2018Taki spravy\u2019, this publishing house experienced outrageous pressure, threats, and blackmail on the part of the State Tax Administration...It stands to reason that the only \u2018guilt\u2019 of publishing house \u2018Taki spravy\u2019 is its consent to print the official agitation campaign materials of the Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko\".14\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits at Attachment 77.\n\n37.\n\nOn 16 March 2002, the Chairman of the Election Commission, Mr. M. M. Ryabets, received from a parliamentary candidate a letter of complaint, drawing attention to the large print runs of \"Unfulfilled Order\" and \"The Team of the Bloc of Yu. Tymoshenko\" - \"printed, by the way, at the same printing house \u2018Taki Spravy\u2019\". The writer asked the Chairman to \"charge the competent bodies with the check-up of the financial violations by Yu. Tymoshenko...and give me the answer: 1. Who, and how much money, paid for printing of 500,000 copies of the book \u2018Unfulfilled Order\u2019? 2. By whom, and what amount, was the fee to the author paid? 3. How much money was spent on the distribution of the book, and from what sources?\"\n\n38.\n\nOn the same day the Chairman sent what was presumably an internal memorandum to a Mr. V. V. Alsufyev, as follows: \"I request that you send the complaint for an urgent examination to the State Tax Administration of Ukraine and to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine\". Mr. Alsufyev promptly forwarded the complaint to Mr. M.Ya. Azarov, the Head of the State Tax Administration, asking for information on what was stated in it, as soon as practicable but not later than 19 March 2002.\n\n*2. The State\u2019s Press Statements*\n---------------------------------\n\n*2.1 The Press Statement of 25 March 2002*\n------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nOn 25 March 2002 the STA issued a Press Statement in which it alleged that Taki spravy was under investigation for suspected money laundering.15 The Statement also asserted that STA was investigating alleged election law violations at the request of the Central Election Commission. During the hearing on the merits, however, witnesses for the State acknowledged that Taki spravy was not under investigation for money laundering at the time the statement was issued. In addition, witnesses for the State also acknowledged that STA has no enforcement authority with respect to election law. According to the STA Press Statement \"a check of the activities of DP \u2018Taki spravy\u2019 was made...because of its active participation in the activities of a diversified network for the legalization of \u2018dirty\u2019 money\". STA asks, \"then why does DP \u2018Taki spravy\u2019 go for unjustified expenses, working for its own losses? Surely because the difference is covered at the expense of \u2018shadowy\u2019 sources of finances and the flows of \u2018dirty\u2019 money\". The statement concludes, \"the violations discovered during the course of the investigation of DP \u2018Taki spravy\u2019 have signs of crimes as foreseen by...Article 209 (the legalization (laundering) of money funds and other property, received by criminal means) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine\".16\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 25.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 25.\n\n40.\n\nDuring the hearing on the merits, Mr. Furlet was asked \"[b]y the end of February 2002, did the authorities of Ukraine, especially your department, reach a conclusion that there was not enough evidence to go forward against Taki spravy or its management for crimes of money laundering?\"17 Mr. Furlet responded: \"[w]ith respect to myself at the end of February 2002, as far as I can recollect, the decision, criminal procedural decision about responsibility of Taki spravy management with regards to money laundering was not taken, so the decision was not taken that they were responsible for money laundering\".18 Mr. Vasyuk was asked, \"[t]o your knowledge, after February 2002...was either Taki spravy or Mr. Danylov under investigation for money laundering?\" Mr. Vasyuk responded, \"[f]or money laundering there was none\". Mr. Vasyuk was asked, \"[n]one after February?\" Mr. Vasyuk replied, \"That\u2019s right\".19\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume III at 240, lines 15-20.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume III at 240, lines 24-25; 241, lines 1-5.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume IV at 102, lines 14-17, 21-23.\n\n41.\n\nMr. Vasyuk was then asked why the money laundering allegations were included in the 25 March 2002 STA Press Statement when both Mr. Vasyuk and Mr. Furlet testified that Taki spravy was not suspected of or under investigation for money laundering after February 2002. Vasyuk testified that \"[p]robably, [ the Press Statement ] is not written correctly enough because Taki spravy transferred non-cash funds into cash money using the scheme which has been well known to tax police for quite a long period of time, as it is mentioned here through fictitious or dummy firms, and when, in the press, the process of transferring non-cash funds into cash money sometimes is wrongly called \u2018money laundering\u2019. So I think from a legal standpoint, this material is written not correctly\"20 [sic]. However, Mr. Vasyuk\u2019s explanation that Taki spravy was under investigation for receiving income from unknown sources was not consistent with his other testimony. Mr. Vasyuk was asked, \"[s]o, in your opinion, the Press Statement should have talked about tax evasion, not money laundering\".21 Mr. Vasyuk agreed, saying, \"[a]bout tax evasion through- by means of moving funds through fictitious firms\".22 The Act of Investigation from the Kyiv State Tax Administration, however, does not allege that Taki spravy received moneys from unknown sources rather, it alleges that Taki spravy claimed improper expenses and VAT credits associated with those expenses.23 The nature of the allegations of tax evasion was confirmed by Mr. Vasyuk, who was asked, \"[s]o in both cases they are claiming deductions or expenses to which they are not entitled\". Mr. Vasyuk responded, \"[y]es, correct\".24\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume IV at 105, lines 9-18.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume IV at 105, lines 19 to 21.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume IV at 105, lines 22 to 23.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 56, p. 7.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume IV at 108, lines 3 to 6\n\n42.\n\nThe STA Press Statement also appears to allege that Taki spravy acted illegally or improperly by undercharging for the production of the material for the BYT. It states, \"[without a doubt, the citizenry of Ukraine should turn its attention to the privileged or sponsored price of printing services. At least, their value for real should be 20 times greater\".25 However, when Mr. Vasyuk was asked whether this allegation is \"at all related to the tax evasion case,\" Mr. Vasyuk responded, \"[n]o...1 didn\u2019t investigate this particular issue in the course of the case\".26 With respect to suspected election law violations, the STA Press Statement states, \"[b]esides that, the Central Election Commission of Ukraine, as directed by current legislation, authorized the tax service to check information about violations of election legislation during the manufacture of printed production by the... \u2018Election Block of Yulia Tymoshenko\".27 When Mr. Furlet was asked, \"[a]re the Tax Police responsible for enforcing elections laws,\" Mr. Furlet responded \"[n]o. The Tax Police does not have the task of exercising control over the observance of election laws...\".28\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 25, p. 4.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume IV at 111, lines 10-14.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 25, p. 2.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume III at 245, lines 4-9.\n\n43.\n\nOn the same date as the Press Statement of 25 March 2002, STA sent a letter to local tax authorities urging them to seek broad media coverage of the statement,29 which was eventually reported in over 100 newspapers.30 On 27 March 2002, Taki spravy issued a declaration and press statement denying the allegations.31\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 26.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 25 (cont.) in Volume II.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexes 27-28.\n\n44.\n\nThe evidence is unclear as to whether the 25 March 2002 STA letter to local authorities was consistent with STA\u2019s normal operations or an exceptional occurrence. Mr. Furlet, however, sidestepped the question from the Tribunal as to whether \"any of those other companies\" that Mr. Furlet had testified \"were subjected to the same treatment\" as Taki spravy \"were the subject of a press release by the state authorities and whether the state authorities issued a directive to local authorities to publish that press release\".32 He said \"there is a kind of not very official guideline from the management of the tax administration to the heads of departments to speak through the mass media from time to time,\" noting that in the two months prior to the hearing, he had \"participated in mass media activities highlighting certain activities against economic crime\".33 In addition, Mr. Vasyuk was asked: \"have you ever received a letter during your service in these terms directing the authorities to provide urgent coverage, and to report on steps taken?\" He replied, \"[s]uch a letter I never received because my competences covered the criminal investigation, and I am not engaged in public relations\".34 Finally, when the Tribunal asked O. Danylov for his opinion as to the purpose of the STA letter to local tax administrations, Danylov responded, \"the objectives of the State Tax Administration of Ukraine sending this letter were purely political\".35\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume III at 243, lines 6-12.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume III at 243, lines 14-17, 21-23.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume IV at 112, lines 12-18.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume III at 59, lines 20-22.\n\n*2.2 Other STA Press Statements*\n--------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nOn 27 November 2002, STA issued a press statement accusing Taki spravy (along with Rembudproekt and Produkt BVO) of conspiracy, tax evasion, dishonesty and illegal turnover.36 On 16 January 2003, STA issued another press statement accusing Taki spravy of conspiracy and tax evasion.37 On 28 December 2002, an announcement appeared in \"RIO\" newspaper listing Taki spravy as an \u2018indebted enterprise\u2019 in amounts that far exceeded Taki spravy\u2019s actual debts. Claimant later asserted that STA was responsible for having this allegedly erroneous information published.38\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 207.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Supplemental Annex 5.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 218.\n\n*3. Investigations and Court Proceedings*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*3.1 Taki Spravy and Produkt BVO*\n---------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nOn 14 February and 18 February, and 2 July 2002, the Solomiansky tax service (hereafter \"STS\") sent to Taki spravy a written request for documentation of its relationship with Produkt BVO.39 The Claimant argues that it complied with the requests even though they were overly broad and without legal foundation.40 On 21 and 26 February 2002, Solomiansky Tax Police (hereafter \"STP\") rendered decisions to seize documents from Taki spravy relating to its relationship with Produkt BVO.41 On 22 and 26 February, and 5 March 2002, STS searched and seized documents from Taki spravy.42 Regarding the 5 March episode, Taki spravy\u2019s chief accountant stated, \"when more than 10 men intruded my office...1 unwillingly recalled the terrible times of Stalin\u2019s repressions.

The Court rejected STA\u2019s request and on 20 May 2002, dismissed the complaint for lack of evidence.45\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 32.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 67.\n\n*3.2 Taki Spravy and Rembudproekt*\n----------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nOn 13 March 2002, STP authorised the inspection of Taki spravy\u2019s dealings with Rembudproekt.46 On the same date (and again on 15 March 2002), STP authorised warrants and seized documents from Taki spravy relating to its dealings with Rembudproekt.47 On 19 April 2002, STA requested Taki spravy to provide information regarding its dealings with Rembudproekt.48 The Claimant argues that it complied with these requests even though they were unsubstantiated and contrary to Ukrainian law. On 7 May 2002, STA issued an \"Act of Investigation\" pursuant to its investigation that Taki spravy failed to make proper tax payments based on its transactions with Rembudproekt.49 On 13 May 2002, Taki spravy submitted objections, which STA rejected on 14 May 2002.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexl9.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexes 21 and 23.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 47.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 56.\n\n49.\n\nOn 7 May 2002, the General Procuratura (hereafter \"GP\") submitted a claim against Rembudproekt and Taki spravy in the Economic Court (Case No 10/399-02-2-25/5178), requesting the Court to invalidate the contract and order the companies to pay the taxes owed. On 30 May 2002, the Court returned the complaint \"without review\". On 17 June 2002, GP appealed the Court\u2019s decision. On 15 July 2002, the Economic Court of Appeals upheld the 30 May 2002 decision. On 16 July 2002, GP appealed to the Higher Economic Court; on 20 August 2002 the Higher Economic Court annulled the lower court\u2019s decision. On 4 September 2002, Taki spravy appealed to the Supreme Court; on 3 January 2003, and again on 6 February 2003, Ukraine\u2019s Supreme Court rejected the appeal.\n\n*3.3 Investigation of Taki Spravy Clients*\n------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nOn 8 April 2002, STA sent letters to three clients of Taki spravy, requesting documentation of their relationship with Taki spravy.50 On 10 April 2002, STA sent letters to two additional clients of Taki spravy, informing them that their relationship with Taki spravy was being investigated.51 The Claimant argues that the five letters do not comply with relevant legal requirements because they do not indicate the legal basis for the request and the investigation.52 In response to questions from the Tribunal, Mr. S. Danylov testified that, of the five clients who received letters from STA, one was \"one of our biggest customers\", another was a \"very big customer\" and another was a significant supplier.53 The Claimant submitted an unsigned witness statement of one of the clients, O.Yarosh of Palitra Druku, indicating that he was the subject of harassment and pressure from STS because of his business relationship with Taki spravy.54\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexes 36-38.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexes 40-41.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraphs 402 and 403.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume III at 60, lines 14-25; 61, lines 1-25; 62, lines 1-22.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 252.\n\n*3.4 Other Allegedly Unfounded Investigations, Searches and Seizures*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nOn 14 February 2002, the STS issued two certificates for tax investigations of Taki spravy.55 On 5 April 2002, STS authorised and executed seizure of documents from Taki spravy relating to LLC Agenstvo Alfo, a company that made payment on behalf of Produkt BVO for campaign materials produced by Taki spravy.56 On 16 April 2002, STS requested Taki spravy to provide personal information regarding its employees, which Taki spravy refused on grounds that such disclosure would violate confidentiality protected by law.57 On 22 and 23 July 2002, STS seized documents and a computer from Taki spravy.58 On 5, 7, 9 and 12 August, 18 September, 4, 16, 22 October and 7 November 2002, STS authorised and conducted additional document seizures.59 Each of these seizures was apparently related to the criminal case against Mr. O. Danylov. Between 30 May 2002 and 25 October 2002, the State issued eleven summonses regarding investigation of Taki spravy. The Claimant alleges that these summonses were legally defective for various reasons (for example, for failure to state subject matter).60 On 7 November, two agents of the State entered the home of a Taki spravy officer, I. Butuzov, without permission, threatened arrest and refused repeated requests to leave. Mr. Butuzov left Taki spravy on 3 June 2003, citing intimidation and fear for his safety.61\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexes 5-6.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexes 33-34.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexes 45, 50.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexes 123-125.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexes 133, 138, 144, 146, 167, 178, 183, 186, 199.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraphs 533-542.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraphs 543-544.\n\n*4. Tax Notice Decisions and Related Proceedings*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nOn 13 May 2002, STS issued two Tax Notice Decisions, demanding payment of taxes allegedly owed.62 On 21 May 2002, Taki spravy submitted a complaint to the Economic Court (Case No: 11/134), requesting that the Court invalidate the Tax Notice Decisions for lack of evidence. On 31 May 2002, Taki spravy submitted a complaint to the Economic Court seeking \"preventative measures\" which the Court granted. On 11 June 2002, STA requested the Court to suspend proceedings, which the Court granted. On 18 June 2002, Taki spravy appealed the decision to suspend the proceedings. On 23 July 2002, the Economic Court of Appeals rejected Taki spravy\u2019s appeal in the light of the pending criminal case against Messrs O. Danylov and Romanov.63 The Claimant argues that the decision to suspend the case and to uphold that decision were rendered without adequate explanation and were subject to improper influence.64\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexes 58-59.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 127.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraphs 619-626, Annex 78.\n\n53.\n\nOn 23 July 2002, STS issued a \"First Tax Demand\" to Taki spravy and on 7 August 2002, STS issued a \"Second Tax Demand\" to Taki spravy (collectively hereafter \"the Tax Demands\").65 On 19 August 2002, Taki spravy submitted a complaint to the Economic Court (Case No 29/266) requesting the Court to invalidate the Tax Demands for reasons including lack of foundation and violation of time limits.66 On 23 August 2002, TS addressed a \"Declaration\" to Solomiansky District Court and the Solomiansky Procuratura with a request that a criminal case be opened against STS officials based on actions that resulted in the Tax Demands. The Court forwarded the complaint to STS. On 3 September 2002, STS informed Taki spravy that the Tax Demands were sent to Taki spravy by mistake.67 On 11 September 2002, STS by letter informed Taki spravy that the Tax Demands were invalid.68 Also on 11 September 2002, the Economic Court halted proceedings in Case No 29/266 at the request of STS.69 On 11 November 2002, Taki spravy submitted a complaint to Solomiansky District Court requesting that the Court order STS to issue a public correction of the erroneously issued Tax Demands, which were published in the media.70 The Court rejected the complaint on 5 December 2002.71 On 11 March 2003, Taki spravy submitted a similar complaint and request to the same court, which once again rejected it.72\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexes 128, 137.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 150.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 158.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 164.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 163.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 201.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 210.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 231.\n\n54.\n\nOn 3 April 2003, STS issued two additional Tax Notice Demands.73 On 11 April 2003, Taki spravy requested the Economic Court (in Case No. 25/353) to invalidate the additional Tax Notice Demands based on deficiencies in the investigation.74 On 10 June 2003, the Court granted Taki spravy petition to suspend the proceeding in light of the pending ICSID case.75\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 236.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 237.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 244.\n\n*5. Tax Investigations and Arrest of Taki Spravy Assets*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nOn 6 June 2002, STA issued a notice of a complex documentary investigation of Taki spravy. On 17 June 2002, STS sent three of its officials to Taki spravy to conduct an \"open-ended\" investigation. Taki spravy expressed concern to STS officials, who left and returned the following day with several armed STP employees. On 20 June 2002, STA adopted a decision to place under administrative arrest all assets of Taki spravy.76\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexes 90-93.\n\n56.\n\nIn response to the asset seizure, Taki spravy filed a complaint with the Economic Court on 21 June 2002 (Case no 11/148), seeking to overturn the decision. On 15 August 2002, the Economic Court issued a decision denying relief to Taki spravy, which Taki spravy appealed on 30 August 2002. On 20 December 2002, the Economic Court of Appeals denied the appeal. Taki spravy appealed this decision on 20 January 2003. On 11 March 2003, the Higher Economic Court accepted the appeal and on 30 May 2003, adopted a decision to remand the case for *de novo* review. On 8 July 2003, the Economic Court dismissed the case.\n\n57.\n\nOn 25 June 2002, STA requested the Economic Court (Case No 21/246) to extend the arrest for an additional 90 days. On 27 June 2002, the Economic Court extended the arrest for 30 days, rejecting the Claimant\u2019s request to join this case with Case No 11/148. On 5 July 2002, Taki spravy appealed against this decision. On 23 July 2002 the Economic Court decided to suspend proceedings pending a decision in Case No 11/148. On 26 July 2002, STA lifted the arrest of assets.\n\n*6. The Criminal Case Against Mr. O. Danylov: Case No. 79/00032*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nOn 13 March 2002, STS initiated a criminal tax evasion case (Case No 79-00111) against Rembudproekt; on 28 March 2002 this was expanded to include Mr. V. Romanov (Rembudproekt\u2019s Director). It appears that this case was later combined with Case No 79/00032, which had been initiated against Mr. O. Danylov on 14 May 2002, for tax evasions based on transactions said to have been entered into with Rembudproekt. During May 2002, Mr. O. Danylov left Ukraine for Lithuania. On 3 July 2002, STP issued an indictment against Mr. Romanov and Mr. O. Danylov. Whilst in custody, Mr. Romanov gave statements supporting STS\u2019s charges but later retracted those statements, alleging that he had been coerced. On 19 September 2002, Romanov filed a complaint alleging that he had been subject to physical abuse and denied access to legal counsel.77 On 6 November 2002, Mr. O. Danylov sought refugee status in Lithuania. On the following day, Solomiansky District Court rendered guilty verdicts against him *(in absentia)* and Mr. Romanov, who was sentenced to six and a half years imprisonment. On 22 November 2002, Mr. Romanov brought an appeal to the Appellate Court, which was rejected on 21 January 2003. On 13 May 2003, the Supreme Court denied relief.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 168.\n\n59.\n\nOn the same day, 13 May 2003, Lithuania granted Mr. O. Danylov refugee status. On 3 March 2005, Mr. O. Danylov returned to Ukraine. On 25 April 2005, STA notified Mr. O. Danylov that it had decided to close the case against him for lack of evidence.78 However, on 8 August 2005, GP notified him of its decision to reopen the case, though it declined Mr. O. Danylov\u2019s request for a copy of the decision.79 On 16 November 2005, the STA decided again to close the case for lack of evidence.80\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits at Annex 1.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits at paragraph 18.\n\nLetter to Martina Polasek, Secretary to the Tribunal, 3 January 2006.\n\n60.\n\nThe case was reopened on 29 December 2005.81 During the hearing on the merits, Mr. O. Danylov testified that, during a meeting with Mr. V. Schvets, a high level official in the Prosecutor General\u2019s office, Mr. Schvets told him that the criminal case against Mr. O. Danylov would be reinstated unless the Claimant withdrew its ICSID claim.82 Mr. O. Danylov further testified that he had meetings with the Head of the State Police, Mr. Katerinchuk, and the Prosecutor General of Ukraine, Mr. S. Piskun, both of whom linked the criminal case to the ICSID claim.83 Mr. O. Danylov testified that he met with the First Deputy Prosecutor, S. Vynokurov on 29 December 2005, who showed him a copy of a letter from the Minister of Justice, Mr. M. Holovaty, to the Prosecutor General, which described the present ICSID proceedings. Mr. Vynokurov used the letter to indicate that the Claimant was demanding too much money from Ukraine and urged Mr. O. Danylov to withdraw the ICSID claim.84\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume I at 96, lines 1-3.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume II at 15, lines 1-17; 32, lines 21-25.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume II at 17, lines 1-25; 18, lines 1-5; 33, lines 15-25.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume II at 42, lines 16-25; 43, lines 1-25; 44, lines 1-3.\n\n7. *Other Denials of Claimant\u2019s Requests for Relief*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant made numerous written appeals to high level tax authorities, the Presidential administration, and central and local Procuraturas, requesting them to intercede to stop the alleged mistreatment of Taki spravy. According to the Claimant, each appeal was summarily dismissed, in some case in contravention of the statutory or constitutional obligations of those offices to pursue bona fide investigations of such complaints.85\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraphs 545-572.\n\n62.\n\nOn 27 June 2002, Taki spravy filed a complaint with the Solomiansky District Court (Case No 2-2335) alleging various illegal acts by STA officials.86 On 2 July 2002, the Court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.87 On 18 November 2002, Mr. S. Danylov filed a complaint in Solomiansky District Court claiming that the State Tax Inspectorate engaged in improper seizures, which the Court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.88\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 98.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 139.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annexes 203, 209 and 211.\n\n*8. The Tax Authorities\u2019 Requests for Taki Spravy to Provide Testimony Against BYT*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nOn 26 February 2002, Mr. O. Danylov met with Mr. Furlet intending to negotiate a settlement of the dispute. According to Mr. O. Danylov, Mr. Furlet questioned him \"regarding companies which had placed orders with Taki spravy for the Block of Yulia Tymoshenko\".89 When Mr. Furlet was asked by counsel whether he \"put questions regarding the political background of the \u2018Unfulfilled Order\u2019\", such as \"[w]hat party stands behind the customer,\" Mr. Furlet replied \"[a]s far as I recollect I didn\u2019t ask such questions\".90\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraph 30, Annex 159.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume III at 101, lines 23-25; 102, lines 1-4.\n\n64.\n\nOn 11 March 2002, Mr. O. Danylov met with Mr. Furlet, who, according to the Claimant, \"suggested that Oleksandr Danylov attest in writing that Taki spravy had received cash payments for orders placed with Taki spravy on behalf of the Block of Yulia Tymoshenko\".91 When Mr. Furlet was asked by the State\u2019s counsel about this allegation, he responded \"[n]o, I didn\u2019t make such a proposal\".92\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraph 35, Annex 159.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume III at 103, Line 1.\n\n65.\n\nAccording to his written statement, Mr. S. Danylov met with Mr. Furlet on 20 May 2002, during which meeting \"Furlet said that his superiors and he himself desire for me to testify that Yulia Tymoshenko gave me a \u2018valise\u2019 with money in it for the printing of the book\".93 In response to a question from the State\u2019s counsel, Mr. Furlet denied making this proposal.94 On 29 July and 15 August 2002, Mr. S. Danylov again met with Mr. Furlet, who, according to Mr. S. Danylov, encouraged him to provide testimony against BYT.95 According to Mr. S. Danylov, \"Furlet in various forms repeated one and the same thing: that I and my coworkers give testimony against Kochetkov (an official representative of BYT)\".96 According to Mr. S. Danylov, Mr. Furlet said that if Mr. S. Danylov and Mr. O. Danylov \"both give testimony against Kochetkov, then they will close the criminal case [ against Mr. O. Danylov ] and lift the siege of our enterprise\".97 In response to questions from the State\u2019s counsel, Mr. Furlet testified that it was Mr. O. Danylov and Mr. S. Danylov who proposed to offer testimony against BYT officials in exchange for the Tax Service dropping the criminal case: \"they said we could, in exchange of closing down the case, make a public action to discredit this political leader. We may name the persons who acted on her behalf, and so on. I didn\u2019t agree with that proposal because that went beyond my competence and was not \u2014 didn\u2019t meet the requirements of criminal and procedural legislation\".98\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 156, p. 5\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume III at 103, lines 7-11.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraphs 130, 145.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 156, p. 7.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 156, p. 8.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume III at 104, lines 6-13.\n\n*9. Evidence of Discrimination Against Other Publishers*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal asked Mr. O. Danylov \"whether other printers or publishing houses performed services [ in early 2002 ] for parties being part of the opposition, in addition to Taki spravy?99 Mr. O. Danylov responded:\n\n\"At that point in time in Ukraine, there was a very hard situation for the opposition [groups] in the perspective of the printing and publishing products because the government had blocked all the possibilities for producing printing products for those blocs and parties. Many directors of printing houses called me and told me that they had been instructed not to accept the orders from those parties and blocs. The State printing companies had been directly instructed not to accept such orders. The private printing houses had been warned verbally by the tax authorities not to accept such orders, otherwise they would run into big problems. I had also received such signals. I often relayed to Directors of printing houses, publishing houses, printing shops, and they often shared with me that such signals were there\".100\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume II at 123, lines 14-17.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume II at 123, lines 23-25; 124, lines 1-14.\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimant submitted with its Reply a letter from Mr. O. Turchynov, an official of BYT, to Mr. S. Danylov, which said that \"the printers in Kyiv categorically refused to place [ orders from BYT ]. Moreover, their management believes that the very fact of such negotiations, if they are to become known, will definitely lead to problems in relations with the current government\".101 The letter continues, \"during the period of the pre-election campaign of 2002 all the large printers of Ukraine were unofficially warned by local representatives of the tax administration and other force structures, that any cooperation with the Block of Yulia Tymoshenko and the political structures which enter into it, will inevitably lead to the closure of the enterprise\".102\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits, at Annex 7.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits at Annex 7.\n\n68.\n\nIn its post-hearing brief the Claimant responded to the Tribunal\u2019s question: \"[d]uring the same period, have other publishing or printing enterprises performed services for the opposition? If so, were they made subject to interventions by the local authorities similar to those experienced by Taki spravy?\" The Claimant cited numerous sources to demonstrate that newspapers, publishers, and printing companies that provided services for, or positive media coverage of, opposition politicians were subject to intervention by governmental authorities. According to these sources, the governmental actions included: (1) the detention of delivery trucks and seizures of print runs, (2) refusals to publish, (3) criminal investigations, (4) searches of offices, and (5) withholding of utility services.103\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief at 24-31. The sources cited by the Claimant include, (1) The Press and the Government: a Chronicle of Confrontation (published by Ukrainian partner of Reporters Without Borders), (2) annual speech to Parliament of Ukraine\u2019s Commissioner for Human Rights, and (3) 2002 Annual Report on Ukraine by Reporters Without Borders.\n\n69.\n\nIn the State\u2019s post-hearing brief it alleges that \"at least five additional enterprises printed or arranged for the production of official campaign materials for the BYT in 2002,\" none of which was \"subject to interventions by the local authorities similar to those experienced by TSI [ Taki spravy ]\".104\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief at paragraph 21.\n\n*10. Political Asylum Granted by Lithuania*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nAccording to documents submitted by the Claimant, Lithuania granted Mr. O. Danylov refugee status on 13 May 2003.105 The decision to grant asylum was based on a 18 May 2003 document issued by the Lithuanian Migration Department, which states in part that the \"[possibility of persecution of Olexksandr Danylov was confirmed by the information of situation in Ukraine, and the materials presented by the applicant proved the fact of such persecution\".106 Mr. O. Danylov was asked \"[w]as there a process by which you applied for asylum in Lithuania?\"107 Mr. O. Danylov responded:\n\n\"[d]uring those interviews [ with Lithuanian Immigration officials ] I had to inform maximum possible extent about all the circumstances of persecution and provide them with the maximum possible number of documents and materials which would testify to this persecution... [T]he Immigrations Department took a decision to grant me status of a political refugee in Lithuania\".108\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 239.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Annex 238.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume II at 132, lines 13-14.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume II at 133, lines 1-5, 8-9.\n\n71.\n\nIn response to the same question, Mr. O. Danylov testified that, during his stay in Lithuania, \"Lithuania refused, rejected my extradition to Ukraine, and my arrest, refused to arrest me, because the Interpol, through which Ukraine demanded my extradition and arrest according to the Interpol statute, Interpol had no rights to take any actions against...people who were granted political immigrant status\".109 Mr. O. Danylov testified that \"when I took a decision to come back into Ukraine after the political situation in the country had changed I submitted the relevant application to the Immigrations Department in which I indicated that because of change to political situation in Ukraine, and because the authorities in Ukraine changed, I took a decision to return back to Ukraine\".110\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume II at 133, lines 12-18.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript Volume II at 135, lines 13-20.\n\n*11. Other Evidence that the State\u2019s Actions Were Politically Motivated*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimant submitted with its Memorial a letter from Peter Byrne, a staff writer for the Kyiv Post, in which Mr. Byrne recalled a 25 June 2003 meeting with Anatoly Yakovinets, deputy head of the tax police investigative unit. According to Mr. Byrne, Yakovinets said that the case against Taki spravy \"was motivated on political grounds, referring to an order \u2018from above\u2019 to put the printing house out of business\".111 As counsel for the Claimant noted at the hearing, the State declined to call Mr. Byrne for cross-examination. According to the Claimant, Mr. O. Danylov met with the Director of the Investigative Directorate of the Tax Police, Mr. B.Y. Valentynovych on 11 April 2002, who informed Mr. O. Danylov that \"the tax service is after [ Taki spravy ] very strongly\".112\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at Supplementary Annexes, Annex 3.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraph 55 (quoting Annex 159, at 5).\n\n**F. THE CLAIMANT\u2019S MAJOR ALLEGATIONS**\n---------------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimant identifies within the main body of events a number of specific instances to which it attaches particular weight. The occurrence of these is not disputed, but there is radical controversy about their significance. For the moment, we do not do more than identify them.\n\n*1. The Press Statement of 25 March 2002*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nFirst, there was an episode which we describe at a little length, because of the importance attached to it by the Claimant. This was evidently set in motion by a press statement of the BYT on 6 March 2002. The following extracts serve to set the tone:\n\n\"Immediately after the Electoral Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko hand [sic] delivered to the Central Election Commission the samples of agitation materials of the Bloc at the publishing house \u2018Taki spravy\u2019, this publishing house experienced outrageous pressure, threats and blackmail on the part of the State Tax Administration. Numerous other unplanned examinations on the part of the tax police, which are accompanied by gross violations of the laws and elementary norms of human respect, resulted in a complete blocking of the publishing house\u2019s operation. It stands to reason that the only \u2018guilt\u2019 of publishing house \u2018Taki spravy\u2019 is its consent to print the official agitation campaign materials of the Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko\".\n\n75.\n\nIt was plainly as a response to this public attack that the STA issued its own Press Statement of 25 March 2002. In particular, importance is attached to the following extracts from the Press Statement:\n\n\"As a result of the discovery of connections, the movement of financial flows and structures related to the legalisation of \u2018shadow\u2019 funds there was discovered an active participant in the illegal activity, namely the Lithuanian subsidiary private enterprise \u2018Taki spravy\u2019 that is why a check of the activities of DP \u2018Taki spravy\u2019 was made not accidentally and in no way based on political considerations. Rather because of its active participation in the activities of a diversified network through legalisation of\u2018dirty\u2019 money for the legalisation of\u2018fictitious\u2019 firms, substitute persons, falsified documents, \u2018fictitious\u2019 contracts. It is established that the legalisation of \u2018shadow funds by DP \u2018Taki spravy,\u2019 an active participant in the network, the \u2018fictitious\u2019 enterprises PP \u2018Produkt BVO\u2019, PP \u2018Rembudproekt\u2019, ZAT \u2018Teslo\u2019, TOV \u2018RIF\u2019, PP \u2018Lira\u2019 were used.\n\n...\n\nNaturally, with the legalisation of dirty money demanded from DP \u2018Taki spravy\u2019 a documented legalisation and masking by the realisation of business operations. It was these operations which drew the attention of the tax service. Besides that, the Central Electoral Commission, as directed by current legislation, authorised the tax service to check information about violations of election legislation during the manufacture of printed production by the election block of political parties \u2018The Election Block of Yulia Tymoshenko\u2019. It is established that on 28.11.2001 there was concluded Contract No. 645 between the \u2018fictitious\u2019 Enterprise PP \u2018Product BVO\u2019 and DP \u2018Taki spravy\u2019 for the manufacture of printed production. On the part of the \u2018fictitious\u2019 enterprise PP \u2018Produkt BVO\u2019 the contract was signed by the supposed director Chemera S.S and on the part of \u2018Taki spravy\u2019 by the director Danylov O.V.\"\n\n76.\n\nAfter deploying figures to suggest that the apparent loss on printing was in reality financed by the BYT the Press Statement turned to a brochure entitled \"The team of the Block of Yulia Tymoshenko\", asserting that according to the documentary orders it appeared to have been ordered twice, and commenting:\n\n\"It should be noted that the contract was falsified already during the course of the investigation of \u2018Taki spravy\u2019. Without a doubt, such a speed is connected only with the effort to hide the fact of the preparation of the agitation materials of the election block of political parties at the expense of money from the \u2018fictitious\u2019 enterprise PP Produkt BVO and the financing from dubious sources of origin\".\n\n77.\n\nFinally, the following must be quoted:\n\n\"The violations discovered during the course of the investigation of DP \u2018Taki spravy\u2019 have signs of crime as foreseen by Article 358 section 1 (falsification of documents, seals, stamps and letterhead, their sale, the use of falsified documents) and Article 209 (the legalisation (laundering) of money funds and other property, received by criminal means) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. Right now these materials are being reviewed\".\n\n78.\n\nThe weight to be attached to this document as part of the Claimant\u2019s allegation of a \"nayizd\" is discussed at a later stage. One thing is however clear, that its plain implication that Taki spravy was part of a ring of money-launderers (as distinct from tax-evaders) was not on the date of its publication established by the evidence available to the tax authorities, whatever \"signs\" of it they may have believed to be present. So much was conceded by the witnesses for the State during the oral hearing; the serious charge of money-laundering soon disappeared from the case; and the State has never sought to persuade the Tribunal that it was in fact well-founded.\n\n79.\n\nIn conclusion, it should be recorded that this document was circulated to numerous agencies who did in due course refer to it in the press with a request to publish it with urgency; that it has been said on behalf of the Claimant that only a few days later this Request was \"withdrawn\", although the State denies this; and that its unfounded allegation of moneylaundering has never been put right by the tax authorities. The Press Statement, and the incorrect allegations which it contained, has never itself been \"withdrawn\" and indeed remains on the STA website until this day.\n\n80.\n\nFinally, in its Response to the State\u2019s Observations, of 3 April 2006, the Claimant noted that the State had not attempted to put forward its own version of events. It noted that the State\u2019s main response to the allegations was not so much that the event alleged never occurred, but was centred on the lack of authority of the relevant officials to negotiate regarding the ICSID arbitration. In response the Claimant asserts that, if the General Procuratura wished to exert pressure on Tokios Tokeles, it could have done so, since it held the power to reopen criminal cases. The Claimant repeated its submission that the repeated opening and closing of the criminal cases constitutes a violation of due process.\n\n*2. The Raids of 17 - 20 June 2002*\n-----------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nNext, particular importance was attached by the Claimant to events occurring on 17 and 18 June 2002. Three certificates were issued by the Solomiansky Tax Service for an open-ended investigation of Taki spravy for the years 1 January 1999 to 1 April 2002, and officers arrived at Taki spravy\u2019s premises to perform it. The visit ended in an impasse, and officers returned the next day accompanied by a tax militia carrying side arms. There was considerable noise and confusion, in the course of which Taki spravy summoned the local police. The incident died down without violence and the documents were seized and taken away. Taki spravy was permitted to make and retain a video record of the incident which the Tribunal has viewed.\n\n*3. The Administrative Arrest of Taki Spravy\u2019s Assets*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nParticular complaint is made about a full administrative arrest of the assets of Taki spravy, which appears was extended by one month as the result of a court order, and which is said to have created great difficulties for the running of its business. Taki spravy instituted court proceedings to invalidate the arresting order (Case No 11/148) but this was unsuccessful at first instance and on appeal.\n\n*4. The Electoral Commission*\n-----------------------------\n\n83.\n\nIt will have been noted that in the Press Statement of March 25, 2002, the STA justified its investigations into Taki spravy on the additional ground that \"...the Central Election Commission of Ukraine, as directed by current legislation, authorized the tax service to check information about violations of election legislation during the manufacture of printed production by the... \u2018Election Block of Yulia Tymoshenko\u2019\" In fact, no current or other election legislation empowered the Commission to confer such an authority, and the Claimant cites this as another example of State agencies riding roughshod over the rights of individuals to further a political aim.\n\n*5. Proceedings in the Courts of Ukraine*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimant occupies much of its lengthy rehearsal of the numerous individual complaints with accounts of acts done or omitted by the Courts of Ukraine and by the Procuratura. The chronological relationship of these to the more direct dealings of the State authorities can readily be understood from Annex B, and we shall not explore it in detail here. For the moment it is sufficient to say that the Claimant\u2019s allegations in relation to the various court cases falls into two categories:\n\nLegal actions brought by the State agencies of Ukraine which allegedly were devoid of grounds and based on insufficient evidence and which were consequently dismissed by the courts; and\n\nCases in which the executive agencies were allegedly able to exert pressure on judges to adopt decisions which were contrary to the facts and the law.\n\n**G. THE CLAIMANT\u2019S FORMULATION OF BREACHES**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the events thus summarised were infringements of the following provisions of the Treaty:\n\n*\"ARTICLE 2. PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF INVESTMENTS*\n\n2. *Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall at all times enjoy full* *protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party\".*\n\n*\"ARTICLE 3. MOST-FAVOURED-NATION-TREAIMENT*\n\n*1. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments and returns of investors of the other contracting Party treatment which is fair and equitable and not less favourable than that which it accords to investments and returns of investors in any third State.*\n\n*2. Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investment which is fair and equitable and not less favourable than that which it accords to investors of any third State\".*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*\"ARTICLE 5. EXPROPRIATION*\n\n*1. Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised,* *expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereafter referred to as \u2018expropriation j in the territory of the other* *Contracting Party except for a public purpose. The expropriation shall be carried out under due process of law, on a non-discriminatory basis and shall be accompanied by provisions for the payment ofprompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such compensation for the benefit of an investor shall be equivalent to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before expropriation or the impending expropriation became public knowledge. The compensation shall include interest calculated on the LIBOR basis from the date of expropriation, shall be made without delay, shall be effectively realizable and shall be freely transferable in freely convertible currency.*\n\n*2. The provision of paragraph 1 of this Article shall also apply where a Contracting* *Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares\".*\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimant contends that during the period 2002-2003 Ukraine committed the following violations of the applicable legal norms, in that it:\n\nFailed to encourage and provide favourable conditions for the Claimant\u2019s investments in Ukraine;\n\nExpropriated the Claimant\u2019s propriety rights in Taki spravy and adopted measures having an equivalent effect;\n\nFailed to provide fair and equitable treatment as well as full protection and security;\n\nDenied justice to Taki spravy;\n\nActed in bad faith by deliberately pursuing a campaign of superficially legal-seeming actions motivated by political considerations that aimed to inflict damage to Taki spravy with the eventual goal of destroying this enterprise\u2019s business activities; and\n\nViolated Ukrainian law by failing to protect the Claimant\u2019s business investments, refrain from interfering in Taki spravy\u2019s business activities and failing to compensate for resulting damages.\n\n**H. THE CASE FOR THE STATE OF UKRAINE**\n----------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe factual case for the State is that although much of the Claimant\u2019s narrative is correct, so far as it goes, it does not go far enough, being so incomplete that it leads in entirely the wrong direction. What it omits, so the State maintains, is any account of what was being done by the tax authorities at and around the time in question, otherwise than in the shape of the Claimant\u2019s catalogue of events. According to the State, this information is supplied through written and oral evidence of Mr. Furlet and Mr. Vasyuk, backed by some significant contemporary documents.\n\n88.\n\nWhat the State\u2019s evidence amounts to is this. It is wholly untrue that the tax officials\u2019 activities vis-\u00e0-vis Taki spravy were inspired by instructions from higher authority to make the Claimant\u2019s life uncomfortable in revenge for printing election materials (especially the brochure, \"Unfulfilled Order\"). The tax authorities had no interest in such materials, and indeed Mr. Furlet and his subordinates knew nothing about the brochure until one of them learned about it while on escort duties on the occasion of the visit of 14 February 2002. The State contends that it was not until 26 February 2002 that the brochure appeared in the investigation, and only then because it was furnished as an example of the kind of work done by Taki spravy.\n\n89.\n\nThe true background of the events in question, according to Mr. Furlet, was that from the latter part of the year 2001 the authorities were performing their allotted task of uncovering and rooting-out fiscal crimes effected through the medium of fictitious enterprises, with particular regard to a business named \"Sound\", and the related Case No 75-00029. This led to the discovery that the persons concerned had acquired Produkt BVO, of which Mr. V O Brodetsky (initials \"BVO\") was named in the registration documents as founder and manager. In the course of an interview with him on 14 February 2002 (the date of the first visit by the tax authorities to Taki spravy) Mr. Brodetsky claimed that he had formed the company at the request of an acquaintance, and soon after transferred the enterprise to the latter, and had never had anything to do with its activities. It transpired that during November 2001 a bank account had been opened in the name of Produkt BVO with the Bank \"Kyivska Rus\". In order to follow up the information given by Mr. Brodetsky the investigators had seized materials and data from this Bank. These purported to show that the management of the enterprise and the right to use the account had been conferred on one S.S. Chemer, a person identified by the number of his passport - although Mr. Brodetsky had not (he said) appointed him.\n\n90.\n\nAnother item of information obtained from the Bank was that during the short lifetime of Produkt BVO\u2019s bank account, funds were credited to it from only two sources, Rembudproekt and another company (\"Teslo\"), and that funds had been transferred out to Taki spravy.\n\n91.\n\nThe State contends that, on this basis, the officials decided on 14 February 2002 that there were sufficient signs of fictitiousness to justify the extension of the enquiry to Rembudproekt, Teslo and Taki spravy, and accordingly signed notices to all three companies to produce documents relating to their dealings with Produkt BVO. Because of the late hour these were not sent until the following day, too late apparently to reach Taki spravy before two less senior officials arrived there to call for, and ultimately obtain, a few documents corresponding with the demand.\n\n92.\n\nFurther investigations in the course of the next few days revealed that Rembudproekt had received substantial funds from Taki spravy, ostensibly for printing services, and that funds had also flowed from Rembudproekt (as Mr. Furlet\u2019s statement expressed it) \"returned through Produkt BVO to Taki spravy with the same purpose for printing services\". Meanwhile, Mr. Chemer had been seeking to replace his passport, which he claimed to have lost, or had stolen from him, some time previously when he was working as a shop assistant. The tax officials now called him in for an interview and showed him the passport (or perhaps a copy of it) which had been used to open the bank account. According to a signed record of the interview he recognised the passport as the one which he had lost, except that his original photograph had been covered-up with that of someone else, whom he did not know.\n\n93.\n\nThe State argues that it was in these circumstances, and for these reasons, that the tax authorities decided that there were signs of involvement with fictitious enterprises in the shape of Rembudproekt and Produkt BVO which justified the extension of the enquiry to Taki spravy, and the prosecution of Mr. Romanov, whom the tax authorities believed for good reason was the original owner and operator. The State argues that this decision was one of the outcomes of a long-running investigation which had begun before the election materials were published and was to continue until well after they had ceased to be of any practical interest. The impetus for the activities of the authorities was an honest perception based on reasonable grounds that there were matters which called for tenacious investigation, and this was their own perception not a cynical cover for spite.\n\n94.\n\nAs previously noted, the police and prosecuting authorities sought to eradicate and punish the kind of economic crimes which were doing so much damage to Ukraine at the time in question. The activities of the State authorities went no further than was justified, but in any event the remedy for the Claimants was to invoke the internal constitutional safeguards and remedies furnished by Ukrainian law. Complaints of the kind advanced in this arbitration are not concerned with investment protection and were never intended to be judged by the international norms, and rectified by the international remedies, of the ICSID/BIT system.\n\n95.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Respondent did not rest content with this outright denial but sought to fall back on an alternative case, which addressed individual complaints or groups of them, by reference to the language of the Treaty. This in turn led to rebuttals by the Claimant, and ultimately to extensive written and oral evidence, examined meticulously in hundreds of pages of submissions. The outcome was complex and demanding set of issues. In its lengthy deliberations, the Tribunal has given all of these the closest attention, but takes this early opportunity to emphasise the importance of not allowing the central issue, of whether the Claimant has proved a breach of the Treaty by reason of the existence of a long-running, concerted and malicious campaign to punish Taki spravy for its association with the political opposition, to be swamped by a flood of detail. It has considered all of the multifarious arguments addressed, but will concentrate attention on those which it believes to be the most germane.\n\n**I. JURISDICTION**\n-------------------\n\n96.\n\nIt will be recalled that among the rulings made by the previous tribunal in the Decision on Jurisdiction was that \"...the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal\". It could have been thought that this would leave only the merits of the dispute to be considered at the present stage, but events have proved otherwise. The State has returned to the Tribunal with several objections to its jurisdiction. One of these was raised at the earlier stage, and rejected by the previous Tribunal. Two could have been raised on that occasion, but were not. The remainder are entirely new.\n\n*1 Investment: Local Requirements*\n----------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe State relies on the requirement under Article 25 of the Convention that the dispute shall arise \"directly out of an investment\", and contends that the tangible assets of the two Taki spravy companies did not comply because the foreign investment notices corresponding to them were incomplete or insufficiently detailed.113 The present Tribunal takes the same view of this argument as its predecessor. Certainly, if the assets had been touched in some way by illegality, or if their utilisation had been actively prohibited, the position might well have been different: *vide* the words\u2014\"...in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter...\" in Article 1 (1) of the Investment Treaty. But there was nothing of the sort here, and if the assets were in reality investments within the meaning of the Investment Treaty a failure to observe the bureaucratic formalities of the domestic law could not have caused their character to change.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Additional Objections to Jurisdiction at paragraphs 17-18.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it could have dealt with the contention simply recording that by virtue of the treatment of the same point in the Decision on Jurisdiction the principles of *res judicata* and issue estoppel excluded any right to raise it again, but in the circumstances it has been thought right to reconsider the question, with the same result as before.\n\n*2 Pre-existing Assets*\n-----------------------\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal has had difficulty in understanding the next objection, advanced in Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief at paragraphs 11-19, but it seems to amount to this: There is a crucial difference between an asset which the national of the investing state already owns within the territory of the host state and the act of moving the asset into that territory. If this is what Ukraine is really saying it seems to pay no regard to the policy of the Investment Treaty read as a whole or to its structure which clearly distinguishes between the two different meanings of the word in the English language (which is the language version to which the present proceedings have been directed), namely to denote (a) a particular species of asset and (b) the act of moving it into the territory of a particular state; and then, having made the distinction, goes on clearly to apply its relevant provisions to both.\n\n100.\n\nWe should add that there may be another possible aspect of this argument. Perhaps Ukraine is contending that after-acquired property cannot be an investment: i.e. that even if an asset is already an investment, money spent to modify, maintain or improve it is not. If this is indeed the argument, the Tribunal has no hesitation in rejecting it, for it has no foundation in logic, and runs entirely counter to the general policy of the Investment Treaty. Very clear words would be required to impose this limitation on the effect of the Treaty, and there are none.\n\n*3 The Order of Events*\n-----------------------\n\n101.\n\nNext, there are two objections dependent on the fact that the first Request for Arbitration was made whilst the series of events in respect of which the claim is made had not yet come to an end: and indeed would not do so for three years and more.\n\n102.\n\nThe first objection turns on the six-month period prescribed by Article 8 of the Treaty for negotiations before a dispute could be referred to arbitration. This entails that when independent claims arising from independent events are referred to arbitration only those events which happened more than six months before the reference can be taken into account. For there cannot be negotiations without an existing dispute, and there cannot be a disputed claim without an existing claim; and there cannot be an existing claim without a current ground for claiming. Thus, so it is said, since arbitration was not invoked until 14 August 2002 only those events happening before 14 February 2002 could be relevant, and there are none.\n\n103.\n\nThere is a problem with this contention which might, if things had been different, have required the Tribunal to solve. Namely, whether the logic of the argument applies when the complaints relate to a single continuing course of conduct which began during the six months\u2019 moratorium, but were still in progress on and after the arbitration was invoked. In the event, however, no solution is required here, for 14 August 2002 is the wrong date from which to count back six months. The Request for Arbitration was then withdrawn, and was not put right until the second Request was filed on 22 November 2002, by which time the objection was academic.\n\n104.\n\nThe second argument on the order of events is more substantial, and raises an issue of consent. The theory of ICSID investor/state dispute resolution as a consensual process without privity is well-established, and need not be expounded at length here. Essentially, the concept is of three, progressively-narrowing fields of consent: the general consent, as between states, embodied in the Convention; the more specific consent between two or more states, created by individual investment treaties, limited to particular kinds of disputes arising from particular kinds of investor/state obligations; and the consent to refer individual disputes to arbitration, created by the choice of the investor to avail itself of the state\u2019s consent as manifested in the Convention and the investment treaty. The reference to arbitration expresses the investor\u2019s choice, and binds the investor and the state irrevocably to the resolution of the specified disputes by the ICSID dispute-resolution processes. But only those and not others, even if a wider reference would have been permitted by the investment treaty.\n\n105.\n\nInvoking this well-established principle, Ukraine relies both on the Letter of Consent and on the Request for Arbitration. The former referred to acts by state bodies \"committed in 2002\", and the latter (which incorporated by reference the Letter of Consent) alleged that a series of investigations had begun in February 2002 (paragraph 3), and that in the year 2002 Ukraine had committed a series of wrongful acts (paragraph 12). Nothing could be clearer, so the State maintains. If the Claimant had intended to place before the Tribunal the whole of the episodes which might later ensue, nothing would have been simpler to say so, by using well-known expressions such as \"...and continuing\".\n\n106.\n\nThe Tribunal pauses to note that interesting as this argument (familiar in the context of party/party arbitration) may be from a theoretical point of view it is of little practical importance here. A glance at Annex B will show that even the proportion of events occurring after 31 December 2002 was small, and surely too small to have any significant impact on the outcome of the dispute. Nevertheless, the point is there and must be addressed, albeit briefly.\n\n107.\n\nTwo situations must be distinguished. First, if the claim had asserted a number of individual, discrete breaches of duty, each of them generating a separate cause of action, then it would seem that in principle an objection on the grounds suggested would be well-founded, for arbitration could not be invoked in respect of a claim until it had occurred and had become the subject of a dispute. On the other hand a *continuing* wrong generating a continuing cause of action would have been in existence, though not yet fully developed, at any stage of the continuum of episodes (see, by way of analogy, Article 15 of the ILC Report on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts). Often, it is hard to know whether a cause of action is continuous or not, but in the present case the parties have provided a solution by the way they have shaped their propositions. As already shown, the Claimant\u2019s idea that the episodes were all part of a series lies at the heart of their case. So also for the State, whose response does not depend for its validity in principle on the establishment of a series but whose explanation of what happened necessarily rests in fact on the proposition that there was throughout an ongoing, though expanding, single investigation of linked financial misdeeds. Thus, in their different ways, the parties are at one in treating the consecutive events as a unity which can be treated as the subject of a dispute, and hence as a ground for invoking arbitration, even though it has not yet been fully consummated.\n\n108.\n\nThis conclusion accords with common sense and with the wording of the claim. Whilst the subjective intention of the party claiming arbitration cannot be relevant to the scope of the reference, for the circle of consent under the ICSID/BIT system is both closed and defined *for both parties* by the terms in which the claimant chooses to invoke the jurisdiction, a correct understanding of those terms must have regard to what the common sense of a particular intention would or would seem to have been. Here it is unlikely, whatever the words might seem to say, that the Claimant can have intended, and or could have been thought by those in charge on the side of the State to intend, that the enquiry should be terminated as at 31 December 2002, leaving the Claimant to begin, and the State to defend, a separate arbitration in respect of later events. On the contrary, since the cause of the dispute began in the year 2002, and was still in progress in that year when the Consent was given and the Request was made, the Tribunal considers it reasonable to understand the reference to the year 2002 as a means of identifying the continuing dispute, and not as a means of cutting short the dispute at the end of the year.\n\n*4 The Transfer of Assets*\n--------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the last, and altogether most formidable, objection. This was not discussed in the Decision on Jurisdiction, and could not have been, since the relevant facts had not yet come into the open. It is now known that on 6 April 2002 Taki spravy transferred to TSII a substantial part of its assets, and indeed (the oral evidence would suggest) would have transferred them all but for inhibitions created by certain covenants as to retention of ownership. The Claimant has not given any explanation of this which the Tribunal has been able to understand, or why it took place when it did. The fact that TSII had been incorporated some months previously, but had not so far performed any functions, suggests an element of pre-planning, but pre-planning for what is a matter of speculation. Still less has the Claimant given any explanation of why this potentially crucial fact was not disclosed when, two years later, the question of jurisdiction was before the previous Tribunal in the context of a claim for damages in which the status of the assets in the hands of TSII would obviously play a part. There was an early opportunity to do so, when the Letter of Consent and the first Request for Arbitration were submitted to the Centre. Instead, the Letter of Consent referred to ICSID jurisdiction over \"the legal dispute which concerns a series of unfounded, illegitimate and unlawful acts by State bodies of Ukraine committed in 2002 against the Lithuanian subsidiary private enterprise \u2018Taki spravy\u2019, which is the repository of investments made in Ukraine by the CISC \u2018Tokios Tokeles\u2019\": thus actively misleading the Centre and ultimately the Tribunal as first constituted. This is unacceptable conduct. For the moment, since the facts are now known, attention must be concentrated on how the transfer affects our jurisdiction over the claim.\n\n110.\n\nFor this purpose, we must distinguish between two elements of the claim as originally presented. The first was a claim by Tokios Tokeles as a claimant investor, through the medium of its local investment vehicle Taki spravy. The second was by Taki spravy in its own right as owner of the tangible and intangible assets of its business. As already stated, the latter was withdrawn as a party to the arbitration, so this second feature has disappeared, taking with it a number of issues arising from the fact that for much of the relevant period only some of the original assets belonged to Taki spravy. Although, in deference to the arguments addressed, the Tribunal has studied these questions, there would be no point in exploring them here, since a solution is not necessary to the resolution of the dispute. There are two linked reasons for this. The first is that once Taki spravy had transferred most of its assets to TSII their ownership was no longer of central importance. Thereafter, attention was focussed on the Claimant and the effect on its assets of any wrongs done to its subsidiary. Secondly, when we come to see what the injured or expropriated investment is said to have been, these questions may be recognised as immaterial. Reading once again the voluminous documents in which the Claimant sets out its case it can be seen that the heart of its complaint is that the State attacked the business of Taki spravy as a going concern, and thereby caused damage to the investor Tokios Tokeles, which had put money into that business; and that the attack took the shape of interfering with its operations, depreciating its goodwill, and putting unacceptable pressures on the company.\n\n111.\n\nThere is no word of complaint, and on the facts presented to us there could not have been, of any direct interference with the physical assets of the business. No destruction of machinery; no seizure of materials; no exclusion of staff from offices; no arrest of ships; and so on. The pressures on the printing enterprises are presented as personal, psychological and economic, not physical. This being so, the transfer of tangible assets from one subsidiary of Tokios Tokeles to another does not affect the findings in the Decision on Jurisdiction. At paragraphs 87 *et seq.* the Tribunal (as then constituted) dealt as follows with one of the State\u2019s objections to jurisdiction:\n\n\"Third objection: The Dispute does Not Arise from the Investment.\n\n87. In order for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction over a dispute, there must be an adequate nexus between the dispute and the Claimant\u2019s investment in the territory of the Contracting Party.\n\n88. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention extends jurisdiction to any dispute \u2018arising directly out of an investment.\u2019 In order for the directness requirement to be satisfied, the dispute and investment must be \u2018reasonably closely connected.\u2019 As Professor Schreuer notes, \u2018disputes arising from ancillary or peripheral aspects of the investment operation are likely to give rise to the objection that they do not arise directly from the investment... \u2019\n\n89. Article 8 of the Ukraine-Lithuania BIT, in turn, provides that an investor in one Contracting Party may submit to arbitration a dispute \u2018in connection with\u2019 an investment in the territory of the other contracting Party. It may be held that the scope of the arbitrable disputes under the Treaty is broader than that contemplated by Article 25(1) of the Convention which refers to any \u2018dispute arising directly out of an investment.\u2019 Even if based only on the language of the Convention, however, the Respondent\u2019s contention is in any case bound to fail.\n\n90. The Respondent argues that the present dispute does not \u2018arise directly out of an investment\u2019 because the allegedly wrongful acts by Ukrainian governmental authorities (including unwarranted and unreasonable investigations of the Claimant\u2019s business, unfounded judicial actions to invalidate the Claimant\u2019s contracts, and false, public accusations of illegal conduct by the Claimant) were not directed against the physical assets of the Claimant, *i.e.,* its facilities and equipment.\n\n91. In this regard, the Respondent misapprehends the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25. For a dispute to arise directly out of an investment, the allegedly wrongful conduct of the government need not be directed against the physical property of the investor. The requirement of directness is met if the dispute arises from the investment itself or the operations of its investment, as in the present case. The scope of this requirement was addressed by the first ICSID tribunal, *Holiday Inns S.A. v. Morocco,* which found jurisdiction over loan contracts that were separate but related to the investment agreement, emphasizing \u2019the general unity of an investment operation.\u2019\n\n92. Thus, the Respondent\u2019s obligations with respect to \u2018investment\u2019 relate not only to the physical property of Lithuanian investors but also to the business operations associated with that physical property. State\u2019s obligations with respect to \u2018property\u2019 and \u2018the use of property\u2019 are well established in international law. For example, the *Draft Convention on the International Responsibility of States for Injuries to Aliens,* defines a \u2018taking of property\u2019 to include \u2018not only an outright taking of property but also any such unreasonable interference with the use, enjoyment or disposal of property as to justify an inference that the owner thereof will not be able to use, enjoy or dispose of the property within a reasonable period of time after the inception of such interference.\u2019 Further, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal found that \u2018 [a] deprivation or taking of property may occur under international law through interference by a state in the use of that property or with the enjoyment of its benefits\u2019\".\n\n112.\n\nIn the opinion of the Tribunal this pronouncement makes it a matter of issue estoppel, quite apart from its own independent conclusion, that damage to a physical asset does not form an essential ingredient of a claim under this Investment. This being so, it is hard to see why, when all the assets taken together comprise the totality of the Claimant\u2019s interests in the home State, it should make any difference precisely where the ownership of them is located: for it is the business of the Claimant which suffered the adverse consequences of whatever wrongs the State may have committed. For this reason we reject this objection, in common with the others, and will now proceed to consider the merits of the dispute.\n\n**J. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S FINDINGS**\n------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nHaving set forth the arguments of the parties, we return to the central question of this dispute: why did the tax authorities take these actions against Taki spravy? Did the authorities initiate and carry out these actions to punish Taki spravy for producing campaign materials for political opponents of the government, as Claimant alleges? Or did the authorities\u2019 investigation of fictitious enterprises with which Taki spravy had business relations naturally and justifiably lead them to investigate Taki spravy, as Respondent maintains?\n\n114.\n\nThere is evidence in the record that supports the argument of each Party. For Claimant, the timing of the State\u2019s actions against Taki spravy, which began just days after the company delivered campaign materials to BYT, is consistent with political motive. In addition, the tax authorities\u2019 public allegations that Taki spravy was suspected of crimes that those authorities had already decided not to pursue, or were not empowered to pursue, cast doubt on the legitimacy of the investigation. Further, the magnitude, character, and duration of the State\u2019s investigation, as well as, in certain respects, its manifest lack of factual or legal foundation, are also consistent with Claimant\u2019s argument. Finally, even allowing for differences among national criminal justice systems, it is difficult to reconcile the criminal proceeding against O. Danylov, which the State has opened and closed a total of five times, with general principles of due process.\n\n115.\n\nOn the other hand, there is evidence in the record that supports the State\u2019s position. That evidence indicates that the actions against Taki spravy were the result of an investigation of companies with which Taki spravy did business that began before Taki spravy produced materials for BYT. That evidence further indicates that these companies showed signs of being sham enterprises and that their dealings with Taki spravy was what led the tax authorities to investigate Taki spravy.\n\n116.\n\nWith this evidence in mind, we turn now to assess Claimant\u2019s allegations that the actions of the State constituted an expropriation of Claimant\u2019s investment and denied Claimant fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\n\n**K. EXPROPRIATION**\n--------------------\n\n117.\n\nAmong the causes of action relied upon by the Claimant on the basis of the Treaty is the prohibition against expropriation and the concurrent obligation to compensate for expropriation under Article 5 of the Treaty. In its ordinary usage this term often denotes the taking of property by the state for the use of the state, and overlaps to a considerable degree the concept of \"nationalisation\", but in the context of investor/state dispute resolution it has been given a considerably wider meaning, by a solid line of jurisprudence: although whether it would have been wide enough to cover a claim such as the present may perhaps be debatable. This possibility need not, however, be explored for the Claimant also relies on the words \"measures having effect equivalent to... expropriation\", which are interpreted in the jurisprudence (as are the words \"tantamount to expropriation\") more widely still. In particular, the concept has emerged of\" *creeping expropriation\"* (an issue dealt with in particular by the Iran-United states Claims Tribunal) or *\"measures having effect equivalent to expropriation\"* or *\"indirect expropriation\"* (UNCTAD Paper on the \"Taking of Property\", 2000, p.4; OECD Working Paper on \"Indirect Expropriation and the Right to Regulate in International Investment Law\", September 2004).\n\n118.\n\nSince the cases are familiar there is no need to rehearse them at length but a resum\u00e9 may be useful as an illustration of the problems which face the Tribunal. The jurisprudence, including under the ICSID Convention, confirms that, differently from expropriation, *\"measures having effect equivalent to expropriation\"* are all those measures the effect of which is to deprive the investor of the control, benefit and economic use of its investment. An ICSID award to which also the Claimant has made reference, *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ARB/19/6), has clearly stated that:\n\n\"When measures are taken by a State the effect of which is to deprive the investor of the use and benefit of his investment even though he may retain nominal ownership of the respective rights being the investment, the measures are often referred to as a \u2018creeping\u2019 or \u2018indirect\u2019 expropriation or, as in the BIT, as measures \u2018the effect of which is tantamount to expropriation\u2019\".114\n\n*Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ARB/19/6), Award of 12 April 2002, at paragraph 108.\n\n119.\n\nIn that case, the measure consisted in the *de facto* revocation of an import licence by the Egyptian authorities, the effect of which was to deprive the foreign investor of the right and ability to import into the country and sell there cement of a certain type. The license qualifying as an \"investment\" under the relevant BIT, it was held that the investor had been deprived by such measures of part of the value of its investment. Similarly, in the UNCITRAL case *CME (Netherlands)* v. *Czech Republic* based on a BIT, the Partial Award of 13 September 2001 found that an expropriation had occurred because the actions and omissions of the national Media Council had *\"caused the destruction of the* [joint venture] *operations, leaving the* [joint venture] *as a company with assets but without business\"* (paragraph 591). Other cases in the context of NAFTA have followed the same line of thinking. Thus, in the *Metalclad Corporation* v. *United Mexican States* the Tribunal has stated:\n\n\"expropriation under NAFTA includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property, such as outright seizure of formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use of reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State\".115\n\n*Metalclad v. United Mexican States,* ICSID (Additional Facility) Case No. ARB/AF/97/1, Award of August 30, 2000, at paragraph 103.\n\n120.\n\nA critical factor in the analysis of an expropriation claim is the extent of harm caused by the government\u2019s actions. For any expropriation - direct or indirect - to occur, the state must deprive the investor of a \"substantial\" part of the value of the investment.116 Although neither the relevant treaty text nor existing jurisprudence have clarified the precise degree of deprivation that will qualify as \"substantial\", one can reasonably infer that a diminution of 5% of the investment\u2019s value will not be enough for a finding of expropriation, while a diminution of 95% would likely be sufficient. The determination in any particular case of where along that continuum an expropriation has occurred will turn on the particular facts before the tribunal.\n\n*See* *Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Government of Canada,* Interim Award, June 26, 2000, at paragraphs 96, 102; *CMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/08, Award, 12 May 2005, at paragraph 262; *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, at paragraph 155.\n\n121.\n\nMoreover, the burden of demonstrating the impact of the state action indisputably rests on the Claimant. The principle of onus *probandi actori incumbit -* that a claimant bears the burden of proving its claims - is widely recognized in practice before international tribunals. The significance of this burden was stated effectively by the tribunal in *Asian Agricultural Products, Ltd. v. Sri Lanka* (ARB/87/3), which noted that:\n\n[a] Party having the burden of proof must not only bring evidence in support of his allegations, but must also convince the Tribunal of their truth, lest they be disregarded for want, or insufficiency, of proof.117\n\nSee *Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. v. Republic of Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Award, 27 June 1990, 6 ICSID Rev.-FILJ 526, 549 (1991) at paragraph 56 (quoting Bin Cheng, General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals 329-31 (1953)). See also *Tradex Hellas SA. v. Republic of Albania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2, Award, 24 December 1996, 14 ICSID Review 197, 219 (1999) (paragraph 74)\u00a0(\"[It] can be considered as a general principle of international procedure - and probably also of virtually all national civil procedural laws -...that it is the claimant who has the burden of proof for the conditions required in the applicable substantive rules of law to establish the claim\".).\n\n122.\n\nIn this case, the Claimant has simply failed to satisfy this burden. For example, the Claimant has not shown that the government agencies\u2019 various press announcements damaged its reputation or customer relationships to the point that it was unable to obtain any new orders. Similarly, the Claimant has not shown that the various police raids and investigations launched against it by Ukrainian authorities have significantly impaired its ability to operate. Further, the Claimant specifically acknowledged that TSII, to which Taki spravy transferred the bulk of its assets, was not harmed by the government\u2019s actions. It is conceivable that such continuous hostile treatment as that alleged by the Claimant could in some cases deprive an investor of a substantial portion of the value of his or her business. But the record before us supports no such finding. Without more extensive proof of harm from the Claimant, we must reject the claim of expropriation under Article 5 of the Treaty.\n\n**L. PROOF OF A BREACH**\n------------------------\n\n*1. Introduction*\n-----------------\n\n*1.1 Proof*\n-----------\n\n123.\n\nA breach of Article 5 of the Treaty being thus rejected there remain claims under Articles 2 and 3 for denial of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. A sharp doctrinal controversy on the standards of protection demanded by these and similar expressions in investment treaties has created two divergent streams of authority, too well-known to require citation here. We do not enter into it now, since in our opinion it does not affect the outcome of the present dispute. For if it is decided that the Claimant has succeeded in proving a deliberate campaign to punish Taki spravy for its impertinence in printing materials opposed to the regime, or to expose Taki spravy as an example to others who might be tempted to do the same, this must surely be the clearest infringement one could find of the provisions and aims of the Treaty, whatever precise standards those provisions might set. Conversely, if proof is absent, so that there remain only a number of disconnected incidents that were not politically motivated, the case for the Claimant, formulated as it has been throughout exclusively in terms of a nayizd, must fall away. This being so, we shall abstain from offering a view on the meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment\", \"full protection and security\" and the associated expressions, and will concentrate on the question whether Claimant has established, according to the appropriate standard of proof, that a nayizd can properly be inferred from facts, admitted or proved.\n\n124.\n\nEqually, we shall not propose a solution for the current uncertainty about the standard of proof to be applied in a case such as the present. We emphasise the standard of proof, not the burden of proof, for there can be no doubt that the latter rests on the Claimant. As regards the standard, three possibilities have attracted support. First, the usual standard, which requires the party making an assertion to persuade the decision-maker that it is more likely than not to be true. Second, that where the dispute concerns an allegation against a person or body in high authority the burden may be lower, simply because direct proof is likely to be hard to find. Third, that in such a situation, the standard is higher than the balance of probabilities. As to these, the logic of the second appears questionable, for its consequence is that the person who makes the allegation may be entitled to succeed even if it is less likely than not that the allegation is true. Certainly, any sensible tribunal considering an allegation of this kind will recognise that the need to rely on circumstantial or secondary evidence does not necessarily tell against it, but this does not dispense with the need for evidence of one kind or another sufficient to take the proof over the barrier. As for the third possibility, which at the other extreme requires proof of more than the balance of probabilities where an allegation of gross misconduct is made against a highly placed person, here also there are serious logical problems. It surely cannot be the case that evidentiary requirements can be heightened purely on the grounds of deference or comity or otherwise. And if it is said that this is an example of the common-sense principle that an inherently unlikely allegation requires stronger than usual supporting evidence before it is accepted, contemporary experience shows how unrealistic it can be to assume that important persons will not behave badly. We make no assumptions of this kind, one way or the other, in the present case, and shall approach the issues on the basis that in order to prove its case on the existence and causal relevance of a nayizd the Claimant must show that its assertion is more likely than not to be true.\n\n*1.2 \"Admitted or Proved\"*\n--------------------------\n\n125.\n\nWe have referred to facts \"admitted or proved\" and now move on to an important aspect of this expression which can easily escape notice; namely, that although it has repeatedly been emphasised that there is little controversy about whether the events relied upon to found the inference of a nayizd did in fact happen this is only half of the picture, for there is no agreement at all about the character of the events. The Claimant\u2019s submissions are pervaded by descriptions such as \"wrongful\", \"frivolous\", \"unfounded\", \"without adequate grounds\", \"patently unjust\", \"false\" and so on. The cumulative effect of the events will obviously be infinitely stronger if these descriptions are accurate than if they are not. For a continuous course of *justified* pressure would say little if anything about the existence of a nayizd, or whether the events constituted a breach of the Treaty. Yet there has been no attempt, except in a few of the more important instances, to assess the extent to which the repeated demands made on the Claimant were soundly based; and indeed there hardly could have been, given the very large numbers of events so described. This being so, the most that the Tribunal can do is to take care not to take a broad view of the events as a whole, without taking for granted the Claimant\u2019s characterisations of them.\n\n126.\n\nThis problem is well illustrated by the complaints made against the courts and the Procuratura, which form a substantial proportion of the Claimant\u2019s allegations, particularly in respect of the latter part of the period in question. The common theme of these complaints is that in addition to officials in the various departments of the tax administration and the Electoral Commission the prime movers in the conspiracy had recruited judges and prosecutors to spend time and effort in breach of their professional ethics to join in persecuting Taki spravy for its impertinence in printing opposition publicity. This is not inherently incredible, for contemporary experience shows that betrayals of trust within a judicial system can and do happen; and we do not draw any inference adverse to the Claimant simply from the absence of direct evidence in support of the allegation, for this is just what one would suspect if it were true. But there still must be evidence of some kind in favour of the assertions that the legal proceedings were \"frivolous\", \"patently unjust\" etc..., before it is possible to rely on them when contemplating an inference that they were part of a widespread and long-running campaign motivated by spite and conducted in bad faith. The prosecution, conviction and sentence of Mr. Romanov, left undisturbed after two appeals, provides a conspicuous example. We are not sure whether it is part of the Claimant\u2019s case that Mr. Romanov was innocent, but it is more than once asserted that a statement by him implicating Mr. Danylov was made under duress. This may be true, or it may not. But the Tribunal has no evidence beyond a statement by Mr. Romanov himself which the Tribunal has no means of testing, and his culpability remains unknown.\n\n*1.3 Documents*\n---------------\n\n127.\n\nIn a case which turns on appraisal of events which happened five years ago, and where in the nature of things many of them cannot be illuminated by direct oral evidence, a decisionmaker is bound to lean heavily on contemporary documents. There is no shortage of these here, and the Claimant has made use of some of those created within the tax administration to show that its actions did not conform with the law: see paragraph 131, below. But there are serious problems with others, notably those which purport to record the commercial activities of persons and corporations (whether \"fictitious\" or not) at the time in question: for example, those summarised in paragraphs 89-91 above, in which Mr. Chemer\u2019s name features in one capacity or another. Yet in a record of his interview with the tax investigators he is reported as denying any knowledge at all of Produkt BVO, or participating in commercial activities of any kind. It is a striking feature that the contemporary documents seem to show Taki spravy dealing with Produkt BVO through a non-existent representative, and it is no surprise that the authorities pressed hard for further documentation. The Claimant has never furnished evidence about how these apparently anomalous documents came into existence, but exist they certainly did. So wherever the truth may lie, they form an important part of the picture when deciding on the justification for the authorities\u2019 conduct as part of the general picture.\n\n*2. Individual Items*\n---------------------\n\n*2.1 The Press Statement*\n-------------------------\n\n128.\n\nAlthough we have more than once emphasised the importance of avoiding too much immersion in detail something must be said about the individual episodes to which the Claimant has given particular weight. The most conspicuous is the Press Statement. Different countries have different traditions about the relationship between the media and public authorities, but if a government body is to use the media to circulate accusations of criminal conduct when public legal proceedings have not even started it should make some effort to get the facts right. This the tax authorities manifestly failed to do when they publicly described the activities of Taki spravy as money-laundering, an alleged offence that the authorities had already decided did not warrant further investigation. It is disturbing that in their oral evidence the witnesses for the State made no attempt to explain how this misstatement came to be made, how it came to be recognised as false, and why it was not corrected. The episode casts a shadow over the entire behaviour and standards of the tax authorities. At the same time, we must keep in mind that the present Tribunal is not appointed to perform a disciplinary function, or to conduct a review under the local administrative law. The question is whether the serious flaw in the Press Statement is evidence of conspiracy being put into effect. If the position had been that the publication of the Press Statement was entirely unprompted there might have been grounds for an affirmative answer. In reality, however, this was not the case. The document was a response to criticisms published on the website of the Bloc some days previously. It should have been more accurate, but we find it hard to perceive as part of a pre-planned course of conduct, initiated five weeks earlier, to wear down the Claimant by unsubstantiated allegations.\n\n129.\n\nMoreover, if the authorities did have such a plan in view they adopted a strange way of putting it into effect. Whilst money-laundering and tax evasion are not the same, they are both economic crimes and are often found in association. If the author of the document had really set out to damage Taki spravy by alleging fictional crimes it is hard to see why he or she did not go the full distance and accuse the target of the conspiracy of both offences, rather than pick the one which the authorities never afterwards tried to sustain. Beyond this, we can go no further. We give full weight to the wrongful nature of the accusation, but cannot regard it as anything approaching decisive evidence of a conspiracy.\n\n2.2 *Entry to Premises*\n-----------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe next major complaint relates to the repeated entries of tax personnel into the premises of Taki spravy, of which the episodes of 18 and 20 June 2002 have demanded and received special attention. We recognise that excessive disturbances of privacy are always distressing, and the progressive removal of documents, escalating as it did from a mere handful at the outset to the virtual stripping of the company\u2019s records as time went on, is bound to have had a serious effect on the orderly conduct of its business. Uncomfortable echoes of former times must have added to the disquieting effects. But too much should not be made of this. Taking the incursions of June 2002 as the worst instance, it is striking that the State personnel not only permitted the office staff to make video recordings of what went on, but even to retain them for future use. This was hardly a feature to be expected in a brutal and cynical affront on the rights of citizens. The Tribunal has in the event been able to view the recording, which though amateurish does give an impression of the general level of confrontation. It shows a scene of confusion, with much shouting and mill-around, but no personal violence. The manager was even allowed to telephone the local police force, who arrived and left again without appearing to achieve anything substantial. The militia officers wore protective upper garments and carried side arms, nothing in itself unusual in many countries of the world, but so as far as can be seen no weapons were produced, still less used. Nobody was hurt, and no damage done to the premises. The female members of staff who can be seen waiting for the episode to die down showed few signs of apprehension. All in all, this must have been an unpleasant experience, and not the only one, but in our view its significance should not be overstated - and of course, its significance for present purposes relates not to a claim against the tax authorities for an inordinate use of their investigatory powers, but to an allegation that they were using them as a disguise for an intimidation which had nothing to do with a genuine suspicion of economic misconduct.\n\n2.*3 Failure to Set Out Grounds for Actions*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nReference to the tax officials\u2019 demands for the production of documents leads to a broader topic: namely, their repeated failure, clearly demonstrated by their own internal communications, to set out the information required by law to be set out in requisitions for authority to seize and search and in the formal written authorities themselves. Having little choice, Mr. Furlet accepted that this should not have happened, and attributed the failure to the fact that his department had inherited the forms from a previous administration, and had not had the opportunity to put them right. This is unimpressive, but even if it is evidence of laxity of administration, it is hard to see how it can have caused additional damage to Taki spravy. The question is whether these deficiencies are evidence of a pre-planned campaign. Surely not. Some of the documents in question were internal to the tax services, and cannot in themselves have put Taki spravy under pressure. As to the others, if the tax authorities were willing to lend themselves to a secret, dishonest and oppressive misuse of their power they would surely have taken the trouble to cover their tracks by making their paperwork look right. In our opinion, whilst the deficiencies do not show the authorities in a good light, we must remind ourselves that we are not conducting an administrative audit but are concerned to see whether the course of events justifies the inference of a nayizd. For this purpose, although we take it into account with all the rest of the history, the complaint does not in our opinion carry the Claimant\u2019s case any great distance further.\n\n*2.4 The Electoral Commission*\n------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimant criticises the statement in the Press Statement that the Central Election Commission \"...governed by current legislation authorised the tax service to check information about violation of election legislation during the manufacture of printed production by the Election Block of political parties \u2018the Election block of Yulia Tymoshenko\u2019\". This was another mis-statement, but it is no evidence of wrongdoing, still less of deliberate wrongdoing. The true state of affairs emerges from a handful of contemporary documents produced in evidence. These show that a candidate for an outlying constituency was voicing suspicions about who was financing the BYT\u2019s election materials. The Chairman of the Commission obviously thought it quicker to enquire from the tax services who were already looking into payments associated with these materials, rather than have his own staff spend valuable time on them. The Chairman did not \"authorise\" the tax authorities to do anything that they were not already doing. Perhaps the communication was not technically in order, and certainly the unknown author of the Press Statement should have taken trouble to state the facts accurately, but we cannot accept that this episode caused the least harm, or that it points in any way to the existence of a conspiracy to damage Taki spravy.\n\n*2.5 The Events of 2005*\n------------------------\n\n133.\n\nThe twice-repeated discontinuance and revival of the criminal charges, which, as of December 2005, remain pending, create a poor impression and must have imposed a quite unnecessary strain on Mr. Danylov. More than three years after the event, the tax and prosecuting authorities ought to have made up their minds whether or not to pursue the criminal charges. Whether in truth this was the outcome of a difference of opinion between officials about the sufficiency of the evidence against Mr. Danylov, or whether it was part of an attempt to put pressure on Tokios Tokeles to settle an expensive ICSID arbitration, we are unable to say. The way in which the complaint was introduced into the arbitration coupled with the refusal of the State to respond to questions from the Tribunal118 as to the legal justification of the criminal proceeding much less give access to its files has made it impracticable to explore the matter in any depth. We accept that a manifest and gross failure to comply with the elementary principles of justice in the conduct of criminal proceedings, when directed towards an investor in the operation of his investment, may be a breach, or an element in a breach, of an investment treaty, but we are unable to find that the events of 2005 were part of the alleged conspiracy, or evidence that one ever existed. The most we can say is that they are part of the general picture which must be looked at in its entirety when we come to decide what if any inferences can properly be made.\n\nHearing on the Merits, Transcript, Volume I, at 265:24 to 266:12, 171:20 to 172:1.\n\n*3. The Complaints as a Whole*\n------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nAlthough we have warned against becoming lost in detail we have had no alternative but to treat these complaints individually, because of the special weight attached to them by the Claimant. We recognise however that this does less than justice to the Claimant\u2019s case, for it is the combined effect of all the complaints which is said to make the inference of a nayizd irresistible, and to elevate what might otherwise disparate items of maladministration into a single continuous breach of international law. Surely, the Claimant urges, this massive deployment of the machinery of State must have been aimed at more than the investigation of whether a single company was engaged in a middle-rank tax fraud. We learn from figures produced by the State itself how very many enterprises were being investigated and brought to justice for just such abuse of fictitious vehicles, and there seems no reason why such a striking amount of time and resources should have been devoted to only one of them. It cannot, so it is urged, have been a simple coincidence that the bureaucratic bombardment of Taki spravy began so soon after the lodging of documents hostile to the current regime. And at the end of the story, it must be something more than obstinacy on the part of officials which explains why a criminal prosecution, which bears all the marks of going nowhere, should still so long after the event be repeatedly brought to life. The whole picture is one of abnormal behaviour which cannot be explained except by the type of plan described in the passages quoted at the beginning of this Award (paragraphs 12-13).\n\n135.\n\nWe are fully alive to the strength of this case, but even when viewed in isolation it leaves important matters unexplained. Perhaps most strikingly, it is clear, once the hundreds of allegations are viewed, not as an undifferentiated bulk but in their chronological development, that their profile is not at all what would be expected if the Claimant\u2019s theory is valid. The latter could be expected to produce an immediate and intense burst of hostile activity, dying down quite rapidly once the election had terminated in favour of the existing regime, making pique and deterrence things of the past. But this is the opposite of what happened, as a glance at the Annexes to this Award will show. In fact the intensity of the attack seems to have grown with time, rather than diminishing as past resentments were overtaken by current preoccupations. The likelihoods are also against the nayizd theory. Would the guilty persons in high places have taken the risk of promoting a campaign of injustice against the supporters of their political opponents, when within a very few weeks the outcome of the election might have installed those opponents in the high places themselves? And when Ms Tymoshenko came later to occupy an important position would it not have been natural for her to put a stop to the persecution of those who had performed services on behalf of her electoral campaign? Yet, according to the Claimant, it continued unabated. And why was only Taki spravy made the target, leaving both TSII and the other publishers of the Bloc\u2019s materials unmolested? These are among the unanswered questions.\n\n*4. Conclusions*\n----------------\n\n136.\n\nNotwithstanding these grounds for scepticism, we might have regarded the issues as very finely balanced, if the existence of a nayizd had been the only feasible explanation of what took place. But this is not so. We have already summarized the account given by the State of the investigations which had begun at the end of the year 2001, and which by mid-February 2002 had already uncovered some highly suspicious circumstances, (supra, paragraphs 89 to 91). This account is corroborated by the contemporary documents, which are not alleged to have been fabricated, whatever the truth of their contents. On the basis of them there was every reason for the authorities to begin, and continue to press, an enquiry into the connection of Taki spravy with these dubious events. There is thus an entirely plausible alternative to the hypothesis of a nayizd. It is not for the State to prove that Taki spravy was guilty of economic offences, and the relevance of this material is simply to show that the Claimant is in error in asserting that the events have no credible alternative explanation other than a concerted, malicious and politically inspired campaign. Once this alternative is on the table it is in our opinion impossible to treat the existence of a nayizd as the most plausible explanation of the events which found the Claimant\u2019s case.\n\n137.\n\nUltimately, this long and costly dispute turns on a short question of inference. Having reflected with great care, giving full weight to the contrary opinion of our colleague, each of us has come to the firm conclusion that the case for the Claimant on this decisive issue is not made out, and we therefore join in dismissing all the causes of action asserted under the Treaty.\n\n**M. APPLICABILITY OF UKRAINIAN LAW**\n-------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nIn addition to the Treaty and international law, the Claimant relies on the provisions of Ukrainian legislation.\n\n139.\n\nThe issue of the law applicable to the present dispute has been dealt with by the parties in their written and oral submissions. The Claimant has contended that according to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, the law of the state party to the dispute and the rules of international law are to be applied failing a choice by the parties. The Claimant further cites Article 8 of the Treaty, which provides that an investor may submit \"any dispute\" to ICSID arbitration, whether it is based on an alleged breach of the Treaty, the domestic law of the host state, or other applicable legal norm. The Respondent has replied that only the Treaty and international law are applicable to settle a dispute arising under the Treaty, the provisions of Ukrainian law serving only the purpose of elucidating the factual background of the case and the Claimant\u2019s claims.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the view expressed by the Annulment Committee in *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* that under Article 42(1), second sentence, \"both legal orders... have a role. The law of the host State can indeed be applied in conjunction with international law if this is justified. So too international law can be applied by itself if the appropriate rule is found in this other ambit\".119\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* Decision of February 5, 2002, 41 ILM 933 (2002), at 941.\n\n141.\n\nThe Claimant relies on various provisions of Ukrainian law, specifically:\n\n(1) those protecting foreign investments and investment activity (including provisions to be found in the Constitution), ensuring stable conditions for foreign investments and compensation to investors in case of expropriation or expropriation-like measures;\n\n(2) those prescribing the observance by State\u2019s authorities of procedures, formalities and conditions for the validity of their acts (as in case of searches, seizures of documents or summons of witnesses); and\n\n(3) those providing for items of damage additional to compensation which is due for expropriatory measures (such as moral damages, under Article 23 of the New Civil Code).\n\n142.\n\nRegarding Ukrainian provisions concerning protection of foreign investments, the Claimant itself recognizes the primacy of international agreements over domestic legislation in this field.120\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraph 322\n\n143.\n\nAccordingly, the system of protection, guarantees and remedies provided by Ukrainian law with regard to foreign investments is in effect replaced *ratione materiae* by the substantive provisions of the Treaty and international law, to the extent the latter govern the same subject-matter.\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimant invoked the provisions referred to in paragraph 141(2) above in order to establish that the State\u2019s actions have had expropriatory effects or have resulted in the failure to provide fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security to the Claimant\u2019s investment in Ukraine.121 According to the Claimant, those were the effects of the actions by the Ukraine\u2019s government and it is on this basis that it has claimed compensation in these proceedings. We thus have taken into consideration the provisions in paragraph 141(2) when examining whether the State\u2019s actions breached the Treaty.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits at paragraph 324.\n\n145.\n\nFinally, a majority of the Tribunal having found that no treaty breach was committed by the State, Ukrainian law provisions regarding damages referred to in paragraph 141(3) above are of no avail.\n\n**N. COSTS**\n------------\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal reviewed the entire conduct of the parties in this matter in order to consider whether it should make any special order as to the allocation between them of a) the legal costs and expenses of each party and b) the \"Cost of Proceedings\" referred to in Chapter VI of the Convention, and has determined that it should not. Accordingly, each side must bear its own legal costs and expenses. The costs of the proceedings shall be borne as to one-half by each party.\n\n**O. ORDERS OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n-----------------------------\n\n147.\n\nThe Tribunal orders as follows:-\n\n(1) The objections by the Respondent to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal are dismissed.\n\n(2) The claim of the Claimant for breach of Article 5 of the Treaty is dismissed.\n\n(3) (By a majority). The claims of the Claimant for breach of Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty are dismissed.\n\n(4) (a) Each party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses; and\n\n(b) Each party shall contribute one half of the Costs of Proceedings.\n\n148.\n\nIn conclusion all members of the Tribunal wish to express their earnest thanks to the Staff of the Secretariat for their sustained endeavours throughout these lengthy proceedings."}]}
