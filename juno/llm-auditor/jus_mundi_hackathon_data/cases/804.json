(collectively referred to as \"Claimants\" or \"CGE\"), made with Tucum\u00e1n, a province of Argentina, and with the investment in Tucum\u00e1n resulting from that agreement. The Republic of Argentina (\"Argentine Republic\") was not a party to the Concession Contract or to the negotiations that led to its conclusion.\n\nThe Argentine Republic is a party to a bilateral investment treaty of July 1991 with the Republic of France, the Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of France for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (hereinafter, \"the Argentine-French BIT\" or \"BIT\")1. Both the Argentine Republic and France are also parties to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\"), which entered into force for both states prior to signature of the Concession Contract by CGE and Tucum\u00e1n.2\n\nThe Concession Contract itself makes no reference to either the BIT or ICSID Convention or to the remedies that are available to a French foreign investor in Argentina under these treaties. Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT provide that each of the Contracting Parties shall grant \"fair and equitable treatment according to the principles of international law to investments made by investors of the other Party,\" that investments shall enjoy \"protection and full security in accordance with the principle of fair and equitable treatment,\" and that Contracting Parties shall not adopt expropriatory or nationalizing measures except for a public purpose, without discrimination and upon payment of \"prompt and adequate compensation.\"3 Article 8 of the Argentine-French BIT provides that, if an investment dispute arises between one Contracting Party and an investor from another Contracting Party and that dispute cannot be resolved within six months through amicable consultations, then the investor may submit the dispute either to the national jurisdictions of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute or, at the investor\u2019s option, to arbitration under the ICSID Convention or to an ad hoc tribunal pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.4\n\nArticle 16.4 of the Concession Contract between CGE and Tucum\u00e1n provided for the resolution of contract disputes, concerning both its interpretation and application, to be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n.5 While this case presents many preliminary and other related questions, the core issue before this Tribunal concerns the legal significance that is to be attributed to this forum-selection provision of the Concession Contract in light of the remedial provisions in the BIT and the ICSID Convention. This questions bears both on the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of this Tribunal under the ICSID Convention and on the legal analysis of the merits of the dispute between CGE and the Argentine Republic.\n\nWhen CGE invoked the jurisdiction of ICSID in reliance on the terms of the BIT and the ICSID Convention and sought damages of over U.S. $300 million, the Argentine Republic responded that it had not consented to submission of the dispute for resolution under the ICSID Convention. Because of the close relationship between the jurisdictional issue and the underlying merits of the claims, the Tribunal decided that it would not be able to resolve the jurisdictional question without a full presentation of the factual issues relating to the merits. Accordingly, the Tribunal, after receiving memorials from the parties and hearing oral argument, joined the jurisdictional issue to the merits.\n\nFor the reasons set forth in this Award, the Tribunal holds that it has jurisdiction to hear the claims of CGE against the Argentine Republic for violation of the obligations of the Argentine Republic under the BIT. Neither the forum-selection provision of the Concession Contract nor the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the BIT on which the Argentine Republic relies preclude CGE\u2019s recourse to this Tribunal on the facts presented.\n\nWith respect to the merits, CGE has not alleged that the Republic itself affirmatively interfered with its investment in Tucum\u00e1n. Rather, CGE alleges that the Argentine Republic failed to prevent the Province of Tucum\u00e1n from taking certain action with respect to the Concession Contract that, Claimants allege, consequently infringed their rights under the BIT. CGE also alleges that the Argentine Republic failed to cause the Province to take certain action with respect to the Concession Contract, thereby also infringing Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT. In addition, CGE maintains that international law attributes to the Argentine Republic actions of the Province and its officials and alleges that those actions constitute breaches of the Argentine Republic\u2019s obligations under the BIT.\n\nWhile CGE challenged actions of Tucum\u00e1n in administrative agencies of the Province, CGE concedes that it never sought, pursuant to Article 16.4, to challenge any of Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s actions in the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n as violations of the terms of the Concession Contract. CGE maintains that any such challenge would have constituted a waiver of its rights to recourse to ICSID under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept CGE\u2019s position that claims by CGE in the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n for breach of the terms of the Concession Contract, as Article 16.4 requires, would have constituted a waiver of Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Further, as the Tribunal demonstrates below, the nature of the facts supporting most of the claims presented in this case make it impossible for the Tribunal to distinguish or separate violations of the BIT from breaches of the Concession Contract without first interpreting and applying the detailed provisions of that agreement. By Article 16.4, the parties to the Concession Contract assigned that task expressly and exclusively to the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n. Accordingly, and because the claims in this case arise almost exclusively from alleged acts of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n that relate directly to its performance under the Concession Contract, the Tribunal holds that the Claimants had a duty to pursue their rights with respect to such claims against Tucum\u00e1n in the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n as required by Article 16.4 of their Concession Contract.\n\nCGE presented certain additional claims regarding allegedly sovereign actions of Tucum\u00e1n that Claimants maintained were unrelated to the Concession Contract. CGE asserted that these actions of the Province gave rise to international responsibility attributable to the Argentine Republic under the BIT as interpreted by applicable international law. Furthermore, CGE alleged that the Argentine Republic was also liable for its failures to perform certain obligations under the BIT that Claimants submitted gave rise to international responsibility independent of the performance of Tucum\u00e1n under the Concession Contract. The Tribunal finds that many of these other claims arose, in fact, from actions of the Province relating to the merits of disputes under the Concession Contract and, for that reason, were subject to initial resolution in the contentious administrative tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n under Article 16.4. To the extent such claims are the result of actions of the Argentine Republic or of the Province that are arguably independent of the Concession Contract, the Tribunal holds that the evidence presented in these proceedings did not establish the grounds for finding violation by the Argentine Republic of its legal obligations under the BIT either through its own acts or omission or through attribution to it of acts of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities.\n\nSigned on July 3, 1991, approved Argentine Law No. 24,100, Bolet\u00edn Oficial, July 14, 1992.\n\nOpened for signature on March 18, 1965, entered into force on October 14, 1966, *reprinted in* ICSID Basic Documents, Doe.

The Claimants supplied such information by letter of January 14, 1997. On January 15, 1997, the Centre accordingly transmitted copies of the request and of its accompanying documentation to the Argentine Republic. By letter of January 21, 1997, the Centre transmitted to the Argentine Republic additional documentation received from the Claimants concerning such authorization.\n\n4.\n\nBy letters of January 29 and February 3, 1997, the Centre asked the Claimants to provide specific information concerning certain administrative steps that were mentioned in the request and that were said to have been taken in Argentina by Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. The Claimants responded by letters of February 3 and 14, 1997, respectively, which were transmitted to the Argentine Republic by the Centre. In such letters the Claimants provided an explanation of the meaning of the terms \u201cadministrative recourse\u201d and \u201cadministrative action\u201d used in the request, and of their relationship to the conditions for submitting a dispute to arbitration under the Argentine-French Agreement.\n\n5.\n\nOn February 19, 1997, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the request and, on the same day, notified the parties of the registration, inviting them to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal under the ICSID Convention as soon as possible. In accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, such registration was required because, on the basis of the information contained in the request, as supplemented, the dispute was not manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter of March 3, 1997, the Claimants informed the Centre that the parties had agreed to suspend for 30 days all time limits applicable to the proceeding. By letters of April 8 and May 7, 1997, the Claimants informed the Centre that the parties had agreed to suspend such time limits for a further 20 days, and then a further 60 days, respectively.\n\n7.\n\nBy a letter of September 16, 1997, the Claimants informed the Secretary-General of ICSID that they were choosing the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention regarding the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. On that same date, the Centre accordingly informed the parties that the Arbitral Tribunal was to consist of three members, one appointed by each party and the third arbitrator, who was to be the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties.\n\n8.\n\nOn October 1, 1997, the Claimants appointed as arbitrator Mr. Peter D. Trooboff, a United States national. On October 17, 1997, the Argentine Republic not having named an arbitrator, the Claimants requested the Chairman of ICSID\u2019s Administrative Council to appoint, under Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, the arbitrators not yet appointed. By a letter of that same date, the Centre explained to the parties its normal consultation procedures for making such appointments. The Centre accordingly wrote to the parties on October 20, November 6 and November 14, 1999, in regard to the recommendations that the Secretary-General intended to make to the Chairman of its Administrative Council concerning such appointments. Having received no objection from either party, the Chairman of the Administrative Council designated Judge Francisco Rezek, a national of Brazil, and Judge Thomas Buergenthal, a United States national, as arbitrators in this proceeding, and designated Judge Rezek as the President of the Arbitral Tribunal. The Centre informed the parties of this designation by letter of November 14, 1997.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter to the parties of December 1, 1997, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties that, having received from each arbitrator the acceptance of his appointment, the Arbitral Tribunal (hereinafter \u201cthe Tribunal\u201d) was deemed to have been constituted, and the proceeding to have begun, on that date, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 6. Mr. Alejandro A. Escobar, Senior Counsel, ICSID, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n10.\n\nOn December 11, 1997, the Secretary of the Tribunal first wrote to the parties to inform them of the Tribunal\u2019s wish to hold its first session with them in Paris on January 15, 1998. By letter of January 8, 1998, the Argentine Republic communicated with ICSID for the first time in this proceeding and raised objections to jurisdiction, besides requesting the postponement of the first session of the Tribunal. The Argentine Republic also urged that all sessions of the Tribunal should be held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. After receiving the Claimants\u2019 views, the Tribunal decided to postpone, exceptionally, its first session, and proposed to hold such session with the parties in Washington, D.C. on February 6, 1998. Under Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal was to hold its first session within 60 days after its constitution, that is, by January 30, 1998, or such other period as the parties may agree. There was no agreement between the parties, however, for holding the session on February 6, 1998.\n\n11.\n\nIn these circumstances, and upon notice to the parties, the Tribunal held its first session by telephone conference call through the Secretariat on January 20, 1998. Among the matters considered at its first session, the Tribunal noted that it had been duly established under the provisions of the ICSID Convention. In addition, the Tribunal determined dates for holding a session with the parties. Copies of the minutes of such session, prepared by the Secretary and approved by the Tribunal, were distributed to the parties together with copies of each of the Tribunal members\u2019 declaration made under Arbitration Rule 6.\n\n12.\n\nOn January 14, 1998, counsel for the Argentine Republic submitted a memorandum to the Secretary-General setting forth the grounds for finding that the dispute was manifestly not within the jurisdiction of the Centre. Copies of that memorandum were distributed to the members of the Tribunal and to the Claimants under cover of the Secretariat\u2019s letter of January 15, 1998. On January 23, 1998, counsel for the Claimants submitted a letter to the Secretary-General setting forth their arguments for finding that the request for arbitration was properly registered and contending that any objection to jurisdiction was for the Tribunal, and not the Secretary-General, to decide.\n\n13.\n\nAt the request of counsel for the Argentine Republic, the Secretary-General of the Centre met at his offices on January 27, 1998, with counsel for the Argentine Republic and with counsel for the Claimants. At that meeting, the Secretary-General informed the parties that he had carefully considered the arguments raised in the Argentine Republic\u2019s memorandum of January 14, 1998, and in the Claimants\u2019 letter of January 23, 1998, before registering the request for arbitration. On that basis, and in view of the provisions of the ICSID Convention, the Secretary-General reiterated to the parties that the request for arbitration was properly registered. The Secretary-General added that the registration of a request for arbitration does not prejudge in any manner the question of whether the dispute is or is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre or otherwise within the competence of the Tribunal established for the case. The foregoing points were confirmed in the Secretary-General\u2019s letter to the parties of January 27, 1998.\n\n14.\n\nOn February 18, 1998, the Tribunal met with the parties at the seat of the Centre to discuss procedural matters not addressed during the Tribunal\u2019s first session, in particular procedural matters concerning the Argentine Republic\u2019s objections to jurisdiction. It was agreed at that session that the parties would file simultaneous observations on the objections of the Argentine Republic to jurisdiction, to be followed by filing simultaneously of further observations and a hearing. The parties also agreed that their memorials would be in English with exhibits presented in their original language, if in English, French or Spanish. The proceedings on the merits were in the interim to remain suspended, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 41(3).\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants were represented in the proceeding by the following counsel:\n\nMr. Luis A. Erize   \nAbeledo Gottheil Abogados   \nAv. E. Madero 1020 - Piso 5 1106 Buenos Aires, Argentina; and\n\nMr. Daniel M. Price  \n Powell, Goldstein, Frazer &amp;amp; Murphy LLP   \nSixth Floor  \n 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.  \n Washington, D.C. 20004.\n\nThe Respondent was represented in the proceeding by the following counsel:  \n   \nThe Hon. Secretary of Public Works  \n Ministry of Economy and of Public Works and Services  \n Yrigoyen 250, Piso 11, Of. 1121  \n (1310) Buenos Aires, Argentina;  \n  \n Mr. Mariano F. Grondona   \nEstudio P\u00e9rez Alati, Grondona,  \n Benites, Amsten &amp;amp; Martinez de Hoz (h)  \n Suipacha 1111, Piso 18  \n (1368) Buenos Aires, Argentina; and\n\nMs. Nancy L. Perkins and Mr. William D. Rogers   \nArnold &amp;amp; Porter   \nThurman Arnold Building 555 12th Street, N.W.  \n Washington, D.C. 20004-1202.\n\n16.\n\nOn April 20, 1998, the parties filed their observations on the Argentine Republic\u2019s objections to jurisdiction. On May 11, 1998, the parties filed their further observations on such objections. On May 26 and 27, 1998, the Tribunal held a hearing at the seat of the Centre to receive the parties\u2019 oral arguments on the issue of jurisdiction.\n\n17.\n\nOn July 2, 1998, the Tribunal issued an order joining the Argentine Republic\u2019s objections to jurisdiction to the consideration of the merits of the dispute. The Tribunal issued on July 23, 1998, an order fixing the schedule for the filing of the parties\u2019 memorials and evidence in the next phase of the proceeding.\n\n18.\n\nOn November 2, 1998, the Claimants filed their memorial on jurisdiction and on the merits with supporting witness affidavits. On February 1, 1999, the Respondent filed its counter-memorial on the merits and jurisdiction with supporting witness affidavits.\n\n19.\n\nOn February 4, 1999, the Tribunal issued an order proposing to the parties three sets of dates for holding a hearing on jurisdiction and on the merits, and a date for holding a pre-hearing session to discuss procedures for the hearing, including those for the presentation of evidence. In addition, the Tribunal requested each party to submit, by April 19, 1999, a pre-hearing memorandum on certain issues identified in the order.\n\n20.\n\nOn April 25, 1999, as agreed, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing session with the parties at the seat of the Centre. On April 27, 1999, the Tribunal issued its fourth order, concerning the presentation of evidence at the hearing and, in particular, the allocation of time for each party to sponsor the written testimony of its witnesses and for the opposing party to cross-examine the witnesses. Based upon the parties\u2019 agreement set forth in their joint pre-hearing memorandum of April 22, 1999, the fourth order of the Tribunal confirmed that, apart from the witness testimony to be presented at the hearing, the evidentiary record was closed; that the parties had reported that they could not provide a stipulation of facts that would meaningfully assist the Tribunal; and that each party was to submit a post-hearing memorial within 30 days from the close of the August 1999 hearing. In addition, the Tribunal in its fourth order permitted the Claimants to present at the hearing the testimony of an expert on water quality even though his affidavit had not been presented with the memorial and reply of Claimants. The Tribunal also determined the time allocation for sponsoring the testimony of this expert and for his cross-examination.\n\n21.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held at the seat of the Centre from August 11 through August 13, 1999. At the hearing, the Tribunal received the testimony of the following witnesses presented by the Claimants: Mr. Francois de Rochambeau, Mr. Christian Lefaix, Mr. Charles-Louis de Maud\u2019Huy, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez and Mr. Oldrich Fischmeister. Also at the hearing, the Tribunal received the testimony of the following witnesses presented by the Respondent: Ms. Mar\u00eda Gilda Pedicone de Vails, Mr. Daniel Esteban Arancibia and Mr. Jorge Rais. Copies of the audio recordings and of the verbatim transcripts made of the hearing were distributed by the Secretariat. The parties subsequently agreed on some adjustments to those transcripts, particularly to the English transcription of testimony given orally in Spanish.\n\n22.\n\nOn August 25, 1999, the Tribunal directed the parties simultaneously to file post-hearing memorials by September 30, 1999. The Tribunal also prepared a list of questions on jurisdiction and liability that it asked each party to address in its post-hearing memorial. At the same time, the Tribunal announced that it would entertain a request by either party to permit the parties simultaneously to submit brief rejoinders to the post-hearing memorials. By a joint letter of September 22, 1999, the parties requested to be permitted to submit such rejoinders by October 12, 1999. The Tribunal granted that permission and the parties\u2019 respective post-hearing memorials and rejoinders thereto were filed on the dates agreed upon.\n\n23.\n\nIn its order of April 27, 1999, the Tribunal decided that the hearing in August 1999 would be devoted only to the issues of jurisdiction and liability, and that it would, if necessary, address questions relating to damages at a later stage of the proceeding. With its holding in this award, under which no further hearing on damages is necessary, the Tribunal hereby determines that the presentation of the case by the parties is completed and declares that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 38, the proceeding is closed.\n\n**C.** ***Facts and Legal Positions of the Parties***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThis case concerns a claim against the Argentine Republic submitted to ICSID by CGE, a French corporation that operates water and sewage systems in France and other countries, and also by CGE\u2019s Argentine affiliate, CAA.6\n\nAt the time of the Concession Contract, CGE held 36 percent of the equity capital of CAA; a Spanish company, Dragados y Construcciones Argentina S.A. (Dycasa), and an Argentine company, Benito Roggio e Hijos S.A. (Roggio), each held 27 percent of the equity capital of CAA. In June 1996, CGE acquired ownership of a total of 68.33 percent of the total equity capital of CAA and acquired beneficial ownership of an additional 16.67 percent of the equity capital of CAA. (Cls. Obs. Jur. at 22-23.) Respondent argued that CAA should not be treated as a French investor because this acquisition occurred after disputes had arisen between CGE and Tucum\u00e1n (Resp. Mem. at App. B, Note relating to CGE\u2019s Acquisition.) CGE responded that the critical date for purposes of determining control under Article 25(2)(b) and under precedent interpreting the ICSID Convention is the date for consent to arbitration and that is the date in late 1996 when CGE submitted the dispute to arbitration. All parties agree that by late 1996 CGE had acquired the Dycasa shares (Cls. Reply at 90-91.) Further, Claimants argue that the French company CGE controlled CAA from the time of the takeover of the Tucum\u00e1n water and sewage concession under the Concession Contract and maintain that it is sufficient for satisfying the test under Article 25(2)(b). For purposes of resolving the issues addressed by this Award, the Tribunal has determined that CGE controlled CAA and that CAA should be considered a French investor from the effective date of the Concession Contract. Accordingly, the Award uses the terms \"CGE\" and \"Claimants\" when referring to CGE and CAA collectively in their capacity as operators of the water and sewage concession.\n\n25.\n\nThe dispute from which the claims in this proceeding arise relates to a Concession Contract that CAA entered into on May 18, 1995 (the \"Concession Contract\"), with the Province of Tucum\u00e1n (\"Tucum\u00e1n\"), one of the 23 provinces of the Argentine Republic. The Concession Contract grew out of a 1993 decision by the government of Tucum\u00e1n to privatize its water and sewage facilities that were being operated by a provincial authority. The signature of the Concession Contract was the culmination of a two-year prequalification and lengthy negotiation process with CGE that the provincial authorities of Tucum\u00e1n conducted with the assistance of its professional advisers. (Cls. Mem. at 15-24.) The record in these proceedings does not indicate that the Argentine Republic played any role with respect to the negotiation and conclusion of the Concession Contract or with respect to anticipated performance by CGE and Tucum\u00e1n of their respective obligations under the Concession Contract.\n\n26.\n\nThe 111-page, single-spaced Concession Contract, consisting of 16 articles plus 25 lengthy appendices, included detailed provisions regarding the service that CGE would provide in operating the water and sewage system of Tucum\u00e1n (Chapter 4), the tariffs that CGE would charge (Chapter 12), and the investments that CGE would make in the system for its improvement and expansion (Chapter 11). The Concession Contract makes no reference to the remedies available to CGE under the BIT, which had entered into force nearly three years before the Concession Contract was signed in May 1995. Nor did the Concession Contract refer to potential remedies under the ICSID Convention which had become effective for the Argentine Republic on the same day (Nov. 18, 1994) that the Tucum\u00e1n Legislature approved the actions of the Pre-Award Commission and the Commission recommended that the concession be awarded to the CGE Consortium. (Cls. Mem. at 22.)\n\n27.\n\nArticle 16.4 of the Concession Contract provides as follows:\n\nFor purposes of interpretation and application of this Contract the parties submit themselves to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Contentious Administrative Tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n.7\n\nThe original reads as follows in Spanish:  \n A los efectos de la interpretaci\u00f3n y aplicaci\u00f3n de este Contrato las partes se someten a la jurisdicci\u00f3n exclusiva de los Tribunales en lo Contencioso Administrativo de la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n.\n\n28.\n\nPursuant to the Concession Contract, CGE assumed responsibility for the operation of the water and sewage system of Tucum\u00e1n on July 22, 1995. It is undisputed that there were serious technical and commercial deficiencies in the structure and operation of the Tucum\u00e1n water and sewer system at the time of the CGE takeover. The principal problems included severe operational difficulties resulting from the inadequate and antiquated infrastructure, deferred maintenance, tariffs that inadequately reflected the cost of operations and the required provision for capital expenditures, and failures in collection from Tucum\u00e1n users, both private and commercial, of a significant part of the tariffs actually imposed.\n\n29.\n\nFrom an early point in the CGE\u2019s performance under the Concession Contract, disputes arose between CGE and the authorities of Tucum\u00e1n. These disputes became the subject of extensive publicity and controversy involving the parties to the Concession Contract and ultimately led to active involvement of the governments of France and Argentina in attempts to resolve the issues that had arisen.\n\n30.\n\nAs for the facts and circumstances giving rise to these disputes, CGE contended that \"from the very beginnings of the Concession, it became apparent that instead of supporting the Concession, various branches of the Provincial Government sought to destroy the Concession.\" (Cls. Prop. Findings at 34.) Claimants maintain that commencing shortly after the takeover of the project in July 1995 and continuing to the end of its concession performance, CGE was subjected to a \"steady stream of decrees, resolutions, laws, and legal opinions which were designed to undermine the operation of the concession and either drive CAA from the Province or force it to renegotiate the Agreement.\" (Cls. Mem. at 106.) Further, these acts of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities were, Claimants submit, part of a \"concerted public attack against CAA and the Concession Agreement by [Tucum\u00e1n] government authorities, which included a series of inflammatory statements and other acts encouraging customers not to pay their bills.\" *(Id.)* Claimants allege that the government of Tucum\u00e1n was generally seeking to interfere with CGE\u2019s performance and exercise of its rights under the Concession Contract.\n\n31.\n\nClaimants further allege that from the inception of the Concession Contract, CGE was \"attacked and vilified\" by officials in all branches of the government of Tucum\u00e1n. (Cls. Prop. Findings at 30-33.) Claimants also allege that such actions continued throughout the effectiveness of the Concession Contract and were intended to and did undermine CGE\u2019s performance of the Concession Contract. Further, Claimants allege that these asserted attacks and this vilification occurred because \"the Concession threatened to disrupt vested economic and political interests in the Province and it represented an opportunity for elements of the Provincial Government to curry favor with the public.\" *(Id.* at 44.)\n\n32.\n\nThe Argentine Republic contests these allegations regarding the substance and reasons for actions of officials of Tucum\u00e1n and submits that the actions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities were the result of alleged deficiencies by CGE in its performance under the Concession Contract. These failures, according to the Argentine Republic, affected the delivery of water and sewage services to the areas of Tucum\u00e1n that were covered by the Concession Contract. The specifics of the disputes concerned such issues under the Concession Contract as the method for measuring water consumption, the level of tariffs to customers, the timing and percentage of any increase in tariffs, the remedy for non-payment of tariffs, the right of CGE to pass-through to customers certain taxes and the quality of the water delivered. Further, the Argentine Republic contends, the actions of the provincial authorities in response to these alleged failures in performance were not directed, encouraged or condoned by the Argentine Republic.\n\n33.\n\nIn the record of these proceedings, the earliest reference to officials of the Argentine Republic taking any action with respect to the Concession Contract between CGE and Tucum\u00e1n occurred in February 1996, when the Argentine government acted through the Ministries of Economy and Interior and the Chief of Cabinet to prevent rescission of the Concession Contract by Tucum\u00e1n (Cls. Mem. at 39.) See also Statement of President Menem in Paris on February 26, 1996, concerning the assistance by the Argentine government \"to find a solution to these problems\" that had arisen between CGE and the Province (Cls. Ex. #26.)\n\n34.\n\nOn March 5, 1996, CGE notified the Argentine Republic of the pending negotiations with Tucum\u00e1n regarding the terms of the Concession Contract and, in particular, of the threat of the Governor of the province to rescind the agreement and his demand for redefinition of the tariff schedule. (Cls. Ex. #27)(letter from CGE and Dycasa to the Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs).) In that letter CGE stated that its purpose was \"keeping... [the Argentine Republic] informed regarding the evolution of the negotiations that are designed to overcome the inconveniences that have arisen regarding the Concession Contract.\" The letter also stated that \"in the event that a satisfactory result is not achieved\" in the negotiations with Tucum\u00e1n, CGE would \"proceed to present the eventual controversy\" under the BIT.8*(Id.)*\n\nThe letter of March 5, 1996, also referred to the bilateral investment treaty between Spain and the Argentine Republic in view of the involvement, as noted above, of a Spanish company in the original CGE Consortium.\n\n35.\n\nOn or about May 2, 1996, several months after negotiations between CGE and Tucum\u00e1n had been under way, the Argentine Republic and Tucum\u00e1n entered into \"an agreement pursuant to which the National Government would provide assistance and expertise for the successful renegotiation of the Concession Agreement.\" (Cls. Prop. Findings at 51 (citing Cl. Ex. #29)). It is undisputed that officials of the Argentine Republic were involved with varying degrees of intensity from these initial initiatives in early 1996 until the turnover in 1998 of the water and sewage concession to an agency of the Argentine Republic. This Argentine governmental involvement concerned the efforts by CGE and Tucum\u00e1n to renegotiate the Concession Contract. It related to a broad range of technical, political and legal aspects of that renegotiation.\n\n36.\n\nIn the end, the Claimants and Tucum\u00e1n did not succeed in concluding a renegotiated Concession Contract that was acceptable to both parties. In particular, lengthy negotiations between CGE and Tucum\u00e1n culminated in a Framework Agreement in 1997 that was rejected by the Tucum\u00e1n legislature. Further, CGE and Tucum\u00e1n negotiated revisions in the Concession Contract that culminated in a text approved by the Governor of Tucum\u00e1n in April 1997. However, before submitting the implementing legislation to the Tucum\u00e1n legislature, the Governor, Claimants argue, altered in significant respects the business terms of the text without consultation with CGE. CGE refused to sign the revised Concession Agreement, as passed by the Tucum\u00e1n legislature. Further negotiations ensued, including further involvement in these exchanges by officials of the Argentine Republic. The parties vigorously disagree over the economic significance of any changes by the Governor or the Tucum\u00e1n legislature to the revisions in the Concession Contract that were negotiated in April 1997. They also dispute whether, by virtue of subsequent negotiations, the Tucum\u00e1n legislature was ready by August 1997, as alleged by Respondent, to approve a revised Concession Contract that would have been acceptable to all concerned parties.\n\n37.\n\nOn August 27, 1997, CGE notified the Provincial Governor of Tucum\u00e1n that CGE was rescinding the Concession Contract pursuant to Section 15.9.5. because of the alleged default of Tucum\u00e1n.\n\n38.\n\nOn September 27, 1997, Tucum\u00e1n rejected the CGE notice of rescission and terminated the Concession Contract, alleging a default in performance by CGE. In addition, relying on Section 15.11 of the Concession Contract, Tucum\u00e1n required CGE to continue providing water and sewage services for a period not to exceed 18 months or until a successor operator could be found. Although CGE strongly contested this Tucum\u00e1n position, it continued for ten months to operate the water and sewage system.\n\n39.\n\nOn October 17, 1998, an agency of the Republic of Argentina assumed responsibility for the operation of the water and sewage system of Tucum\u00e1n. (Cls. Prop. Findings at 89 and 94.)\n\n**D.** ***Jurisdiction***\n-------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimants submit that this Tribunal has jurisdiction on the basis of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 8 of the Argentine-French BIT. The latter provides that in the event that a dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party is not resolved within six months, then the investor may at its discretion seek relief either in the courts of the Contracting State with which the dispute exists or in an international arbitral tribunal established either under the ICSID Convention, if each State Party has adhered to that Convention, or *ad hoc* pursuant to the Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.9\n\nThe ICSID Convention had entered into force for France during 1967; the Argentine Republic became a party to the ICSID Convention after its signature of the BIT, *i.e.,* in November 1994\n\n41.\n\nThe Argentine Republic responds that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because these provisions upon which Claimants rely provide for consent to jurisdiction only if there is a dispute between the Claimants and the Argentine Republic. Respondent argues that the only dispute presented by the Claimants arises under and relates exclusively to a Concession Contract to which the Argentine Republic was not a party. The Argentine Republic also takes the position that, absent its consent and designation of Tucum\u00e1n, paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention preclude Claimants from asserting against the Argentine Republic a claim that is based on actions of Tucum\u00e1n. Finally, Respondent submits that the only claims presented by Claimants relate to rights and obligations of the parties under Concession Contract and that, accordingly, Article 16.4 of the Concession Contract requires that Claimants submit those claims to the contentious administrative tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n. The Argentine Republic denies that its national governmental authorities engaged in any conduct that may serve as the basis for a claim under the BIT. It also denies that, for jurisdictional purposes, the actions of the Province may be attributed to the national government.\n\n42.\n\nClaimants answer that, notwithstanding the terms of Article 16.4 of the Concession Contract, they are not obligated by the BIT to pursue a domestic judicial remedy prior to bringing a treaty claim against the Argentine Republic. Claimants argue that had if they had pursued any domestic legal remedy in the Argentine courts, whether against the Argentine Republic or the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, they would have been held to have made the choice presented under Article 8 of the BIT and now be faced with the argument by the Respondent that Claimants had waived their right to seek arbitration under the ICSID Convention. (The parties referred to such a waiver as taking the \"fork in the road\" under Article 8 of the BIT.)\n\n43.\n\nUnder the terms of the BIT and as the Tribunal emphasized in its order of July 2, 1998, the Argentine Republic is liable to Claimants only if the Argentine government violated a legal duty that is owed to Claimants and that duty was violated by acts or omissions of the Argentine Republic. In these proceedings, Claimants have contended that the Argentine Republic violated its legal duty under Articles 3 (fair and equitable treatment) and 5 (expropriation) of the BIT. In this regard, Claimants make two distinct types of submissions. First, Claimants assert that the actions of the officials of Tucum\u00e1n are legally attributable to the Argentine Republic and serve as the basis for finding that the Argentine government expropriated the rights of Claimants in the Concession Contract and denied \"fair and equitable\" treatment to Claimants. Claimants next assert that on the facts presented the inaction of the Argentine Republic itself constitutes a violation of a legal duty that the Argentine Republic owes to investors under terms of the BIT and international law. In this connection Claimants rely particularly on the failure of Argentine government officials to prevent Tucum\u00e1n officials from taking certain actions and the failure of the Argentine Republic to require Tucum\u00e1n to honor its obligations under the Concession Contract and to enter into and approve a renegotiated Concession Agreement.\n\n44.\n\nThe Argentine Republic submits that as a non-party to the Concession Contract it owed no legal duty to Claimants and that there is no basis in international law to attribute in this case to the Argentine Republic the actions of the provincial authorities of Tucum\u00e1n. Further, the Argentine Republic responds that the scope of its duty to the Claimants is affected not only by the terms of the Concession Contract, including Article 16.4, but also by the provisions of the Argentine Constitution that govern its relationship to the provinces under the Argentine federal system. As a result, the Argentine Republic submits that in this case it owes to CGE only an obligation to exercise good faith or show due diligence in seeking to promote agreement between CGE and the Tucum\u00e1n authorities in order to fulfill its duty to provide the investor with fair and equitable treatment under the BIT and to prevent expropriatory action in violation of the BIT. The Argentine Republic submits that the actions of its officials fully satisfied this legal duty.\n\n45.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that the jurisdiction of ICSID extends to \"any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\" provided that the parties consent to submit their dispute to the Centre. Under Article 8 of the BIT, an investor in the Republic of Argentina is entitled to submit to ICSID a \"dispute relating to investments, within the meaning of this [the BIT] agreement.\" Article 1(1) of the BIT defines \"investments\" to include \"[c]oncessions granted by law or by virtue of an agreement.\" It is not disputed by the Argentine Republic that this definition includes concession agreements of the kind entered with CGE.\n\n46.\n\nThe Argentine Republic contends nevertheless that it is not subject to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. In advancing this proposition, Respondent points to the following three provisions:\n\n\u2022 Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, as referred to by Article 8 of the BIT, which limits the jurisdictional consent of states to investment disputes \"between a contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State;\"\n\n\u2022 Article 25(3) of the ICSID Convention which provides with respect to the jurisdiction of the Centre that \"[c]onsent by a constituent subdivision... of a Contracting Party shall require the approval of that State unless that State notifies the Centre that no such approval is required;\" and\n\n\u2022 Article 16.4 of the Concession Contract which provides for submission of issues of interpretation or application to the exclusive jurisdiction of the contentious administrative tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n.10\n\nSee Appendix 1 for the full text of each of these provisions.\n\n47.\n\nIn reliance on these provisions, the Respondent argues that CGE\u2019s claims may be heard by this Tribunal only upon designation by the Argentine Republic of Tucum\u00e1n under subsection (1) of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and upon grant of the consent by the Argentine Republic called for under subsection (3) of Article 25. The parties agree that the Argentine Republic has not made any such designation or filed any such consent pursuant to these subsections. They disagree regarding the import of the absence of such action. In addition, the Respondent also argues that CGE waived its right to resort to the ICSID Convention to assert those claims that Claimants have raised under the BIT because with respect to such claims CGE accepted the exclusive jurisdiction of the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n under Article 16.4 of the Concession Contract.11\n\nRespondent also contended that Claimants had submitted to the national jurisdictions of Argentina under Article 8 of the BIT by pursuing their *administrative* remedies before the *administrative* authorities of Tucum\u00e1n *(see. e.g..* Res. Rep. Jur. at 7 (\"They referred the matter to the administrative fora *[i.e.,* Tucum\u00e1n administrative agencies] specified in the Contract.... They cannot change course now.... they are committed [under Article 8 of the BIT],... Claimants have promised they would have recourse to the local agencies and tribunals. They had recourse to those local agencies.\") The Argentine Republic abandoned this argument in subsequent phases of the proceedings, presumably because Article 8 of the BIT refers to \"national jurisdictions,\" meaning courts, including contentious administrative tribunals of the type mentioned in Article 16.4, and not administrative agencies. (See, Mem. Resp. at 126-27 (referring only to Tucum\u00e1n tribunals) and Resp. Post-Hrg. Mem. at 30 (Concession Contract \"committed the parties to remit all disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the Concession Agreement to the local administrative *courts* in the first instance.\")(emphasis added).\n\n48.\n\nThe Argentine Republic relies on its federal system under its 1994 Constitution in arguing that the acts of officials of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n cannot be attributed to the federal government and, accordingly, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction for the claims of CGE in this case. (Resp. Obs. Jur. at 7 and Resp. Mem. at 70 and 94.) The Argentine Republic concedes, however, that even though the Concession Contract is between the Province of Tucum\u00e1n and CGE, it could incur liability for actions or failure to act on the part of federal officials in relation to the CGE investment in Tucum\u00e1n. *(See, e.g,* Trans. Jur./Merits at p. 474.) The Argentine Republic thus denies as a matter of international law the attribution of liability for actions of Tucum\u00e1n but at the same time acknowledges that the BIT places independent duties on the Argentine government vis-\u00e1-vis the Concession Contract. Specifically, the Argentine Republic concedes that it could be liable under Articles 3 or 5 of the BIT relating to the treatment to which foreign investors are entitled and the prohibition against expropriatory governmental action. Respondent contends, however, that since it was not a party to the Concession Contract, these obligations are in this case limited to maintaining an open environment for investment, avoiding discrimination, ensuring security and affording a forum for adjudication of disputes. Further, the Argentine Republic takes the position that the facts presented do not support any finding of inaccessibility for investment, discrimination or absence of security and, accordingly, this Tribunal should ask only whether Respondent has engaged in a denial of justice to the investor. The Argentine Republic maintains that since there is no evidence of a denial of justice on its part in this case, nor even an allegation to that effect, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.\n\n49.\n\nUnder international law, and for purposes of jurisdiction of this Tribunal, it is well established that actions of a political subdivision of federal state, such as the Province of Tucum\u00e1n in the federal state of the Argentine Republic, are attributable to the central government.12 It is equally clear that the internal constitutional structure of a country can not alter these obligations.13 Finally, the Special Rapporteur of the International Law Commission, in discussing the proposed Commentary that confirms the attribution of conduct of political subdivisions to the federal State, has referred to the \"established principle\" that a federal state \"cannot rely on the federal or decentralized character of its constitution to limit the scope of its international responsibilities.\"14\n\n*See, e.g.,* Luigi Condorelli, *L 'imputation \u00e1 / '\u00e9tat d'un fait internationalement illicite: solutions classicpies etnouvelles tendances,* 189 Recueil des Cours 66 (1984) (\"sont attribu\u00e9s \u00e1 l\u2019Etat, d\u2019apr\u00e9s le droit international, tous les comportements de tous ceux qui, dans l\u2019ordre interne de l\u2019Etat concem\u00e9, exercent effectivement les prerogatives de la puissance publique\"); *see also* Antonio Brot\u00f3ns et al., *Derecho Internacional* 418 (1997) and Manual Diez de Velasco Vallejo, *La Responsabilidad Internacional,* Instituciones de Derecho Internacional P\u00fablico 688 (IIth ed. 1997) (discussing the consensus regarding the responsibility in international law of the central government for actions of states in a federal state).\n\nMax Sorensen, *Manual of Public International Law* 557 (1968)(referring to the \"obvious principle\" and \"generally accepted principle of international law that a federal state is responsible for the conduct of its political sub-divisions and cannot evade that responsibility by alleging that its constitutional powers of control over them are insufficient for it to enforce compliance with international obligations.\"). *See also* Nguyen Quoc Dinh, *Droit International Public* 752 (eds. Dailler and Pellet, 6th ed. 1999)(referring to the well-established international jurisprudence that \"[1]\u2019\u00c9tat f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ne peut s\u2019abriter derri\u00e8re une constitution qui organise l\u2019autonomie de ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments composants pour d\u00e9gager sa responsiblit\u00e9 internationale\")\n\nFirst Report on State Responsibility 14-15, UNDOC A/CN.4/490 and Add. 5 (1998).\n\n50.\n\nIn this case CGE contends that the Argentine Republic itself violated its obligations under the BIT by virtue of the attribution to that central government of the acts of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n. Claimants\u2019 request for relief is thus not based on a breach of the terms of the Concession Contract. For this reason, the Tribunal finds that its jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention is not, as the Argentine Republic argues, precluded by the requirement of Article 8 of the BIT that the dispute be between the French investor and the Argentine Republic. The Tribunal also concludes that it has jurisdiction over those claims of CGE that are based directly on alleged actions or failures to act of the Argentine Republic itself and that do not rely in any respect upon the principle of attribution.\n\n51.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal cannot accept the position of Respondent that its failure to designate or consent to the application of the ICSID Convention to the Province of Tucum\u00e1n under Article 25 of that treaty deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction to hear the claims of CGE against the Argentine Republic. The designation and consent provisions of paragraphs (1) and (3) of Article 25 stipulate that a subdivision or agency of a Contracting State may, with the permission of that State, submit itself to the jurisdiction of ICSID for purposes of resolving a legal dispute arising out of an investment dispute between that subdivision or agency and a national of another Contracting State. Those optional provisions do not apply to disputes between the Contracting State itself (in this instance the Argentine Republic) and a national of another Contracting State that may be related to an investment contract between a subdivision or agency of that State and the national. In other words, Article 25(3) does not restrict the subject matter jurisdiction of the Tribunal; rather, it creates potential efficiencies in operations of ICSID by establishing, with approval of the central government, the right of such agencies or subdivisions to be parties in their own right to an ICSID proceeding.\n\n52.\n\nThe foregoing reading of Articles 25(1) and (3) is confirmed by the negotiating history of the ICSID Convention. It shows that these provisions were designed to permit the expansion of the scope of ICSID arbitration *ratione personae* to include subdivisions and agencies of a Contracting State. This enlargement of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction occurred without in any respect restricting ICSID jurisdiction **ratione materiae** over claims against a Contracting State arising from actions of such subdivisions or agencies that are alleged to be attributable to the Contracting State. Article 25(1) and (3) responded to the concerns that many states carried out their investment functions through distinct legal entities, including state-owned agencies and subdivisions.15 Article 25 consequently provided a method for giving these entities standing for purposes of ICSID arbitration as long as their Contracting State had given its consent thereto.16 The Tribunal also notes that the Argentine Republic did not notify its intention under Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention to exclude **ratione materiae** claims based generally on actions of political subdivisions, or, more specifically, on actions of political subdivisions in relation to concession contracts. Nor has the Argentine Republic argued in these proceedings that any such express *ratione materiae* restriction appears in its consent to jurisdiction under the BIT or the ICSID Convention.\n\nFor statements of delegations from developing countries to the negotiation of the ICSID Convention pointing out the significant role of their state agencies and other sub-federal institutions in entering into investment agreements and, therefore, the importance to these states in attracting foreign investment of *expanding* the jurisdiction of the Centre to hear disputes involving foreign investor claims against state agencies and political subdivisions, provided that the government of the relevant Contracting Party approved, *see, e.g.,* II History ICSID Convention at 297 and 366; *see also* Christoph Schreuer, \"Commentary on the ICSID Convention,\" 11 ICSID Rev. 318, 380 (Fall 1996)(explaining that the provision \"open[s] the possibility, in principle, that such entities may become parties in ICSID proceedings instead of or in addition to the host State itself;\" and referring to the designation under the parenthetical in Article 25(1) as relating to \"jurisdiction *ratione personae* \" to give \"the entities described *locus standi,* if the Convention\u2019s requirements have been met\" and to Article 25(3) as relating to \"the modalities of consent.\")\n\nThe BIT refers as well to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law which include no provision comparable to Articles 25(1) and (3). Since the two sets of arbitral rules are alternatives under the BIT, there is a strong inference that no limitation of the type asserted by Respondent was intended on the subject matter for arbitration if the ICSID Convention is invoked\n\n53.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal holds that Article 16.4 of the Concession Contract does not divest this Tribunal of jurisdiction to hear this case because that provision did not and could not constitute a waiver by CGE of its rights under Article 8 of the BIT to file the pending claims against the Argentine Republic. On this issue, the parties have presented extensive argument on the potential pertinence of the preliminary decision on jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunal in *Lanco International Inc. v. Argentine Republic.*17 The *Lanco* tribunal addressed the distinct argument that a contract provision by which the parties submitted their disputes to federal contentious administrative tribunals of the City of Buenos Aires constituted a pre-existing agreement that precluded ICSID arbitration under the distinct terms of the bilateral investment agreement at issue in that case. Having rejected that position, the *Lanco* tribunal also upheld the investor\u2019s option to choose ICSID arbitration when the investor could not and did not submit to such tribunals its claims based on the bilateral agreement.18 In this case the claims filed by CGE against Respondent are based on violation by the Argentine Republic of the BIT through acts or omissions of that government and acts of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities that Claimants assert should be attributed to the central government. As formulated, these claims against the Argentine Republic are not subject to the jurisdiction of the contentious administrative tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n, if only because, *ex hypothesi,* those claims are not based on the Concession Contract but allege a cause of action under the BIT.19\n\n*Lanco Int* 7, *Inc.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6)(Prelim. Decision on Jurisdiction)(8 Dec. 1998).\n\n*Id.* at Paras. 28-30. It is true that the forum-selection clause in **Lanco** was agreed to *before* entry into force of the relevant Argentina-U.S. BIT referring to ICSID while Article 16.4 of the CGE Concession Contract with the Province of Tucum\u00e1n was signed three years *after* the Argentine-French BIT entered into force and after the Argentine Republic had become a party to the ICSID Convention. It is also true, that, unlike the Concession Agreement in this case, the forum-selection clause in the **Lanco** investment contract did not use the term \"exclusive\" in referring to the domestic courts of Argentina as did the Concession Agreement in the instant case. Neither of these distinctions alters the key point that for jurisdictional purposes *Lanco.* in addition to resolving the pre-existing agreement issue, also upholds the investor\u2019s option for ICSID arbitration despite the presence of a forum-selection clause in the investor-state contract at issue.\n\n*See. also,* Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 1-3. The Tribunal does not accept the position of Respondent that Tucum\u00e1n courts would have had jurisdiction over a claim against the Argentine Republic based on the BIT because \"an allegation of breach of the BIT by Argentina depends on a prior determination that the Concession Contract was breached by Tucum\u00e1n\" and that CGE did not violate the Contract. (Resp. Post-Hrg. Answers at 4.) It is clear that the Argentine Republic could have engaged in conduct or failed to act in violation of its obligations under the BIT even if Tucum\u00e1n were not in violation of the Concession Contract. Moreover, the suit that the Respondent hypothesizes would not be against the Argentine Republic *ratione personae* because, as the responses of both parties to the Tribunal\u2019s questions indicate, the Tucum\u00e1n courts do not have jurisdiction over such a suit absent consent by Respondent. Nor does the Tribunal agree with Respondent that the choice of the law of Tucum\u00e1n by the parties to the Concession Contract, \"raises a presumption\" against finding ICSID jurisdiction and in favor of deference to the Tucum\u00e1n courts. (Resp. Mem. at 127.) That argument is not apposite when the parties to the Concession Contract and their governments have entered into agreements expressly addressing the jurisdiction of the Tucum\u00e1n courts and ICSID.\n\n54.\n\nThus, Article 16.4 of the Concession Contract cannot be deemed to prevent the investor from proceeding under the ICSID Convention against the Argentine Republic on a claim charging the Argentine Republic with a violation of the Argentine-French BIT.\n\n55.\n\nBy this same analysis, a suit by Claimants against Tucum\u00e1n in the administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n for violation of the terms of the Concession Contract would not have foreclosed Claimant from subsequently seeking a remedy against the Argentine Republic as provided in the BIT and ICSID Convention. That is, submission of claims against Tucum\u00e1n to the contentious administrative tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n for breaches of the contract, as Article 16.4 required, would not, contrary to Claimants\u2019 position, have been the kind of choice by Claimants of legal action in national jurisdictions (z.e., courts) against the Argentine Republic that constitutes the \"fork in the road\" under Article 8 of the BIT, thereby foreclosing future claims under the ICSID Convention.\n\n**E.** ***Merits***\n-------------------\n\n**E.1** ***Overview of the Positions of the Parties***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Argentine Republic was not a party to the Concession Contract, nor did that agreement refer in any respect to the role that the Argentine Republic, which was not a party to its negotiation, might be called upon to play in ensuring performance of the contract by Tucum\u00e1n.\n\n57.\n\nClaimants contend, however, that every action of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, taken in the exercise of sovereign power and not as a party to a contract, is directly attributable to the Argentine Republic. Thus, Claimants submit, if the Province of Tucum\u00e1n exercised governmental authority in abrogating the rights of Claimants under the Concession, then the Argentine Republic is liable to Claimants under the BIT. (Cls. Mem. at 97-101.)\n\n58.\n\nClaimants have not alleged that any action of the Argentine Republic directly or indirectly interfered with their performance of the Concession Contract. Rather, they base their claim against the Argentine government on its failure to have acted and, in particular, its failure to have caused Tucum\u00e1n (i) to refrain from exercising governmental powers that abrogated the rights of Claimants, or (ii) to comply with the terms of the Concession Contract.\n\n59.\n\nClaimants argue that the Argentine Republic is subject to a strict liability standard under the BIT and that any action of the Province that violates the BIT creates liability on the part of Respondent. (Cls. Post-Hrg. Mem. at 20 and Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 28.) Claimants submit that the record is replete with examples of such action.\n\n60.\n\nThe Argentine Republic maintains that the standard of its liability is limited to what the parties and the Tribunal have sometimes termed \"due diligence\" but which may be more appropriately termed \"good offices,\" *i.e.,* a duty to undertake a good faith effort through actions of its federal officials to help resolve the controversy between the Province and Claimants. (Res. Post-Hrg. Mem. at 35-38 and Res. Post-Hrg. Answers at 14.)\n\n61.\n\nClaimants respond that this lesser standard of obligation does not apply to the alleged BIT violations at issue in this case *(i.e.,* expropriation and denial of fair and equitable treatment resulting from actions of officials of a political subdivision of a Contracting Party) (Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 30). Further, Claimants submit that even in the case of other violations, the lesser \"due diligence\" or \"good offices\" standard applies only if the actions of private parties are involved \u2014 not actions of a political subdivision such as a Province. **(Id.** at 29-30.) In any event, Claimants contend that the Argentine Republic violated its obligation under the BIT and applicable international law even under this lesser standard because the Argentine Republic \"failed... to take reasonable measures to solve the conflict and protect or redress damage to Claimants.\" **(Id.** at 48.)\n\n**E.2** ***Analysis of the Relationship of the Alleged Violations of BIT by the Argentine*** ***Republic to Issues of Alleged Non-Performance under the Concession Contract***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nTo resolve these issues in this case, the Tribunal need not determine generally whether bilateral investment treaties with provisions forbidding expropriation in the absence of full compensation and requiring fair and equitable treatment under international law impose a strict liability standard on a central government for actions of a political subdivision. Instead, the Tribunal resolves this case on the basis of the specific allegations on which the Claimants base their claims and their legal significance in light of the terms of the Concession Contract and the BIT.\n\n63.\n\nIn its post-hearing submissions, Claimants, in response to the request by the Tribunal for \"specific acts or omissions\" taken by or attributable to the Argentine Republic under a strict liability standard of attribution, identified four categories of \"acts of the Province attributable to [Respondent] that violated Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT.\" (Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 51-53.) Claimants described these categories as follows: (1) \"Acts that resulted in a fall in the recovery rate;\" (2) \"Acts that unilaterally reduced the tariff rate;\" (3) \"Abuses of regulatory authority;\" and (4) \"Dealings in bad faith.\"\n\n64.\n\nNone of these four categories include any act or omission by officials of the Argentine Republic. Therefore, liability of the Respondent may arise in this case on any of these grounds only through attribution of actions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities to the Argentine Republic. Because these acts are an essential element of the Claimants\u2019 case, the Tribunal will consider each of the acts under their respective categories. The Tribunal will seek to determine not only the basis for establishing liability of the Argentine Republic under the BIT in reliance upon these provincial acts; it will also consider the relationship of these acts to the promised performance of the parties under the Concession Contract.\n\n**E.2.1** ***Acts that Resulted in a Fall in the Recovery Rate under the Concession Contract***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nOf the four alleged acts of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n that Claimants include in this category, two relate directly to actions of the administrative authorities of Tucum\u00e1n \u2014 the Ombudsman of Tucum\u00e1n and the Ente Regulador de los Servicios de Agua y Cloacas de Tucum\u00e1n (\"ERSACT\"). In the case of the Ombudsman, the action identified by Claimants concerned a decision of the Ombudsman in December 1996 that Claimants allege to have deprived CGE of \"their right to cut off service to non-paying customers.\" In the case of ERSACT, which served as the regulatory body supervising the services rendered by CGE, Claimants point to two resolutions, Nos. 170 and 212, that \"forced a reduction in the tariff and thereby created uncertainty as to what invoices had to be paid.\" (Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 52.) Claimants never challenged in the courts of Tucum\u00e1n any of these actions of the administrative agencies of Tucum\u00e1n relating to implementation of the Concession Contract.\n\n66.\n\nThe other two actions that Claimants place in the category of \"Acts that resulted in a fall in the recovery rate,\" are \"public statements made by various branches of the Tucum\u00e1n government to encourage customers not to pay their bills\" and \"modification by the Governor and the Legislature to the second renegotiated agreement that deprived Claimants of their right to cut off the service to non-paying customers.\" (Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 52.) The first of these alleged grounds concerns a highly disputed issue of fact, *i.e.,* whether Tucum\u00e1n authorities organized a campaign for non-payment of invoices issued by Claimants. In any event, this non-payment issue relates to the grounds for non-payment under the Concession Contract and to whether under that agreement termination of service was an authorized remedy for non-payment. *(see, e.g.,* Cls. Reply at 18-21.) The other cited action relates directly to the action of the Ombudsman, as noted in the previous paragraph. Again, all of these issues concerned the rights of Claimants under the Concession Contract and the performance by Tucum\u00e1n of its obligations under that agreement. Claimants failed to challenge any of these acts in the Tucum\u00e1n courts.\n\n**E.2.2** ***Acts that Unilaterally Reduced the Tariff Rate***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nTwo of the acts that Claimants specify as being in this second category of allegedly attributable actions are the same as those under the prior category, *i.e.,* Resolutions 170 and 212 of ERSACT and, as noted, were never challenged in the Tucum\u00e1n courts. The third act also harkens back to the first category and refers also to the fourth category (discussed below) because it concerns the changes by the Tucum\u00e1n legislature in Law 6826 to the tariff schedule in the second renegotiated agreement.\n\n**E.2.3** ***Abuses of Regulatory Authority***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nClaimants categorize under this heading two types of alleged action by Provincial authorities\u2014 (1) actions that encouraged non-payment of bills or reduced the recovery rate, and (2) the intervention of ERSACT by the Governor and subsequent actions of that agency. As to the first, these repeat from another perspective points already reviewed above relating to payment of invoices by water and sewage customers in Tucum\u00e1n and the remedy for their non-payment of invoices. CGE never challenged in the Tucum\u00e1n courts the interpretation that the Tucum\u00e1n agencies gave to the provisions of the Concession Contract bearing on this issue.\n\n69.\n\nAs to the ERSACT intervention, Claimants concede that they sought no \"special provision in the Concession Agreement that would prevent the Governor from overriding the normal appointment process and appoint an Intervenor.\" (Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 84.) Claimants contend, nonetheless, that the intervention of ERSACT in January 1996 was \"not an exercise of legitimate regulatory authority\" but rather was \"politically motivated\" to affect the terms of the Concession Contract. *(Id.* at 85.) Respondent submits that intervention of ERSACT was authorized under established Argentine administrative law principles. (Resp. Post-Hrg. Answers at 93-96.) Claimants never brought any legal challenge in the courts of Tucum\u00e1n of the ERSACT intervention on the ground that such action violated the rights of CGE under the Concession Contract.\n\n**E.2.4** ***Dealings in Bad Faith***\n-------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nFinally, Claimants argue that the Argentine Republic is liable by attribution for the bad faith of Tucum\u00e1n officials as exemplified most clearly by the alleged changes that the Governor of the Province made in the terms of the second renegotiated agreement that was submitted to the Tucum\u00e1n legislature. Three other examples are also given: (i) imposing penalties for failure to conduct water tests even though the laboratory was stripped of equipment at the time of the takeover; (ii) refusing to permit CGE to invoice for municipal and provincial taxes; and (iii) exploiting the manganese so-called \"black water\" problem for public relations purposes even though CGE was not responsible for its occurrence and promptly remedied the circumstances.\n\n71.\n\nPerhaps no issue has been more disputed in this proceeding than the occurrence, significance and consequences of the alleged 70 changes in the second renegotiated agreement. These events took place in period March through August 1997. *(See* Cls. Post-Hrg. Mem. at 62-70 and Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 59 - 67; Resp. Post-Hrg. Answers at Annex I (Chronology) and Annex II (Explanation of Changes).) In summary and with due acknowledgement that the factual complexity of the differences handicaps any effort to simplify the issues, the disagreement relates to whether the Governor would submit to the Tucum\u00e1n Legislature and the Legislature would approve implementing legislation that incorporated the version of the second renegotiated agreement that the Governor and the Claimants had initially agreed upon on or about April 22, 1997. Further, the Claimants, having refused to sign the revised Concession Contract with the disputed changes to the April 22 version, terminated the Concession Contract at the very moment (Aug. 15, 1997) when, according to Respondent, the Tucum\u00e1n legislature and its authorized committee were apparently ready to approve the second renegotiated agreement without the 70 changes.\n\n72.\n\nClaimants argue that the modifications by the Provincial Governor of the April 22 text of the legislation \"signaled the end of any basis of trust and persuaded Claimants that the Provincial Government was determined to destroy the concession and that the Federal Government lacked the determination to redress the wrong.\" (Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 80.) It is these actions of the Governor and the Legislature on which Claimants rely in support of their contention of \"bad faith dealing\" attributable to the Argentine Republic.\n\n73.\n\nIt is essential to recall that this dispute regarding the second renegotiated agreement relates entirely to the *negotiations* of Tucum\u00e1n and Claimants, and not to whether or how either was performing its legal obligations under the Concession Contract. Claimants do not assert that Tucum\u00e1n was legally obligated to modify the Concession Contract. It is also undisputed that the Argentine Republic, fully supported by the Claimants, sought in a variety of ways to bring about agreement of the parties, including the so-called Rottenberg mission and political pressure on certain of the key political parties in Tucum\u00e1n. In these circumstances and on the evidence presented, the Tribunal does not find the basis for holding the Argentine Republic liable for actions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities that may be attributed to Respondent. (See Section E.3, *infra,* regarding the claims based on failure of the Argentine Republic to respond to the alleged bad-faith dealings of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities.)\n\n74.\n\nAs to the three other actions of the Argentine Republic that Claimants identify as supporting their bad-faith allegations, the first relates to water testing. The Argentine Republic submits that the citations by ERSACT against CGE were justified by the facts and permitted under Article 14.8 of the Concession Contract. Specifically, Respondent argues that this provision permitted Tucum\u00e1n authorities to deliver a notice of deficiency and to take punitive action if the deficiency was not cured. Further, the Argentine Republic maintains that the fines for failure to test were never collected. (Res. Post-Hrg. Answers at 102-05.) For their part, Claimants submit that the notices of deficiency specified no deadline, that by December, 1995 CGE had installed the necessary test equipment, that the failures resulted from the seriously inadequate state of the facilities that CGE received at the time of the takeover, and that additional fines imposed upon confirmation of the first fines demonstrate the political motivation of the procedure. Further, Claimants maintain that the political motivation was also shown by statements from officials whose superiors were seeking to pressure CGE to renegotiate its rates. (Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 90-92.) Since none of the fines were ever enforced against Claimants, the Tribunal cannot base a finding of bad faith dealings on this alleged action, particularly when the dispute concerning its justification appears to depend in significant part on an interpretation of the Concession Contract that the parties thereto agreed would be decided by the Tucum\u00e1n courts.\n\n75.\n\nClaimants also assert bad faith dealings by Tucum\u00e1n authorities due to their refusal to permit CGE to invoice for municipal and provincial taxes; and exploiting the manganese or so-called \"black water\" problem for public relations purposes even though CGE was not responsible for its occurrence and promptly remedied the circumstances. In both instances, the parties disagree over the meaning and applicability of the pertinent provisions of the Concession Contract, as well as over the underlying facts. *(See, e.g.,* Cls. Mem. at 12 and 25 n. 80; Resp. Rej. at 91.)\n\n76.\n\nFinally, Claimants allege that CGE was improperly required to continue to provide water and sewage service to Tucum\u00e1n for 18 months pursuant to the holdover provisions of the Concession Contract. (Cls. Mem. at 72 and 116-17.) According to Respondent, Tucum\u00e1n officials were acting in reliance upon Section 15.11 of the Concession Contract. (Resp. Post-Hrg. Answers at 106-10.) Claimants respond that the actions of Tucum\u00e1n \"effectively repudiated the concession and destroyed its value\" and that, therefore, the \"Province was not entitled... as a matter of law or equity\", to invoke this provision of the Concession Agreement. (Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 95.) Further, CGE maintains that during this 10-month holdover period Provincial authorities refused to determine the applicable tariffs and continued to urge customers not to pay their bills for services *(Id.* at 96.)\n\n**E.2.5** ***Relationship of Alleged Acts of Tucum\u00e1n Authorities to Performance under*** ***Concession Contract and Legal Consequences***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nFrom the foregoing, it is apparent that all of the above-mentioned actions of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n on which the Claimants rely for their position attributing liability to the Argentine Republic are closely linked to the performance or non-performance of the parties under the Concession Contract. The Tribunal concludes, accordingly, that all of the issues relevant to the legal basis for these claims against Respondent arose from disputes between Claimants and Tucum\u00e1n concerning their performance and non-performance under the Concession Contract. These included the issues summarized in the preceding sections based on Claimants\u2019 response to the Tribunal, as well as such questions as the reasonableness of the rates and the timing of increases in rates that the Claimants contended were authorized by the Concession Contract, whether individual metering was required or permitted, whether CGE was entitled to charge certain local taxes to its customers in addition to its service tariff, whether CGE was permitted to terminate service to users who failed to pay their water and sewage invoices, whether CGE failed to submit an investment plan, maintain adequate insurance, or submit an emergency plan in a timely manner and, finally, whether CGE was required to continue operating the system for 10 months after it terminated the Concession Contract.\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses, therefore, the relationship between the terms of the Concession Contract, and, in particular, the forum selection provision in Article 16.4, and the alleged international legal responsibility of the Argentine Republic under the BIT with respect to the previously outlined actions of officials and agencies of Tucum\u00e1n. In this regard, the Tribunal holds that, because of the crucial connection in this case between the terms of the Concession Contract and these alleged violations of the BIT, the Argentine Republic cannot be held liable unless and until Claimants have, as Article 16.4 of the Concession Contract requires, asserted their rights in proceedings before the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n and have been denied their rights, either procedurally or substantively.20 Alternatively, as the Tribunal discusses below (Paras. 83-92, *infra),* the Argentine Republic could be held liable if it were shown that it failed to satisfy its obligation to pursue in good faith and with reasonable efforts the resolution of disputes between Tucum\u00e1n and Claimants.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Claimants\u2019 argument that Article 16.4 of the Concession Contract is without effect in this matter because Article 10 of the BIT, which refers to rights under a special agreement between a Contracting Party and an investor, \"supercedes the forum selection clause in the Concession Agreement.\" (Cls. Mem. at 86.) Article 10 protects rights granted to an investor under a special agreement if such rights are more favorable to the investor than those granted under the BIT. The question here is not whether one or the other is more favorable, but whether the Tribunal is in a position, on the facts of this case, to separate the breach of contract issues from violations of the BIT, considering that the parties to the Concession Contract have agreed to an exclusive remedy in the Tucum\u00e1n courts for the determination of the disputed contractual issues which are not governed by the BIT.\n\n79.\n\nHere it is clear that, given the nature of the dispute between Claimants and the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, it is not possible for this Tribunal to determine which actions of the Province were taken in exercise of its sovereign authority and which in the exercise of its rights as a party to the Concession Contract considering, in particular, that much of the evidence presented in this case has involved detailed issues of performance and rates under the Concession Contract. To make such determinations, the Tribunal would have to undertake a detailed interpretation and application of the Concession Contract, a task left by the parties to that contract to the exclusive jurisdiction of the administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n. The contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n were open to Claimants to pursue contract remedies against the Province of Tucum\u00e1n under the Concession Contract. Claimants bargained under Article 16.4 for seeking such remedies in those courts and conferred exclusive jurisdiction upon them for disputes relating to issues arising under the Concession Contract. There is no allegation before the Tribunal that the courts of Tucum\u00e1n were unavailable to hear such claims or that they lacked independence or fairness in adjudicating them.\n\n80.\n\nBecause the Tribunal has determined that on the facts presented Claimants should first have challenged the actions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities in its administrative courts, any claim against the Argentine Republic could arise only if Claimants were denied access to the courts of Tucum\u00e1n to pursue their remedy under Article 16.4 or if the Claimants were treated unfairly in those courts (denial of procedural justice) or if the judgment of those courts were substantively unfair (denial of substantive justice) or otherwise denied rights guaranteed to French investors under the BIT by the Argentine Republic. However, since Claimants failed to seek relief from the Tucum\u00e1n administrative courts and since there is no evidence before this Tribunal that these courts would have denied Claimants procedural or substantive justice, there is no basis on this ground to hold the Argentine Republic liable under the BIT.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes that this decision does not impose an exhaustion of remedies requirement under the BIT because such requirement would be incompatible with Article 8 of the BIT and Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. In this case, however, the obligation to resort to the local courts is compelled by the express terms of Article 16.4 of the private contract between Claimants and the Province of Tucum\u00e1n and the impossibility, on the facts of the instant case, of separating potential breaches of contract claims from BIT violations without interpreting and applying the Concession Contract, a task that the contract assigns expressly to the local courts. That is why the Tribunal rejects Claimants\u2019 position that they had no obligation to pursue such local remedies against the Province or that, in the event of a denial of justice of rights under the BIT, that any such legal action in the Tucum\u00e1n courts would have waived their right to resort to arbitration against the Argentine Republic before ICSID under the BIT.\n\n82.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that despite the considerable importance Claimants attached during these proceedings to the failure in negotiation of the revised Concession Contract and, in particular, to the changes by the Tucum\u00e1n Governor and the Legislature in the April 22 draft, the Tribunal considers that these circumstances do not amount to a breach by the Argentine Republic of the BIT based on actions of the Province. Specifically, the Claimants have never argued that the Province violated a legal duty to revise the Concession Contract. Further, as noted below in discussing actions of the Argentine Republic, there is ample evidence in the record that federal officials of the Argentine Republic played a constructive role in the renegotiation process involving Tucum\u00e1n officials and representatives of CGE.\n\n**E.3** ***Failure of the Argentine Republic to Respond to Actions of Tucum\u00e1n Officials***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nIt remains for the Tribunal to address the allegations of the Claimants that the Argentine Republic is liable under the BIT by failing to respond appropriately to the actions of officials of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n. In this connection and despite the several years of acrimony in the relations between Tucum\u00e1n and Claimants, the Tribunal notes that Claimants produced only a single document, a letter dated March 5, 1996 (Cls. Ex. #27), that served as the basis for notifying the Argentine Republic that, absent resolution of the ongoing disputes between Claimants and the Province, the Claimants would pursue before ICSID their remedy against the Argentine Republic under the BIT. That letter concerns principally a report on the status of the renegotiations between Claimants and Tucum\u00e1n over a tariff reduction and does not ask Argentine officials to take any particular action relating to the Concession Contract or the pending differences between Claimants and the authorities of Tucum\u00e1n.\n\n84.\n\nThe record contains no evidence that Argentine officials ever failed to take any specific action that the Claimants requested. During the hearing, witnesses for the Claimants, including Mr. Charles-Louis de Maud\u2019Huy, who served as a member, vice chairman and then chairman of the CAA board (Trans. Jur./Merits at 244), and Mr. Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, a leading Tucum\u00e1n industrialist and a member of the CAA board, were unable to identify specifically any action that Claimants asked the Argentine Republic to take and that was not taken. Indeed, Mr. Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, when testifying about a critical meeting with a senior Argentine official, stated \"No, we did not request absolutely any specific steps to be taken....\" (Trans. Jur./Merits at 341.) Moreover, Claimants did not present as evidence any document in which they put Respondent on notice regarding what action the Argentine governmental authorities had taken that constituted a violation of the BIT or what action, if not taken by the Argentine Republic, would have constituted a breach of the BIT.\n\n85.\n\nIn the hearing, Respondent stated that Article 5 of the BIT could be read to require that, for purposes of the present arbitration, the Argentine Republic had an obligation \"to do everything in its power to avoid illegal expropriation by other political subdivisions.\" (Trans. Jur./Merits at 476.) The Respondent argued that this obligation was fulfilled by providing a forum for adjudication of the contract claims. (Trans. Jur./Merits at 477-78.) Claimants maintain that Respondent also had an obligation \"to take reasonable measures to solve the conflict and protect or redress damage to Claimants.\" (Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 48.)\n\n86.\n\nClaimants argue that the Argentine Republic failed to meet this good-offices obligation because the Argentine Republic did not \"exhaust the legal and political means at its disposal to protect Claimants\u2019 rights and did not even try to use them.\" (Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 48.) The Tribunal considers in turn each of the grounds upon which Claimants base this position.\n\n87.\n\nClaimants argue that the Argentine Republic \"failed to institute a legal action against Tucum\u00e1n to compel Tucum\u00e1n to comply with the BIT\" by instituting legal proceeding in the Argentine Supreme Court to \"declare that acts of a province... are not in conformity with federal laws, treaties, or the Constitution itself.\" (Cls. Post-Hearing Answers at 48-49.) The parties dispute whether the Argentine Republic could have initiated any such legal action without either a predicate court decision by a Tucum\u00e1n court, or a Tucum\u00e1n public law that on its face conflicted with Argentine federal law in an area of exclusive federal jurisdiction. (Res. Rej. at 33 and 37-39.) The Tribunal need not resolve this contested issue of Argentine law. It is clear that Claimants never urged that the Argentine Republic initiate such legal action at the time of the effectiveness of the Concession Contract (Res. Post-Hrg. Answers at 61-65.)(\"The fact is, Claimants never asked the Republic to start a legal action against Tucum\u00e1n.\") Further, the basis for any such federal action would depend on whether Tucum\u00e1n had, in fact, failed to fulfill its obligations under the Concession Contract or had taken measures clearly outside the scope of the Concession Contract. Under Article 16.4 of the Concession Contract, Claimants agreed to pursue in the courts of Tucum\u00e1n any such alleged violation of the terms of that agreement. On the facts presented, the Tribunal finds that there was no action of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n that, absent such a local court proceeding, so obviously violated the BIT as to require the Argentine government to seek a legal remedy against the Province in the Argentine courts nor, for that matter, did the Claimants ever specify any such action to the Argentine Republic.\n\n88.\n\nClaimants argue that the Argentine Republic also failed to \"exercise its financial leverage over the province to persuade Tucum\u00e1n to comply with the BIT.\" (Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 49.) Only one of the asserted Argentine precedents for such action appears to have involved the Argentine Republic entering into a dispute involving a private contract and, in that instance, a clear breach of an obligation to privatize was apparently involved (Trans. Jur./Merits at 822-24.) Again, the parties dispute the availability of the remedy in this case. However, they appear to agree that Claimants never urged such action during the period of the effectiveness of the Concession Contract. (Res. Rej. at 36; Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 49 (stating without citation to any request by Claimants to the Argentine Republic that the \"Federal Government refused to exercise its financial leverage over the province to persuade Tucum\u00e1n to comply with the BIT\" by furnishing additional funds to assist the Province or by withholding funds to pressure the Province.)) Even if the Tribunal were prepared to adopt the proposition that the Argentine Republic could be found legally required under the BIT to take such action, and the Tribunal does not resolve that point in this instance, that duty could not arise in this case absent proceedings in the courts of Tucum\u00e1n demonstrating either a clear breach of an obligation of Tucum\u00e1n to the investor or proceedings in those courts that otherwise failed to satisfy the international standard for procedural or substantive justice.\n\n89.\n\nClaimants also find a basis for liability in the failure of the Argentine Republic to take action showing the \"political commitment necessary to resolve the problem.\" (Cls. Post-Hearing Answers at 50.) Claimants concede that the Argentine Republic offered \"technical assistance\" and \"even helped prepare a new agreement\" between the Province and Claimants. However, they contend that Respondent had a duty to resolve the political problem resulting from the fact that, in their judgment, the \"Province simply had no interest in a new agreement that would allow CAA to operate as a viable commercial entity.\" *(Id.)* This position was strongly disputed by the Argentine Republic whose witnesses presented evidence in support of the conclusion that the disaffection of the Province with Claimants could reasonably be attributed to non-performance under the Concession Contract. Without resolving this contentious point, the Tribunal sees no basis for finding on the facts presented an international legal duty under the BIT for the Argentine Republic to cause Tucum\u00e1n to enter into a new agreement. Such a proposition would require this Tribunal to adopt the Claimants\u2019 assertions about the purposes and motives of the Province which are not justified by the evidence presented in these proceedings. *(See, e.g.,* Res. Post-Hearing Answers at 98-100 (disputing Claimants\u2019 interpretation of the actions of Tucum\u00e1n officials).)\n\n90.\n\nClaimants also submit that the Argentine Republic failed in its obligation to notify the Province of Tucum\u00e1n that \"its actions are causing a breach of the Republic\u2019s obligations under the BIT.\" (Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 51.) Given the denial of Respondent that it is liable under the BIT and Claimants\u2019 failure to specify to the Argentine Republic which actions of the Province violated the BIT, the Tribunal finds no basis for finding liability of Respondent based on the absence of such notification to the Province.\n\n91.\n\nClaimants also allege that the \"attacks on CAA revealed an interlocking web of [Tucum\u00e1n] officials that together were able to drive CAA from the Province.\" (Cls. Post-Hrg. Answers at 86.) Further, Claimants argue that under the BIT, as interpreted by international law, the Argentine Republic is liable for these actions of the Tucum\u00e1n officials. The Tribunal specifically asked the parties to address whether there was evidence in the record that actions of the legislators of Tucum\u00e1n that adversely affected the operations of Claimants *(e.g,* demonstrations and encouragement of non-payment of invoices) were, in fact, directed or coordinated by the Governor of Tucum\u00e1n or his cabinet. Claimants characterized the coordination between the various political branches as \"generally informal,\" but pointed to specific examples of actions of officials, executive and legislative, that were said to demonstrate that \"both individually and collectively, the public authorities in Tucum\u00e1n worked to undermine the concession.\" *(Id.* at 89.) These actions related to disagreements over the tariffs being charged by CGE, charges by an Investigative Commission of the Legislature regarding the performance of the government officials who had negotiated the Concession Contract and the previously noted alleged 70 changes in the second renegotiated agreement. Respondent vigorously disputes this interpretation of the actions of the Tucum\u00e1n executive and legislative officials. (Resp. Post-Hrg. Answers at 98.) In addition to pointing out that the legislators on whose actions the Claimants rely were opponents of the governing party in Tucum\u00e1n at the time that the disputes arose under the Concession Contract, Respondent presented a point by point refutation of the other evidence upon which Claimants rely for these allegations. After carefully reviewing the extensive memorials and testimony, the Tribunal finds that the record in these proceedings regarding these allegations does not establish a factual basis for attributing liability to the Argentine Republic under the BIT for the alleged actions of officials of Tucum\u00e1n.\n\n92.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the record of these proceedings does not provide a basis for holding that the Argentine Republic failed to respond to the situation in Tucum\u00e1n and the requests of the Claimants in accordance with the obligations of the Argentine government under the BIT.\n\n**F.** ***Costs and Fees***\n---------------------------\n\n93.\n\nNeither the BIT nor the provisions of the ICSID Convention include a provision directing how this Tribunal should regulate the costs and fees of the parties. Nor does the Concession Contract include any provision on this subject.\n\n94.\n\nICSID tribunals, and international arbitral tribunals generally, have not followed a uniform practice with respect to the award of costs and fees.21 In a recent ICSID decision, the tribunal decided not to follow the common practice that the party not prevailing bear the costs of arbitration and contribute to the prevailing party\u2019s reasonable costs of representation. *Robert Azinian et al. v. The United Mexican States,* Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2 (Nov. 1, 1999). In that case, which was initiated under the Chapter 11 investment provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the tribunal relied upon a number of factors in declining to award costs or fees to either party. Those factors included the \"new and novel mechanism for the resolution of international investment disputes\" under NAFTA and that the Claimants, who did not prevail on the merits, had \"presented their case in an efficient and professional manner.\"\n\nFor a recent comprehensive survey of the practice of ICSID and other international arbitral tribunals see J. Gotanda, *Awarding Costs and Attorney's Fees in International Commercial Arbitrations,* 21 Mich. J. Inf 1 L. 1, 25 (1999) (discussing the varied practice of ICSID tribunals in several cases and concluding that \"there is no consensus on the amount of costs and fees that should be paid to the prevailing party\"); *see also* A. Redfern & M. Hunter, *Law and Practice of International Commercial Arbitration* 407 (2d ed. 1991)(\"It is impossible to identify any general practice as to the treatment of costs in international commercial arbitrations.\").\n\n95.\n\nIn this case, the Claimants have prevailed on the jurisdictional issue while the Respondent has prevailed on the merits. The instant case raised a set of novel and complex issues not previously addressed in international arbitral precedent relating to the interplay of a bilateral investment treaty, a Concession Contract with a forum-selection clause and the ICSID Convention. Counsel for both parties have presented their arguments, written and oral, in an efficient and professional manner and have extensively briefed these issues of first impression. Finally, the positions of both parties evolved in the course of the proceeding as their respective arguments and the inquiries of the Tribunal caused them to clarify their positions.\n\n96.\n\nIn these circumstances and in the exercise of its discretion after taking account of all pertinent factors, the Tribunal decides that each side shall bear its own expenses for the proceedings, and that the two sides shall bear equally the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre. Since the parties have each made equal advance payments to ICSID, the Tribunal need not award the payment of any amount on account of such fees, expenses or charges.\n\n**G.** ***Award***\n------------------\n\nThe Tribunal herewith dismisses the claims filed by the Claimants against the Republic of Argentina.\n\n***Appendix 1*** ***Text of Cited Treaty and Contract Provisions***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A.

On 20 March 2001, the Claimants requested annulment of the award pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. Under Article 52 (3), the Chairman of the Administrative Council appointed three members of the Panel of Arbitrators, the undersigned and Mr. Yves Fortier, C.C., Q.C., as an *ad hoc* Committee to consider the request. The three members agreed that Mr. Fortier would be the President of the Committee.1 At its first session in Washington on 21 June 2001, all members made declarations in terms of Rule 6 of the Arbitration Rules. Mr. Fortier qualified his declaration in one respect, and the Respondent reserved the right to challenge him. Subsequently it did so.\n\nOn the election of the President by members of an *ad hoc* Committee see C.H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2001) pp. 1013-1014 (\u00a7345).\n\n2.\n\nChapter V of the Convention is entitled \"Replacement and Disqualification of Conciliators and Arbitrators\". Article 56 provides that once a Commission or Tribunal has been constituted and has begun its proceedings, its composition shall remain unchanged, subject to contingencies such as the death, incapacitation or resignation of a member. Articles 57 and 58 of the Convention deal with the procedure to be followed in case of a proposal to disqualify any member of a Commission or Tribunal. In particular Article 58 states that a proposal to disqualify a conciliator or arbitrator is to be decided \"by the other members of the Commission or Tribunal... provided that where those members are equally divided, or in the case of a proposal to disqualify a sole conciliator or arbitrator, or a majority of the conciliators or arbitrators, the Chairman shall take that decision\". Arbitration Rule 9 deals with issues of disqualification of arbitrators in further detail.\n\n3.\n\nChapter V does not refer to disqualification of the members of *ad hoc* Committees. Nor does Article 52. Article 52 (4) stipulates that:\n\n\"The provisions of Articles 41-45, 48, 49, 53 and 54, and of Chapters VI and VII shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to proceedings before the Committee.\"\n\nChapter V is not mentioned, although it deals with questions that could well arise with respect to the membership of Committees. However Rule 53, which is entitled \"Rules of Procedure\", states:\n\n\"The provisions of these Rules shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to any procedure relating to the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award and to the decision of the Tribunal or Committee.\"\n\nThe effect is to apply the procedure referred to in Arbitration Rule 9 to proposals to disqualify any member of a Committee. Pursuant to Rules 9 and 53, the undersigned were called on promptly to decide on the Respondent\u2019s proposal.\n\n4.\n\nBefore doing so Mr. Fortier made an explanation of his position in terms of Rule 9 (3). This was circulated to the Parties, who were given a brief period to comment on it. The Claimants made no observations. By letter of 12 September 2001 the Respondent confirmed its earlier challenge and made certain additional observations, which are discussed below.\n\n**Competence of Members of the Committee to Decide on a Disqualification Proposal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nAn initial question concerns our competence to decide on the proposal. Although neither Party raised the issue, it might be argued that the failure of Article 53 (4) of the Convention to refer to Chapter V or to apply it to the disqualification of members of *ad hoc* Committees was deliberate. If so, the Administrative Council was arguably incompetent to achieve by a Rule what the Convention itself specifically did not achieve and thus by implication precluded. It is necessary to consider this question before turning to the circumstances of the present case.\n\n6.\n\nThe rule-making powers of the Administrative Council are set out in Article 6 of the Convention. This provides, *inter alia,* that:\n\n\"(1) Without prejudice to the powers and functions vested in it by other provisions of this Convention, the Administrative Council shall:\n\n\"(c) adopt the rules of procedure for conciliation and arbitration proceedings (hereinafter called the Conciliation Rules and the Arbitration Rules);\n\n\u2026\n\n\"The decisions referred to in sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (f) above shall be adopted by a majority of two-thirds of the members of the Administrative Council.\n\n\"(2) The Administrative Council may appoint such committees as it considers necessary.\n\n\"(3) The Administrative Council shall also exercise such other powers and perform such other functions as it shall determine to be necessary for the implementation of the provisions of this Convention.\"\n\nThe Council consists of one representative of each Contracting State (Article 4).\n\n7.\n\nIt is not entirely clear from the Convention whether annulment requests and proceedings pursuant to such requests under Article 52 come within the term \"arbitration proceedings\" in Article 6 (1) (c), or whether they are to be considered as distinct. There are indications both ways. On the one hand annulment proceedings occur before a separate *ad hoc* Committee, separately constituted; on the other hand, the role of the Committee is narrowly defined and could be seen an ancillary to the arbitration function of ICSID as a whole. Nothing turns on this, however, since in any event the Council has power under Article 6 to regulate the procedures to be applied on a request for annulment, procedures which are only skeletally set out in Article 52. In particular it would have such power under Article 6 (3), on the basis that to establish orderly procedures for dealing with annulment requests can plainly be regarded as \"necessary for the implementation of the provisions of this Convention\". No doubt any such Rules must be consistent with the terms of the Convention and with its object and purpose. But subject to this, the judgement whether they are necessary is a matter for the Council.\n\n8.\n\nArticle 52 (3) provides that no member of an *ad hoc* Committee can have been a member of the Tribunal which rendered the award. In addition no member may have the same nationality as any of the members of the Tribunal or of either Party or have been nominated to the Panel of Arbitrators by either of the States concerned. This covers some issues relating to the independence of members of *ad hoc* Committees but it does not do so exhaustively. Although such members must be Panel members (and may therefore be presumed to have the general qualities required), they may still have or have had particular links with the parties to an annulment proceeding which would disqualify them from sitting. Yet it is not clear that the Chairman of the Administrative Council would have inherent power to decide such issues in the absence of any article or rule to that effect. It would clearly be appropriate for the Administrative Council under Article 6 (3) to provide a procedure for challenging the appointment of an *ad hoc* Committee member. It seems equally clear that the Council has actually done so. Although Arbitration Rule 9 itself refers to Article 57 of the Convention (which does not apply to disqualification of Committee members), Rule 9 is sufficiently self-contained and can be given effect without relying on powers expressly conferred by the Convention itself on other bodies. There can be no doubt as to the competence of the Administrative Council to apply the Arbitration Rules *mutatis mutandis* to proceedings relating to the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award, since this can clearly be seen as \"necessary for the implementation of the provisions of this Convention\". Nor\u2014if such a characterisation is relevant\u2014is there any difficulty in describing proceedings on a request for disqualification, including the identification of those who will make the decision, as procedural questions for the purposes of Rule 53.\n\n9.\n\nThe intention of the Administrative Council to apply Arbitration Rule 9 to the membership of *ad hoc* Committees can be inferred from the history of the Rules. Rule 53 of the initial Arbitration Rules of 1968 provided that:\n\n\"Chapter II to V (excepting rules 39 and 40) of these Rules shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to any procedure relating to the interpretation, revision and annulment of an award, and Chapter VI shall similarly apply to the decision by the Tribunal or Committee.\"2\n\nRule 39 concerned provisional measures; Rule 40, ancillary claims. These corresponded to Articles 46 and 47 of the Convention, which likewise were not applied by Article 52 (4) to annulment proceedings. Apart from these two Rules, the only significant exclusion from former Arbitration Rule 53 was Chapter I, which dealt with the establishment of the Tribunal, and which included the procedures for dealing with challenges. In 1984, the Administrative Council adopted a new set of Arbitration Rules, including Rule 53 in the terms set out above. The substantial effect of new Arbitration Rule 53 as compared with its predecessor was to apply *mutatis mutandis* the provisions of Chapter I and of Rules 39 and 40 to annulment procedures. We are informed that Parties to the Convention, who were given the opportunity to comment on the new Rules, made no comments on Rule 53. The new Rules were adopted without debate or dissent.3\n\nFor the text of the 1968 Arbitration Rules see 1 *ICSID Reports* p. 63.\n\nSee *ICSID Annual Report 1985,* p. 18.\n\n10.\n\nThus it can be inferred that the intention of the Council in 1984 was to apply all the Arbitration Rules, so far as possible, to annulment proceedings, including Rule 9. In our view the only reason why the procedure laid down in Arbitration Rule 9 could not be applied to members of *ad hoc* Committees *mutatis mutandis* would be if to apply such a procedure was inconsistent with the Convention, having regard to its object and purpose. We see no reason to regard it as such.\n\n11.\n\nAs to the object and purpose of the Convention, there is no difficulty. *Ad hoc* Committees have an important function to perform in relation to awards (in substitution for proceedings in national courts), and their members must be, and appear to be, independent and impartial. No other procedure exists under the Convention, expressly or impliedly, for deciding on proposals for disqualification. The only question then is whether it is literally inconsistent with the terms of the Convention, given that Chapter V is not applied by Article 52 to annulment, for the Rules to step in and make equivalent provision. Admittedly, the catalogue of provisions incorporated by reference in Article 52 (4) appears a considered one. The provisions incorporated are not only concerned with the powers of Committees. They apply to a range of questions, including the status of decisions made. On the other hand the matter of disqualification might simply have been overlooked, and other aspects of Chapter V are clearly apt to be applied to *ad hoc* Committees.\n\n12.\n\nThe point is noted as follows by Schreuer\u2019s *Commentary.*\n\n\"the application of Arbitration Rules 8-12 to annulment proceedings is only possible on the assumption that the omission of the Convention\u2019s Chapter V from the list of provisions in Art. 52(4) was unintentional. If the omission of Arts. 56-58 from Art. 52(4) is interpreted as a deliberate exclusion, it is not permissible to reintroduce these Articles under the guise of the corresponding Arbitration Rules... If this were otherwise, one could introduce the procedures for interpretation, revision and annulment in respect of decisions on annulment by way of applying the pertinent Arbitration Rules, a result that is clearly not intended by the Convention.\"4\n\nBut as Schreuer also notes,5 the *travaux preparatories* of the Convention do not suggest that there was any particular reason for excluding the application of Chapter V. It appears that no State party at the time of the adoption of Arbitration Rule 53 suggested any such reason. That Rule was adopted unanimously and was treated by the Members of the Administrative Council as uncontroversial. In the circumstances, the unanimous adoption of Arbitration Rule 53 can be seen, if not as an actual agreement by the States parties to the Convention as to its interpretation, at least as amounting to subsequent practice relevant to its interpretation.6\n\nC.H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2001) p. 1042 (\u00a7422).\n\nIb\u00edd., p. 1039 (\u00a7412).\n\nCf. Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969, Art. 31 (3).\n\n13.\n\nFor all these reasons, we accept that Arbitration Rule 53 was within the competence of the Administrative Council under Article 6 (3) of the Convention, to the extent that it applies Chapter V *mutatis mutandis* to proposals to disqualify any member of an *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n**The Question of Disqualification**\n------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nWe turn then to the particular question raised by the challenge to Mr. Fortier. The governing standard here is not in doubt. It is set forth in Article 14 of the Convention, which is applied to members of annulment Committees by Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. Article 14 provides as follows:\n\n\"(1) Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.\"\n\nNeither Mr. Fortier\u2019s moral character nor his competence in the field of law have been questioned by the Respondent. The issue centres only on the question of his independence and impartiality with respect to the parties to the dispute, specifically the Claimants, i.e. on whether he \"may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment\".\n\n15.\n\nArbitration Rule 6, as applied to *ad hoc* Committees by Arbitration Rule 53, requires from each of the members a declaration that there is to the best of their knowledge no reason why they should not serve, and a \"statement of... past and present professional, business and other relationships (if any) with the parties\". In his statement of 18 June 2001, Mr. Fortier advised that one of the partners in his law firm Ogilvy Renault had been engaged by Vivendi\u2019s predecessor, Compagnie Gen\u00e9rale des Eaux, to advise on certain matters relating to taxation under Quebec law. Mr. Fortier had had no personal involvement in the work, which was wholly unrelated to the present case.\n\n16.\n\nIn response to certain questions put by the Respondent at the first session, Mr. Fortier affirmed that the remuneration involved was *de minimis.* He subsequently provided a memorandum from his firm stating that the work done for Vivendi S.A. had \"always been very limited and, in relative terms, is inconsequential to our firm\u2019s total billing\". The responsible tax partner of the firm provided a further memorandum outlining in general terms the nature of the work done and specifying the fees charged. According to this statement, fees of approximately $216,000 had been billed, of which the great majority (approximately $204,000) concerned work done in the period 1995-1999. The work was done for Vivendi S.A. but on instructions from a United States law firm which was acting generally in the matter. The work remaining to be done by Ogilvy Renault in respect of the matter was trivial; it concerned only the winding up of the arrangements in question and would involve fees of not more than $2000. The partner undertook that he would not accept any further instructions from Vivendi S.A. until after the completion of this Committee\u2019s mandate.\n\n17.\n\nIn its statement of 12 September 2001 the Respondent noted that the retainer from Compagnie Gen\u00e9rale des Eaux was a continuing one and stated that the amounts charged on that retainer since 1995 \"cannot be considered by the Republic of Argentina as *de minimis\".* It also stressed the importance of the present proceedings. In these circumstances it affirmed its challenge under Article 14 of the Convention. It had originally relied, *inter alia,* on the following provisions of the Code of Ethics for International Arbitrators (International Bar Association, 1987):\n\nRule 3.1: The criteria for assessing questions relating to bias are impartiality and independence. Partiality arises where an arbitrator favours one of the parties, or where he is prejudiced in relation to the subject-matter of the dispute. Dependence arises from relationships between an arbitrator and one of the parties, or with someone closely connected with one of the parties.\n\nRule 3.2: Facts which might lead a reasonable person, not knowing the arbitrator\u2019s true state of mind, to consider that he is dependent on a party create an appearance of bias. The same is true if an arbitrator has a material interest in the outcome of the dispute, or if he has already taken a position in relation to it. The appearance of bias is best overcome by full disclosure as described in Article 4 below.\n\nRule 4 establishes, in effect, the obligation of arbitrators to declare all facts or circumstances that may give rise to justifiable doubts.\n\n18.\n\nConsistently with this Code of Ethics, Arbitration Rule 6 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which is directly applicable here, imposes the obligation to declare \"past and present professional, business and other relationships (if any) with the parties\". The fundamental principle is that arbitrators shall be and remain independent and impartial; in terms of Article 14 (1) of the Convention, they must be able to be \"relied on to exercise independent judgment\". Exactly the same principle applies to the members of *ad hoc* Committees. The role of the other members of this Committee is to determine whether there is \"a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14\".\n\n19.\n\nCertain initial points should be made. First, although various legal entities within the Vivendi group have been mentioned (Compagnie Gen\u00e9rale des Eaux, Vivendi S.A., Vivendi Universal), it does not appear that there is any relevant distinction between them for present purposes. Accordingly we approach the question on the basis that one of the claimant companies, or at any rate a company within the Vivendi group, is a client of Mr. Fortier\u2019s law firm in an as yet uncompleted matter. The great bulk of the work was done before the present proceedings were commenced and only a minor amount of work remains to be done. Mr. Fortier at no stage has had any personal involvement with the work or with the Claimant companies in relation thereto, and the work done bears no relationship to the present dispute.\n\n20.\n\nSecondly, a question arises with respect to the term \"manifest lack of the qualities required\" in Article 57 of the Convention. This might be thought to set a lower standard for disqualification than the standard laid down, for example, in Rule 3.2 of the IBA Code of Ethics, which refers to an \"appearance of bias\". The term \"manifest\" might imply that there could be circumstances which, though they might appear to a reasonable observer to create an appearance of lack of independence or bias, do not do so manifestly. In such a case, the arbitrator might be heard to say that, while he might be biased, he was not *manifestly* biased and that he would therefore continue to sit. As will appear, in light of the object and purpose of Article 57 we do not think this would be a correct interpretation.\n\n21.\n\nDecisions on a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator under Article 57 have been made in two previous cases. In the *Amco Asia* case, the Respondent challenged the Claimant\u2019s party-appointed arbitrator, Mr. Rubin, on a number of grounds. Prior to his appointment as arbitrator (but after the commencement of the arbitration) Mr. Rubin had personally given a limited amount of tax advice to the principal shareholder in the Claimant company. His law firm had also, prior to the commencement of the arbitration, had a profit sharing arrangement with the lawyers acting for the Claimants. During the period of that arrangement neither the shareholder nor the Claimant had been clients of either law firm. In their unpublished decision of 14 June 1982,7 the other two arbitrators (Professors Goldman and Foighel) first affirmed by reference to the object and purpose of the Convention, that...\n\n\"an absolute impartiality... of all the members of an arbitral tribunal, is required, and it is right to say that no distinction can and should be made, as to the standard of impartiality, between the members of an arbitral tribunal, whatever the method of their appointment.\"8\n\nBut they went on to say that this requirement did not preclude the appointment as an arbitrator of a person who has had, before his appointment, some relationship with a party, unless this appeared to create a risk of inability to exercise independent judgment. In this context, in their view, the existence of some prior professional relationship in and of itself did not create such a risk \"whatever the character\u2014even professional\u2014or the extent of said relations.\"9 As to Article 57, they laid stress on the term \"manifest\", which in their view required \"not a possible lack of the quality, but... a highly probable one.\"10 On this basis they rejected the challenge. In their view, legal advice (with a fee, in 1982, of Can$450) given by someone who had never been \"regular counsel of the appointing party\" was minor and had no bearing on the reliability of the arbitrator; nor could the links between the two law firms \"create any psychological risk of partiality\".11 Thus Mr. Rubin\u2019s lack of reliability was not manifest; indeed, in their view, it was not even reasonably apprehended.\n\nICSID Case ARB/81/1, *Amco Asia Corp. v. Republic of Indonesia,* Decision on the proposal to disqualify an arbitrator, of 24 June 1982, unpublished.\n\nAs cited by M. Tupman, \"Challenge and Disqualification of Arbitrators in International Commercial Arbitration\", *ICLQ,* v. 38, 1989, p.26 at p. 45.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n22.\n\nThe decision has been strongly criticized.12 To the extent that it concerned a personal relationship of legal advice given by the arbitrator to a party or to a related person after the dispute in question had arisen, it can in our view only be justified under the *de minimis* exception. That the advice was given on an unrelated matter, though a relevant factor, can hardly be sufficient. The fact remains that a lawyer-client relationship existed between the claimant and the arbitrator personally during the pendency of the arbitration; this must surely be a sufficient basis for a reasonable concern as to independence, unless the extent and content of the advice can really be regarded as minor and wholly discrete.\n\nIbid., p. 51.\n\n23.\n\nThe second decision under Article 57 was given on 19 January 2001 in the *Zhinvali* case, which is still pending. There the challenge was based on the existence of occasional, purely social, contacts between the arbitrator in question and an executive instrumental in the claimant\u2019s investment. The other two arbitrators stressed the absence of any professional or business relationship between the arbitrator and the person concerned, and concluded that to suggest that a merely occasional personal contact could manifestly affect the judgment of an arbitrator, in the absence of any further facts, was purely speculative.13 They accordingly dismissed the challenge.\n\nICSID Case ARB/00/1, *Zhinvali Development Ltd. v. Republic of Georgia,* Decision on Respondent\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator, 19 January 2001 (Davis Robinson, Seymour J. Rubin), unpublished.\n\n24.\n\nOn the crucial question of the threshold test, the *travaux preparatories* of Article 57 give little guidance. Schreuer says only that the requirement that the lack of impartiality must be manifest \"imposes a relatively heavy burden of proof on the party making the proposal\".14 Some guidance is however to be obtained from general authorities in the field of international arbitration. According to Fouchard, Gaillard & Goldman, the existence of business relations between an arbitrator and one of the parties does not necessarily lead to the existence of a relationship of dependency that would justify a challenge.15 They note, realistically, the large number of possibilities that exist for arbitrators to have or have had some \"professional contact\" with the parties. In this respect, an illustrative case is that of *Philipp Brothers,16* where it was stressed that a professional party could not be allowed to challenge *en bloc* all other professionals within his or her milieu. The authors also refer to an ICC arbitration where counsel acting for one of the parties belonged to the same firm as the president of the arbitral tribunal. The Paris *Cour d\u2019appel* held that belonging to such an \"association of interests\" as a large law firm with multiple divisions and specializations does not imply economic dependency sufficient to justify disqualification.17\n\nSchreuer, *Commentary,* p. 1200, \u00a716, and see ibid., p. 1199, \u00a714 for a review of the *travaux.* On the meaning of the term \"manifestly\" in Arts. 36 (3) and 52 of the Convention see ibid., pp. 458-460, \u00a7\u00a745-47, pp. 932-936, \u00a7\u00a7137-146, respectively. It is implicit in what we have said that the term may have a different meaning in these different contexts.\n\n*Trait\u00e9 d\u2019arbitrage commercial international,* Paris, Litec, 1999, pp. 584.\n\nTGI Paris, 28 October 1988 and 29 June 1989, *Rev. arb.* 1990, p. 497.\n\nJudgment of 28 June 1991, *Rev. arb.* 1992, p. 568, reported by P. Bellet; cited by Fouchard, Gaillard & Goldman, pp.584-585.\n\n25.\n\nIt is not necessary to consider the implications of the term \"manifest\" in Article 57 for cases in which there is any dispute over the facts, since there is none in the present case. On the one hand it is clear that that term cannot preclude consideration of facts previously undisclosed or unknown, provided that these are duly established at the time the decision is made. On the other hand, the term must exclude reliance on speculative assumptions or arguments\u2014for example, assumptions based on prior and in themselves innocuous social contacts between the challenged arbitrator and a party. But in cases where (as here) the facts are established and no further inference of impropriety is sought to be derived from them, the question seems to us to be whether a real risk of lack of impartiality based upon those facts (and not on any mere speculation or inference) could reasonably be apprehended by either party. If (and only if) the answer is yes can it be said that the arbitrator may not be relied on to exercise independent judgment.18 That is to say, the circumstances actually established (and not merely supposed or inferred) must negate or place in clear doubt the appearance of impartiality. If the facts would lead to the raising of some reasonable doubt as to the impartiality of the arbitrator or member, the appearance of security for the parties would disappear and a challenge by either party would have to be upheld. Once the other arbitrators or Committee members had become convinced of this conclusion, there would no longer be room for the view that the deficiency was not \"manifest\".\n\nFor examples of the application of a test of this kind to diverse facts see e.g. *AT & T Corporation v. Saudi Cable Co.* [2000] 2 Lloyd\u2019s Rep. 127; *In re Medicaments and Related Classes of Goods (No. 2)* [2001] 1 WLR 700.\n\n26.\n\nTurning to the facts of the present case, it is true that a partner of Mr. Fortier\u2019s had (and still has) the Claimants or one of their affiliates as a client. But we do not think that this, in and of itself, is enough to justify disqualification in the circumstances of this case. Relevant on the other hand are the following facts: (a) that the relationship in question was immediately and fully disclosed and that further information about it was forthcoming on request, thus maintaining full transparency;19 (b) that Mr. Fortier personally has and has had no lawyer-client relationship with the Claimants or its affiliates; (c) that the work done by his colleague has nothing to do with the present case; (d) that the work concerned does not consist in giving general legal or strategic advice to the Claimants but concerns a specific transaction, in which Ogilvy Renault are not the lead firm; (e) that the legal relationship will soon come to an end with the closure of the transaction concerned.\n\nMr. Fortier declined, in our view reasonably, to provide details of his overall remuneration with Ogilvy Renault. Disclosure of that information, confidential to him and his partners, was not necessary in order to decide on the proposal for disqualification.\n\n27.\n\nIn these specific circumstances we see no reason to regard Mr. Fortier\u2019s independence as in any way impaired by the facts disclosed. We therefore do not need to rely on any *de minimis* rule as a basis for our conclusion. We note that the Respondent does accept in principle the existence of such a rule.20 While we agree with the Respondent that the amount of fees earned in the transaction since its inception is not *de minimis,* it is the case that only a small amount will have been charged for the last stages of the work, in the period 2000-2002. This is the relevant period for the purposes of the present annulment request. If necessary, the *de minimis* rule would have provided a further basis for rejecting the proposal for disqualification.\n\nSee above, paragraph 17.\n\n**Conclusions**\n---------------\n\n28.\n\nTo summarise, we agree with earlier panels which have had to interpret and apply Article 57 that the mere existence of some professional relationship with a party is not an automatic basis for disqualification of an arbitrator or Committee member. All the circumstances need to be considered in order to determine whether the relationship is significant enough to justify entertaining reasonable doubts as to the capacity of the arbitrator or member to render a decision freely and independently. In the present case, for the reasons given above, the continuing relationship between another partner of Ogilvy Renault and Vivendi is not significant enough for this purpose. Accordingly the proposal for disqualification submitted by the Respondent must be dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2002-07-03T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\nA. THE ANNULMENT PROCEEDINGS\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 20 March 2001, Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. (\"CAA\") and Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux (\"CGE\"; CGE and CAA are referred to, collectively, as \"Claimants\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") an application in writing (the \"Application\") requesting the partial annulment of an Award dated 21 November 2000 (the \"Award\") rendered by the Tribunal in the arbitration between Claimants and Respondent.1\n\nThe text of the award is published at 40 ILM 426 (2001).\n\n2.\n\nThe Application was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\"). The Application sought partial annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, specifically: the Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers; there had been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and the Award failed to state the reasons on which it was based.\n\n3.\n\nThe Application was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on 23 March 2001. In accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), the Secretary-General transmitted a Notice of Registration to the parties on that date and also forwarded to the Respondent copies of the Application and accompanying documentation. Thereafter, in accordance with Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention and at the request of the Secretary-General, the Chairman of the Administrative Council proceeded to appoint an *ad hoc* Committee (the \"Committee\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Committee was subsequently duly constituted\u2014composed of Professor James R. Crawford, Professor Jos\u00e9 Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Rozas and Mr. L. Yves Fortier\u2014and the parties were so notified by the Secretary-General on 18 May 2001, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules. On 25 May 2001, the Secretary of the Committee informed the parties that Mr. L. Yves Fortier had been designated President of the Committee.\n\n5.\n\nThe first meeting of the Committee was held at the seat of ICSID, in Washington, D.C., on 21 June 2001. At that meeting, all members made declarations in terms of Rule 6 of the Arbitration Rules. Mr. Fortier qualified his declaration in one respect, and the Respondent reserved the right to challenge him. Subsequently it did so, pursuant to Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 53. The challenge concerned Mr. Fortier\u2019s disclosure that one of the partners in his law firm had been engaged by CGE to advise on certain specific matters relating to taxation under Quebec law. Mr. Fortier had had no personal involvement in the work, which was wholly unrelated to the present case and which did not involve a general retainer. After receiving written statements from the parties, the other two members of the Committee, by a decision of 24 September 2001, dismissed the challenge.\n\n6.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural timetable laid down by the Committee at its meeting of 21 June 2001, the parties filed their respective Memorials on 20 August 2001 and on 12 November 2001. Claimants\u2019 Memorial was accompanied by an Expert Opinion prepared by Professor Christoph H. Schreuer, and Respondent filed an Expert Opinion rendered by Professor Arthur T. von Mehren. Claimants thereafter submitted a Reply on 10 December 2001. Respondent filed a Rejoinder on 8 January 2002.\n\n7.\n\nA two-day hearing in this annulment proceeding was held at the seat of ICSID on 31 January and 1 February 2002, at which counsel for both parties presented their arguments and submissions, and responded to questions from the members of the Committee. The parties subsequently made observations to the English and Spanish transcripts made of the hearing, which have been taken into account by the Committee.\n\n8.\n\nIn the absence of any agreed request by the parties to vary the rules of procedure laid down in the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, the annulment proceeding was at all times conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 3 of Chapter IV of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules.2\n\nArticle 52(4) of the ICSID Convention provides: \"The provisions of Articles 41-45, 48, 49, 53 and 54, and of Chapters VI and VII [of the Convention, dealing with arbitration proceedings] shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to proceedings before the Committee.\"\n\nB. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S AWARD\n-----------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe dispute underlying the arbitration arose out of certain alleged acts of the Argentine Republic and its constituent Province of Tucum\u00e1n that, according to Claimants, caused the termination of a thirty-year concession contract (the \"Concession Contract\") entered into by Tucum\u00e1n and CAA on 18 May 1995. In the arbitration, Claimants asserted that all of these acts were attributable to the Argentine Republic under international law and, as such, violated Argentina\u2019s obligations under the Agreement between the Government of the Argentine Republic and the Government of the Republic of France for Reciprocal Protection and Promotion of Investments of 3 July 1991 (the \"BIT\").3 Relevant provisions of the BIT are set out later in this decision.\n\nSigned 3 July 1991; entered into force 3 March 1993; **United Nations Treaty Series,** vol. 1728, p. 282 (French text). The BIT provisions quoted, in English, in the present decision are drawn from the official United Nations English translation: **United Nations Treaty Series,** vol. 1728, p. 298. Appendix 1 to the Tribunal\u2019s Award of 21 November 2001 is the source of the English translation of the provisions of the Concession Agreement referred to herein: 40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 449-451.\n\n10.\n\nThe Award that is the subject of the present annulment proceeding was rendered on 21 November 2000. In the Award, the Tribunal rejected the objections to its jurisdiction raised by the Argentine Republic. Having upheld its jurisdiction, the Tribunal nonetheless dismissed the claim.\n\n11.\n\nIn order to provide relevant background and context to the present decision, and before proceeding to consider the detailed findings of the Tribunal and the grounds for annulment to which those findings are said to give rise, the Committee can do no better than recite the Tribunal\u2019s own \"Introduction and Summary\":\n\n*A. Introduction and Summary*\n\nThis case arises from a complex and often bitter dispute associated with a 1995 Concession Contract that a French company, Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux, and its Argentine affiliate, Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. (collectively referred to as \"Claimant\" or \"CGE\"), made with Tucum\u00e1n, a province of Argentina, and with the investment in Tucum\u00e1n resulting from that agreement. The Republic of Argentina (\"Argentine Republic\") was not a party to the Concession Contract or to the negotiations that led to its conclusion....\n\nThe Concession Contract...makes no reference to either the BIT or ICSID Convention or to the remedies that are available to a French foreign investor in Argentina under these treaties. Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT provide that each of the Contracting Parties shall grant \"fair and equitable treatment according to the principles of international law to investments made by investors of the other Party,\" that investments shall enjoy \"protection and full security in accordance with the principle of fair and equitable treatment,\" and that Contracting Parties shall not adopt expropriatory or nationalizing measures except for a public purpose, without discrimination and upon payment of \"prompt and adequate compensation.\" Article 8 of the Argentine-French BIT provides that, if an investment dispute arises between one Contracting Party and an investor from another Contracting Party and that dispute cannot be resolved within six months through amicable consultations, then the investor may submit the dispute either to the national jurisdiction of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute or, at the investor\u2019s option, to arbitration under the ICSID Convention or to an *ad hoc* tribunal pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.\n\nArticle 16.4 of the Concession Contract between CGE and Tucum\u00e1n provided for the resolution of contract disputes, concerning both its interpretation and application, to be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n. While this case presents many preliminary and other related questions, the core issue before this Tribunal concerns the legal significance that is to be attributed to this forum-selection provision of the Concession Contract in light of the remedial provisions in the BIT and the ICSID Convention. This question bears both on the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of this Tribunal under the ICSID Convention and on the legal analysis of the merits of the dispute between CGE and the Argentine Republic.\n\nWhen CGE invoked the jurisdiction of ICSID in reliance on the terms of the BIT and the ICSID Convention and sought damages of over U.S. $300 million, the Argentine Republic responded that it had not consented to submission of the dispute for resolution under the ICSID Convention. Because of the close relationship between the jurisdictional issue and the underlying merits of the claims, the Tribunal decided that it would not be able to resolve the jurisdictional question without a full presentation of the factual issues relating to the merits. Accordingly, the Tribunal, after receiving memorials from the parties and hearing oral argument, joined the jurisdictional issue to the merits.\n\nFor the reasons set forth in this Award, the Tribunal holds that it has jurisdiction to hear the claims of CGE against the Argentine Republic for violation of the obligations of the Argentine Republic under the BIT. Neither the forum-selection provision of the Concession Contract nor the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the BIT on which the Argentine Republic relies preclude CGE\u2019s recourse to this Tribunal on the facts presented.\n\nWith respect to the merits, CGE has not alleged that the Republic itself affirmatively interfered with its investment in Tucum\u00e1n. Rather, CGE alleges that the Argentine Republic failed to prevent the Province of Tucum\u00e1n from taking certain action with respect to the Concession Contract that, Claimants allege, consequently infringed their rights under the BIT. CGE also alleges that the Argentine Republic failed to cause the Province to take certain action with respect to the Concession Contract, thereby also infringing Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT. In addition, CGE maintains that international law attributes to the Argentine Republic actions of the Province and its officials and alleges that those actions constitute breaches of the Argentine Republic\u2019s obligations under the BIT.\n\nWhile CGE challenged actions of Tucum\u00e1n in administrative agencies of the Province, CGE concedes that it never sought, pursuant to Article 16.4, to challenge any of Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s actions in the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n as violation of the terms of the Concession Contract. CGE maintains that any such challenge would have constituted a waiver of its rights to recourse to ICSID under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept CGE\u2019s position that claims by CGE in the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n for breach of the terms of the Concession Contract, as Article 16.4 requires, would have constituted a waiver of Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. Further, as the Tribunal demonstrates below, the nature of the facts supporting most of the claims presented in this case make it impossible for the Tribunal to distinguish or separate violations of the BIT from breaches of the Concession Contract without first interpreting and applying the detailed provisions of that agreement. By Article 16.4, the parties to the Concession Contract assigned that task expressly and exclusively to the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n. Accordingly, and because the claims in this case arise almost exclusively from alleged acts of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n that relate directly to its performance under the Concession Contract, the Tribunal holds that the Claimants had a duty to pursue their rights with respect to such claims against Tucum\u00e1n in the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n as required by Article 16.4 of their Concession Contract.\n\nCGE presented certain additional claims regarding allegedly sovereign actions of Tucum\u00e1n that Claimants maintained were unrelated to the Concession Contract. CGE asserted that these actions of the Province gave rise to international responsibility attributable to the Argentine Republic under the BIT as interpreted by applicable international law. Furthermore, CGE alleged that the Argentine Republic was also liable for its failures to perform certain obligations under the BIT that Claimants submitted gave rise to international responsibility independent of the performance of Tucum\u00e1n under the Concession Contract. The Tribunal finds that many of these other claims arose, in fact, from actions of the Province relating to the merits of disputes under the Concession Contract and, for that reason, were subject to initial resolution in the contentious administrative tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n under Article 16.4 To the extent such claims are the result of actions of the Argentine Republic or of the Province that are arguably independent of the Concession Contract, the Tribunal holds that the evidence presented in these proceedings did not establish the grounds for finding violation by the Argentine Republic of its legal obligations under the BIT either through its own acts or omission or through attribution to it of acts of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities.4\n\nAward, Part A., pp. 1-3; 40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 427-429 (footnotes omitted).\n\n12.\n\nIn the final section of its Award, after reviewing the procedural history of the arbitration,5 summarising the facts and respective legal positions of the parties6 and explaining its reasoning with respect to both its jurisdiction7 and the merits,8 the Tribunal disposed of Claimants\u2019 case in the following terms:\n\n*G. Award*\n\nThe Tribunal herewith dismisses the claims filed by the Claimants against the Republic of Argentina.9\n\nAward, Part B., paras. 1-23; 40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 429-433.\n\nAward, Part C\" paras. 24-39; 40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 433-435.\n\nAward, Part D\" paras. 40-55; 40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 435-439.\n\nAward, Part E., paras. 56-92; 40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 439-446.\n\nAward, Part G., p. 35; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 447. Part E of the Award, paras. 93-96, contains the Tribunal\u2019s assessment and determination regarding the allocation of the costs and fees associated with the arbitration: 40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 446-447.\n\n13.\n\nBefore considering the grounds for annulment presented to the Committee, it is necessary to set out in some greater detail the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning both as to its jurisdiction and regarding the merits of the claim.\n\n(1) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on Jurisdiction\n-------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe core of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in support of its jurisdictional finding is contained in paragraphs 49 to 54 of the Award. The Tribunal found as follows:\n\n(a) Claimants\u2019 claims concerning the actions of the federal government of Argentina as well as those of the provincial authorities of Tucum\u00e1n are properly characterised as claims arising under the BIT, and not as contractual claims under the Concession Agreement.10\n\n(b) Under international law, the acts of organs of both the central government and provincial authorities are attributable to the state\u2014in this case, the Argentine Republic\u2014with the result that Argentina cannot rely on its federal structure as a means of limiting its treaty obligations.11\n\n(c) Article 25(3) of the ICSID Convention is intended to allow for constituent subdivisions or agencies of a state party to the ICSID Convention to be subject to ICSID jurisdiction and to be parties to ICSID cases, in their own right and in their own name, where they have so consented and the Contracting State in question has approved. Article 25(3) neither limits the scope of the state\u2019s international responsibilities in accordance with normal rules of attribution nor qualifies the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal over that state. In the present case, it does not restrict the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the Argentine Republic pursuant to the BIT, and there is no question of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n itself being a party to the arbitration in its own name.12\n\n(d) Similarly, Article 16(4) of the Concession Contract\u2014which provides that \" [f]or purposes of interpretation and application of this Contract the parties submit themselves to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Contentious Administrative Tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n\"\u2014does not, and indeed could not, exclude the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the BIT. Claimants\u2019 claims \"are not subject to the jurisdiction of the contentious administrative tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n, if only because, *ex hypothesi,* those claims are not based on the Concession Contract but allege a cause of action under the BIT.\"13\n\nAward, para. 50; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 438.\n\nAward, para. 49; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 437\n\nAward, para. 51; in para. 52, the Tribunal supports this conclusion by reference to the *travaux* of Article 25; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 438.\n\nAward, para. 53; 40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 438-439 (footnote omitted). This conclusion is supported *inter alia* by reference to the decision of the ICSID Tribunal in *Lanco International Inc v. Argentine Republic* (Preliminary Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 December 1998), 40 ILM 457 (2001).\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to state that \" [b]y this same analysis,\"14 instituting proceedings against the Province of Tucum\u00e1n before the contentious administrative tribunals for breach of the Concession Contract would not have been \"the kind of choice by Claimants of legal action in national jurisdictions *(i.e.,* courts) against the Argentine Republic that constitutes the \u2018fork in the road\u2019 under Article 8 of the BIT, thereby foreclosing future claims under the ICSID Convention.\"15\n\nReferring to the analysis contained in paras. 53-54 of the Award (40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 438-439) and summarized at para. 14(d) of this decision.\n\nAward, para. 55; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 439. Strictly speaking, this passage did not constitute part of the Tribunal\u2019s findings on jurisdiction, though it flowed from its analysis of the jurisdictional situation. We return to it later in this decision.\n\n(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on the Merits\n-----------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nIn considering the Tribunal\u2019s findings on the merits, it is necessary to\u00a0distinguish between what the Tribunal referred to as, on the one hand, claims\u00a0\u201cbased directly on alleged actions or failures to act of the Argentine\u00a0Republic\u201d16 and, on the other hand, claims relating to conduct of the\u00a0Tucum\u00e1n authorities which are nonetheless brought against Argentina and\u00a0\u201crely...upon the principle of attribution.\u201d17 For the purposes of this decision,\u00a0these two categories of claims will be referred to, respectively, as the \u201cfederal\u00a0claims\u201d and the \u201cTucum\u00e1n claims.\u201d\n\nAward, para. 50; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 438.\n\nIbid. The terminology employed by the Tribunal in this regard is not entirely happy. All international claims against a state are based on attribution, whether the conduct in question is that of a central or provincial government or other subdivision. See ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for\u00a0Internationally Wrongful Acts, annexed to GA Resolution 54/83, 12 December 2001 (hereafter \u201cILC\u00a0Articles\u201d), Articles 2(a), 4 and the Commission\u2019s commentary to Article 4, paras. (8)-(10). A similar\u00a0remark may be made concerning the Tribunal\u2019s later reference to \u201ca strict liability standard of attribution\u201d (Award, para. 63; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 440). Attribution has nothing to do with the standard\u00a0of liability or responsibility. The question whether a state\u2019s responsibility is \u201cstrict\u201d or is based on due\u00a0diligence or on some other standard is a separate issue from the question of attribution (cf. ILC Articles,\u00a0Arts. 2, 12). It does not, however, appear that either of these terminological issues affected the reasoning\u00a0of the Tribunal, and no more need be said of them.\n\n17.\n\nAlthough, as mentioned above, the Tribunal expressly \u201cdismisse[d] the\u00a0claims filed by Claimants against the Republic of Argentina,\u201d18 what it actually did\u2014and did not do\u2014was much disputed between the parties. According\u00a0to the Respondent, the Tribunal carefully considered and, as stated in its\u00a0Award, dismissed all of Claimants\u2019 claims on the merits. According to Claimants, the Tribunal never actually considered the merits of their BIT claims at all, and by purporting to dismiss those claims without effectively\u00a0considering them on their merits, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\u00a0Further, Claimants submit, even if it could be said that the Tribunal did consider their claims on the merits, it nonetheless failed to give any reasons for dismissing them. There is thus a fundamental difference between the parties as to\u00a0the manner in which the Tribunal\u2019s decision is to be characterised.\n\nAward, Part G\u201e p. 35; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 447.\n\n(a) The Federal Claims\n----------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal dealt with the federal claims\u2014that is, claims arising from alleged conduct on the part of the federal authorities of the Argentine Republic\u2014in paragraphs 83-90 and 92 of the Award.\n\n19.\n\nIt began by noting that on only one occasion\u2014in a letter dated 5 March 1996\u2014did Claimants ever raise the issue, as against the federal authorities directly, of a breach of the BIT.19 The Tribunal noted that nowhere in the letter did Claimants \"ask Argentine officials to take any particular action relating to the Concession Contract or the pending differences between Claimants and the authorities of Tucum\u00e1n.\"20 Accordingly the Tribunal determined that \" [t]he record contains no evidence that Argentine officials ever failed to take any specific action that the Claimants requested.\"21\n\nAward, para. 83; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 444.\n\n*ibid.*\n\nAward, para. 84; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 444.\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal nonetheless went on to deal with the federal claims in some detail. It surveyed the range of \"legal and political means\" which, according to Claimants, the federal authorities should have used \"to protect Claimants\u2019 rights.\"22 These included: commencing legal proceedings against Tucum\u00e1n in a federal court (para. 87); exercising financial (para. 88) and political (para. 89) leverage over the province; and notifying Tucum\u00e1n that its conduct was in breach of the BIT (para. 90).\n\nAward, para. 86; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 445.\n\n21.\n\nRepresentative of this discussion is the treatment of potential legal action by the federal government, in a federal court, designed \"to compel Tucum\u00e1n to comply with the BIT.\"23 The Tribunal acknowledged (but declined to resolve) the contested issue of Argentine law as to whether a federal court action would lie against a province for breach of a treaty. It observed that recourse to the Tucum\u00e1n tribunals was available to Claimants (or at least to CAA) under the terms of the Concession Contract. It concluded by holding:\n\nOn the facts presented, the Tribunal finds that there was no action of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n that, absent such a local court proceeding [viz. under Article 16(4) of the Concession Agreement], so obviously violated the BIT as to require the Argentine government to seek a legal remedy against the Province in the Argentine courts nor, for that matter, did the Claimants ever specify any such action to the Argentine Republic.24\n\nAward, para. 87; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 445.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n22.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s overall conclusion regarding the federal claims was as follows:\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the record of these proceedings does not provide a basis for holding that the Argentine Republic failed to respond to the situation in Tucum\u00e1n and the requests of the Claimants in accordance with the obligations of the Argentine government under the BIT.25\n\nAward, para. 92; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 446.\n\n(b) The Tucum\u00e1n Claims\n----------------------\n\n23.\n\nClaimants\u2019 claims arising from the alleged conduct of Tucum\u00e1n and its officials are discussed in paragraphs 57-82 and 91 of the Award.\n\n24.\n\nAfter some initial discussion of the arguments of the parties regarding the so-called \"strict liability standard of attribution\" (paras. 57-61), the Tribunal declared that it would resolve the case not by answering any general question as to whether treaty provisions \"impose a strict liability standard on a central government for actions of a political subdivision,\" but rather by analysing \"the specific allegations on which the Claimants base their claims and their legal significance in light of the terms of the Concession Contract and the BIT.\"26 It then proceeded to analyse what Claimants had identified as \"four categories of \u2018acts of the Province attributable to [Respondent] that violated Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT.\u2019\"27\n\nAward, para. 62; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 440. Thus, as mentioned above *(see note* 17), the confusion inherent in the phrase \"strict liability standard of attribution\" seems to have no operative effect in the Award.\n\nAward, para. 63; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 440.\n\n25.\n\nThe first category of alleged BIT violations by Tucum\u00e1n concerned \"[a]cts that resulted in a fall in the recovery rate.\"28 These included a decision by the Ombudsman, in December 1996, which was said to have deprived CGE of \"their right to cut off service to non-paying customers,\" as well as certain decisions of a local regulatory authority, ERSACT, which were said to have \"forced a reduction in the tariff and thereby created uncertainty as to what invoices had to be paid.\" In respect of all these decisions, the Tribunal found that \"Claimants never challenged in the courts of Tucum\u00e1n any of these actions of the administrative agencies of Tucum\u00e1n relating to implementation of the Concession Contract.\"29\n\nAward, paras. 65-66; 40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 440-441.\n\nAward, para. 65; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 440.\n\n26.\n\nUnder this first category of impugned conduct, the Tribunal also considered Claimants\u2019 allegations concerning public statements by provincial legislators and others purportedly urging customers not to pay their water bills. The Tribunal remarked that those allegations concerned \"a highly disputed issue of fact, *i.e.,* whether Tucum\u00e1n authorities organized a campaign for nonpayment of invoices issued by Claimants\"; but it determined that \" [i]n any event, this non-payment issue relates to the grounds for non-payment under the Concession Contract,\" and, as with the administrative decisions discussed above, the Tribunal found that \"Claimants failed to challenge any of these acts in the Tucum\u00e1n courts.\"30\n\nAward, para. 66; 40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 440-441.\n\n27.\n\nThe second category of Tucum\u00e1n conduct allegedly in violation of Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT concerned \"[a]cts that unilaterally reduced the tariff rate.\"31 These were found to comprise essentially the same acts referred to in the first category, and the Tribunal determined that, as with the impugned conduct comprising the first category, they \"were never challenged in the Tucum\u00e1n courts.\"32\n\nAward, para. 67; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 441.\n\n*ibid.*\n\n28.\n\nWith respect to the third category of alleged Tucum\u00e1n breaches of the BIT, which concerned certain \"[a]buses of regulatory authority,\"33 the Tribunal again noted that \"CGE never challenged in the Tucum\u00e1n courts the interpretation that the Tucum\u00e1n agencies gave to the provisions of the Concession Contract bearing on this issue.\"34\n\nAward, paras. 68-69; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 441.\n\nAward, para. 68. In para. 69, the Tribunal sidestepped a factual dispute as to whether \"the ERS-ACT intervention\" was a legitimate administrative intervention or was politically motivated, to the detriment of Claimants, noting again that \"Claimants never brought any legal challenge in the courts of Tucum\u00e1n [in respect] of the ERSACT intervention on the ground that such action violated the rights of CGE under the Concession Contract.\" *See* 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 441.\n\n29.\n\nThe fourth category of alleged BIT violations by Tucum\u00e1n concerned certain \"[dealings in bad faith.\"35 A number of examples were given, including conduct by the provincial Governor designed to alter unilaterally \"the terms of the second renegotiated agreement that was submitted to the Tucum\u00e1n legislature\" in the period March-August 1997 (paras. 70-71). After briefly reviewing the factual differences between the parties on this point (para. 72), the Tribunal observed that this aspect of the dispute related solely to the parties\u2019 efforts to conclude a negotiated settlement. It stressed that, as Claimants themselves acknowledged, Tucum\u00e1n was not \"legally obligated to modify the Concession Contract\" (para. 73). After noting that Argentina itself was involved in attempts to resolve the impasse, the Tribunal held that \"on the evidence presented, the Tribunal does not find the basis for holding the Argentine Republic liable for actions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities.\"36\n\nAward, paras. 70-76; 40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 441-442.\n\nAward, para. 73; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 442. This conclusion is repeated in para. 82 of the Award: 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 444.\n\n30.\n\nThree additional allegations were made by Claimants in support of their claim of bad faith. One concerned certain fines imposed on Claimants for poor water quality allegedly discovered during water testing by Tucum\u00e1n. Argentina argued that the fines were authorised by the Concession Contract, and were in any event never collected; Claimants asserted that the fines were politically motivated and were intended to induce it to modify the Concession Contract, thus amounting to an abuse of power. For its part, the Tribunal concluded that \"[s]ince none of the fines were ever enforced against Claimants, the Tribunal cannot base a finding of bad faith dealings on this alleged action, particularly when the dispute concerning its justification appears to depend in significant part on an interpretation of the Concession Contract that the parties thereto agreed would be decided by the Tucum\u00e1n courts.\"37 Similarly, as regards the other acts of Tucum\u00e1n allegedly committed in bad faith, the Tribunal concluded that \"the parties disagree over the meaning and applicability of the pertinent provisions of the Concession Contract, as well as over the underlying facts.\"38\n\nAward, para. 74; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 442.\n\nAward, para. 75; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 442. The Tribunal also referred summarily to the posttermination conduct of the parties, specifically Claimants\u2019 allegations that they were forced to continue to provide services under the Concession Contract while the provincial authorities continued to obstruct their attempts to collect charges from their customers (para. 76). The Tribunal only summarised the arguments made by the parties in this regard.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusions, drawn from its analysis of these \"four categories\" of Tucum\u00e1n acts, are summarised in paragraphs 77-84 of the Award.\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal opens this section of its Award with the statement that \"it is apparent that all of the...actions of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n on which the Claimants rely...are closely linked to the performance or non-performance of the parties under the Concession Contract.\"39 It concludes that \"all of the issues relevant to the legal basis for these claims against Respondent arose from disputes between Claimants and Tucum\u00e1n concerning their performance and non-performance under the Concession Contract.\"40 These findings lead to the Tribunal\u2019s central conclusion:\n\n[T]he Tribunal holds that, because of the crucial connection in this case between the terms of the Concession Contract and these alleged violations of the BIT, the Argentine Republic cannot be held liable unless and until Claimants have, as Article 16.4 of the Concession Contract requires, asserted their rights in proceedings before the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n and have been denied their rights, either procedurally or substantively.41\n\nAward, para. 77; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 443.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nAward, para. 78; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 443.\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to make a number of additional findings in support of this overarching conclusion:\n\n[G]iven the nature of the dispute between Claimants and the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, it is not possible for this Tribunal to determine which actions of the Province were taken in exercise of its sovereign authority and which in the exercise of its rights as a party to the Concession Contract.... To make such determinations the Tribunal would have to undertake a detailed interpretation and application of the Concession Contract, a task left by the parties to that contract to the exclusive jurisdiction of the administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n.42\n\n\u2026\n\nThere is no allegation before the Tribunal that the courts of Tucum\u00e1n were unavailable to hear such claims or that they lacked independence or fairness in adjudicating them.43\n\n\u2026\n\nBecause the Tribunal has determined that on the facts presented the Claimants should first have challenged the actions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities in its administrative courts, any claim against the Argentine Republic could arise only if Claimants were denied access to the courts of Tucum\u00e1n to pursue their remedy under Article 16.4 or if the Claimants were treated unfairly in those courts (denial of procedural justice) or if the judgment of those courts were substantively unfair (denial of substantive justice) or otherwise denied rights guaranteed to French investors under the BIT by the Argentine Republic.44\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes that this decision does not impose an exhaustion of remedies requirement under the BIT because such requirement would be incompatible with Article 8 of the BIT and Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nIn this case, however, the obligation to resort to the local courts is compelled by the express terms of Article 16.4 of the [Concession Contract] and the impossibility, on the facts of the instant case, of separating potential breaches of contract claims from BIT violations without interpreting and applying the Concession Contract, a task that the contract assigns expressly to the local courts.45\n\nAward, para. 79; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 443.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nAward, para. 80; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 443.\n\nAward, para. 81; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 444.\n\n34.\n\nTwo further points should be noted. The first concerns Article 10 of the BIT, on which Claimants had relied to avoid the apparently preclusive effect of Article 16(4) of the Concession Contract. Article 10 provides that:\n\nInvestments which have been the subject of a specific undertaking by one Contracting Party vis-\u00e0-vis investors of the other Contracting Party shall be governed, without prejudice to the provisions of this Agreement, by the terms of this undertaking, in so far as its provisions are more favourable than those laid down by this Agreement.\n\n35.\n\nIn a footnote, the Tribunal declared:\n\nArticle 10 protects rights granted to an investor under a special agreement if such rights are more favorable to the investor than those granted under the BIT. The question here is not whether one or the other is more favorable, but whether the Tribunal is in a position, on the facts of this case, to separate the breach of contract issues from violations of the BIT, considering that the parties to the Concession Contract have agreed to an exclusive remedy in the Tucum\u00e1n courts for the determination of the disputed contractual issues which are not governed by the BIT.46\n\nAward, para. 78, note 20; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 449.\n\n36.\n\nThe second point concerns the Tribunal\u2019s explanation of why, in its view, the so-called \"fork in the road\" provision of Article 8(2) of the BIT has no application to Claimants in the circumstances of this case. Article 8(2) provides in relevant part that, \" [o]nce an investor has submitted the dispute to the courts of the Contracting Party concerned or to international arbitration, the choice of one or the other of those procedures is final.\" In the Tribunal\u2019s view, recourse by Claimants to the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n would not have precluded them from subsequently bringing claims before an ICSID tribunal in accordance with the BIT, i.e., it would not have amounted to a final \"choice of one or the other of those procedures\" within Article 8(2). The Tribunal addressed this question twice, in paragraphs 55 and 81 of the Award.\n\n37.\n\nIn paragraph 55, the Tribunal announced this conclusion with the prefatory words \"[b]y this same analysis.\" The analysis in question is found in paragraphs 53 and 54, where, after analysing the decision in the *Lanco* case, the Tribunal stated:\n\n53.... In this case the claims filed by CGE against Respondent are based on violation by the Argentine Republic of the BIT... As formulated, these claims against the Argentine Republic are not subject to the jurisdiction of the contentious administrative tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n, if only because, *ex hypothesi,* those claims are not based on the Concession Contract but allege a cause of action under the BIT.\n\n54. Thus, Article 16.4 of the Concession Contract cannot be deemed to prevent the investor from proceeding under the ICSID Convention against the Argentine Republic on a claim charging the Argentine Republic with a violation of the Argentine-French BIT.\n\n55. *By this same analysis,* a suit by Claimants against Tucum\u00e1n in the administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n for violation of the terms of the Concession Contract would not have foreclosed Claimant from subsequently seeking a remedy against the Argentine Republic as provided in the BIT and ICSID Convention...47\n\n40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 438-439 (emphasis added, footnote omitted).\n\n38.\n\nAs these passages show, the Tribunal interpreted Article 8(2) as applying only to claims of a breach of the BIT, and not to purely contractual or other claims within the jurisdiction of the administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n, even if those claims overlapped with the claims for breach of the BIT. In other words, in the view of the Tribunal, the fork in the road set out in Article 8(2) is limited in its application to claims which explicitly \"allege a cause of action under the BIT\" or which \" [charge] the Argentine Republic with a violation of the Argentine-French BIT\"; it does not apply in the circumstance of claims \"based on the Concession Contract\" or to \"a suit by Claimants...for violation of the terms of the Concession Contract.\"\n\n39.\n\nThat this is the correct interpretation of the Tribunal\u2019s ruling as to Article 8(2) is reinforced by the discussion contained in footnote 19, at paragraph 53 of the Award, where the Tribunal explicitly rejected Respondent\u2019s contention that the Tucum\u00e1n courts would have had jurisdiction over \"a claim against the Argentine Republic based on the BIT.\" It gave two reasons: first, \"the Argentine Republic could have engaged in conduct or failed to act in violation of its obligations under the BIT even if Tucum\u00e1n were not in violation of the Concession Contract\"; and second, \"the Tucum\u00e1n courts do not have jurisdiction over such a suit [against the Argentine Republic] absent consent by Respondent.\" The underlying assumption is, again, that for a claim before the Tucum\u00e1n courts to be covered by Article 8(2), it would have to be \"based on the BIT.\"\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal returned to the question in paragraph 81 of its Award:\n\nThat is why the Tribunal rejects Claimants\u2019 position that they had no obligation to pursue such local remedies against the Province or that, in the event of a denial of justice of [sic] rights under the BIT, that any such legal action in the Tucum\u00e1n courts would have waived their right to resort to arbitration against the Argentine Republic before ICSID under the BIT.48\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 444.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s stated rationale for rejecting Claimants\u2019 position is \"the impossibility, on the facts of the instant case, of separating potential breaches of contract claims from BIT violations without interpreting and applying the Concession Contract, a task that the contract assigns expressly to the local courts.\" The Tribunal appears to have considered that, because Claimants\u2019 contract and treaty claims could not be separated, a distinct claim \"based on the BIT\" was impossible in the circumstances of the case, at least prior to submission of the dispute to the provincial courts.\n\n42.\n\nThus, it seems that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the fork in the road was never reached in this case is based on an interpretation of Article 8(2) which limits its application exclusively to claims alleging a breach of the BIT, that is, to treaty claims as such.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal returned to consider the Tucum\u00e1n claims in paragraph 91 of the Award, which addresses Claimants\u2019 allegations regarding hostile and concerted \"action by officials, legislative and executive.\" In this regard, the Tribunal said:\n\nIn addition to pointing out that the legislators on whose actions the Claimants rely were opponents of the governing party in Tucum\u00e1n at the time that the disputes arose under the Concession Contract, Respondent presented a point by point refutation of the other evidence upon which Claimants rely for these allegations. After carefully reviewing the extensive memorials and testimony, the Tribunal finds that the record in these proceedings regarding these allegations does not establish a factual basis for attributing liability to the Argentine Republic under the BIT for the alleged actions of officials of Tucum\u00e1n.49\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 446.\n\nC. THE COMMITTEE\u2019S ANALYSIS\n---------------------------\n\n44.\n\nBefore proceeding to analyse the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in more detail, with a view specifically to assessing the validity of the grounds of annulment raised by the parties, it is necessary to say something about the France-Argentina BIT of 3 July 1991, and about the role of annulment panels and the scope of their powers.\n\n(1) Relevant Provisions of the France-Argentina BIT\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Agreement between the Government of the Argentine Republic and the Government of the Republic of France for Reciprocal Protection and Promotion of Investments was signed by France and Argentina at Paris on 3 July 1991 and came into force on 3 March 1993.50 It deals, *inter alia,* with the following matters relevant to the present proceeding.\n\nAbove, note 3.\n\n(a) Definition of \"Investor\" and \"Investment\"\n---------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nArticle 1(1) contains a broad definition of the term \"investment,\" which includes: \"Shares, issue premiums and other forms of participation, albeit minority or indirect, in companies constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party,\" which are invested in accordance with the law of the Contracting Party before or after the entry into force of the BIT.51\n\nBIT, Article l(1)(b).\n\n47.\n\nThe term \"investor\" is defined in Article 1(2). It is stated to apply to: (a) individuals; (b) bodies corporate having the nationality of one of the Contracting Parties, and also to (c) Any body corporate effectively controlled, directly or indirectly, by nationals of one Contracting Party, or by bodies corporate having their registered office in the territory of one Contracting Party and constituted in accordance with that Party\u2019s legislation.52\n\nBIT, Article l(2)(c).\n\n48.\n\nAt the time the Concession Contract was signed and the initial investment was made, the shareholding in CAA was divided between CGE, a Spanish company, Dragados y Construcciones Argentina S.A. (Dycasa), and an Argentine company, Benito Roggio e Hijos S.A. (Roggio), none of which had a controlling shareholding in CAA. When the letter of 5 March 1996 was written, Dycasa maintained its interest in CAA, hence the letter referred not only to the Argentine-France BIT but also to a BIT between Spain and Argentina. Subsequently, in June 1996, CGE acquired Dycasa\u2019s shareholding and thus had effective control of CAA within the meaning of Article 1 (2)(c) of the Argentine-French BIT at the time the arbitration proceedings were commenced.\n\n49.\n\nNotwithstanding these facts (on which there seems to be no dispute between the parties) the Tribunal held, in a footnote, that \"CAA should be considered a French investor from the effective date of the Concession Contract.\"53 The Respondent claims that this finding was unsupported by any reasons and was in fact contradicted by uncontested evidence before the Tribunal. According to the Respondent, CGE was not the controlling shareholder at the time when most of the alleged BIT violations occurred, and CAA was accordingly not an \"investor\" for the purposes of the BIT at that time.\n\nAward, para. 24, note 6; 40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 447-448.\n\n50.\n\nIn common with other BITs, Article 1 clearly distinguishes between foreign shareholders in local companies and those companies themselves. While the foreign shareholding is by definition an \"investment\" and its holder an \"investor,\" the local company only falls within the scope of Article 1 if it is \"effectively controlled, directly or indirectly, by nationals of one Contracting Party\" or by corporations established under its laws. In accordance with these provisions, which determine the scope of operation of the BIT, issues might well arise where there has been a transfer of control of a local company from a shareholder of one nationality to a shareholder of another. For example, if Dycasa had a Spanish treaty claim prior to March 1996, questions might arise as to how that claim could be later transferred to a French company, or as to how CGE could have acquired a French treaty claim in respect of conduct concerning an investment which it did not hold at the time the conduct occurred and which at that time did not have French nationality. At least, such questions might affect the quantum of recovery, but they might have further and even more basic legal consequences. But while it is arguable that the Tribunal failed to state any reasons for its finding that \"CAA should be considered a French investor from the effective date of the Concession Contract,\" that finding played no part in the subsequent reasoning of the Tribunal, or in its dismissal of the claim. Moreover it cannot be argued that CGE did not have an \"investment\" in CAA from the date of the conclusion of the Concession Contract, or that it was not an \"investor\" in respect of its own shareholding, whether or not it had overall control of CAA. Whatever the extent of its investment may have been, it was entitled to invoke the BIT in respect of conduct alleged to constitute a breach of Articles 3 or 5. It is also clear that CGE controlled CAA at the time the proceedings were commenced, so that there was no question that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over CAA as one of Claimants in the arbitration. In the circumstances, and for the purposes of the present proceedings, the Committee does not need to reach any conclusion on the precise extent of CAA\u2019s and CGE\u2019s treaty rights at different times.\n\n(b) Local Remedies and Their Relation to Arbitration under the BIT\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe role and effect, if any, of local remedies available to the investor under the France-Argentina BIT are addressed in Article 8 of the BIT, which is central to this case, and in certain articles of the ICSID Convention, especially Article 26.\n\n52.\n\nIn accordance with Article 26 of the Convention, consent to ICSID arbitration involves consent \"to the exclusion of any other remedy.\" A Contracting State may qualify its consent by requiring, as a pre-condition to arbitration, \"the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies.\" Argentina did not impose such a pre-condition when it agreed to Article 8 of the BIT. Accordingly it is common ground (and the Tribunal so held) that the exhaustion of local remedies rule does not apply to claims under the BIT.\n\n53.\n\nArticle 8 of the BIT expressly gives investors a choice of forum. Article 8 provides in full as follows:\n\n1. Any dispute relating to investments made under this Agreement between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the two parties concerned.\n\n2. If any such dispute cannot be so settled within six months of the time when a claim is made by one of the parties to the dispute, the dispute shall, at the request of the investor, be submitted:\n\n\u2022 Either to the domestic courts of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute;\n\n\u2022 Or to international arbitration under the conditions described in paragraph 3 below.\n\nOnce an investor has submitted the dispute to the courts of the Contracting Party concerned or to international arbitration, the choice of one or the other of these procedures is final.\n\n3. Where recourse is had to international arbitration, the investor may choose to bring the dispute before one of the following arbitration bodies:\n\n\u2022 The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and National of other States opened for signature in Washington on March 18, 1965, if both States Parties to this Agreement have already acceded to the Convention.\n\nUntil such time as this requirement is met, the two Contracting Parties shall agree to submit the dispute to arbitration, in accordance with the rules of procedure of the Additional Facility of ICSID;\n\n\u2022 An *ad hoc* arbitral tribunal established in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\n4. The ruling of the arbitral body shall be based on the provisions of this Agreement, the legislation of the Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute, including rules governing conflict of laws, the terms of any private agreements concluded on the subject of the investment, and the relevant principles of international law.\n\n5. Arbitral decisions shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute. [Footnote omitted.]\n\n54.\n\nTwo initial points may be made about these provisions. First, it is evident that the term \"national jurisdictions\" as used in Article 8(2) (\"juridictions nationales\"/\"jurisdiciones nacionales\" in the authentic French and Spanish texts; \"domestic courts\" in the UNTS English translation) refers to all the courts and tribunals of the Contracting Parties, and not just to those at the federal level. In a treaty between a unitary and a federal state, such as France and Argentina respectively, one would not expect any disparity in the application of a phrase such as \"national jurisdictions\": all French courts and tribunals are national, as are, for the purposes of the BIT, all courts and tribunals of Argentina. The relevant distinction, as Article 8(2) makes clear, is between \"national\" and \"international\" tribunals, not between \"national\" and \"provincial\" courts. Thus, there is no disparity between the phrases \"national jurisdictions *[i.e.,* courts]\" and \"jurisdictions [courts] of the Contracting Party\" as used in the two paragraphs of Article 8(2). In consequence, the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n are to be considered as national courts falling within the scope of Article 8 (2).54\n\nAlthough counsel for the Respondent contended otherwise before the Committee, the issue does not appear to have been the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on Article 8(2). See above, paras. 35-41, where the Committee summarises its understanding of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on this point.\n\n55.\n\nSecondly, Article 8 deals generally with disputes \"relating to investments made under this Agreement between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party.\" It is those disputes which may be submitted, at the investor\u2019s option, either to national or international adjudication. Article 8 does not use a narrower formulation, requiring that the investor\u2019s claim allege a breach of the BIT itself. Read literally, the requirements for arbitral jurisdiction in Article 8 do not necessitate that the Claimant allege a breach of the BIT itself: it is sufficient that the dispute relate to an investment made under the BIT. This may be contrasted, for example, with Article 11 of the BIT, which refers to disputes \"concerning the interpretation or application of this Agreement,\" or with Article 1116 of the NAFTA, which provides that an investor may submit to arbitration under Chapter 11 \"a claim that another Party has breached an obligation under\" specified provisions of that Chapter. Consequently, if a claim brought before a national court concerns a \"dispute relating to investments made under this Agreement\" within the meaning of Article 8(1), then Article 8(2) will apply.55 In the Committee\u2019s view, a claim by CAA against the Province of Tucum\u00e1n for breach of the Concession Contract, brought before the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n, would *prima facie* fall within Article 8(2) and constitute a \"final\" choice of forum and jurisdiction, if that claim was coextensive with a dispute relating to investments made under the BIT.\n\nCf. *Waste Management, Inc. v. Mexico (No. 1),* 40 ILM 56 (2001) at p. 68 (para. 28).\n\n(c) Scope and Application of Substantive Provisions of the BIT\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nClaimants\u2019 case before the Tribunal was based on Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT, which deal, respectively, with \"fair and equitable treatment according to the principles of international law\" and with \"measures of expropriation...or any other equivalent measure.\"\n\n57.\n\nArticle 3 provides that:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall undertake to accord in its territory and maritime zone just and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law, to the investments of investors of the other Party and to ensure that the exercise of the right so granted is not impeded either *de jure* or *de facto.*\n\n58.\n\nArticle 5 provides that:\n\n1. Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party shall be fully and completely protected and safeguarded in the territory and maritime zone of the other Contracting Party, in accordance with the principle of just and equitable treatment mentioned in article 3 of this Agreement.\n\n2. The Contracting Parties shall not take, directly or indirectly, any expropriation or nationalization measures or any other equivalent measures having a similar effect of dispossession, except for reasons of public necessity and on condition that the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a specific undertaking.\n\nAny such dispossession measures taken shall give rise to the payment of prompt and adequate compensation the amount of which, calculated in accordance with the real value of the investments in question, shall be assessed on the basis of a normal economic situation prior to any threat of dispossession.\n\nThe amount and methods of payment of such compensation shall be determined not later than the date of dispossession. The compensation shall be readily convertible, paid without delay and freely transferable. It shall yield, up to the date of payment, interest calculated at the appropriate rate.\n\n3. Investors of either Contracting Party whose investments have suffered losses as a result of war or any other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency or uprising in the territory or maritime zone of the other Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Party treatment which is no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of the most-favoured nation.\n\n59.\n\nBoth these Articles refer to an international law standard, expressly or by clear implication. The protection afforded under both Articles is extended to \"investments made by investors.\"\n\n60.\n\nAgain it is evident that a particular investment dispute may at the same time involve issues of the interpretation and application of the BIT\u2019s standards and questions of contract. Article 8(4), by expressly empowering the Tribunal to base its ruling on the provisions of the BIT as well as on the terms of any private agreements concluded on the subject of the investment, clearly acknowledges that possibility. So too does Article 8(2), which contemplates that the very same dispute may be submitted either to the domestic courts of the Contracting Party (to be determined in accordance with the domestic law of that State), or to international arbitration (to be determined in accordance with the applicable law identified in Article 8(4)).\n\n(2) The Role of Annulment Under the ICSID Convention\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nIt is against this background that the Committee has to consider the grounds for annulment relied on before it. Before doing so, however, some brief remarks on the role of annulment in the ICSID system are necessary.\n\n62.\n\nAlthough the issue of the proper role of an annulment committee in the ICSID system must necessarily inform the analysis and the conclusions of this Committee, relatively little needs to be said about the issue for the reason that there seems to be little disagreement between the parties. Claimants and Respondent agree that an *ad hoc* Committee is not a court of appeal and that its competence extends only to annulment based on one or other of the grounds expressly set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. It also appears to be established that there is no presumption either in favour of or against annulment,56 a point acknowledged by Claimants as well as Respondent.\n\nCf. *MINE v. Guinea,* Decision on Annulment of 22 December 1989, (1989) 4 ICSID Rep. 79 at p. 86 (paras. 4.09-4.12); and *see also* C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2001) (hereafter \"Schreuer\"), at pp. 902-3.\n\n63.\n\nNo doubt the Committee must take great care to ensure that the reasoning of an arbitral tribunal is clearly understood, and must guard against the annulment of awards for trivial cause. But where a tribunal has \"manifestly exceeded its powers\" or has committed \"a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\"\u2014both grounds for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and both relied on by Claimants in this proceeding\u2014the matter is by definition not trivial.\n\n64.\n\nA greater source of concern is perhaps the ground of \"failure to state reasons,\" which is not qualified by any such phrase as \"manifestly\" or \"serious.\" However, it is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state *any* reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons.57 It bears reiterating that an *ad hoc* committee is not a court of appeal. Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.\n\n*See* Schreuer, pp. 984-1008.\n\n65.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an *ad hoc* committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal\u2019s reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.\n\n66.\n\nFinally, it appears to be established that an *ad hoc* committee has a certain measure of discretion as to whether to annul an award, even if an annullable error is found. Article 52(3) provides that a committee \"shall have the authority to annul the award or any part thereof,\" and this has been interpreted as giving committees some flexibility in determining whether annulment is appropriate in the circumstances.58 Among other things, it is necessary for an *ad hoc* committee to consider the significance of the error relative to the legal rights of the parties. This question, as it applies in the circumstances of the present case, is addressed below.\n\nSee Schreuer, pp. 1018-1023, with references to the authorities, especially *MINE* at paras. 4.09-4.10.\n\n67.\n\nAnother question, which was debated between the parties in this case, is whether an *ad hoc* committee is limited to the grounds for annulment relied on by a Claimant, or whether the Respondent may itself raise additional grounds for annulment. In their Application, Claimants sought only the partial annulment of the Award, on three grounds: (1) that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers; (2) that there had been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and (3) that the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based.59 The Respondent not only resisted each of these contentions, it further argued that if any of them were to be upheld, the Award *as a whole* should be annulled, on the grounds either that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction at all, or that there was a fundamental contradiction in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning as between that part which dealt with jurisdiction and that part which dealt with the merits. By way of reply, in their written pleadings, Claimants argued that what they called Respondent\u2019s \"counterclaim\" for annulment of the Award as a whole was inadmissible, on the ground that it was out of time and that Article 52 made no provision for counterclaims.\n\nApplication, para. 3; *see also* para. 2 of the present decision.\n\n68.\n\nThe Committee agrees with Claimants that a counterclaim for annulment, that is, a claim which is not raised by the party concerned as a separate request in accordance with Article 52(1) of the Convention, is inadmissible. But it does not follow that a party, such as Respondent in the present case, may not present its own arguments on questions of annulment, provided that those arguments concern specific matters pleaded by the party requesting annulment, in this case the Claimants. In the opinion of the Committee, a party to annulment proceedings which successfully pleads and sustains a ground for annulment set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention cannot limit the extent to which an *ad hoc* committee may decide to annul the impugned award as a consequence. Certain grounds of annulment will affect the award as a whole\u2014for example, where it is demonstrated that the tribunal which rendered the award was not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a)). Others may only affect part of the award. An *ad hoc* committee is expressly authorised by the Convention to annul an award \"in whole or in part\" (Article 52(3)).\n\n69.\n\nThus where a ground for annulment is established, it is for the *ad hoc* committee, and not the requesting party, to determine the extent of the annulment. In making this determination, the committee is not bound by the applicant\u2019s characterisation of its request, whether in the original application or otherwise, as requiring either complete or partial annulment of the award. This is reflected in the difference in language between Articles 52(1) and 52(3), and it is further supported by the *travaux* of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, Claimants in the present case eventually accepted this view.\n\n70.\n\nIn seeking in the alternative the annulment of the jurisdictional portion of the Award, the Respondent was not making a late annulment application by way of a counterclaim\u2014a procedure which, as Claimants correctly asserted, is not contemplated by Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. Rather it was arguing that if Claimants\u2019 position on the merits were to be upheld, either under Article 52(1)(b) or 52(1)(e), the effect must necessarily be to bring down the whole Award. That position was entirely open to the Respondent. It in no way entailed what would have been an inadmissible counterclaim for annulment on new grounds.\n\n(3) The Grounds of Annulment\n----------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Committee accordingly turns to the grounds for annulment themselves. Since, as explained above, the grounds validly pleaded by the Respondent extend to the Tribunal\u2019s holding on jurisdiction, it is appropriate to consider first the issue of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n(a) The Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdictional Finding\n-----------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Committee has already summarised the grounds on which the Tribunal upheld its jurisdiction. The Tribunal gave extensive reasons for doing so, and these reasons are not in themselves contradictory.60 It is true that Respondent argued, in the alternative, that there was a contradiction between those reasons and the reasons given by the Tribunal concerning the merits. But Argentina also argued that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction in any event. If this is right, it was a manifest excess of power for the Tribunal to proceed to consider the merits, and the whole Award must be annulled. Accordingly, the question of failure to give reasons, including possibly contradictory reasons, does not arise so far as the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional finding is concerned.\n\nWith the possible exception of the matter concerning Dycasa\u2019s shares, referred to above, para. 48.\n\n73.\n\nFor its part, however, the Committee has no difficulty accepting each of the four propositions, summarised in paragraph 14 above, on the basis of which the Tribunal held that it had jurisdiction and that its jurisdiction extended to the Tucum\u00e1n claims.\n\n74.\n\nIn particular, the Committee agrees with the Tribunal in characterising the present dispute as one \"relating to investments made under this Agreement\" within the meaning of Article 8 of the BIT. Even if it were necessary in order to attract the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction that the dispute be characterised not merely as one relating to an investment but as one concerning the treatment of an investment in accordance with the standards laid down under the BIT, it is the case (as the Tribunal noted) that Claimants invoke substantive provisions of the BIT.\n\n75.\n\nThe Committee likewise agrees that the fact that the investment concerns a Concession Contract made with Tucum\u00e1n, a province of Argentina which has not been separately designated to ICSID under Article 25(1), does not mean that the dispute falls outside the scope of the BIT, or that the investment ceases to be one \"between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party\" within the meaning of Article 8(1) of the BIT.\n\n76.\n\nThis being so, the fact that the Concession Contract referred contractual disputes to the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n did not affect the jurisdiction of the Tribunal with respect to a claim based on the provisions of the BIT. Article 16(4) of the Concession Contract did not in terms purport to exclude the jurisdiction of an international tribunal arising under Article 8(2) of the BIT; at the very least, a clear indication of an intention to exclude that jurisdiction would be required.\n\n77.\n\nThe *Lanco* decision, cited by the Tribunal, supports its finding of jurisdiction.61 In that case the contract at issue, which involved an agency of the federal government of Argentina, contained an exclusive jurisdiction clause referring contractual disputes to a federal contentious administrative tribunal. The *Lanco* Tribunal held:\n\n[T]he stipulation of Article 12 of the Concession Agreement, according to which the parties shall submit to the jurisdiction of the Federal Contentious-Administrative Tribunals of the City of Buenos Aires, cannot be considered a previously agreed dispute-settlement procedure. The Parties could have foreseen submission to domestic or international arbitration, but the choice of a national forum could only lead to the jurisdiction of the contentious-administrative tribunals, since administrative jurisdiction cannot be selected by mutual agreement.62\n\n40 ILM 457 (2001), cited by the Tribunal in its Award, para. 53.\n\n40 ILM 457 (2001), p. 466 (\u00a7 26).\n\n78.\n\nBut in any event the *Lanco* Tribunal denied that an exclusive jurisdiction clause could exclude ICSID jurisdiction, relying in particular on Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. It said:\n\n\u00a739 A State may require the exhaustion of domestic remedies as a prior condition for its consent to ICSID arbitration. This demand may be made (i) in a bilateral investment treaty that offers submission to ICSID arbitration, (ii) in domestic legislation, or (iii) in a direct investment agreement that contains an ICSID clause. The ARGENTINA-U.S. Treaty does not provide at any point for the exhaustion of domestic remedies, and the Argentine Republic, for its part, has not alleged that there is any such domestic legislation. The only requirement that the ARGENTINA-U.S. Treaty does provide for is the period of six months that is required for turning to ICSID arbitration.\n\n\u00a740 In our case, the Parties have given their consent to ICSID arbitration, consent that is valid, there thus being a presumption in favor of ICSID arbitration, without having first to exhaust domestic remedies. In effect, once valid consent to ICSID arbitration is established, any other forum called on to decide the issue should decline jurisdiction. The investor\u2019s consent, which comes from its written consent by letter of September 17, 1997, and its request for arbitration of October 1, 1997, and the consent of the State which comes directly from the ARGENTINA-U.S. Treaty, which gives the investor the choice of forum for settling its disputes, indicate that there is no stipulation contrary to the consent of the parties... In effect, the offer made by the Argentine Republic to covered investors under the ARGENTINA-U.S. Treaty cannot be diminished by the submission to Argentina\u2019s domestic courts, to which the Concession Agreement remits.63\n\n*Ibid,* \u00a7\u00a7 39-40\n\n79.\n\nIndeed, **Lanco** was a stronger case on the facts than the present, as regards the effect of an exclusive jurisdiction clause, since the foreign claimant in **Lanco** was actually a party to the exclusive jurisdiction clause at issue, unlike CGE here.64\n\nSee also *Salini Costruttori SpA* v. *Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID, jurisdictional decision, 23 July 2001, reported in 129 *Journal de droit international 196* (2002), with note by Gaillard, *ibid.,* p. 209. This was a construction dispute focusing on the amount payable under a contract with a local jurisdiction clause. The Tribunal held that provisions in the BIT concerning measures of expropriation or nationalization \"ne saurait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e dans le sens d\u2019une exclusion de tout grief d\u2019origine contractuelle du champ de l\u2019application de cet article\" (p. 209, para. 59), and further that, notwithstanding the local jurisdiction clause, \"le Tribunal arbitral demeure comp\u00e9tent pour les violations du contrat qui constituerait en m\u00eame temps, \u00e0 la charge de l\u2019Etat une violation de l\u2019Accord bilat\u00e9ral\" (p. 209, para. 62).\n\n80.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Respondent\u2019s request that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional finding be annulled must be rejected.\n\n(b) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings on the Merits\n-----------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nClaimants relied on three grounds set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention as supporting its request for partial annulment. The Committee will deal with these in turn.\n\n*(i) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure: Article 52(l)(d)*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe first of these grounds concerns the claim that \"there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" (Article 52(1)(d)). Claimants argued that the Tribunal had departed from a fundamental rule of procedure in that its eventual decision, notably as to the dismissal of the Tucum\u00e1n claims on grounds related to Article 16(4) of the Concession Contract, concerned a question not adequately canvassed in argument.\n\n83.\n\nThe Committee cannot find in the record of the arbitration, including the Award, any basis for Claimants\u2019 allegations in this regard. Under Article 52(1)(d), the emphasis is clearly on the term \"rule of procedure,\" that is, on the manner in which the Tribunal proceeded, not on the content of its decision. In the opinion of the Committee, the Tribunal proceeded with abundant care. It considered the issue of jurisdiction first, and it decided, in the exercise of its discretion, to join that issue to the merits of the dispute. It then considered the merits at length and rendered a densely reasoned award.\n\n84.\n\nClaimants contend the Tribunal\u2019s decision came unannounced, and that they had no opportunity to present arguments on the decision to dismiss their claim on the merits on grounds related to Article 16(4) of the Concession Contract. It may be true that the particular approach adopted by the Tribunal in attempting to reconcile the various conflicting elements of the case before it came as a surprise to the parties, or at least to some of them. But even if true, this would by no means be unprecedented in judicial decision-making, either international or domestic, and it has nothing to do with the ground for annulment contemplated by Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. In fact, the Tribunal had already determined that the questions of jurisdiction and merits were closely linked, and it had joined the two. Moreover, in its questioning and especially its request for post-hearing briefs, the Tribunal clearly indicated that it had concerns as to how to reconcile Article 8 of the BIT and Clause 16(4) of the Concession Contract.\n\n85.\n\nFrom the record, it is evident that the parties had a full and fair opportunity to be heard at every stage of the proceedings. They had ample opportunity to consider and present written and oral submissions on the issues, and the oral hearing itself was meticulously conducted to enable each party to present its point of view. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis of issues was clearly based on the materials presented by the parties and was in no sense *ultra petita.* For these reasons, the Committee finds no departure at all from any fundamental rule of procedure, let alone a serious departure.\n\n*(ii) Manifest excess of powers: Article 52(1)(b)*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nIt is settled, and neither party disputes, that an ICSID tribunal commits an excess of powers not only if it exercises a jurisdiction which it does not have under the relevant agreement or treaty and the ICSID Convention, read together, but also if it fails to exercise a jurisdiction which it possesses under those instruments.65 One might qualify this by saying that it is only where the failure to exercise a jurisdiction is clearly capable of making a difference to the result that it can be considered a manifest excess of power. Subject to that qualification, however, the failure by a tribunal to exercise a jurisdiction given it by the ICSID Convention and a BIT, in circumstances where the outcome of the inquiry is affected as a result, amounts in the Committee\u2019s view to a manifest excess of powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b).\n\nSchreuer, pp. 937-938.\n\n87.\n\nNo doubt an ICSID tribunal is not required to address in its award every argument made by the parties, provided of course that the arguments which it actually does consider are themselves capable of leading to the conclusion reached by the tribunal and that all questions submitted to a tribunal are expressly or implicitly dealt with. In the present case, Claimants contend that, far from considering their claims concerning breach of the BIT prior to purportedly dismissing them, the Tribunal actually declined to decide Claimants\u2019 allegations since it considered that, in order to do so, it would have had to address issues which, according to the Concession Contract, fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tucum\u00e1n courts. Claimants argue that if the Tribunal was wrong as regards this approach\u2014that is, if the Tribunal erred in finding that it could not consider the BIT claims, in the circumstances\u2014it failed to exercise its treaty jurisdiction, a jurisdiction which it had itself upheld. On that assumption, its failure to do so could also be said to be manifest.\n\n88.\n\nWith these preliminary comments in mind, the Committee turns to the substance of Claimants\u2019 request for partial annulment of the Award on the ground of manifest excess of powers. In doing so, it is necessary to distinguish between the Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the federal claims and the Tucum\u00e1n claims.\n\n*The federal claims*\n--------------------\n\n89.\n\nAn initial point concerns Claimants\u2019 argument that there was a breach of the BIT by reason of the actions and omissions of ministers and officers of the federal government of the Argentine Republic\u2014the so-called \"federal claims.\" As the review of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning set out at paragraphs 18-22 above demonstrates, the Award clearly evidences a certain reliance on Article 16(4) of the Concession Contract even as to the federal claims; and the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the obligations incumbent on the federal authorities under the BIT emerges more by implication from its treatment of the facts than as a result of any detailed analysis. However, in the opinion of the Committee, it is nonetheless clear that the Tribunal carefully considered the federal claims on the facts, and that it rejected those claims. The Tribunal committed no excess of power, manifest or other, so far as the federal claims are concerned.\n\n90.\n\nClaimants submit that, even if the Tribunal could be said to have considered the federal claims on their merits, its consideration was vitiated in that the Tribunal\u2019s handling of the federal and Tucum\u00e1n claims was interdependent. Specifically, Claimants argue that if Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s actions did in truth constitute a breach of the BIT, then Respondent was under a far more stringent obligation to respond and to correct the situation than the Tribunal found applied to it. Claimants contend that the Tribunal\u2014always with its mind set on Article 16(4)\u2014failed to consider this alternative. In the opinion of the Committee, it is true, as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, that Article 16(4) did obtrude into the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the federal claims to some degree. However, the Tribunal did not suggest that Claimants were in any sense obliged to pursue their federal claims in any domestic court or tribunal. It held, rather, that the federal authorities could reasonably have regarded the dispute as contractual in character,66 and that the extent of any federal obligation to react could reasonably have been influenced by this perception.\n\nAward, para. 87; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 445.\n\n91.\n\nAs to the Tribunal\u2019s findings of fact, there is no basis under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention for this Committee to disagree. The Tribunal found that the Argentine federal authorities responded to Claimants\u2019 initiatives, that they sought to resolve the problem and in fact took reasonable steps to do so, that they did not fail to do anything requested of them and that they were never themselves charged, directly, with any breach of the BIT. As to the Tribunal\u2019s findings of law, it may be that the Award lacks a detailed analysis of the relevant BIT provisions, as Claimants contend. Yet the gist of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is clear enough. On its face, Article 3 of the BIT imposes no more than an obligation on the Argentine Republic to take appropriate care. And the Tribunal\u2019s findings, taken together, are more than sufficient to provide a basis for the Tribunal\u2019s clear conclusion that the federal claims were not sustainable, and that there had been no breach of Article 3 as a result of any federal act or omission. Moreover the Committee does not consider that the Tribunal\u2019s dismissal of Claimants\u2019 federal claims was so intimately linked to its decision regarding the Tucum\u00e1n claims, and to its alleged failure to exercise its jurisdiction with respect to the latter, that the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the federal claims must fall in the event that its decision on the Tucum\u00e1n claims is annulled.\n\n92.\n\nFor these reasons, Claimants\u2019 request for partial annulment of the Award in relation to the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the federal claims is rejected.\n\n*The Tucum\u00e1n claims*\n--------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe second question in relation to Article 52(1)(b) is whether the Tribunal, having validly held that it had jurisdiction over the Tucum\u00e1n claims, was entitled nonetheless to dismiss them as it did. Claimants, for their part, submit that the Tribunal did not so much dismiss the Tucum\u00e1n claims as decline to address them. They argue that the only reason those claims were dismissed was that they were held to be substantially identical with claims against Tucum\u00e1n under the Concession Contract, which the Tribunal found it could not determine, and that the Tribunal\u2019s refusal to decide the Tucum\u00e1n claims on this basis was a manifest excess of powers. The Respondent argues that, assuming the Tribunal had jurisdiction over these claims, it acted correctly in dismissing them on the basis of Article 16(4) of the Concession Contract, but that in any event this was not the only reason for dismissal since the Tribunal did consider the Tucum\u00e1n claims on their merits.\n\n94.\n\nIn dealing with these issues, it is necessary first to consider the relationship between the responsibility of Argentina under the BIT and the rights and obligations of the parties to the Concession Contract (especially those arising from Article 16(4), the exclusive jurisdiction clause); and secondly, to consider precisely what the Tribunal decided with respect to the Tucum\u00e1n claims.\n\n95.\n\nAs to the relation between breach of contract and breach of treaty in the present case, it must be stressed that Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT do not relate directly to breach of a municipal contract. Rather they set an independent standard. A state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and *vice versa,* and this is certainly true of these provisions of the BIT. The point is made clear in Article 3 of the ILC Articles, which is entitled \"Characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful\":\n\nThe characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.\n\n96.\n\nIn accordance with this general principle (which is undoubtedly declaratory of general international law), whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law\u2014in the case of the BIT, by international law; in the case of the Concession Contract, by the proper law of the contract, in other words, the law of Tucum\u00e1n. For example, in the case of a claim based on a treaty, international law rules of attribution apply, with the result that the state of Argentina is internationally responsible for the acts of its provincial authorities.67 By contrast, the state of Argentina is not liable for the performance of contracts entered into by Tucum\u00e1n, which possesses separate legal personality under its own law and is responsible for the performance of its own contracts.\n\n*See* above, paras. 16, 23-33, 43.\n\n97.\n\nThe distinction between the role of international and municipal law in matters of international responsibility is stressed in the commentary to Article 3 of the ILC Articles, which reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n(4) The International Court has often referred to and applied the principle. For example in the *Reparation for Injuries* case, it noted that \"[a]s the claim is based on the breach of an international obligation on the part of the Member held responsible... the Member cannot contend that this obligation is governed by municipal law.\" In the *ELSI* case, a Chamber of the Court emphasized this rule, stating that:\n\n\u2018Compliance with municipal law and compliance with the provisions of a treaty are different questions. What is a breach of treaty may be lawful in the municipal law and what is unlawful in the municipal law may be wholly innocent of violation of a treaty provision. Even had the Prefect held the requisition to be entirely justified in Italian law, this would not exclude the possibility that it was a violation of the FCN Treaty.\u2019\n\nConversely, as the Chamber explained:\n\n\u2018...the fact that an act of a public authority may have been unlawful in municipal law does not necessarily mean that that act was unlawful in international law, as a breach of treaty or otherwise. A finding of the local courts that an act was unlawful may well be relevant to an argument that it was also arbitrary; but by itself, and without more, unlawfulness cannot be said to amount to arbitrariness... Nor does it follow from a finding by a municipal court that an act was unjustified, or unreasonable, or arbitrary, that that act is necessarily to be classed as arbitrary in international law, though the qualification given to the impugned act by a municipal authority may be a valuable indication.\u2019\n\n(7) The rule that the characterization of conduct as unlawful in international law cannot be affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful in internal law makes no exception for cases where rules of international law require a State to conform to the provisions of its internal law, for instance by applying to aliens the same legal treatment as to nationals. It is true that in such a case, compliance with internal law is relevant to the question of international responsibility. But this is because the rule of international law makes it relevant, e.g. by incorporating the standard of compliance with internal law as the applicable international standard or as an aspect of it. Especially in the fields of injury to aliens and their property and of human rights, the content and application of internal law will often be relevant to the question of international responsibility. In every case it will be seen on analysis that either the provisions of internal law are relevant as facts in applying the applicable international standard, or else that they are actually incorporated in some form, conditionally or unconditionally, into that standard.68\n\nCommentary to Article 3, paras. (4), (7) (footnotes omitted). The passages from the *ELSI* case, quoted in para. (4) of the commentary, are to be found at ICJ Reports 1989 at p. 51, para. 73, and p. 74, para. 124.\n\n98.\n\nIn a case where the essential basis of a claim brought before an international tribunal is a breach of contract, the tribunal will give effect to any valid choice of forum clause in the contract.69 For example in the *Woodruff* case,70 a decision of an American-Venezuelan Mixed Commission in 1903, a claim was brought for breach of a contract which contained the following clause:\n\nDoubts and controversies which at any time might occur in virtue of the present agreement shall be decided by the common laws and ordinary tribunals of Venezuela, and they shall never be, as well as neither the decision which shall be pronounced upon them, nor anything relating to the agreement, the subject of international reclamation.\n\nThat is, unless the treaty in question otherwise provides. *See, e.g.,* Article 11(1) of the Claims Settlement Declaration of 19 January 1981, 1 *Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal Reports* p. 9, which overrode exclusive jurisdiction clauses concerning United States courts but not Iranian courts: see the cases cited by C.N. Brower & J.D. Brueschke, *The Iran-United. States Claims Tribunal.* (The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, 1998) pp. 60-72. The Committee does not need to consider whether the effect of Article 8 of the BIT is to override exclusive jurisdiction clauses in contracts underlying investments to which the BIT applies.\n\n*Reports of International. Arbitral. Awards,* vol. IX, p. 213.\n\n99.\n\nThe Commission in that case held that Woodruff was bound by this clause not to refer his contractual claim to any other tribunal. At the same time, the exclusive jurisdiction clause did not and could not preclude a claim by his government in the event that the treatment accorded him amounted to a breach of international law:\n\n[W]hereas certainly a contract between a sovereign and a citizen of a foreign country can never impede the right of the Government of that citizen to make international reclamation, wherever according to international law it has the right or even the duty to do so, as its rights and obligations can not be affected by any precedent agreement to which it is not a party;\n\nBut whereas this does not interfere with the right of a citizen to pledge to any other party that he, the contractor, in disputes upon certain matters will never appeal to other judges than to those designated by the agreement, nor with his obligation to keep this promise when pledged, leaving untouched the rights of his Government, to make his case an object of international claim whenever it thinks proper to do so and not impeaching his own right to look to his Government for protection of his rights in case of denial or unjust delay of justice by the contractually designated judges;...71\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 222.\n\n100.\n\nThe Commission accordingly dismissed the claim \"without prejudice on its merits, when presented to the proper judges,\" on the ground that \"by the very agreement that is the fundamental basis of the claim, it was withdrawn from the jurisdiction of this Commission.\"72\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 223.\n\n101.\n\nOn the other hand, where \"the fundamental basis of the claim\" is a treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, the existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract between the claimant and the respondent state or one of its subdivisions cannot operate as a bar to the application of the treaty standard.73 At most, it might be relevant\u2014as municipal law will often be relevant\u2014in assessing whether there has been a breach of the treaty.\n\nIt is not necessary for the Committee to pronounce on the content of the standard laid down in the BIT, in particular Article 3. It may be that \"mere\" breaches of contract, unaccompanied by bad faith or other aggravating circumstances, will rarely amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard set out in Article 3. The Tribunal did not, however, offer any interpretation of Article 3, nor seek to base itself on this consideration.\n\n102.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, it is not open to an ICSID tribunal having jurisdiction under a BIT in respect of a claim based upon a substantive provision of that BIT, to dismiss the claim on the ground that it could or should have been dealt with by a national court. In such a case, the inquiry which the ICSID tribunal is required to undertake is one governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law. Such an inquiry is neither in principle determined, nor precluded, by any issue of municipal law, including any municipal law agreement of the parties.\n\n103.\n\nMoreover the Committee does not understand how, if there had been a breach of the BIT in the present case (a question of international law), the existence of Article 16(4) of the Concession Contract could have prevented its characterisation as such. A state cannot rely on an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract to avoid the characterisation of its conduct as internationally unlawful under a treaty.\n\n104.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, even if the Tribunal had jurisdiction, and even if it could not decline to exercise that jurisdiction by reference to the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the Concession Contract, this was not what the Tribunal did. According to the Respondent, it emerges clearly from the Award that the Claimants had no arguable case for a breach of Articles 3 or 5 of the BIT and that, at best, their claim was one for breach of contract: the issue of a treaty claim could only arise in the event that the contentious administrative tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n denied Claimants justice, substantively or procedurally.\n\n105.\n\nThe question thus becomes how to characterize the Tribunal\u2019s decision. In considering that question, the Committee does not believe that it is material either that CGE was not a party to the Concession Contract or that the parties to the Concession Contract were CAA and the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, as opposed to CAA and the federal government. If the Tribunal was right in saying that it could not consider any allegation of breach of treaty which required it to interpret or apply the Concession Contract, then it is arguable that CGE could be in no better position than CAA. It is also arguable that this conclusion should apply even though CAA\u2019s contractual commitment was to a province, since the acts of that province form the nub of the claim. But it is one thing to exercise contractual jurisdiction (arguably exclusively vested in the administrative tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n by virtue of the Concession Contract) and another to take into account the terms of a contract in determining whether there has been a breach of a distinct standard of international law, such as that reflected in Article 3 of the BIT.\n\n106.\n\nClaimants made a series of allegations as to the conduct of Tucum\u00e1n, much of which, they claim, involved measures taken in bad faith. Such action included alleged instances of: acts of the Ombudsman and other regulatory authorities; incitement of consumers, by legislators and others, not to pay their water bills; unauthorized tariff changes; the incorrect imposition of fines (never in fact collected) for allegedly deficient water quality; incorrect invoicing for municipal and provincial water taxes; conduct relating to the \"black water\" problem, which was blamed on CAA, but which CAA denied was its fault; unilateral changes by the provincial Governor to the second renegotiated agreement; and various post-termination conduct. This conduct, they contend, amounted on the whole to concerted action by the Tucum\u00e1n authorities to frustrate the concession.\n\n107.\n\nThe Tribunal expressed views on some of these allegations, but by no means all. For example, in paragraph 82 of the Award, the Tribunal took the view that the unilateral changes to the renegotiated agreement did not amount to a breach of the BIT because there was no legal duty to revise the concession contract.74 In paragraph 91, under the general heading \"Failure of the Argentine Republic to Respond to Actions of Tucum\u00e1n Officials,\" the Tribunal concluded that \"the record...does not establish a factual basis for attributing liability to the Argentine Republic under the BIT for the alleged actions of officials of Tucum\u00e1n.\"75 In its context the latter passage is not unequivocal; it suggests that the Tribunal had in mind earlier discussion of the \"strict liability standard of attribution,\" and the reference to \"alleged action\" is troublesome: it is in the end unclear whether the Tribunal rejected the Claimants allegations of fact or whether they held that the allegations, though potentially made out, were not sufficient to \"attribute liability\" to the federal government.\n\nAward, para. 82; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 444.\n\nAward, para. 91; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 446.\n\n108.\n\nBut however this may be, it is clear from the core discussion of the Tucum\u00e1n claims, at paragraphs 77-81 of the Award, that the Tribunal declined to decide key aspects of the Claimants\u2019 BIT claims on the ground that they involved issues of contractual performance or non-performance. The Tribunal itself characterised these passages, in paragraph 81, as embodying its \"decision\" with respect to the Tucum\u00e1n claims.\n\n109.\n\nA key passage in this regard is found in paragraph 79, where the Tribunal said:\n\n[G]iven the nature of the dispute between Claimants and the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, it is not possible for this Tribunal to determine which actions of the Province were taken in exercise of its sovereign authority and which in the exercise of its rights as a party to the Concession Contract considering, in particular, that much of the evidence presented in this case has involved detailed issues of performance and rates under the Concession Contract.76\n\nAward, para. 79; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 443.\n\n110.\n\nThis passage calls for two remarks. First, it is couched in terms not of decision but of the *impossibility* of decision, the impossibility being founded on the need to interpret and apply the Concession Contract.77 Yet under Article 8(4) of the BIT the Tribunal had jurisdiction to base its decision upon the Concession Contract, at least so far as necessary in order to determine whether there had been a breach of the substantive standards of the BIT. Second, the passage appears to imply that conduct of Tucum\u00e1n carried out in the purported exercise of its rights as a party to the Concession Contract could not, *a priori,* have breached the BIT. However, there is no basis for such an assumption: whether particular conduct involves a breach of a treaty is not determined by asking whether the conduct purportedly involves an exercise of contractual rights.78\n\nSee also the Tribunal\u2019s summary, cited in para. 11 above, where the Tribunal said it was \"impossible... to distinguish or separate violations of the BIT from breaches of the Concession Contract without first interpreting and applying the detailed provisions of that agreement.\"\n\n*See* ILC Articles, commentary to Article 4, para. (6), commentary to Article 12, paras. (9)-(10). *See also* C. Amerasinghe, \"State Breaches of Contracts with Aliens and International Law,\" *American Journal of International Law,* vol. 58 (1964), p. 881, at pp. 910-912: \"The general proposition that, where a state performs an act which is prohibited by a treaty to which it is a party, it will be responsible for a breach of international law to the other party or parties to the treaty requires no substantiation. In accordance with the same principle, an act which constitutes a breach of contract would be a breach of international law, if it is an act which that state is under an obligation not to commit by virtue of a treaty to which it and the national state of the alien are parties\"; R. Jennings & A. Watts, *Oppenheims International Law* (9th edn.) (Harlow, Longman, 1992), p. 927: \"It is doubtful whether a breach by a state of its contractual obligations with aliens constitutes *per se* a breach of an international obligation, unless there is some such additional element as denial of justice, or expropriation, or breach of treaty, in which case it is that additional element which will constitute the basis for the state\u2019s international responsibility.\"\n\n111.\n\nFor these reasons, and despite certain passages of the Award in which the Tribunal seems to go further into the merits, the Committee can only conclude that the Tribunal, in dismissing the Tucum\u00e1n claims as it did, actually failed to decide whether or not the conduct in question amounted to a breach of the BIT. In particular, the Tribunal repeatedly referred to allegations and issues which, it held, it could not decide given the terms of Article 16(4) of the Concession Contract, even though these were adduced by Claimants specifically in support of their BIT claim.79 Moreover, it offered no interpretation whatsoever either of Article 3 or of Article 5 of the BIT, something which was called for if the claims were to be dismissed on their merits.\n\nAward, paras. 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81; 40 ILM 426 (2001), pp. 440- 444.\n\n112.\n\nIt is not the Committee\u2019s function to form even a provisional view as to whether or not the Tucum\u00e1n conduct involved a breach of the BIT, and it is important to state clearly that the Committee has not done so. But it is nonetheless the case that the conduct alleged by Claimants, if established, *could* have breached the BIT. The claim was not simply reducible to so many civil or administrative law claims concerning so many individual acts alleged to violate the Concession Contract or the administrative law of Argentina. It was open to Claimants to claim, and they did claim, that these acts taken together, or some of them, amounted to a breach of Articles 3 and/or 5 of the BIT. In the Committee\u2019s view, the Tribunal, faced with such a claim and having validly held that it had jurisdiction, was obliged to consider and to decide it. Although the Tribunal expressed conclusions on certain aspects of the claim, it never expressed a conclusion as to the claim as a whole, still less did it assess Claimants\u2019 case against the requirements of Article 3 or 5 of the BIT.\n\n113.\n\nIn the light of Article 8 of the BIT, the situation carried risks for Claimants. Having declined to challenge the various factual components of its treaty cause of action before the administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n, instead choosing to commence ICSID arbitration\u2014and having thereby, in the Committee\u2019s view, taken the \"fork in the road\" under Article 8(4)\u2014CAA took the risk of a tribunal holding that the acts complained of neither individually nor collectively rose to the level of a breach of the BIT. In that event, it would have lost both its treaty claim and its contract claim. But on the other hand it was entitled to take that risk, with its associated burden of proof. A treaty cause of action is not the same as a contractual cause of action; it requires a clear showing of conduct which is in the circumstances contrary to the relevant treaty standard. The availability of local courts ready and able to resolve specific issues independently may be a relevant circumstance in determining whether there has been a breach of international law (especially in relation to a standard such as that contained in Article 3). But it is not dispositive, and it does not preclude an international tribunal from considering the merits of the dispute.\n\n114.\n\nIt should be stressed that the conduct complained of here was not more or less peripheral to a continuing successful enterprise. The Tucum\u00e1n conduct (in conjunction with the acts and decisions of Claimants) had the effect of putting an end to the investment. In the Committee\u2019s view, the BIT gave Claimants the right to assert that the Tucum\u00e1n conduct failed to comply with the treaty standard for the protection of investments. Having availed itself of that option, Claimants should not have been deprived of a decision, one way or the other, merely on the strength of the observation that the local courts could conceivably have provided them with a remedy, in whole or in part. Under the BIT they had a choice of remedies.\n\n115.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal exceeded its powers in the sense of Article 52(1)(b), in that the Tribunal, having jurisdiction over the Tucum\u00e1n claims, failed to decide those claims. Given the clear and serious implications of that decision for Claimants in terms of Article 8(2) of the BIT, and the surrounding circumstances, the Committee can only conclude that that excess of powers was manifest. It accordingly annuls the decision of the Tribunal so far as concerns the entirety of the Tucum\u00e1n claims.\n\n*(iii) Failure to state reasons: Article 52(1)(e)*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nIn view of the foregoing conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider the further ground of annulment relied on by Claimants, viz., that in dismissing the claim the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which its decision was based. As to the federal claims, the Committee has already concluded that reasons for the dismissal of those claims were given. As to the Tucum\u00e1n claims, in the Committee\u2019s view the Tribunal gave very full reasons for the step it took, viz., the dismissal of those claims without any overall consideration of their merits. The question of failure to state reasons would only arise if one took the view that the Tribunal actually did reach a conclusion adverse to Claimants under Articles 3 and 5 in respect of the Tucum\u00e1n claims as a whole\u2014a view the Committee has already rejected. Accordingly, nothing more needs to be said on this ground of annulment.\n\nD. COSTS\n--------\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal made no order for costs, and required Claimants and Respondent to share equally the costs of ICSID. It observed that the dispute raised \"a set of novel and complex issues not previously addressed in international arbitral precedent relating to the interplay of a bilateral investment treaty, a Concession Contract with a forum-selection clause and the ICSID Convention.\"80 It noted that both parties had prevailed to some extent. These considerations apply equally to the present phase of the proceedings. Claimants have succeeded in part, but only in part. Moreover, Argentina was entitled to take the position it took, which itself raised a difficult and novel question of public importance concerning ICSID and the operation of investment protection agreements on the model of the BIT.\n\nAward, para. 95; 40 ILM 426 (2001), p. 447.\n\n118.\n\nIn the light of the importance of the arguments advanced by the parties in connection with this case, the Committee considers it appropriate that each party bear its own expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding, and that the parties bear equally all expenses incurred by the Centre in connection with this proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee.\n\nE. DECISION\n-----------\n\n119.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee DECIDES:\n\n(a) The Tribunal rightly held that it had jurisdiction over the claims.\n\n(b) The Tribunal committed no annullable error in its rejection of the federal claims (claims concerning the conduct of federal authorities) on the merits, and that rejection is accordingly *res judicata.*\n\n(c) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by not examining the merits of the claims for acts of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities under the BIT and its decision with regard to those claims is annulled.\n\n(d) Each party shall bear its own expenses, including legal fees, incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding.\n\n(e) Each party shall bear one half of the costs incurred by the Centre in connection with this annulment proceeding. Accordingly, the Argentine Republic shall reimburse the Claimants one half of the total costs incurred by the Centre in connection with this annulment proceeding once the amount has been determined by the Secretariat of the Centre."}, {"Title": "Decision of the ad hoc Committee on the Request for Supplementation and Rectification of its Decision Concerning Annulment of the Award", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2003-05-28T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision of the ad hoc Committee on the Request for Supplementation and Rectification of its Decision Concerning Annulment of the Award\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn July 3, 2002, the *ad hoc* Committee (the \"Committee\") rendered a Decision on Annulment with respect to the Award issued by the Tribunal in the present arbitration (the \"Decision\").1\n\nThe English version of the Decision is reported in 41 ILM 1135 (2002).\n\n2.\n\nOn August 16, 2002, the Argentine Republic submitted to the Secretary-General of ICSID a Request for Supplementation and Rectification of some aspects of the Decision (the \"Request\"). The Request was made on the basis of Article 49(2) of the *Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States* (the \"ICSID Convention\") and Rule 49 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\n(2) The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award. Its decision shall become part of the award and shall be notified to the parties in the same manner as the award. The periods of time provided for under paragraph (2) of Article 51 and paragraph (2) of Article 52 shall run from the date on which the decision was rendered.\n\n3.\n\nThe Argentine Republic having complied with the deadline set in Article 49(2) and having made the payments required under the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, the Request was registered by the Secretariat and transmitted to the Claimants and the members of the Committee on August 23, 2002.\n\n4.\n\nAfter deliberation, the Committee decided, in accordance with the provisions of Arbitration Rule 49(3), to grant the Claimants until November 4, 2002 to file their observations on the Request. Argentina submitted a Reply to Claimants\u2019 observations on December 6, 2002.\n\nB. THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES\n------------------------------\n\n1) Argentina\u2019s Position\n-----------------------\n\n5.\n\nIn support of its Request, the Argentine Republic makes the following fundamental arguments:\n\n*(a) Request for a supplementary decision under the provisions of Arbitration Rule 49(1)(c)(i):*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nRespondent asserts that, in its Decision, the Committee incorrecdy omitted to decide whether, as argued by Argentina, the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s failure to account for the fact that the transfer of CAA\u2019s shares from DyCASA to CGE was not previously authorised by the Government of Tucum\u00e1n undermined its decision on jurisdiction.\n\n7.\n\nThis omission, contends Respondent, requires that the Committee render a supplementary decision which specifically addresses the issue.\n\n*(b) Request for rectification of seven specific matters pursuant to the provisions of Arbitration Rule 49(1)(c)(ii):*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Argentine Republic submits that, in its Decision, the Committee committed seven material errors in its description of the arguments and legal position advanced by Argentina in the annulment proceedings. These errors, each of which is the object of a specific request for rectification, are:\n\n(i) The Committee erred in affirming that there was no dispute between the parties concerning CGE\u2019s control of CAA at the time the arbitration proceedings were commenced (paragraphs 48 and 49 of the Decision);\n\n(ii) The Committee erred in stating that the Respondent acknowledged that there exists no presumption either in favor of or against annulment of an arbitral award (paragraph 62 of the Decision);\n\n(iii) The Committee erred in describing the Respondent\u2019s position in relation to the possibility of a partial annulment and its consequences (paragraph 67 of the Decision);\n\n(iv) The Committee erred in stating that the Respondent was not making a late annulment application by way of a counterclaim (paragraph 70 of the Decision);\n\n(v) The Committee erred in stating that the Respondent argued that there was a contradiction between the Tribunal\u2019s reasons concerning jurisdiction and its reasons concerning the merits of the dispute (paragraph 72 of the Decision);\n\n(vi) The Committee erred in stating that neither party disputes that a tribunal commits an excess of powers if it fails to exercise its jurisdiction (paragraph 86 of the Decision);\n\n(vii) The Committee erred in summarizing the arguments of the Respondent in relation to the treatment by the Tribunal of the Tucum\u00e1n claims (paragraph 93 of the Decision).\n\n2) Claimants\u2019 Position\n----------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Claimants object to the Respondent\u2019s Request. They maintain that the request for supplementary decision and each of the seven requests for rectification should be rejected as disclosing no omission or error on the part of the Committee.\n\nC. THE COMMITTEE\u2019S ANALYSIS\n---------------------------\n\n1) Limits on the Scope of a Request for Supplementation/Rectification\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nBefore addressing the issues raised by Argentina\u2019s Request, the Committee considers it appropriate to comment on the nature and purpose of the procedure by which ICSID awards and decisions may be supplemented or rectified.\n\n11.\n\nIn this regard, it is important to state that that procedure, and any supplementary decision or rectification as may result, in no way consists of a means of appealing or otherwise revising the merits of the decision subject to supplementation or rectification.2 Those sorts of proceedings are simply not provided for in the ICSID system. Still less may a request for supplementation or rectification of a *decision on annulment* be employed as vehicle by which to examine the correctness, not of the decision of the *ad hoc* committee, but of the underlying arbitral award.\n\nC. H. Schreuer, *Commentary,* Art. 49, para. 47.\n\n12.\n\nWith these comments firmly in mind, the Committee turns to the various aspects of Respondent\u2019s Request.\n\n2) On the Request for Supplementary Decision\n--------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nAs mentioned, the Respondent\u2019s written submissions of August 16 and December 6, 2002, set out the legal grounds on which the Argentine Republic relies in support of its Request.\n\n14.\n\nAs regards its request for a supplementary decision, the Respondent argues that the Committee omitted to rule on Argentina\u2019s claim that the Tribunal\u2019s decision upholding its jurisdiction in the arbitration was undermined by its failure to account for the manner in which CAA\u2019s shares, and thus control of the company, was transferred from DyCASA to CGE. Argentina contends that, in accordance with the provisions of the Concession Contract, this transfer required the express authorization of the Government of Tucum\u00e1n. The existence or non-existence of such authorization and the consequences thereof for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal must, in the Respondent\u2019s view, be examined by the Committee.\n\n15.\n\nFor their part, the Claimants argue: that the Committee is not obliged to opine on every single matter raised by the parties; that the Request exceeds the scope of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention; and that in any event the Decision reveals no omission, but, rather, a decision by the Committee contrary to the position advocated by the Respondent.\n\n16.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, and contrary to what is argued by the Respondent, neither the Committee nor indeed the Arbitral Tribunal omitted to consider Argentina\u2019s position concerning the circumstances surrounding the transfer of CAA\u2019s shares from DyCASA to CGE or the consequences of that transfer as regards the Tribunal\u2019s competence. As the Argentine Republic acknowledges in its written submissions, the Committee stated in its Decision that CGE had always been an investor, whether or not it had overall control of CAA; and in any case CGE controlled CAA at the time that arbitration proceedings were commenced, such that there was no question but that the Tribunal enjoyed jurisdiction over CAA.3 Specifically, in paragraph 50 of its Decision, the Committee declared:\n\n[W]hile it is arguable that the Tribunal failed to state any reasons for its finding that \"CAA should be considered a French investor from the effective date of the Concession Contract,\" that finding played no part in the subsequent reasoning of the Tribunal, or in its dismissal of the claim. (...) It is also clear the CGE controlled CAA at the time the proceedings were commenced, so that there was no question that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over CAA as one of the Claimants in the arbitration.4\n\nParagraph 16 of the Request of the Argentine Republic, quoting from paragraph 50 of the Decision on Annulment.\n\nSee also paragraph 48 of the Decision.\n\n17.\n\nThese constitute material and substantive findings by the Committee that belie the contentions underlying Respondent\u2019s Request, although they admittedly do not expressly refute its entire legal argument.5 Indeed, the Decision itself demonstrates that, as asserted by Claimants in their written submissions, the Committee in fact considered - and denied - the relevance of Argentina\u2019s arguments with respect to jurisdiction.6\n\nIn the sense expressed by the decisions on supplementation and rectification made in *AM CO v. Indonesia,* October 10, 1990, *ICSID Reports,* vol. 1, 1993, at 638-640, and *Genin v. Estonia,* April 4, 2002, http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/genin-sp.pdf.\n\nThe argument that the Committee could alter substantive decisions in the award has been studied and rejected. See Respondents Submission of December 6, 2002, para. 20, citing the specifications presented by C. Schreuer (footnote 4) and the decisions in *Mine v. Guinea and Klockner v. Cameroon* (footnote 5). In both of those cases, the transfer of shares at issue was considered relevant. This is not true in the present case, and the argument of irrelevance or indifference is simply intended to weaken any allegation of substance. Cf. C. Schreuer, *Commentary,* Art. 49, para. 37.\n\n18.\n\nIn these circumstances, only a highly subjective perspective makes it possible to affirm, as does Respondent, that, but for the Committee\u2019s alleged \"omission,\" the content of the Decision would have been different. This subjective perspective has led the Respondent to refer matters to this Committee that have already been addressed and decided in the Decision.\n\n19.\n\nIn no way can it be said that the Committee omitted to address Argentina\u2019s arguments. Rather, it appears that Respondent is seeking to reopen a substantive debate that occurred and was resolved during the earlier, merits phase of the annulment proceeding, with a view to having the Committee reconsider its findings concerning CAA\u2019s status as an investor subject to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the manner in which the issue was addressed by the Tribunal. This is something that, in this exceptional phase of the annulment proceeding, the Committee cannot and will not do.\n\n20.\n\nWith the collapse of Respondent\u2019s case concerning the Committee\u2019s alleged omission - the only case open to Respondent under Article 49 of the ICSID Convention - Argentina\u2019s entire argument in support of its request for a supplementary decision falls.\n\n21.\n\nThe Committee wishes to stress that it was not necessary, in order to decide that CGE controlled CAA at the time of the commencement of the arbitration, to decide whether relevant contractual requirements had been met. The question was exclusively whether CAA was a \"body corporate effectively controlled, directly or indirectly, by\" CGE (see 1991 Agreement, Article l(2)(c)), and the dossier indicated clearly that it was. In the Committee\u2019s view (as, evidently, in the Tribunal\u2019s view also), para. (c) looks to the factual situation and is concerned with jurisdiction, not with the implications of any failure to comply with contractual or other requirements, even if these might be relevant to the merits. Even assuming that CGE should have obtained Tucuman\u2019s agreement to its acquisition of DyCasa\u2019s shares and did not, it remained the case that at the time of commencement of the arbitration CGE directly or indirectly controlled CAA, and for the purposes of ICSID jurisdiction that is enough. The Committee made it quite clear that in partially annulling the Tribunal\u2019s decision, including its finding that CAA was controlled by CGE from the effective date of the Concession Contract, it made no decision for itself on any aspect of the merits of the Tucuman claim.\n\n22.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee rejects that aspect of Respondent\u2019s Request that consist of a request that the Committee issue a supplementary decision.\n\n3) On the Requests for Rectification\n------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Argentine Republic also requests the rectification of what it considers to be seven material errors in the Decision. It submits that the scope of the remedy of rectification provided for in Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention is well established, as illustrated by recent precedents, and argues that the particular errors affecting the Decision in the present case are so serious that, unless rectified, they could \"nullify the Decision on Annulment\" and prejudice Argentina\u2019s position in future ICSID arbitrations. The implication is that, in its deliberations and preparation of the Decision, the Committee disregarded many of the arguments put forward by the Respondent, to its significant detriment.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant, for its part, argues that the seven requests for rectification should be rejected, on the grounds that they exceed the scope of Article 49(2) and, in effect, represent further attempts by the Respondent to reopen debate on issues already decided by the Committee.\n\n25.\n\nA review of pertinent arbitral awards7 illustrates that the availability of the rectification remedy afforded by Article 49(2) depends upon the existence of two factual conditions. First, a clerical, arithmetical or similar error in an award or decision must be found to exist. Second, the requested rectification must concern an aspect of the impugned award or decision that is purely accessory to its merits. Simply stated (and contrary to Respondent\u2019s assertion at paragraph 26 of its Request), Article 49(2) does not permit the \"rectification\" of substantive findings8 made by a tribunal or committee or of the weight or credence accorded by the tribunal or committee to the claims, arguments and evidence presented by the parties. The sole purpose of a rectification is to correct clerical, arithmetical or similar errors, not to reconsider the merits of issues already decided. As will be seen, below, many of the Respondent\u2019s requests derive from a misunderstanding of this fundamental principle.\n\n*AMCO v. Indonesia, op. cit.,* at 638, *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain,* Rectification of the Award of January 31, 2001, *ICSID Rev.,* vol. 16, 2001, at 279 and *CDSE v. Republic of Costa Rica,* decision of June 8, 2000, *ICSID Rev.,* vol. 15, 2000, at 169.\n\nSee *Genin v. Estonia, op. cit.,* para. 16.\n\n*(a) Whether the Committee erred in affirming that there was no dispute between the parties concerning CGE\u2019s control of CAA at the time the arbitration proceedings were commenced (paragraphs 48 and 49 of the Decision)*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Committee reaffirms the statements (actually, the summary of the facts) contained in paragraphs 49 and 50 of its Decision. Those passages are not concerned with whether or not the parties are in agreement as to CGE\u2019s control of CAA or as to the consequences of a determination one way or another; they merely describe the factual circumstances relating to the alleged transfer of control of CAA prior to the commencement of the arbitration proceedings. It is solely in relation to these facts, that is, concerning the manner in which the shares of CAA changed hands, that the Decision states that there is no disagreement between the parties. This does not imply that the Committee considers that there was agreement between the parties with respect to the validity or juridical consequences of that transfer, for example as regards CAA\u2019s status as a foreign investor under the ICSID Convention.\n\n27.\n\nNo error having been found, the Committee denies the rectification requested by Respondent, which appears as yet another attempt to revisit the same issue as in its request for a supplementary decision.\n\n*(b) Whether the Committee erred in stating that the Respondent acknowledged that there exists no presumption either in favour of or against annulment of an arbitral award (paragraph 62 of the Decision)*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nParagraph 62 of the Decision comprises, *inter alia,* a summary of complex legal arguments raised by the parties during the annulment proceeding. It focuses on what the Committee considered to be the central aspects of the parties\u2019 positions for the purpose of its Decision. In summarising their positions thus, the Committee is by no means obliged to restate the parties\u2019 submissions in their entirety. In this case, the Respondent certainly did make submissions regarding the existence of a presumption in favor of the validity of the awards, but not in specific terms, as can be seen by a reading of paragraph 3 of its written submission of December 6, 2002. Rather, it limited itself to suggesting the possibility of support for the presumption of the validity of awards without, however, making an issue of it, or in any way questioning the legitimacy of the annulment proceeding, which was accepted by all parties.\n\n29.\n\nAt the end of paragraph 62 of its Decision, the Committee merely observes that there is no definitive presumption one way or the other. And the two parties appear independently to have arrived at the same conclusion, as illustrated by the fact that they both accept that annulment proceedings are restricted to certain very concrete cases and that the competence of an *ad hoc* committee extends only to annulment justified on one or other of the specific grounds enumerated in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, rather than on any general presumption.\n\n30.\n\nThere being no error that is susceptible of rectification, Argentina\u2019s request for rectification is rejected.\n\n*(c) Whether the Committee erred in describing the Respondent\u2019s position in relation to the possibility of a partial annulment and its consequences (paragraph 67 of the Decision)*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nOnce again, the Respondent\u2019s request comprises an inappropriate attempt to revise the wording of the Decision as it concerns the Committee\u2019s summary of the parties\u2019 allegations, rather to \"rectify\" any error within the meaning of Article 49(2). Indeed, the Committee is unable to identify any specific error in paragraph 67 of the Decision, notwithstanding Argentina\u2019s view to the contrary. As stated above, in summarising the parties\u2019 positions in relation to a particular issue, the Committee is by no means obliged to restate the parties\u2019 submissions in their entirety.\n\n32.\n\nFor these reasons, and on the same basis as for Respondent\u2019s request for rectification \"(b),\" above, Argentina\u2019s request is rejected.\n\n*(d) Whether the Committee erred in stating that the Respondent was not making a late annulment application by way of a counterclaim (paragraph 70 of the Decision)*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe foregoing reasons could apply as well to the Respondent\u2019s fourth request for rectification. That said, there are additional compelling reasons on the basis of which the Committee also denies this request.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent itself admits, in paragraph 53 of its Request, that it had pointed out \"in a subsidiary and conditional manner\" the absence of consideration of the jurisdictional issue arising from the transfer of CAA\u2019s shares from DyCASA to CGE. In any event, in paragraph 70 of the Decision, the Committee clearly states that Respondent\u2019s position to the effect that, if any part of the Tribunal\u2019s award is annulled its jurisdictional decision must also fall, is *not* to be considered as a \"late annulment application by way of a counterclaim\" or \"an inadmissible counterclaim for annulment on new grounds.\" It should be stressed that the Committee did consider Argentina\u2019s subsidiary argument relating to jurisdiction, and did so in full.\n\n35.\n\nThe Committee need not and will not re-visit the parties\u2019 respective positions as to whether or not Argentina\u2019s submissions were in fact \"late.\" Suffice it to state that the Respondent has identified no error whatsoever that requires rectification, and that its request for rectification is therefore rejected.\n\n*(e) Whether the Committee erred in stating that the Respondent argued that there was a contradiction between the Tribunal\u2019s reasons concerning jurisdiction and its reasons concerning the merits of the dispute (paragraph 72 of the Decision)*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nParagraph 72 of the Decision similarly refers to the parties\u2019 positions concerning the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional finding and the annulment of that aspect of its Award. And in this instance, the Decision does reveal an error: the word \"Respondent\" in the third sentence should read \"Claimants,\" since it was in fact the Claimants which \"...argued, in the alternative, that there was a contradiction between those reasons and the reasons given by the Tribunal concerning the merits.\" This clerical error can easily and accurately be remedied by changing one word, without the need to delete the entire sentence, as requested by Argentina.\n\n37.\n\nAccordingly, this element of Argentina\u2019s Request is granted, in part. The third sentence of paragraph 72 of the Decision shall be rectified by the substitution of the word \"Claimants\" for the word \"Respondent.\"\n\n*(f) Whether the Committee erred in stating that neither party disputes that a tribunal commits an excess of powers if it fails to exercise its jurisdiction (paragraph 86 of the Decision)*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nIn paragraph 86 of its Decision, the Committee described what it considered to be the settled and uncontroversial principle that a tribunal may commit an excess of powers not only by purporting to exercise a jurisdiction that it does not possess, but also by failing to exercise a jurisdiction that it in fact does possess. In so doing, the Committee stated that \"neither party disputes\" this proposition.\n\n39.\n\nIt is true, however, that the Respondent - although only in its Memorial, and not in its subsequent written submissions on annulment or during the hearing - made the arguments relating to the issue that are enumerated in paragraph 59 of its Request. The Committee interpreted the Respondent during the oral hearing as - at least - not stressing this argument any longer, but accepts that it was not formally abandoned. As such, the phrase \"neither party disputes\" could be seen as a clerical or similar error, which in no way affects the merits of the Decision.\n\n40.\n\nAccordingly, and for the sake of accuracy, the first sentence of paragraph 86 of the Decision shall be rectified by the deletion of the words \", and neither party disputes.\" Respondent\u2019s Request is thus granted in this respect.\n\n*(g) Whether the Committee erred in summarizing the arguments of the Respondent in relation to the treatment by the Tribunal of the Tucum\u00e1n claims (paragraph 93 of the Decision)*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nAs with the majority of its specific requests for rectification, the Respondent has failed to identify, in this particular request, any clerical, arithmetical or similar error susceptible of rectification. Once again, its objective appears to be to have the Committee substantially alter the summary, in paragraph 93 of the Decision, of what it appreciated as the most relevant aspects of the parties\u2019 positions concerning the issue under consideration. It goes without saying that such a summary could obviously be approached in a number of different ways. The important point, however, is that paragraph 93 contains no identifiable error. On the contrary, the Committee is of the opinion that it captures the essence of the Respondent\u2019s submissions, in particular as they were developed in the oral hearings.\n\n42.\n\nFor these reasons, this element of Argentina\u2019s Request is denied.\n\nD. COSTS\n--------\n\n43.\n\nIn its Decision, the Committee determined that \"in the light of the importance of the arguments advanced by the parties in connection with this case, [it] considers it appropriate that each party bear its own expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding...\" The same cannot, however, be said of the present phase of the proceeding. Indeed, in all but two instances, the Committee has found that the various requests that comprise Respondent\u2019s Request are not only unfounded but inappropriate, consisting essentially of attempts to re-argue substantive elements of the Committee\u2019s Decision.\n\n44.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Committee finds that each party shall bear all of its own costs incurred in connection with the Request for Supplementation and Rectification of the Committee\u2019s Decision, but that Argentina shall pay the entirety of the fees and expenses incurred by the Committee in connection with the above-mentioned request of Argentina.\n\nE. DECISION\n-----------\n\n45.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee DECIDES:\n\n(a) Respondent\u2019s Request for a supplementary decision is denied;\n\n(b) Respondent\u2019s Requests for rectification are denied, with the exception of the following:\n\n(i) The third sentence of paragraph 72 of the Decision is rectified by the substitution of the word *\"Claimants\"* for the word *\"Respondent\",*\n\n(ii) The first sentence of paragraph 86 of the Decision is rectified by the deletion of the words *and neither party disputes.\"*\n\n(c) Each party shall bear all of its own costs incurred in connection with the Request for Supplementation and Rectification of the Committee\u2019s Decision, and Respondent shall pay the entirety of the fees and expenses of the Committee in connection with the above-mentioned request of Argentina."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2005-11-14T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe case now before this Tribunal is a resubmitted case. The dispute here involved has been the subject of prior proceedings before the Centre, as ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3. Pursuant to a Request for Arbitration filed on 26 December 1996 and registered on 17 February 1997 (\"First Request\" or \"Original Request\"), a duly appointed Tribunal (\"First Tribunal\" or \"Original Tribunal\") rendered an Award on 21 November 2000. Two Claimants were named in the Original Request, Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. (\"CAA\") and Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux (\"CGE\");\n\n2.\n\nBy a Request for Partial Annulment of the Award, (\"Request for Annulment\") filed pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, Claimants, on 20 March 2001, sought an annulment of the merits portion of the Award. The Applicants named in the Request for Annulment were CAA and Vivendi Universal S.A. (formerly CGE). Vivendi Universal S.A. attached to the Request for Annulment a letter dated 20 March 2001 from Gilbert Klajnman, its Senior Vice-President Legal Affairs, informing the Secretary General of ICSID that *\"The party of the arbitration proceeding, Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux (\"CGE\") has changed its corporate name to Vivendi and has been merged to form Vivendi Universal.\"* A duly constituted *ad hoc* Committee (\"Committee\" or \"*ad hoc* Committee\") rendered a Decision on Annulment on 3 July 2002.\n\n3.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee decided, *inter alia,* that the Original Tribunal rightly held that it had jurisdiction over the claims before it, but that it had exceeded its powers by not examining the merits of the claims for acts of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities under the BIT. Accordingly, the Committee annulled the First Tribunal's Decision with regard to those claims.\n\n4.\n\nOn 26th August 2002, Respondent submitted to the Secretary-General of ICSID a Request for Supplementation and Rectification of some aspects of the *ad hoc* Committee's Decision. By Decision dated 26 May 2003, the *ad hoc* Committee denied Respondent's Request for a Supplementary Decision and, with one minor exception (having to do with a typographical error), denied Respondent's Request for Rectification.\n\n5.\n\nBy a Request for Arbitration dated 29 August 2003 (\"Second Request\"), Claimants resubmitted the dispute to ICSID pursuant to Article 55(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Claimants sought adjudication by a new Tribunal of the issues as to which the Award was annulled, namely the merits of their BIT claims arising out of the alleged acts and omissions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities. The Claimants named in the Second Request are CAA and Vivendi Universal S.A. (\"Vivendi Universal\"). The resubmitted case continues to bear the same Case No. ARB/97/3 assigned to the original case.\n\n6.\n\nThe present Tribunal was constituted on 14 April 2004.\n\n**B. AGREED PROCEDURAL TIMETABLE OF RESUBMITTED DISPUTE**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal held its First Session with the parties on 7 July 2004 pursuant to Rule 13 of the Arbitration Rules. At that Session, following the expression of the parties' views, a timetable for production of documents, written submissions and a substantive hearing was established.\n\n8.\n\nIn accordance with that timetable, as subsequently amended by agreement of the Parties, the Memorial of Claimants was filed on 24 November 2004. Respondent's CounterMemorial was due to be filed by 7 April 2005.\n\n9.\n\nOn 23 March 2005, two weeks before the 7 April 2005 deadline for the submission of its Counter-Memorial, the Argentine Republic filed an Exception to the Jurisdiction of the Centre and the Competence of the Tribunal in which it raised comprehensive objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and this Tribunal.\n\n**C. ARGENTINE REPUBLIC'S OBJECTIONS TO THE JURISDICTION OF TRIBUNAL**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nIn its 23 March 2005 Memorial on Jurisdiction, as developed in its 21 June 2005 Reply on Jurisdiction (entitled \"Rejoinder Brief about Objections Raised...\"), and as further developed during the course of the hearing on jurisdiction held on 16-17 August 2005, the Argentine Republic raises five objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. These may shortly be summarised as follows:\n\n(i) Vivendi Universal has not proved itself to be the successor-in-interest to CGE. Rather, through a series of complicated corporate changes that occurred after the filing of the First Request but before the filing of the Second Request, Veolia Environment succeeded to CGE's majority shareholding in CAA and Vivendi Universal currently owns only 5.3% of Veolia Environment's issued and outstanding shares (on the date of the Second Request it held only 20.4% of such shares);\n\n(ii) Being presently only an indirect minority shareholder of CAA, Vivendi Universal's current claims are derivative and derivative claims are forbidden under both Argentine and international law;\n\n(iii) As regards CAA's claims, CAA did not obtain its French nationality for protection pursuant to the terms of Argentina-France BIT and to the extent that it acquired protection under the treaty it did so illegitimately;\n\n(iv) CAA and Vivendi Universal have failed to comply with Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 2(1)(f) of the Institution Rules; and\n\n(v) The *ad hoc* Committee's Decision precludes consideration of purely contractual claims (*ie*, for breach of the Concession Contract). To the extent that the present Tribunal has jurisdiction, it is limited to claims for breach of the Argentina-France BIT which are grounded in allegations of conspiracy or based on facts which constitute a concerted effort by the Tucum\u00e1n authorities to frustrate the Concession Contract.\n\n**D. PROCEDURAL TIMETABLE ADOPTED FOR JURISDICTIONAL DETERMINATION**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn 12 April 2005, having considered Respondent's objections and the parties' submissions of 1 and 7 April 2005, the Tribunal decided that Respondent's objections required to be dealt with as a preliminary question in accordance with the following schedule:\n\n(i) Claimants to file a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on or before 31 May 2005;\n\n(ii) Respondent to file a Reply on Jurisdiction on or before 21 July 2005;\n\n(iii) Claimants to file a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on or before 12 July 2005;\n\n(iv) A two-day oral hearing on Jurisdiction to be held on 16-17 August 2005 in Washington, D.C.\n\n12.\n\nOn the same date, the parties were informed by the Secretariat that, given their potential relevance to Respondent's objections, the Tribunal had requested the Secretariat to provide it with their submissions on jurisdiction previously made before the First Tribunal and before the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n**E. RESPONDENT'S JURISDICTIONAL CASE**\n---------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nIt is here convenient to summarise briefly the elements and scope of Respondent's case on jurisdiction as advanced in its written submissions and during the course of the oral hearing.\n\n**(1) Vivendi Universal lacks** ***ius standi*** **to sue, not having established itself as the successor to CGE**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nThe Argentine Republic contends that Vivendi Universal bears the burden to, but has failed to establish itself as the successor-in-interest to CGE. It has both failed to document appropriately changes in its corporate name so as to show itself as successor-in-interest to CGE or to explain adequately those corporate changes which justify its claim to be the successor-in-interest to CGE. It has also failed to prove its shareholding in the company that is the successor to CGE.\n\n15.\n\nArgentina asserts that Vivendi Universal's claim to be successor-in-interest to CGE requires to be *\"... proved formally and irrefutably at this stage, and not at any other stage of these proceedings*\".1 Argentina also says that control of CAA by a French national is essential to *ius standi* pursuant to Article 25(2)(b).\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b619.\n\n16.\n\nIn substance, Argentina contends that Vivendi Universal (or its predecessor) has divested all of its water operations, which after a number of corporate changes are presently within Veolia Environment, a company in which Vivendi Universal now holds only a minority interest. More specifically, Argentina submits that public filings -in particular financial reports and filings before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") - by Vivendi Universal and its affiliates indicate that:\n\n(i) On 23 December 1999, Vivendi S.A. transferred 100% of its shares in CGE to Vivendi Environment and later (by the end of 2002) to Vivendi Water2;\n\n(ii) In April 2003, Vivendi Environment changed its name to Veolia Environment and Vivendi Water changed its name to Veolia Water3 ;\n\n(iii) Over this same period, Vivendi Universal's holding in Veolia Environment (previously Vivendi Environment) decreased from 100% to 72% in 2000, to 63% in 2001, to 20.4% in December 20024, and to 5.3% in 2005.\n\nArgentina relies in particular upon the 2002 and 2003 Veolia Water Financial Reports (Annex 15 and 14, respectively). For example, the 2003 Veolia Water (previously known as Vivendi Water) Financial Report indicates that \"*The Vivendi Water group was created in December 1999 through (...) The contribution at book value on December 23, 1999 by Vivendi Universal to Vivendi Environment of its shareholdings in the capital of Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux (100%; holding company for water and wastewater services (...)).\"*\n\nArgentina relies in particular upon the 2002 and 2003 Veolia Water Financial Reports (Annex 15 and 14, respectively).\n\nArgentina relies in particular upon Vivendi Universal's filing before the SEC of 30 June 2003 (Annex 17) and upon Veolia Environment's filing before the SEC of 30 May 2003 (Annex 12).\n\n17.\n\nArgentina further contends that after CGE's alleged change of name to Vivendi S.A. in May 1998 and until the middle of 2003, CGE remained registered (and Vivendi S.A. was not registered) in CAA's register of shares. Argentina submits that the reason why Vivendi S.A. was not registered in CAA's register of shares at the time is that Vivendi S.A. transferred in 1999 all its water operations to one of its subsidiaries called CGE-Sahide S.C.A., which had been created on 26 June 1998 and which later changed its name to CGE.5 Argentina also argues that maintaining CGE's name in CAA's register of shares at ordinary shareholders meeting after CGE's name was changed to Vivendi S.A. validated the \"notation\" of the shares in favour of the party that was in fact the \"new CGE\". In Argentina's submission, this shows that CGE and Vivendi S.A. coexisted before December 1999 and that Vivendi S.A. was not the universal successor of CGE, as alleged by Claimants.6 Given that there was no universal succession, the only way Vivendi S.A. could become a shareholder of CAA is by way of a specific transaction, which Claimants failed to prove. The Argentine Republic also argues that Claimants' argument that Vivendi S.A. was not entered into CAA's register of shares between May 1998 and the middle of 2003 because of an \"administrative delay of 5 years\" is not believable.7\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b625-28 and 31-33. In support of its argument that all of Vivendi S.A.'s water operations were transferred to CGE in 1999, Argentina relies in particular on the 2002 and 2003 Veolia Water Financial Reports, which both indicate that \"Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux\" became the recipient of all of (as opposed to some of) the water-related activities of Vivendi Universal (Annex 14 at 1; Annex 15 at 1; see also Transcript at 161-163).\n\nRespondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b628-33.\n\nTranscript at 171.\n\n18.\n\nAs regards Claimants' reliance upon jurisdictional findings of the First Tribunal or the *ad hoc* Committee (to support its arguments of *res judicata*), Respondent argues that the existence of a controlling interest by a French national at the beginning of the arbitration (*ie*, on 26 December 1996) is insufficient. This is because such control must persist over time. Thus, it is required also to be established as at 29 August 2003, the date of the filing of the Second Request and throughout the proceedings. For this reason, Argentina contends that Vivendi Universal's minority interest in (hence lack of control of) Veolia Environment - the controlling shareholder of Veolia Water which owned CAA -critically undermines Claimants' BIT claims and the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\n**(2) Vivendi Universal's claim is a derivative claim forbidden by Argentine and international law**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nVivendi Universal claims as an indirect minority investor in Veolia Water (holding a 20.4% interest at the date of filing of the Second Request, and a 5.3% interest today). This minority indirect shareholding in a protected investor converts Vivendi Universal's claim into a derivative action prohibited under both Argentine and international law.\n\n20.\n\nUnder Argentine law shareholders of corporations may not assert claims in respect of corporate rights but only on their own behalf. Absent special legislative provisions, such derivative claims for rights belonging to the Corporation are improper. Such claims are also impermissible under international law. Reliance is placed on the conclusions of the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") in the *Barcelona Traction case*.8 In sum, it is CAA, not Vivendi Universal or even Veolia Environment which can assert claims on its behalf.\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company Limited,* judgment of 5 February 1970, International Court of Justice, Reports of Judgments, Advisory Opinions and Orders.\n\n**(3) CAA did not acquire French \"nationality\" under the protection of the Argentine/French BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nArgentina says that at the time issues arose under the Concession Contract, CAA was an Argentine company established under Argentine Law. It contends further that CGE's acquisition of a majority stake in CAA, occurring as it did after grievances had arisen, was made only to ensure CGE obtained the controlling interest required by Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Further, CAA's acquisition of a French nationality under the French/Argentine BIT in these circumstances constitutes a fraud on the treaty and cannot be used to satisfy the nationality conditions of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention.\n\n**(4) CAA and Vivendi Universal failed to comply with essential preconditions to instituting ICSID arbitration proceedings**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nIt is Argentina's case in this regard that Article 36(2) of the Convention and Rule 2(1)(f) of the Institution Rules require that all necessary internal actions have been taken to authorize the registration of the case and that the necessary powers to institute proceedings have been granted, both of these preconditions requiring documentary proof.\n\n23.\n\nArgentina contends that the documents evidencing powers of attorney granted by Vivendi Universal and CAA to Messrs. Price and Erize are ineffective. Moreover, CAA has never conferred such a power to Mr. Colombres, nor has Vivendi Universal ever empowered Mr. Erize. Such failures are said to constitute insurmountable obstacles to the admissibility of Claimants' claims.\n\n**(5) Claimants' claims are prohibited under the terms of the ad hoc Committee's Decision**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nArgentina argues that the *ad hoc* Committee distinguished between purely contractual claims and treaty claims and annulled the Award only in so far as the First Tribunal had declined to decide Claimants' treaty claims.9 Argentina identified 13 claims, issues or questions which the First Tribunal had clearly delineated as being contractual in nature which, having not been revised by the Committee, must be considered as being barred from consideration by this Tribunal on the grounds of *res judicata.*10\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6172 - 176.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction *,* \u00b6178.\n\n25.\n\nArgentina further contends that the *ad hoc* Committee's analysis of the First Tribunal's errors in this regard makes it clear that Claimants' only proper \"treaty claims\" are those based on \"*a conspiracy of the authorities of Tucum\u00e1n to frustrate the Concession Contract*.\"11 Accordingly, this Tribunal's jurisdiction must be limited to a consideration of such claims.\n\nRespondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6193 and Transcript, pages 63-65.\n\n26.\n\nFinally, Argentina says that, to the extent that the evidence at this stage does not readily enable a determination as to which claims sound only in contractual breach and which are based on concerted action or conspiracy to frustrate the Concession Contract, such a determination should be reserved to and joined with the merits stage of these proceedings, should such a stage be reached.\n\n**F. CLAIMANTS' JURISDICTIONAL CASE**\n-------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nIt is here convenient to summarise briefly the elements and scope of Claimants' case on jurisdiction as it was developed in their written submissions and during the course of the oral hearing.\n\n**(1) Argentina's claim that Vivendi Universal lacks standing is precluded by** ***res judicata*** **and is based on a fundamental misstatement of fact**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nClaimants argue that this Tribunal's jurisdiction was established by the First Tribunal five years ago when it found it had jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the dispute having rejected the many objections to jurisdiction then raised by Argentina. Because this positive finding was not annulled by the *ad hoc* Committee, it is *res judicata* and binds both the parties and this Tribunal.\n\n29.\n\nIn concluding that it had jurisdiction, the First Tribunal necessarily made final determinations on the various elements of jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, finding, *inter alia,* that CGE and CAA were proper Claimants and that the dispute arose out of the investment made by Claimants in Argentina. In endorsing the First Tribunal's jurisdictional analysis the *ad hoc* Committee agreed that CAA should be treated as a French company for the purpose of the arbitral proceedings, finding that *\"...there was no question that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over CAA as one of the Claimants in the arbitration.\"12* The *ad hoc* Committee also confirmed the First Tribunal's findings that this dispute is one *\".relating to investments.*\" under Article 8 of the BIT.13 Thus, the *ad hoc* Committee decided that *\".the Tribunal rightly held that it had jurisdiction over the Claims.\"14*\n\n*See* Decision on Annulment at \u00b650.\n\nSee Decision on Annulment at \u00b674.\n\n*See* Decision on Annulment at \u00b6119.\n\n30.\n\nFurther, Rule 55(3) expressly precludes resubmission to a new tribunal constituted under Article 52(6) of any claims or issues adjudicated by an earlier Tribunal and not subsequently annulled.\n\n31.\n\nThe practice of ICSID Tribunals also confirms that a new tribunal constituted under Article 52(6) of the Convention may not reconsider non-annulled findings of the First Tribunal. Reliance is placed on the *Amco Asia case.15*\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction (resubmitted case), 10 May 1998, 1 ICSID Rep. 543 (1993).\n\n32.\n\nWhilst it is possible, on very rare occasions, that a new fact may arise subsequent to the annulment proceedings that may require consideration of a jurisdictional question in a resubmitted case, there are no new \"facts\" here, merely demonstrably false speculations.\n\n33.\n\nAlso, even where a new fact may give rise to a jurisdictional-enquiry, that enquiry is limited to determining whether, in fact and in law, the conditions of *res judicata* apply (*ie*, whether the parties and the causes of action are the same as in the previous proceeding). Critically, here, Argentina makes no allegation that there is a different party or that Claimant has maintained different causes of action.\n\n34.\n\nIn any event, Argentina's allegations that there was a change in CAA's corporate ownership is simply false. Vivendi Universal was formerly known as Vivendi S.A., which in turn was formerly known as CGE. Vivendi Universal continues to this day to hold the majority stake in CAA that was acquired at the time that it was known as CGE.\n\n35.\n\nArgentina's suggestion that Vivendi Universal no longer holds the majority of CAA's shares rests on the assumption that its stake in CAA may have been transferred in 1999 along with most of Vivendi S.A.'s water related assets to what today are the Veolia companies. However, the alleged transfer of shares never occurred. CAA's board of directors in June 2003 explicitly confirmed that Vivendi Universal was CGE's successor-in-interest and holds title to all the shares formerly held in the name of CGE.16 CAA's shareholder register shows, explicitly, that Vivendi Universal is CGE's successor-ininterest and that Vivendi Universal owns the CAA shares previously acquired and held by Vivendi Universal's predecessor, CGE.17 Finally, Vivendi Universal's status as the majority owner of CAA is demonstrated conclusively by the CAA share certificates currently held by Vivendi Universal.18\n\nCAA Board of Directors, Act no. 80, 17 Jun 2003; Claimants' Memorial, \u00b635.\n\nCAA register of shares at 3 (Exhibit 348) (05558); Claimants' Counter-Memorial \u00b636.\n\n*See* CAA share certificates nos. 1, 2, 4-9, 17 June 2003 (349)(05561-05568).\n\n**(2) A shareholder may bring a claim under the BIT for injury to the company in which it is invested**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nClaimants contend that Argentina's objection, that Vivendi Universal is improperly advancing a claim based on harm to CAA which is prohibited under Argentine law as well as international law, fails because:\n\n(i) The standing of CAA's controlling shareholder has already been established by the First Tribunal and, thus, is *res judicata;* and\n\n(ii) It is well established that shareholders (whether minority or majority) may bring investor-state claims based on breaches of an investment treaty that have injured the company in which they have invested.\n\n37.\n\nAs regard *res judicata*, the *ad hoc* Committee stated:\n\n*Moreover, it cannot be argued that CGE did not have an \"investment\" in CAA from the date of the conclusion of the Concession Contract, or that it was not an \"investor\" in respect of its own shareholding, whether or not it had overall control of CAA. Whatever the extent of its investment may have been, it was entitled to invoke the BIT in respect of conduct alleged to constitute a breach of Articles 3 or 5.19*\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b650\n\n38.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee thus upheld the First Tribunal's finding that CGE had standing as CAA's shareholder to pursue arbitration under the BIT. This finding remains in force and is *res judicata*. The Committee's Decision was also issued after CGE's name had been changed to Vivendi S.A. and after Vivendi was succeeded by Vivendi Universal S.A. The Annulment Decision's caption reads \"*Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal (formerly Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux) v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment 3 July 2002)*.\n\n39.\n\nAs regards existing precedent, Claimants say that Argentina's contention that corporate shareholders may not bring claims for investment treaty breaches that harm the company in which they invest so clearly contradicts a settled point of law as to border on bad faith.\n\n40.\n\nFirst, the Argentina-France BIT (the instrument through which Argentina consents to arbitration under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention) explicitly includes shares in its definition of \"*investments*\", making it clear that a foreigner who holds shares of a domestically incorporated company has an \"*investment*\".20 The BIT further entitles foreign investors to bring claims for Argentina's breach of the Treaty's protections with respect to those investments.21\n\nBIT Art. 1(1).\n\nBIT Art. 8.\n\n41.\n\nSecond, reliance on the *Barcelona Traction case* is misplaced and international tribunals have consistently upheld independent shareholder standing under investment treaties. Reliance was placed on eighteen cases, all of which upheld the ability of shareholders to pursue such claims. In eleven of the eighteen cases, the Argentine Republic, as Respondent, made the same argument it now advances and in each of those eleven cases that argument was rejected.22\n\nAppendix 1 contains a list of the 18 cases in question.\n\n**(3) CAA is a French company with standing under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8 of the BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nClaimants say that CAA's status as a French company under the Convention and the BIT may not be challenged here because the First Tribunal's jurisdictional finding is *res judicata*. In the first proceedings, Argentina raised exactly the same objection that it raises here, arguing that CAA \"*should not be treated as a French investor*\" because a majority of its voting stock was not owned by French companies at the time the dispute arose.23\n\nAward at \u00b624 and n.6.\n\n43.\n\nIn this regard, the First Tribunal held that \"*.the Tribunal has determined that CGE controlled CAA and that CAA should be considered a French investor from the effective date of the Concession Contract*\".24 It went on to conclude, *inter alia,* that *\".it is.clear that CGE controlled CAA at the time the proceedings were commenced **so that****there was no question that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over CAA as one of the Claimants in the arbitration**.\"25*\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b648; Award at n. 6. This conclusion was not annulled by the *ad hoc* Committee. Rather it noted that CGE \"...had effective control of CAA within the meaning of Article 1(2)(c) of the Argentine/French BIT [at least as of June 1996].\n\nDecision on Annulment \u00b650 (emphasis added).\n\n44.\n\nMoreover, even if this issue was not *res judicata*, Argentina is undeniably wrong on the facts.26 CAA meets all the criteria to be deemed a French company under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, being both controlled and majority owned by a French investor at all times relevant under the Treaty.27\n\nClaimants contend that the history of CAA's equity ownership was set out in the First Tribunal Award at Note 6 and was summarized again by the *ad hoc* Committee in its Decision on Annulment at \u00b648. None of the facts have changed since that time.\n\n*See* Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, Article 1(2)(c) of the Argentine/French BIT concerning evidence which is sufficient to demonstrate \"effective control\".\n\n**(4) Argentina's complaints regarding authorisation of Claimants are misguided and not relevant to jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nClaimants argue that the Argentine Republic's complaints regarding authorisation of Claimants to pursue arbitration and the powers granted to Claimants' attorneys fail for three reasons.\n\n46.\n\nFirst, these procedural complaints do not constitute a jurisdictional objection. Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 2(1)(f) of the ICSID Institution Rules on company authorisation are procedural in nature and do not provide a basis for an objection to jurisdiction. Failure to comply with these provisions can readily be cured and compliance becomes moot after registration of the Request for Arbitration.\n\n47.\n\nFor a tribunal to find that it lacks jurisdiction, it must identify a missing element under Article 25 of the Convention or Article 8 of the BIT and no such jurisdictional deficiency is involved in the requirements of Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 2(1)(f) of the ICSID Institution Rules.\n\n48.\n\nSecond, Argentina must be held to have waived such objections because it failed to raise them during the preceding eight and half years of these proceedings involving the same companies and the same attorneys. Indeed, a claimant's compliance with Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Institution Rule 2 is relevant only until the Secretary-General has registered a Request for Arbitration under Article 36(3) of the Convention.28\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2001) (\"Schreuer ICSID Convention\") at 456.\n\n49.\n\nThird, even if Argentina's complaints provided a basis for jurisdictional objection and even if Argentina had not waived its rights to object, its objection would still fail because Claimants have met the requirements under Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention, Rule 2(1)(f) of the Institution Rules and Arbitration Rule 18(1) in both the original proceeding and in this resubmitted case.29\n\nReliance is placed on Delegation of Authority, 11 July 2002 (Claimants' Request for Arbitration, 29 August 2003) (Exhibit 9); Letters from Gilbert Klajnman, 4 and 29 July 2003 (Claimants' Request for Arbitration, 29 August 2003) (Exhibits 7 and 8); Resolution of the Board of Directors of CAA, 29 July 2003 (Claimants' Request for Arbitration, 29 August 2003) (Exhibit 5) and Letter from Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, CAA's Vice-President, 12 August 2003 (Claimants' Request for Arbitration, 29 August 2003) (Exhibit 6).\n\n**(5) Argentina's suggestion that jurisdiction over treaty claims must be limited to those based on conspiracy/concerted action are unfounded**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nClaimants argue that Argentina may not challenge this Tribunal's jurisdiction over treaty claims based on the action of the Tucum\u00e1n Authorities relating to the Concession Agreement, because the First Tribunal's finding - that it had jurisdiction over all claims arising under the BIT, including BIT claims relating to rights and obligations under the Concession Agreement - is *res judicata.* The *ad hoc* Committee did not annul (and indeed endorsed) this finding. Argentina is thus barred from seeking to re-litigate this Tribunal's jurisdiction, and cannot be heard when it argues that some BIT claims should be sent to the local jurisdiction because they are contractual in nature.\n\n51.\n\nArgentina is said to misconstrue the *ad hoc* Committee's Decision on Annulment. In fact, the Committee rejected the First Tribunal's conclusion that it could not consider the contract-related BIT claims, finding that the standards set forth in Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT are \"*independent*\" from the Argentine law standard for breach of contract.30 Argentina thus may breach the treaty without breaching the contract and *vice versa*. It therefore follows that \"*whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of the contract are different questions*\" to \"*be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law*\".31\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b695.\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b696.\n\n52.\n\nClaimants submit that, properly analysed, the findings of the First Tribunal, as modified by the Decision on Annulment, lead to conclusions exactly opposite from those now advocated by Argentina. First, the Original Tribunal's description of certain of the claims at issue as \"*contractual*\", and its resulting decision that they ought not to be reviewed under the BIT, have been annulled and thus have no legal force and are not *res judicata*. In the result, this Tribunal is now obliged to review such claims. Second, neither the holdings nor the reasoning of the Committee's Decision on Annulment support Argentina's position that contract-related BIT claims should be referred to the local courts. On the contrary, the Committee's explicit rejection of this proposition formed the basis for its partial annulment of the First Tribunal's Award. Under the pretext of its claim that certain issues are *res judicata*, Argentina is, in reality, asking the Tribunal to ignore this case's history and to repeat the First Tribunal's error, namely to refuse to undertake the legal analysis of Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT for the contract-related BIT claims that have been determined to be within its jurisdiction.\n\n**G. PREVIOUS SUBMISSIONS ON JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nGiven the central importance of the doctrine of *res judicata* to the parties' positions regarding Respondent's current objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, it is useful to restate the procedural history concerning the timing, number, nature and scope of the objections to jurisdiction that have been raised by the Argentine Republic over the course of these proceedings.\n\n54.\n\nAs previously noted, the First Request was received by the Centre on 26 December 1996, with the request being registered on 19 February 1997.\n\n55.\n\nFollowing a letter of 11 December 1997, from the Secretary of the First Tribunal notifying the parties of the latter's wish to hold its First Session, the Argentine Republic, by letter of 8 January 1998, raised its first objections to jurisdiction. A week later, on 14 January 1998, counsel for Argentina submitted a memorandum to the Secretary-General setting forth grounds for finding that the dispute was manifestly not within the jurisdiction of the Centre.32 On 23 January 1998, Counsel for Claimants submitted a letter to the Secretary-General setting forth their arguments for finding that the Request for Arbitration was properly registered and contending that any objection to jurisdiction was for the Tribunal, not for the Secretary-General.33\n\n*See* Award at \u00b6\u00b610-12.\n\n*See* Award at \u00b612.\n\n56.\n\nOn 18 February 1998, at a meeting of the parties with the Tribunal, it was then agreed that the parties would file simultaneous observations on the objections of the Argentine Republic to jurisdiction, to be followed by filing of simultaneous Further Observations and a hearing, after which the proceedings before the First Tribunal unfolded as follows:34\n\n(i) On 20 April 1998, the parties filed their Observations on Argentina's Objections to Jurisdiction;35\n\n(ii) On 11 May 1998, the parties filed their Further Observations on such Obj ections;36\n\n(iii) On 2 July 1998, the First Tribunal ordered that Argentina's Objections to Jurisdiction be joined to the consideration of the merits of the dispute;37\n\n(iv) On 2 November 1998, Claimants filed their Memorial which included their argumentation on Jurisdiction;38\n\n(v) On 1 February 1999, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the merits and jurisdiction;39\n\n(vi) On 4 March 1999, Claimants filed their Reply on the Merits and Jurisdiction;\n\n(vii) Following the Respondent's Rejoinder, filed on 5 April 1999, which dealt only with the merits, the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held on 11-13 August 1999;40\n\n(viii) On 30 September 1999, the parties simultaneously filed Post-Hearing Memorials. Post-Hearing Rejoinders were filed simultaneously on 12 October 1999.41\n\n*See* Award at \u00b616.\n\n*See* Award at \u00b616.\n\n*See* Award at \u00b616.\n\n*See* Award at \u00b617.\n\n*See* Award at \u00b618.\n\n*See* Award at \u00b618.\n\n*See* Award at \u00b621.\n\n*See* Award at \u00b622.\n\n57.\n\nIn the course of the Annulment Proceedings there were five further written submissions, each of which dealt further with the jurisdictional issues:\n\n(i) On 20 August 2001, Claimants filed their Memorial;42\n\n(ii) On 12 November 2001, Argentina filed its Counter-Memorial;43\n\n(iii) On 10 December 2001, Claimants filed their Reply;44\n\n(iv) On 8 January 2002, the Argentine Republic filed its Rejoinder.45\n\n*See* Decision on Annulment at \u00b66.\n\n*See* Decision on Annulment at \u00b66.\n\n*See* Decision on Annulment at \u00b66.\n\n*See* Decision on Annulment at \u00b66.\n\n**H. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------\n\n58.\n\nMany of the relevant factual issues and legal arguments pertaining to each of Argentina's five current objections to jurisdiction are the same or overlap. Nonetheless, it is convenient to consider each objection separately.\n\n**(1) Vivendi Universal lacks** ***ius standi*** **to sue, not having established itself as the successor to CGE**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nRespondent's objections to Claimants' standing in this resubmitted case turn on five principal questions:\n\n(i) At what stage of the proceedings is the jurisdiction of an ICSID Tribunal to be assessed;\n\n(ii) Did the First Tribunal assess its jurisdiction as at the correct stage of these proceedings;\n\n(iii) If so, is the jurisdictional decision of the First Tribunal binding on this Tribunal;\n\n(iv) May the jurisdictional determination made by the First Tribunal be reopened because of, so-called, new facts; and\n\n(v) If so, are there new facts to support the arguments of the Argentine Republic on this point.\n\n60.\n\nAs to question (i) above, it is generally recognized that the determination of whether a party has standing in an international judicial forum, for purposes of jurisdiction to institute proceedings, is made by reference to the date on which such proceedings are deemed to have been instituted.46 ICSID Tribunals have consistently applied this Rule.47 More specifically, in ICSID arbitration, the critical date for purposes of determining the nationality of the foreign investor under Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention is the date of consent48, *ie* generally the date when the arbitration is instituted in case of a dispute arising out of a BIT49.\n\n*Ceskoslovensk\u00e1 Obchodn\u00ed Banka, A.S. v. The Slovak Republic* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4 Decision of the Tribunal on objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, 14 ICSID Rev. - Foreign Inv. L.J. 251, 262 at \u00b631 (1999).\n\n*See* Pierre Lalive, *The First 'World Bank' Arbitration (Holiday Inns v.

L.J. 457, 490 at \u00b672 (2000).\n\n*See* Schreuer, ICSID Convention at 226 \u00b6325, 288 \u00b6490 and 289 \u00b6493.\n\nIndeed, ICSID clauses in modern BITs express an offer by the two Contracting States to submit to ICSID jurisdiction; the investor can accept such an offer by instituting ICSID proceedings (*see* Schreuer, ICSID Convention at 210-281 \u00b6\u00b6285-308).\n\n61.\n\nThis is not only a principle of ICSID proceedings, it is an accepted principle of international adjudication that jurisdiction will be determined in the light of the situation as it existed on the date the proceedings were instituted. Events that take place before that date may affect jurisdiction; events that take place after that date do not. The ICJ developed cogent case law to this effect in the *Lockerbie case.* There, in a preliminary objection, Libya relied on the Montreal Convention to establish the Court's jurisdiction. The United States and the United Kingdom contended that Security Council Resolutions adopted after the initiation of the proceedings deprived the Court of jurisdiction. The Court rejected categorically the arguments of the United States and the United Kingdom, deciding that:\n\n*The Court cannot uphold this line of argument. Security Council Resolutions 748 (1992) and 883 (1993) were in fact adopted after the filing of the Application on 3 March 1992. In accordance with its established jurisprudence, if the Court had jurisdiction on that date, it continues to do so. The subsequent coming into existence of the above-mentioned Resolutions cannot affect its jurisdiction once established.\"50*\n\n*See Case Concerning Questions of Interpretation and Application of the 1971 Montreal Convention Arising from the Aerial incident at Lockerbie (Libyan Arab Jamahiriva v. United States of America) Preliminary Objection,* Judgment, 27 February 1998, 37 I.L.M. 590, 604 at \u00b638 (1998).\n\n62.\n\nThe Court confirmed this rule in the *Arrest Warrant case,* where it stated:\n\n*The Court recalls that, according to its settled jurisprudence, its jurisdiction must be determined at the time that the act instituting proceedings was filed. Thus, if the Court has jurisdiction on the date the case is referred to it, it continues to do so regardless of subsequent events. Such events might lead to a finding that an application has subsequently become moot and to a decision not to proceed to judgment on the merits, but they cannot deprive the Court of jurisdiction...\"51*\n\n*See* *Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of Congo v. Belgium),* Judgment, 14 February 2002 at \u00b626, available at http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/iCOBEframe.htm.\n\n63.\n\nThe consequence of this rule is that, once established, jurisdiction cannot be defeated. It simply is not affected by subsequent events. Events occurring after the institution of proceedings (other than, in a case like this, an *ad hoc* Committee's Decision to annul the prior jurisdictional finding) cannot withdraw the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the dispute.\n\n64.\n\nThis principle applies in particular to the nationality requirement under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. As Professor Schreuer notes:\n\n*Any change in the juridical person's nationality after the date of consent is immaterial for jurisdiction. Subsequent to consent, a juridical person may lose the nationality of the original Contracting State and may acquire the nationality of a non-Contracting State or that of the host State without losing access to ICSID.*52\n\nSchreuer, ICSID Convention at 289, \u00b6493\n\n65.\n\nIt should be noted that the situation is less clear when nationality depends on foreign control. Indeed, ICSID Tribunals dealing with the relevant date to assess foreign control have generally favoured the date of consent. At the same time, they have not wholly disregarded subsequent developments, stressing in particular that the foreign control requirement was still met at a later date.53 Be that as it may, the question of the relevance of new facts in connection with foreign control can be left open here. Indeed, as will be seen when discussing question (v) below, the Tribunal has found that control did not change, *ie* that no new facts occurred in this case.\n\nSchreuer, ICSID Convention at 324-325, \u00b6\u00b6579-581 and at 326ff, \u00b6\u00b6581ff with references to cases (Professor Schreuer notes that ICSID Tribunals dealing with the critical date for foreign control have generally favoured the date of consent but have also expressed some concern for subsequent development).\n\n66.\n\nAs regards question (ii) above, it is beyond doubt that jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the Argentine-French BIT was established by the First Tribunal in this case five years ago. As is also evident from a review of Chapter G above, the parties briefed and argued jurisdiction extensively before each of the First Tribunal and *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n67.\n\nIn the result, the First Tribunal rejected each of Argentina's objections to jurisdiction, finding that:\n\n*This case concerns a claim against the Argentine Republic submitted to ICSID by CGE, a French corporation that operates water and sewage systems in France and other countries, and also by CGE's Argentine affiliate, CAA.54*\n\n*See* Award at \u00b624.\n\n68.\n\nIn footnote 6, which explained this finding, the First Tribunal noted, *inter alia* :\n\n*Respondent argued that CAA should not be treated as a French investor because this acquisition occurred after disputes had arisen between CGE and Tucum\u00e1n (Resp. Mem. at App. B, Note relating to CGE's Acquisition.) CGE responded that the critical date for purposes of determining control under Article 25(2)(b) and under precedent interpreting the ICSID convention is the date for consent to arbitration and that is the date in late 1996 when CGE submitted the dispute to arbitration. All parties agree that by late 1996 CGE had acquired the Dycasa shares..For purposes of resolving the issues addressed by this Award, the Tribunal has determined that CGE controlled CAA and that CAA should be considered a French investor from the effective date of the Concession Contract.*\n\n69.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee on Annulment did not annul this positive finding; it expressly endorsed it:\n\n*Moreover it cannot be argued that CGE did not have an \"investment\" in CAA from the date of the conclusion of the Concession Contract or that it was not an \"investor\" in respect of its own shareholding, whether or not it had overall control of CAA. Whatever the extent of its investment may have been, it was entitled to invoke the BIT in respect of conduct alleged to constitute a breach of Articles 3 or 5. It is also clear that CGE controlled CAA at the time the proceedings were commenced, so that there was no question that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over CAA as one of the Claimants in the arbitration. In the circumstances, and for the purposes of the present proceedings, the Committee does not need to reach any conclusion on the precise extent of CAA's and CGE's treaty rights at different times.55*\n\n*See* Decision on Annulment at \u00b650\n\n70.\n\nUltimately *,* the *ad hoc Committee* concluded that \"[t]*he Tribunal rightly held that it had jurisdiction over the claims*.\"56\n\n*See* Decision on Annulment at \u00b6119.\n\n71.\n\nQuestion (iii) above, *ie*, whether the First Tribunal's decisions on jurisdiction, as endorsed by the *ad hoc* Committee, are binding on this Tribunal is governed by the doctrine of *res judicata*, which is recognized as a general principle of law.57\n\nSee *eg* B. Cheng, *General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals*, London, Sweet & Maxwell, 1953, reprinted Cambridge, Grotius, 1987, at 336, with references (\"Cheng, General Principles of Law\"); B. Hanotiau, *The res judicata effect of arbitral awards*, ICC International Court of Arbitration Bulletin, special supplement 2003, Complex arbitrations, at 43, \u00b6 1 (\"Hanotiau, The res judicata effect of arbitral awards\"); and, Schwarzenberger, Georg, *International Law*, Vol. 1, Stevens & Sons, London, 1945, at 407-422.\n\n72.\n\nIt is common ground between the parties that a later tribunal is bound by the decision of an earlier one if the two actions involve the same parties and the same cause of action58, *ie* if the claims asserted in both proceedings are the same.59 This is in line with the general notion of *res judicata*. Indeed, it is generally recognized that the *res judicata* doctrine only applies where there is identity of the parties and of the \"question at issue\" - this second identity requirement being sometimes divided into the object (*persona petitum*) and the grounds (*causa petendi*)\".60\n\nAt the hearing, Counsel for Respondent stated that \"*when we speak of res judicata, we speak of a decision that has been - that is a firm decision because of the impossibility of any review or reconsideration, and such impossibility of review or reconsideration is based on the notion that one would be rediscussing the same issue with the same parties under the condition that there be no new facts (\u2026). In other words, there must be identity of object, identity of cause or case, and identity of subject or parties*\" (Transcript at 146). Counsel for Claimants explained that the conditions of *res judicata* are \"*first, that the parties are the same, and second, that the causes of action are the same*\" (Transcript at 187). Thus, the parties agree that there must be identity of parties and identity of cause. The parties disagree however on whether the determination made by a first Tribunal can be reopened because of so-called new facts (modifying the \"object of the case\" to use Respondent's wording). This question will be addressed below under question (iv).\n\nRelying on the *Amco Asia* resubmitted case, Counsel for Claimants defined the cause of action as the claims formally brought before a Tribunal: \"*(\u2026) the dispute must have the same causes of action. The Tribunal, in the resubmitted Amco Asia case stated \"A dispute is defined by claims formally asserted and responded to in claim and defense or in counterclaim and reply to counterclaim; in other words, the causes of action*\" (Transcript at 189-190). Counsel for Respondent did not give such a precise definition, but said that in the present resubmitted case there were \"*new parties, new claims, new facts*\" (Transcript at 152).\n\nCheng, General Principles of Law, at 339-340 and 343-345 (who notes, however, that in his opinion an examination of international decisions throws some doubts upon the accuracy of the subdivision of the second requirement into *petitum* and *causa petendi*); Hanotiau, The *res judicata* effect of arbitral awards, at 48 \u00b6 32.\n\n73.\n\nThe Argentine Republic argues that these identity requirements are not met, while the Claimants submit that they are satisfied. The identity of the parties depends on whether Vivendi Universal is the successor-in-interest of CGE. As will be seen below, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that Vivendi Universal is indeed the successor of CGE and shareholder of CAA. Hence, the requirement of identical parties is met.\n\n74.\n\nThe same conclusion holds true with respect to the identity of the \"questions at issue\". Depending on the definition given to this second requirement, the requirements for the identity which it implies may be more or less stringent. In the present case, there is no need to further define the applicable requirements, as the dispute before this Tribunal meets the identity requirement by any standard. A review of the pleadings before this and the First Tribunal demonstrates that the claims are based on the same facts, *ie*, on certain conduct of the authorities of *Tucum\u00e1n* and on the same legal grounds, *ie*, on breaches of Articles 3 and 5 of the Treaty. It further demonstrates that in both cases Claimants seek reparation in the form of an award of damages. It is true that in the resubmitted case, Claimants have made allegations about certain conduct which occurred later than the acts submitted to the First Tribunal, and produced related evidence.61 This fact does not change the conclusion on the identity of the \"questions at issue\" as the later occurrences are merely the continuation in time of the breaches initially complained of.62\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 25 - 27, and Claimant's Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 259 ff.\n\nThis is in line with \"continuing character\" of breaches referred to in Article 14 of the International Law Commission Draft on the Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, which provides as follows: \"*The breach of an international obligation by an act of a State having a continuing character extends over the entire period during which the act continues and remains not in conformity with the international obligation*\".\n\n75.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3) adopts the doctrine of *res judicata* and precludes resubmission to a new tribunal constituted under Article 52(6) of the Convention of any claims or issues adjudicated by the First Tribunal and not subsequently annulled:\n\n*(3) If the original award had only been annulled in part, the new tribunal shall not reconsider any portion of the award not so annulled...*\n\n76.\n\nProfessor Schreuer cites Rule 55(3) for the proposition that:\n\n*...if the original award had only been annulled in part, the unannulled portion of the original award remains res judicata and is binding on the new tribunal.*63\n\n*See* United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Dispute Settlement, International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, 2.8 Post Award Remedies and Procedures at 31.\n\n77.\n\nNote D to Arbitration Rule 55 of 1968 in turn confirms that submission of unannulled portions of an award to a new tribunal constituted under Article 52(6) of the ICSID Convention would deprive Article 53(1) of its intended effect. Note D provides in pertinent part:\n\n*[ICSID Arbitration Rule 55(3)] provides that if the original award had only been annulled in part, then the new tribunal shall not reconsider any portion of the award not so annulled. This is in accordance with the first sentence of Article 53(1) of the Convention, which indicates that awards shall not be subject to appeal except as provided in the Convention. If an ad hoc Committee empowered to annul all of an award has decided to annul only part thereof (as it is entitled to do under Article 52(3) of the Convention), then the only possible remedy with respect to the unannulled portion is a request for revision made pursuant to Article 51 of the Convention.64*\n\n*See* Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), 1968 1 ICSID Rep. 117 at D (1993).\n\n78.\n\nWhen it concluded, in its Award, that it had jurisdiction, the First Tribunal made determinations on the various elements of the jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, finding, *inter alia* that the CGE and CAA were proper Claimants and that the dispute arose out of the investments made by Claimants in Argentina. Given these findings this Tribunal is precluded under the doctrine of *res judicata* from reconsidering the First Tribunal's jurisdictional conclusions.\n\n79.\n\nTurning now to question (iv) above, *ie*, whether new facts permit prior jurisdictional findings to be reopened, Claimants, in their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction of 31 May 2005, agreed, citing *Amco Asia,* that, on very rare occasions, it is possible that a new fact will arise subsequent to the annulment proceeding requiring the consideration of a jurisdictional question in a resubmitted case, even where the First Tribunal's jurisdictional finding was not annulled.65\n\n*See* *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction (resubmitted case), 10 May 1998, 1 ICSID Rep. 543(1993) at \u00b699.\n\n80.\n\nHowever, when questioned on this point at the Jurisdictional Hearing, counsel for Claimants explained that, properly understood, *Amco Asia* means only that, in a resubmitted case, where jurisdiction has already been found, any new facts must bear on the applicability of *res judicata* if they are to have any jurisdictional significance. According to Claimants, there is no room for any other jurisdictional enquiry. The Arbitral Tribunal has doubts that this is the meaning of *Amco Asia.* The Tribunal in *Amco Asia* did not say so, at least explicitly, and the structure of the decision tends to indicate otherwise. Whether new facts must bear on the applicability of *res judicata* to be considered at all, can, however, be left open here given that the Tribunal's conclusion below that there are no new facts.\n\n81.\n\nThese assertions lead directly to question (v) above - are there new facts such as to justify not applying the doctrine of *res judicata.* The answer to this question is no.\n\n82.\n\nArgentina's allegation that there has been a change in CAA's corporate ownership is inaccurate. The evidence before this Tribunal demonstrates that, in May 1998, CGE changed its name to Vivendi S.A., which then merged with several other companies to form the company Vivendi Universal. Vivendi Universal continues to this date to hold the majority stake in CAA that was acquired at the time by CGE.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts as dispositive proof of this conclusion:\n\n(i) The affidavit of CAA Chairman, Charles-Louis de Maud'huy, indicating that \"Vivendi Universal is CGE's successor in interest with respect to CAA\";66\n\n(ii) CAA Board of Directors' confirmation that Vivendi S.A. and later, Vivendi Universal, succeeded to and holds title to all of the shares formerly held in the name of CGE;67\n\n(iii) CAA's shareholders register, which indicates that Vivendi Universal owns the CAA shares previously acquired and held by CGE and in which the change of name from CGE to Vivendi S.A. is explicitly inscribed;68 and\n\n(iv) The CAA share certificates which are currently held by Vivendi Universal and which list Vivendi Universal as holder of title to the various classes of CAA shares.69\n\nAffidavit of Charles-Louis de Maud'huy, 5 November 2004, at \u00b62 (Exhibit 4) (00070) attached to Claimants' Memorial of 24 November 2004.\n\nCAA's Board of Directors, Act No. 80, 17 June 2003 (Exhibit 347) (05553).\n\nCAA Register of Shares at 3 (Exhibit 348) (05558).\n\n*See* CAA Share Certificates Nos. 1,2,4-9, 17 June 2003 (Exhibit 349) (05561-68).\n\n84.\n\nBased upon the foregoing evidence, the Tribunal also rejects Argentina's allegation that the majority stake in CAA must have been transferred from Vivendi S.A. to what today are the Veolia companies, along with all of Vivendi S.A.'s water operations. Although most of Vivendi S.A.'s water-related assets were transferred to the Veolia companies, the above evidence shows that CAA was not included in such transfer. In this respect, the fact that the 2002 and 2003 Veolia Water Financial Reports70 mention that all water-related activities were transferred to the Veolia companies is not decisive, as any deduction one may draw from it is contradicted by the clear and better evidence listed at para. 83 above.\n\nAnnexes 14 and 15, at 1.\n\n85.\n\nArgentina's argument that Vivendi S.A. cannot be the universal successor of CGE, in particular since Vivendi S.A. and CGE co-existed, is also dismissed. Indeed, the evidence on record mentioned at para. 83 above undoubtedly shows that CGE was renamed Vivendi S.A. in May 1998 and then merged into Vivendi Universal (keeping with it the shares of CAA), so that Vivendi Universal is the successor of CGE. The company named CGE, which coexisted with Vivendi S.A. and which is mentioned in some of the public filings produced by the Argentine Republic,71 is in fact another company created in June 1998, first known as SAHIDE, then renamed CGE-Sahide and finally renamed CGE. The existence of another company named CGE has no bearing on the fact that CGE became, by change of name, Vivendi S.A., which then, by way of merger, became Vivendi Universal. As for the delay in registering Vivendi S.A.'s name change in CAA's records, in particular in CAA's register of shares, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that it does not change any of the foregoing conclusions in light of the clear evidence enumerated in para. 83.\n\n*See* e.g. Annex 14 at 1 and Annex 15 at 1.\n\n86.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Vivendi Universal S.A. continues to this date to hold the majority stake in CAA. In these circumstances, the Tribunal has no difficulty whatever in concluding that the parties to the resubmitted case are the same as the parties below.\n\n87.\n\nThus, the requirements for the application of the doctrine of *res judicata* are satisfied - an earlier decision involving the same claims between the same parties as those pending before this Tribunal. In these circumstances, this Tribunal is precluded from reconsidering the jurisdictional determination of the First Tribunal pursuant to which the requirements for jurisdiction were fulfilled. The First Tribunal having (in the words of the *ad hoc* Committee) rightly concluded that it had jurisdiction on that date, this Tribunal also has jurisdiction. Accordingly, Respondent's first jurisdictional objection is thus dismissed.\n\n**(2) Vivendi Universal's claim constitutes a derivative claim forbidden by Argentine and international law**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe objection of the Argentine Republic that Vivendi Universal cannot proceed as a claimant because it is only a shareholder in CAA (a minority shareholding was asserted) must also fail and is hereby dismissed.\n\n89.\n\nAs noted above, the First Tribunal held that CAA's majority shareholder - then CGE -could pursue the treaty claims it asserted. For the reasons already noted, that holding, not having been annulled (and indeed having been endorsed by the *ad hoc* Committee) is *res judicata.*\n\n90.\n\nEven if this were not case, there is really no question that the ICSID Convention and the France-Argentina BIT give corporate shareholders, whether majority or minority, the status of investors.\n\n91.\n\nUnder Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Centre's jurisdiction extends to any legal dispute *\".arising directly out of an investment*\" between an investor of one Contracting State and another Contracting State. Each Contracting State thus may define the \"*investments*\" as to which it will accept the Centre's jurisdiction through its consent under Article 25(1) of the Convention.72\n\nSchreuer, ICSID Convention at 124.\n\n92.\n\nAs the instrument of Argentina's consent, the Argentina-France BIT thus provides the applicable definition of \"*investment*\", and this definition explicitly includes shares. Article 1 of the BIT provides, in pertinent part:\n\n*For purposes of this Agreement: 1. The term \"investments\" means assets such as property, rights and interests of any kind and in particular. shares, stock and other forms of participation, even minor or indirect, in companies incorporated within the territory of the Contracting Parties.73*\n\nBIT at Art. 1(1) (\"*El t\u00e9rmino \"inversiones\" designa los activos tales como los bienes, derechos e intereses de cualquier naturaleza y, en particular, aunque no exclusivamente:.b) las acciones, primas de emsi\u00f3n y otras formas de participaci\u00f3n, a\u00fan minoritarias o indirectas, en las sociedades constitu\u00eddas en el territorio de una de las Partes Contratantes.\")*.\n\n93.\n\nThus, under the BIT, it is evident that a foreign shareholder's investment in shares of a domestically incorporated company constitutes an \"*investment\"*. The BIT, in turn, entitles investors who make such shareholding investments to bring claims for Argentina's alleged breaches of the Treaty's protections with respect to those investments.\n\n94.\n\nFinally, numerous arbitral tribunals have rejected this very same jurisdictional objection as shown by the 18 cases referred to in Appendix 1 to this Decision. In each of those eighteen cases the tribunals upheld the right of shareholders to pursue such claims. In 11 cases, the Argentine Republic was respondent and asserted, and lost, this same objection. In the last one of these cases, the Tribunal observed that the very objection which Argentina raises in this case \"*has been made numerous times, never, so far as the Tribunal has been aware, with success\".74*\n\n*Gas Natural SDG, S.A. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/10, Decision of the Tribunal on Preliminary Question on Jurisdiction, 17 June 2005.\n\n**(3) CAA did not acquire French \"nationality\" under the protection of the Argentine/French BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nArgentina's third objection to jurisdiction, that CAA lacks standing as a claimant, having not properly acquired French nationality under the Convention and the BIT, was explicitly advanced before and considered by the First Tribunal.\n\n96.\n\nThe First Tribunal's summary of the history of CAA's equity ownership discloses that a majority of CAA equity was under French ownership well before the parties consented to submit this dispute to arbitration on 26 December, 1996.75 As previously noted, the *ad hoc* Committee endorsed the First Tribunal's finding that CAA was a French company under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.76\n\n*See* Award at n. 6.\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b648 and 50.\n\n97.\n\nBecause the First Tribunal found that CAA was a French company under the ICSID Convention and the BIT and the *ad hoc* Committee did not annul this finding, the finding remains in force and is *res judicata.* Accordingly, Argentina's third jurisdictional objection is dismissed.\n\n**(4) CAA and Vivendi Universal failed to comply with essential preconditions to instituting an ICSID arbitration proceeding**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe fundamental problem with this objection is Respondent's failure to identify a jurisdictional requirement that the documentation submitted by Claimants fails to satisfy. Objections to jurisdiction must be premised on a failure to satisfy an element of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention or the jurisdictional limitations of the France-Argentina BIT. The Respondent's documentary complaints bear on neither of these.\n\n99.\n\nAccording to Professor Schreuer, the corporate authorization requirement is not a jurisdictional requirement. As he explains in his Commentary, \"*it is merely a rule of procedure\"*. Indeed, designation of legal representatives is not even required in a Claimant's Request for Arbitration.77\n\n*See* Schreuer, The ICSID Convention, 456 at \u00b636.\n\n100.\n\nWhen faced with shortcomings under Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Institution Rule 2, the ICSID Secretary-General need not decline to register the Request. Rather, the Secretary-General may consult with the claimant and provide it with *\"an opportunity to supplement or correct their request before he takes a decision on its registration\".78*\n\nSchreuer, The ICSID Convention, 458 at \u00b642.\n\n101.\n\nThe Secretary-General employed exactly this procedure when Claimants filed their Original Request on 26 December 1996. On 3 January 1997, ICSID advised Claimants of its satisfaction with the information it had received on CGE's behalf, attesting to CGE's authorization of the Request.79 However, in the same letter, it requested that CAA, as a condition for the registration of the Request, submit evidence demonstrating that the filing of the Request was authorized under CAA's internal procedures. On 15 January 1997, ICSID sent another letter to Claimants, acknowledging receipt of the requested additional evidence that CAA had been properly authorized to file the Request.80\n\n*See* letter from ICSID to Claimants 3 January 1997 (Exhibit 364) (05689).\n\n*See* letter from ICSID to Claimants 15 January 1997 (Exhibit 365) (05790).\n\n102.\n\nNo request for supplementation of the information and materials provided by the Claimants in support of their Second Request for Arbitration was made and the Second Request was duly registered.\n\n103.\n\nIn any event, as Professor Schreuer explains,\n\n*...once a request has been registered, the tribunal must ascertain the existence of all jurisdictional requirements on the basis of Art. 25 in the light of all available evidence. Omissions, errors and other deficiencies in their request for arbitration are not an independent basis for the tribunal to decline jurisdiction.81*\n\nSchreuer, The ICSID Convention, 456 at \u00b636.\n\n104.\n\nBecause Claimants' Second Request was registered on 23 October 2003, any possible deficiencies in that Request cannot now be raised and, even if they could, would not operate as a bar to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. For each of these reasons, Respondent's fourth objection is dismissed.\n\n**(5) Claimants' claims are prohibited under the terms of the** ***ad hoc*** **Committee's Decision**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nRespondent's argument on this objection evolved in the course of the jurisdictional phase. Taking into account the written memorials and the oral submissions, the Tribunal summarises Respondent's argument as follows: in light of the *ad hoc* Committee's Decision (i) the majority of Claimants' claims, which are essentially contractual in nature, must be considered as being barred from consideration by this Tribunal; and (ii) this Tribunal's jurisdiction should be limited to a consideration of the claims based on a conspiracy of the authorities of Tucum\u00e1n to frustrate the Concession contract. As will be explained below, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that Respondent's argument misconstrues the *ad hoc* Committee's Decision.\n\n106.\n\nIn the jurisdictional portion of its award, the First Tribunal held that:\n\n*In this case the claims filed by CGE against Respondent are based on violation by the Argentine Republic of the BIT through.the acts of the Tucum\u00e1n Authorities that Claimants assert should be attributed to the central government. As formulated, these claims against the Argentine Republic are not subject to the jurisdiction of the contentious administrative tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n, if only because, ex hypothesi, those claims are not based on the Concession Contract but allege a cause of action under the BIT.82*\n\nThus, in the earlier jurisdictional phase, the First Tribunal found it had jurisdiction over all claims arising under the BIT, including BIT claims relating to rights and obligations under the Concession Contract *.*\n\nAward at \u00b653.\n\n107.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee did not annul this finding but instead confirmed it.83 Hence, like all other non-annulled findings of the First Tribunal, this one is *res judicata* and the only issue that arises here is a question of interpretation of the *ad hoc* Committee's Decision.\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b6119.\n\n108.\n\nAccording to the Committee, the standards set forth in Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT are \"*independent*\" from Argentine law standards for breach of contract.84 Argentina thus *\".may breach [the] treaty without breaching [the] contract and vice versa\".85* It logically follows that *\".whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether that has been a breach of contract are different questions\"* to *\"be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law.86*\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b695.\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b695.\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b696.\n\n109.\n\nIn fact, Respondent asks this Tribunal to adopt precisely the approach, which led to the annulment of the First Award. According to the *ad hoc* Committee:\n\n*... the inquiry which the ICSID Tribunal is required to undertake is one governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law. Such an inquiry is neither in principle determined, nor precluded, by any issue of municipal law, including any municipal law agreement of the parties.87*\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b6102.\n\n110.\n\nThe Committee further stated:\n\n*The Claim was not simply reducible to so many civil or administrative law claims concerning so many individual acts alleged to violate the Concession Contract or the administrative law of Argentina. It was open to Claimants to claim, and they did claim, that these acts taken together, or some of them, amounted to a breach of Articles 3 and/or 5 of the BIT. In the Committee's view, the Tribunal, faced with such a claim and having validly held that it had jurisdiction, was obliged to consider and to decide it.88*\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b6112.\n\n111.\n\nIn other words, the claims presented in the First Arbitration, which are identical to those in these proceedings, are Treaty claims. The fact that they are related to the Concession Contract does not change their nature. Whether the conduct complained of constitutes a Treaty breach (as opposed to, or as well as a contract violation) is another issue, which remains to be considered at the merits stage of this arbitration.\n\n112.\n\nBecause the First Tribunal failed to consider and rule on these Treaty claims, the Committee found that it had \"*manifestly exceeded it powers*\" under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, it annulled this portion of the Award.89\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b6115.\n\n113.\n\nRespondent also argues that this Tribunal is limited to reviewing a claim of conspiracy or concerted action under the BIT. It bases this argument on a passage in the Annulment Decision, which states that the Claimants asserted that the conduct of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities \"*amounted on the whole to concerted action [\u2026] to frustrate the concession*\".90 It is obvious, however, that this passage contains no restriction on the ICSID Tribunal's jurisdiction over the Treaty claims. Other passages in the Annulment Decision make it abundantly clear that the First Tribunal had the duty to rule on Treaty claims without a limitation to conspiracy, and so does this Tribunal.\n\nDecision on Annulment, at \u00b6106.\n\n114.\n\nBecause the *ad hoc* Committee affirmed the jurisdiction of the First Tribunal and annulled the portion of the First Tribunal's Award where it declined to deal with those claims on the merits, this Tribunal is now charged with resolving all claims for Treaty breach, including contract-related Treaty claims. It follows that we must also dismiss Respondent's fifth jurisdictional objection. Hence, Respondent's alternative requests91 that the issue of jurisdiction be joined to the merits or that jurisdiction be affirmed but limited to Treaty claims of conspiracy or concerted actions must also be dismissed.\n\nTranscript, at pp. 59-60.\n\n**I. THE COSTS OF THIS JURISDICTIONAL PHASE**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nEach of the parties in their written submissions sought an award of costs and attorneys fees in connection with these proceedings.92\n\n*See* Respondent's Exception to the Jurisdiction of the Centre and the Competence of the Tribunal at IV. PETITION \u00b643 and Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction at \u00b6\u00b6123-126.\n\n116.\n\nDuring the course of the oral hearing, the Tribunal asked the parties whether they sought an award of costs and legal fees to be made now and payable now in the event of a finding in its/their favour.93\n\nTranscript at 116.\n\n117.\n\nCounsel for Claimants confirmed that this was the case and that their application for costs persisted.94\n\nTranscript at 117.\n\n118.\n\nCounsel for the Argentine Republic requested the ability to take instructions overnight and, at the conclusion of its Reply arguments, withdrew its claim for Claimants to pay costs and legal fees if the Argentine Republic was successful on its objections. Instead, it advised the Tribunal that it now felt it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to assess costs to either party, given that\n\n*We are faced with a case that is being looked at during a historic stage in ICSID's history. It's a new submission of a case that was annulled, which has brought to the floor very delicate, very sensitive topics and issues on which there is no precedent or practical guidance as to how the parties should perform and how the Tribunal should perform or act.95*\n\nTranscript at 176.\n\n119.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Tribunal requested a report to be filed on 31 August 2005 in support of Claimants' request for an award of costs, including attorneys' fees, associated with these jurisdictional proceedings, with Respondent being given the opportunity to comment thereon one week later.\n\n120.\n\nIn its comments on Claimants' Memorandum on Costs, Respondent made the points, *inter alia*, that Arbitration Rule 47(1) limits:\n\n(i) A tribunal's ability to make a decision regarding the costs of a proceeding to an award and that an interim decision upholding jurisdiction under Article 41 is not an award and consequently cannot properly contain a decision on costs, and\n\n(ii) Although Arbitration Rule 28 allows a tribunal to decide that related costs shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of the parties, this rule deals with prospective costs yet to be incurred and is solely concerned with the fees of the tribunal and the charges of the Centre. It does not include attorneys' fees or other costs incurred by a party.\n\n121.\n\nThe First Tribunal, when it came to consider the question of costs and fees, noted that neither the BIT nor the provisions of the ICSID Convention include a provision directing how a Tribunal should regulate the costs and fees of the parties. It noted that ICSID Tribunals, and international arbitration tribunals generally, have not followed a uniform practice with respect to the award of costs. After drawing attention to a number of facts the tribunal in the *Robert Azinian* case had relied on in declining to award costs or fees to either party, it noted that:\n\n*The instant case raised a set of novel and complex issue not previously addressed in international arbitral precedent relating to the interplay of a bilateral investment treaty, a Concession Contract with a forum-selection clause and the ICSID Convention. Counsel for both parties have presented their arguments, written and oral, in an efficient and professional manner and have extensively briefed these issues of first impression. Finally, the position of both parties evolved in the course of the proceeding as their respective arguments and the enquiries of the Tribunal caused them to clarify their positions.96*\n\nAward at \u00b695.\n\n122.\n\nIn the circumstances, the First Tribunal decided that each side should bear its own expenses for the proceedings and that the two sides bear equally the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre.97\n\nAward at \u00b696.\n\n123.\n\nDuring the annulment phase, the *ad hoc* Committee decided that:\n\n*In light of the importance of the arguments advanced by the parties in connection with this case, the Committee considers it appropriate that each party bear its own expenses incurred with respect to these annulment proceeding.98*\n\nDecision on Annulment, at \u00b6118.\n\n124.\n\nHowever, with respect to Argentina's Subsequent Request for Supplementation and Rectification of its Decision Concerning Annulment of the Award, the *ad hoc* Committee concluded that:\n\n*The same cannot, however, be said of the present phase of the proceeding. Indeed, in all but two instances, the Committee has found that the various requests that comprise Respondent's Requests are not only unfounded but inappropriate, consisting essentially of attempts to re-argue substantive elements of the Committee's Decision.99*\n\nDecision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Request for Supplementation and Rectification of its Decision Concerning the Annulment of the Award, at \u00b643.\n\n125.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Committee ordered Argentina to pay the entirety of the fees and expenses incurred by the Committee in connection with that Request. It concluded that each party should bear its own costs in connection with the Request.\n\n126.\n\nIn the present instance, we have concluded not only that each of Argentina's objections is without merit, but that each of objections one, two, three and five has previously been taken before the First Tribunal and the *ad hoc* Committee. Indeed, objection three has previously been made before numerous other tribunals before which Argentina has appeared. As regards objection four, it is advanced for the first time, eight and a half years into these proceedings, a year and a half after registration of the Second Request and eight months after the first meeting of this Tribunal with the Parties.\n\n127.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes not only that Respondent's five objections are unfounded but that they have been raised inappropriately at this stage of these proceedings, in an attempt, for the most part, to reargue elements of the First Tribunal's jurisdictional decision, as endorsed by the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n128.\n\nNevertheless, we conclude that it is appropriate to reserve all questions concerning costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the parties for subsequent determination. In so doing, the Tribunal takes due note of Claimants' request that Respondent bears all of the costs of this jurisdictional phase, including legal fees.\n\n**J. THE TRIBUNAL'S OPERATIVE ORDER**\n-------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal DECIDES:\n\n(a) Each of Respondent's objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of this Tribunal is rejected;\n\n(b) Respondent's Counter-Memorial shall be filed on or before the later of 17 October 2005, or fifteen (15) days after this Decision.\n\n(c) Claimants' Reply shall be filed on or before a date sixty (60) days following the date established for the filing of Respondent's Counter-Memorial.\n\n(d) Respondent's Rejoinder shall be filed on or before a date sixty (60) days following the date established for the filing of Claimants' Reply.\n\n(e) All questions concerning costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the parties in connection with this jurisdictional phase of these proceedings are reserved for subsequent determination by the Tribunal.\n\nDone in English and Spanish, both versions being equally authoritative.\n\n**K.

Overview**\n-----------------\n\n1.1.1.\n\nThis case arises out of the troubled relationship which developed between the parties to a 1995 \"Concession Agreement\" which privatised (as it turned out, unsuccessfully) the water and sewage services of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n (\"Tucum\u00e1n\" or the \"Province\") in the Argentine Republic (\"Argentine Republic\" or \"Argentina\"). The original signatories to the Concession Agreement were a French company, Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux (\"CGE\" now Vivendi Universal S.A., \"Vivendi\"), its Argentine affiliate, Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. (\"CAA\") Benito Roggio e Hijos S.A. (\"Roggio\"), Dragados y Construcciones (\"DYCASA\"), and the Province.\n\n1.1.2.\n\nThe Argentine Republic was not a party to the Concession Agreement but is party to a bilateral investment treaty signed on 3 July 1991 with the French Republic -Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the French Republic for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (\"BIT\" or \"Treaty\").1 Both Argentina and France are also parties to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and other Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\") which entered into force for both states prior to signature of the Concession Agreement.2\n\nThe BIT was published as Argentine Law No. 24,100, Boletin Oficial 14 July 1992; Acuerdo Entre el Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Francesa Para la Promoci\u00f3n y la Protecci\u00f3n Reciproca de Las Inversiones, 3 July 1991 (Exhibit 310).\n\nEntered into force for Argentina on 18 November 1984; entered into force for France on 20 September 1967.\n\n1.1.3.\n\nThe case has a protracted history, the current dispute having been the subject of prior ICSID proceedings before the Centre. In those proceedings, pursuant to a Request for Arbitration filed by CGE and CAA on 26 December 1996, a duly appointed tribunal comprised of Judge Francisco Rezek - President, Judge Thomas Buergenthal and Mr. Peter Trooboff (\"First Tribunal\" or \"Original Tribunal\"), rendered an award on 21 November 2000 (\"First Award\" or \"Original Award\").3\n\nThe Original Award is published at 16 ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ 641 (2001); 40 ILM 426 (2001); 125 I.L.R. 1 (2004); 26 Y.B. Com. Arb. 61 (2001) (excerpts); Spanish translation of English original in La Ley (Buenos Aires) A\u00f1o LXV No. 25, February 5, 2001, p. 1. The text of the Original Award is also available online through http://www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n1.1.4.\n\nOn 20 March 2001, a Request for Partial Annulment was filed by CAA and CGE\u2019s successor, Vivendi, and on 3 July 2002, a duly constituted *\"ad hoc* Committee\", comprised of Mr. Yves Fortier - President, Professor James Crawford and Professor Jos\u00e9 Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Rozas, rendered a Decision on Annulment (\"Decision on Annulment\").4\n\nThe Decision on Annulment is published at 19 ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ 89 (2004); 41 ILM 1135 (2002); 6 ICSID Rep. 340 (2004); 125 I.L.R. 58 (2004); French translation of English and Spanish originals in 130 Journal du droit international 195 (2003). The text of the Decision on Annulment is also available online through http://www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n1.1.5.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee decided, *inter alia,* that the First Tribunal rightly held that it had jurisdiction over the claims before it, but that it had exceeded its powers by not examining the merits of the claims based on actions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities under the BIT. Accordingly, the Committee annulled the First Tribunal\u2019s decision with regard to those claims. The *ad hoc* Committee did not annul the First Tribunal\u2019s findings with respect to the claims \"based directly on alleged actions or failures to act of the Argentine Republic\" (the \"Federal Claims\").5\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b616.\n\n1.1.6.\n\nOn 26 August 2002, Respondent submitted to the Secretary-General of ICSID a Request for Supplementation and Rectification of some aspects of the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s Decision. By Decision dated 26 May 2003, the *ad hoc* Committee denied Respondent\u2019s Request for a Supplementary Decision and, with one minor exception (having to do with a typographical error), denied Respondent\u2019s Request for Rectification.6\n\nThe Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Request for Supplementation and Rectification of its Decision Concerning Annulment of the Award (3 May 2003) is published at 19 ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ 139 (2004); 8 ICSID Rep. 490 (2005). The text is also available online through http://www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n1.1.7.\n\nBy a Request for Arbitration dated 29 August 2003 (\"Second Request\"), Vivendi and CAA (\"Claimants\" in these proceedings) resubmitted the dispute to ICSID pursuant to Article 55(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Claimants sought adjudication by a new tribunal of the issues as to which the First Award had been annulled, namely the merits of their BIT Claim arising out of the alleged acts and omissions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities. As to the merits, Claimants assert that the Tucum\u00e1n authorities denied Claimants fair and equitable treatment in connection with the Concession Agreement and expropriated their investment without compensation.\n\n1.1.8.\n\nClaimants say that the Argentine Republic is internationally responsible for the impugned acts and omissions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities and that Respondent has therefore violated Claimants\u2019 rights under Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT.\n\n1.1.9.\n\nClaimants seek to recover damages in the sum of US$316,923,000.00 plus interest compounded at 9.70% from 27 November 1997.7\n\nMemorial at \u00b6\u00b6404-409.\n\n1.1.10.\n\nClaimants\u2019 investments having been made in US dollars and/or French francs, Claimants request that any award be made in US dollars.\n\n1.1.11.\n\nAs will be evident from this award (\"Award\") and our previous Decision on Jurisdiction, the \"Tribunal\" has been greatly assisted by the submissions of counsel, who, in turn, were helped by many others whose names do not appear in the transcription of the hearings. It is therefore appropriate, at the beginning of this Award to record our appreciation of the scholarship and industry which counsel for the disputing parties have brought to bear during these complicated and lengthy proceedings, together with their respective experts, assistants and other advisors.\n\n**1.2. The Parties**\n--------------------\n\n**Claimants**\n-------------\n\n1.2.1.\n\nCAA is a company established and organised under the laws of Argentina with its principal place of business at the following address:\n\nCompa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A.\n\nCatamarca 444\n\nC4000ITJ - San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n\n\nProvincia de Tucum\u00e1n Argentina\n\n1.2.2.\n\nVivendi is a company established and organised under the laws of France with its principal place of business at the following address:\n\nVivendi Universal S.A.\n\n42 Avenue de Friedland\n\n75008 Paris\n\nFrance\n\n1.2.3.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction,8 the Tribunal found Vivendi to be the successor-in-interest to CGE, a company also established and organised under the laws of France.9\n\nAs defined below under the heading \"Decision on Jurisdiction\".\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction at \u00b682.\n\n**Respondent**\n--------------\n\n1.2.4.\n\nRespondent is the Argentine Republic.\n\n**1.3. The Parties\u2019 Representatives**\n-------------------------------------\n\n1.3.1.\n\nClaimants were represented in this proceeding by:\n\n1.3.2.\n\nRespondent was represented in this proceeding by:\n\n**1.4. The Arbitral Tribunal and Secretaries**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1.4.1.\n\nThe present tribunal was constituted on 14 April 2004, as follows:\n\n1.4.2.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s administrative secretary was Dr. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Counsel, ICSID, World Bank, Washington DC. The Tribunal also acknowledges the considerable support received from ICSID generally and particularly from Mrs. Mercedes Kurowski, Ms. Ashley Grubor, Ms. Michelle Salomon and Mr. Malkiat Singh.\n\n1.4.3.\n\nMs. Lisa Parliament of McMillan Binch Mendelsohn, Toronto, Canada acted as Assistant to the Tribunal. Ms. Parliament\u2019s appointment was made with the agreement of the disputing parties. As Assistant to the Tribunal she assumed the same obligations of impartiality, independence and confidentiality as the members of the Tribunal.\n\n**2. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n**2.1. Original Award**\n-----------------------\n\n2.1.1.\n\nAs stated above, the First Award was annulled in part. Given that a number of the parties arguments before us turn on both the First Tribunal\u2019s holdings, and the analysis made by the *ad hoc* Committee of the First Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, it is useful to highlight here aspects of the First Award and the Decision on Annulment of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n2.1.2.\n\nBecause of its importance to an understanding of the First Award and the Decision on Annulment it is helpful to record the terms of Article 16.4 of the Concession Agreement - the exclusive jurisdiction clause - which provides:\n\n*\"For purposes of interpretation and application of this* *Contract, the parties submit themselves to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Contentious Administrative Tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n. \"10*\n\nConcesi\u00f3n del Servicio de Agua y Desag\u00fces Cloacales en la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n, Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n (Concession Agreement), with Annexes XIV, XX-XXIII, 18 May 1995 (Exhibit 127), at Article 16.4.\n\n2.1.3.\n\nHaving joined to the merits all issues which had been raised as to jurisdiction, the First Tribunal, in the Original Award, rejected each of Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction. It also dismissed each of Claimants\u2019 so-called federal claims (ie, claims arising from alleged acts or omissions on the part of the federal authorities). The First Tribunal\u2019s overall conclusion as to those claims was as follows:\n\n*\"In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the record of these proceedings does not provide a basis for holding that the Argentine Republic failed to respond to the situation in Tucum\u00e1n and the requests of the Claimants in accordance with the obligations of the Argentine Government under the BIT\"11*\n\nFirst Award at \u00b692.\n\n2.1.4.\n\nAs to the provincial claims, the First Tribunal found that:\n\n*\"...the nature of the facts supporting most of the claims presented in this case make it impossible for the Tribunal to distinguish or separate violations of the BIT from breaches of the Concession Contract without first interpreting and applying the detailed provisions of that agreement...* *Accordingly, and because the claims in this case arise almost exclusively from alleged acts of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n that relate directly to its performance under the Concession Contract, the Tribunal holds that the Claimants had a duty to pursue their rights with respect to such claims against Tucum\u00e1n in the contentious administrative courts of Tucum\u00e1n as required by Article 16.4 of their Concession Contract\".12*\n\nFirst Award, Part A, p. 3.\n\n**2.2. Annulment Decision**\n---------------------------\n\n2.2.1.\n\nAs previously noted, the *ad hoc* Committee decided that the First Tribunal rightly held it had jurisdiction over the Claims before it, but that it had exceeded its powers when it failed to examine the merits of the claims for acts of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities under the BIT.\n\n2.2.2.\n\nIn reaching its decision on this latter point, the *ad hoc* Committee observed:\n\n*\"...where the \"fundamental basis of the claim \" is a treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, the existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract between the claimant and the respondent state or one of its subdivisions cannot operate as a bar to the application of the treaty standard.* *At most, it might be relevant - as municipal law will often be relevant - in assessing whether there has been a breach of the treaty. \"13*\n\n*\"In the Committee\u2019s view, it is not open to an ICSID tribunal having jurisdiction under a BIT in respect of a claim based upon a substantive provision of that BIT, to* *dismiss the claim on the ground that it could or should have been dealt with by a national court. \"14*\n\n*\"A state cannot rely on an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract to avoid the characterisation of its conduct as internationally unlawful under a treaty. \"15*\n\n*\"...it is one thing to exercise contractual jurisdiction (arguably exclusively vested in the administrative tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n by virtue of the Concession Contract) and another to take into account the terms of a contract in determining whether there has been a breach of a distinct standard of international law, such as that reflected in Article 3 of the BIT. \"16*\n\n*\"...whether particular conduct involves a breach of a treaty is not determined by asking whether the conduct purportedly involves an exercise of contractual rights. \"17*\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b6101. The *ad hoc* Committee noted that it may be that \"mere\" breaches of contract, accompanied by bad faith or other aggravating circumstances, will rarely amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standards set out in Article 3. However, the First Tribunal failed to offer any interpretation of that Article, nor did it seek to base its rationale on this consideration.\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b6102.\n\n*Ibid.,* at \u00b6103.\n\n*Ibid.,* at \u00b6105.\n\n*Ibid.,* at \u00b6 **1** 10. In connection with this statement, the *ad hoc* Committee cited the ILC Articles, commentary to Article 4, para. (6); commentary to Article 12, paras. (9) - (10), and also C. Amerasinghe, \"State Breaches of Contract with Aliens and International Law,\" *American Journal of International Law,* vol. 58 (1964), p. 881 at pp. 910-912: \"The general proposition that, where a state performs an act which is prohibited by a treaty to which it is a party, it will be responsible for a breach of international law to the other party or parties to the treaty requires no substantiation. In accordance with the same principle, an act which constitutes a breach of contract would be a breach of international law, if it is an act which that state is under an obligation not to commit by virtue of a treaty to which it and the national state of the alien are parties\"; R. Jennings & A. Watts, *Oppenheim\u2019s International Law* (9th edn.) (Harlow Longman, 1992) p. 927: \"It is doubtful whether a breach by a state of its contractual obligations with aliens constitutes *per se* a breach of an international obligation, unless there is some such additional element as denial of justice, or expropriation, or breach of treaty, in which case it is that additional element which will constitute the basis for the state\u2019s international responsibility.\"\n\n2.2.3.\n\nAfter noting that it was not its function to form even a provisional view as to whether or not the Tucum\u00e1n conduct involved a breach of the BIT, and stating clearly that it had not done so, the *ad hoc* Committee nonetheless concluded that the conduct alleged by claimants, if established, *could* breach the BIT. Accordingly, it annulled the decision of the First Tribunal so far as it concerned the *entirety* of the Tucum\u00e1n claims.\n\n**2.3. The Resubmitted Dispute**\n--------------------------------\n\n2.3.1.\n\nFollowing the Decision on Annulment, on 29 August 2003, Claimants resubmitted the dispute to ICSID, seeking a determination of the merits of the claims with respect to which the Original Award was annulled. The resubmitted case continues to bear the same case number, assigned to the original case.\n\n**2.4. Pleadings and Agreed Procedural Timetable for the Resubmitted Dispute**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.4.1.\n\nThe present Tribunal was constituted on 14 April 2004 and held its first session with the parties on 7 July 2004 at the offices of the World Bank in Washington DC.\n\n2.4.2.\n\nAt the first session, the parties confirmed that they had no objection to the constitution of the Tribunal. Following the expression of the parties\u2019 views and in consideration of the agreements reached between the parties, a timetable for production of documents, written submissions and a substantive hearing was established.\n\n2.4.3.\n\nAt this time, the parties also agreed, *inter alia,* that statements from witnesses who were not available for cross-examination at the oral hearing were not to be taken into evidence by the Tribunal. The parties further agreed to include with their written submissions not only their legal argument, but also all of the evidence on which they intended to reply for the legal arguments advanced therein. The parties agreed that the Tribunal was not to receive any testimony or other evidence that had not been introduced in writing, unless the Tribunal determined that exceptional circumstances existed. The agreement of the parties with respect to the submission of evidence and the attendance of witnesses proved significant during the course of the hearing, as discussed further below at 2.7.6 *et* *seq.*\n\n2.4.4.\n\nPrior to the hearing on the merits, and in accordance with the procedure and timetable established by the Tribunal (with subsequent amendments as to timetabling thereafter), the disputing parties made written submissions to the Tribunal as set out below:\n\n(i) Memorial of Claimants, 24 November 2004;\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s Exception to the Jurisdiction of the Centre and the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal, 7 April 2005;\n\n(iii) Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, 31 May 2005;\n\n(iv) Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction (entitled Rej oinder Brief About Objections Raised), 21 June 2005;\n\n(v) Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, 12 July 2005;\n\n(vi) Counter-Memorial of Respondent, 29 November 2005;\n\n(vii) Reply of Claimants, 15 February 2006;\n\n(viii) Rejoinder Memorial of Respondent, 19 May 2006.\n\n**2.5. Argentina\u2019s Objections to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.5.1.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed timetable, Claimants filed their Memorial on 24 November 2004.\n\n2.5.2.\n\nOn 23 March 2005, approximately two weeks before the due date for the submission of its Counter-Memorial, Respondent filed an Exception to the Jurisdiction of the Centre and the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal, in which it raised objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and this Tribunal. Those objections can be summarised as follows:\n\n(i) Vivendi had not established itself as the successor-in-interest to CGE. Rather, through a series of complicated corporate changes that occurred after the filing of the first Request but before the filing of the Second Request, Veolia Environment succeeded to CGE\u2019s majority shareholding in CAA and Vivendi currently owns only 5.3% of Veolia Environment\u2019s issued and outstanding shares (on the date of the Second Request it held only 20.4% of such shares);\n\n(ii) being presently only an indirect minority shareholder of CAA, Vivendi\u2019s current claims are derivative and derivative claims are forbidden under both Argentine and international law;\n\n(iii) with respect to CAA\u2019s claims, CAA had not obtained its French nationality for protection pursuant to the terms of Argentina-France BIT and to the extent that it had acquired any protection under the treaty it had done so illegitimately through transfers and transactions in violation of the Concession Agreement;\n\n(iv) CAA and Vivendi had failed to comply with Rule 36(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 2(l)(f) of the Institution Rules; and\n\n(v) the *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s Decision on Annulment precludes consideration of purely contractual claims (ie, for breach of the Concession Agreement). To the extent that the present Tribunal has jurisdiction, it is limited to claims for breach of the BIT which are grounded in allegations of conspiracy or based on facts which constitute a concerted effort by the Tucum\u00e1n authorities to frustrate the Concession Agreement.\n\n2.5.3.\n\nOn 12 April 2005, having considered Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and the parties submissions of 1 and 7 April 2005, the Tribunal decided that Respondent\u2019s objections required to be dealt with as a preliminary question. The parties thereupon exchanged a series of submissions on jurisdiction (as described in the next preceding section).\n\n**2.6. Decision on Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------\n\n2.6.1.\n\nAfter a two-day oral hearing on jurisdiction, held on 16-17 August 2005 in Washington, D.C., the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction on 14 November 2005, rejecting each of Respondent\u2019s objections.18\n\nA copy of the Decision on Jurisdiction has been published online at http://www.iisd.org/pdf/2006/itn\\_vivendi\\_decision.pdf.\n\n2.6.2.\n\nBecause Respondent continues to assert defences based on CAA not being a proper claimant under the Treaty,19 it is helpful to set out here a number of the findings made by the First Tribunal, the *ad hoc* Committee and this Tribunal in respect of Respondent\u2019s successive jurisdictional arguments concerning CAA\u2019s standing.\n\nMemorial at \u00b6\u00b6467-415.\n\n2.6.3.\n\nIn rejecting Argentina\u2019s initial objections to jurisdiction, the First Tribunal found that:\n\n*\"This case concerns a claim against the Argentine Republic submitted to ICSID by CGE, a French corporation that operates water and sewage systems in France and other countries, and also by CGE\u2019s Argentine affiliate, CAA. \"20*\n\nFirst Award at \u00b624.\n\n2.6.4.\n\nThe First Tribunal explained this finding in footnote 6 of the First Award in the following language:\n\n*\"Respondent argued that CAA should not be treated as a* *French investor because this acquisition occurred after disputes had arisen between CGE and Tucum\u00e1n (Resp.* *Mem. at App. B, Note relating to CGE\u2019s Acquisition). CGE responded that the critical date for purposes of determining control under Article 25(2)(b) and under precedent* *interpreting the ICSID Convention is the date for consent to arbitration and that is the date in late 1996 when CGE submitted the dispute to arbitration. All parties agree that by late 1996 CGE had acquired the Dycasa shares.... For purposes of resolving the issues addressed by this Award, the Tribunal has determined that CGE controlled CAA and that CAA should be considered a French investor from the effective date of the Concession Contract. \"*\n\n2.6.5.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee did not annul this positive finding; it expressly endorsed it.\n\n*\"Moreover it cannot be argued that CGE did not have an \"investment\" in CAA from the date of the conclusion of the Concession Contract, or that it was not an \"investor \" in respect of its own shareholding, whether or not it had overall control of CAA. Whatever the extent of its investment may have been, it was entitled to invoke the BIT in respect of conduct alleged to constitute a breach of Articles 3 or 5. It is also clear that CGE controlled CAA at the time the proceedings were commenced, so that there was no question that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over CAA as one of the Claimants in the arbitration. In the circumstances, and for the purposes of the present proceedings, the Committee does not need to reach any conclusion on the precise extent of CAA\u2019s and CGE\u2019s treaty rights at different times. \"21*\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b650.\n\n2.6.6.\n\nUltimately, the *ad hoc* Committee concluded that \"the Tribunal rightly held that it had jurisdiction over the claims.\"22\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b6119.\n\n2.6.7.\n\nAmongst the various objections raised as to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, Respondent sought to rely on events subsequent to the date CGE submitted its claim to arbitration to show that Vivendi had not established itself as the successor to CGE.\n\n2.6.8.\n\nAs to this aspect of Respondent\u2019s objections, this Tribunal rejected Respondent\u2019s allegation that there had been a change in the CAA\u2019s corporate ownership subsequent to the Decision on Annulment of the *ad hoc* Committee. In doing so, we held that:\n\n*\"The evidence before this Tribunal demonstrates that, in May 1998, CGE changed its name to Vivendi S.A., which then merged with several other companies to form the company Vivendi Universal. Vivendi Universal continues to this date to hold the majority stake in CAA that was acquired at the time by CGE. \"23*\n\n*\"In these circumstances, the Tribunal has no difficulty whatever in concluding that the parties to the resubmitted case are the same as the parties below. \"24*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction at \u00b682.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction at \u00b686. However, we also concluded that, as a consequence of the well-established rule of international law, as expressed by the ICJ in the *Lockerbie Case,* that: \"The consequence of this rule is that, once established, jurisdiction cannot be diverted. It simply is not affected by subsequent events. Events occurring after the institution of proceedings (other than, in a case like this, an *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s Decision to annul the prior jurisdictional finding) cannot withdraw the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the dispute.\" See, Decision on Jurisdiction at \u00b663.\n\n**2.7. Hearing on the Merits and Evidentiary Matters**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.7.1.\n\nA hearing on the merits was held from 24 July to 4 August 2006, (over 11 working days) at the seat of the Centre at the offices of the World Bank in Washington, D.C. The hearing was recorded by transcript.\n\n2.7.2.\n\nAt the hearing, the Tribunal heard oral testimony from the following witnesses presented by Claimants:\n\nMr. Daniel Benquis Mr. Christian Lefaix\n\nMr. Charles-Louis de Maud\u2019huy Mr. Jos\u00e9 Alvaro Padilla\n\nMr. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez Ms. Dominique Perrier\n\nDr. Herman J. Gibb Mr. J. Alan Roberson\n\nMr. G\u00e9rald Gu\u00e9rin Mr. Fran\u00e7ois de Rochambeau\n\nMr. R\u00e9gis Hahn Mr. Walter Velarde\n\n2.7.3.\n\nThe Tribunal also heard oral testimony from the following witnesses presented by Respondent:\n\nMr. Daniel Esteban Arancibia Mr. Angel Maria Garcia Pinto\n\nMr. Pr\u00f3spero Barrionuevo Mr. Ra\u00fal Gil Romero\n\nMs. Silvia Estela Courel Mr. Emilio Lentini\n\nMr. Franco Davolio Mr. Ra\u00fal Roque Topa\n\nMr. Fortunato Carlos Duguech Mr. Daniel Arturo Vaca\n\n2.7.4.\n\nIn addition to the evidence received at the oral hearing, Claimants filed witness statements and/or expert reports from:\n\nDaniel Benquis R\u00e9gis Hahn\n\nAlberto B. Bianchi Herve Jauffret\n\nCarmen Broudeur Christian Lefaix\n\nJuan Walter Velarde Carrion Alvaro Jos\u00e9 Padilla\n\nCharles-Louis de Maud\u2019huy Daniel Jos\u00e9 Paz\n\nFran\u00e7ois de Rochambeau Dominique Perrier\n\nHerman J.

Vanetta\n\n2.7.5.\n\nSimilarly, Respondent filed witness statements and/or expert reports from:\n\nDaniel Esteban Arancibia Ismael Mata (replaces report of Francisco Sassi Colombres)\n\nPr\u00f3spero Barrionuevo\n\nJorge A. Garc\u00eda Mena\n\nMaria Silvina Bosio\n\nAlejo J.

Kavanaugh\n\nEmilio Juan Lentini\n\n2.7.6.\n\nOn 10 July 2006, Claimants advised Respondent and the Tribunal that one of its witnesses, Dr. Paz, would be unable to attend the hearing on the merits having become severely ill. At the Tribunal\u2019s request, on 17 July 2006, Claimants provided a medical certificate describing Dr. Paz\u2019s condition and his inability to participate in the schedule hearing.\n\n2.7.7.\n\nDuring the course of the hearing, Respondent advised Claimants and the Tribunal that Mr. Jorge Rais had also become ill and would not be able to attend the hearing as had originally been anticipated. At the Tribunal\u2019s request, Respondent provided Claimants and Tribunal with a medical certificate describing Mr. Rais\u2019s medical condition and his inability to participate in the scheduled hearing.\n\n2.7.8.\n\nThe parties agreed that, having regard to the acceptable medical certificates that had been provided, the evidence of both Mr. Rais and Mr. Paz, as provided in their witness statements, was to be admitted in evidence before the Tribunal, despite their inability to attend the oral hearing.25\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 8, p. 1915 (31 July 2006).\n\n2.7.9.\n\nPrior to the commencement of the oral hearing, by letters dated 14 and 19 July 2006, Respondent applied to the Tribunal, *inter alia,* for an order permitting one of its expert witnesses, Mr. Michael Kavanaugh, to testify by video conference, instead of attending in-person at the oral hearing. Claimants made their position known on Respondent\u2019s application in their letters of 18 and 20 April 2006.\n\n2.7.10.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, having considered the parties\u2019 respective positions, the Tribunal denied Respondent\u2019s application, noting that no reason had been provided for the proposed non-attendance at the oral hearing of Mr. Kavanaugh. The Tribunal indicated its willingness to reconsider Respondent\u2019s application if Respondent substantiated, for good reason, why Mr. Kavanaugh could not make himself available to attend.\n\n2.7.11.\n\nAt the commencement of the oral hearing, Respondent advised the Tribunal it had been unable to reach Mr. Kavanaugh and sought an order either to allow Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s evidence to remain on the record despite his absence from the hearing, or to permit Mr. Kavanaugh to testify by video conference.\n\n2.7.12.\n\nClaimants counter-applied, seeking an order from the Tribunal striking Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s evidence from the record in accordance with the prior agreement of the parties and having regard to the fact that no explanation had been provided as to Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s inability to attend.\n\n2.7.13.\n\nInitially, the Tribunal advised the parties that it would defer a ruling on the parties\u2019 competing applications, preferring to give Respondent a further opportunity to contact Mr. Kavanaugh and to provide an explanation as to his reasons for non-attendance.\n\n2.7.14.\n\nOn day eight of the hearing, Respondent advised the Tribunal that one of its former legal advisers had been aware at the time Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s witness statement was given that he would be unable to attend the hearing on the merits due to a prior commitment. The Tribunal was further advised that, although he had not yet been contacted, Mr. Kavanaugh was expected to arrive in Paris that night or the following day.\n\n2.7.15.\n\nRespondent thereupon renewed its application to have Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s witness statement received in evidence and for his cross-examination to take place by video conference. Claimants renewed their application to have Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s evidence stricken from the record.26\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 8, pp. 1917-1919, 2047-2048 (31 July 2006).\n\n2.7.16.\n\nAfter considering of the Parties\u2019 respective position, the Tribunal denied Respondent\u2019s application to present Mr. Kavanaugh for cross-examination by video conference and granted Claimants\u2019 application to have Mr. Kavanaugh\u2019s witness statements stricken from the record. The Tribunal was influenced, *inter* *alia,* by the number of opportunities Respondent had been given to explain the whereabouts of Mr. Kavanaugh and his reasons for being unable to attend the oral hearing and the unwillingness of Claimants to depart from the prior agreement of the parties that statements from witnesses who were not available for cross-examination at the oral hearing were not to be taken into evidence by the Tribunal. The Tribunal\u2019s reasons are set out fully in the transcript.27\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 8, pp. 2080-2083 (31 July 2006).\n\n2.7.17.\n\nFollowing the hearing on the merits, and in accordance with the directions of the Tribunal, the Tribunal received further written submissions as follows:\n\n(i) on 23 August 2006, after the conclusion of the hearing on the merits, Claimants sought to file additional evidence not in the record to support alternative approaches to the calculation of damages. By letter dated 1 September 2006, Claimants explained that although \"[t]o be sure, there are facts on the existing record that the Tribunal can use for that purpose\", Claimants wished the Tribunal to exercise its discretion to accept further evidence offered by Claimants to give the Tribunal the \"full picture\" relevant to alternative calculation methods. In its letter dated 31 August 2006, Respondent objected to Claimants\u2019 attempt to introduce such evidence. In Respondent\u2019s view, even if the Tribunal sought further discussion from the parties as to the effects of the various methods of calculation on Claimants\u2019 damages claim, the record was clear that no new evidence was to be introduced. The Tribunal communicated its decision to the parties by letter dated 15 September 2006, attached hereto as Schedule A. The Tribunal advised that it declined to exercise its discretion to accept Claimants\u2019 new evidence;\n\n(ii) on 25 August 2006 each of the disputing parties submitted a post-hearing submission;\n\n(iii) on Days 10 and 11 of the hearing on the merits, to assist the parties in developing their closing arguments and post-closing submissions, the Tribunal noted various topics with respect to which the Tribunal thought it would be helpful if the parties provided summaries of the evidence. On 12 September 2006, Respondent submitted to the Tribunal various compilations and descriptions with respect to various of the governmental agencies that were relevant to the proceedings. On 13 September 2006, Claimants objected to Respondent\u2019s submission on the basis that the submission was untimely. After carefully considering the positions of the parties, as expressed by Claimants in its letters of 13 September 2006 and 19 September 2006, the Tribunal has concluded that it will accept the summaries and compilations of existing evidence provided by Respondent. Although it might have been contemplated that the parties would submit all compilations and descriptions with their post-hearing briefs, this was not explicitly required by the Tribunal. The Tribunal notes that Claimants do not suggest that any of the materials provided by Respondent include evidence not already part of the record. In any event, the Tribunal has concluded that there is no actual prejudice to Claimants in permitting Respondent to present this material to the Tribunal;\n\n(iv) on 29 September 2006 each of the parties made their respective initial submissions on costs;\n\n(v) on 6 October 2006, each of the parties made submission commenting on the costs of the other party.\n\n2.7.18.\n\nOn 25 May 2007, the Tribunal notified the parties that it had that day declared the proceeding closed in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38.\n\n**3. OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE**\n------------------------------\n\n**3.1. Tribunal\u2019s Approach**\n----------------------------\n\n3.1.1.\n\nIt is useful here to set out a summary overview of the disputing parties respective cases so as to provide the contextual backdrop for the next section of the Award -the Tribunal\u2019s review of and findings regarding the facts relevant to the dispute.\n\n**3.2. Overview of Claimants\u2019 Case**\n------------------------------------\n\n3.2.1.\n\nTo Claimants, this case is all about the mistreatment of a French investor by the authorities in the Argentian province of Tucum\u00e1n. Almost immediately upon taking over the water and sewage services concessions for Tucum\u00e1n, Claimants say that CGE / Vivendi and CAA were attacked by the provincial authorities and systematically deprived of their rights under the Argentine/France BIT. The provincial authorities are said to have used their regulatory powers to impose unilaterally modified tariffs, contrary to the terms of the Concession Agreement and at great cost to Claimants. They are said to have used their oversight powers to pepper the concessionaire with numerous, unjustified accusations while themselves acting in flagrant violation of the agreement. It is claimed that they used the media and the public stage to generate hostility in the citizenry towards the foreign Claimants and that they interfered directly with CAA\u2019s customer relationships, inciting its customers not to pay their bills and abetting customer efforts to avoid their payment obligations. After forcing Claimants to renegotiate the Concession Agreement, they are said to have used their law making powers to reject or secretly to undermine the proposals that could have ended the crisis and saved the concession from disaster.\n\n3.2.2.\n\nClaimants argue that these alleged attacks destroyed the economic value of the Concession Agreement and that by mid-1997 CGE/Vivendi and CAA had no choice but to terminate the concession - the first time in CGE / Vivendi\u2019s 150-year history in water concessions that it had been driven to terminate a concession for the fault of the grantor. After the agreement\u2019s termination, Claimants say that they were held \"hostage\" by the Province and obliged to continue to provide services for a further ten months and, even after they were released from that obligation in October 1998, the provincial authorities continued their harassment, culminating in a series of targeted enactments to prevent CAA from pursuing lawsuits to collect outstanding invoices and, eventually from enforcing any judgments.\n\n3.2.3.\n\nThese acts and omissions of the Province, which Claimants say are legally attributable to the Argentine Republic, constituted:\n\n(i) a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, as expressed in Articles 3 and 5 (1) and (3) of the BIT,28 and\n\n(ii) an expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment in its entirety, contrary to Article 5(2) of the BIT29.\n\nMemorial at \u00b6\u00b6286-322.\n\nMemorial at \u00b6\u00b6324-376.\n\n3.2.4.\n\nHaving thus been deprived of their rights under Articles 3 and 5 of BIT, Claimants seek damages for the harms inflicted upon them, assessed on the basis of CAA\u2019s losses, totalling US$ 3 1 6,923,000,30 plus interest, compounded from 27 November 1997 (the date as of which Claimants have calculated and stated their amounts claimed),31 plus their costs and expenses associated with the arbitration proceedings.\n\nMemorial at \u00b6 404. and Statement of Amounts Claimed, with verification report of Ernst & Young, 19 November 2004 (Exhibit 7).\n\nMemorial at \u00b6 405. and Statement of Amounts Claimed, with verification report of Ernst & Young, 19 November 2004 at Note 8 (Exhibit 7).\n\n**3.3. Overview of Respondent\u2019s Defences**\n------------------------------------------\n\n3.3.1.\n\nTo Respondent, this case exclusively involves contractual matters *(ie* disputes arising under the Concession Agreement) over which the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction.32 Respondent also says that CGE\u2019s purchase of its controlling interest in CAA in June 1996 conflicted with the express terms of the Concession Agreement (under which the consent of Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s executive was required prior to the transfer). Such consent having never been granted, Claimants should not be allowed to pursue a claim for violation of Treaty rights which were acquired unlawfully.33\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b62; Rejoinder at \u00b6 8.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b615.\n\n3.3.2.\n\nRespondent asserts that, shortly after assuming the concession, without warning to an impoverished population and without noticeably improving service, CAA doubled the water bills in the first round of invoices sent to consumers. CAA then proceeded to destroy the confidence of the population by negligently delivering black, undrinkable and potentially unhealthy water over a period of many weeks. Respondent contends that this situation understandably caused consumers to revolt and, in some cases, to refuse to pay vastly inflated bills. CAA then made matters worse by responding to its customers\u2019 grievances in a confrontational and aggressive manner.\n\n3.3.3.\n\nTo the extent Claimants\u2019 cite speeches made and actions taken by individual legislative representatives in response to their constituents\u2019 grievances (improperly characterising their comments as arbitrary acts of the state), Respondent contends that that position is untenable. Bilateral investment treaties have never been deemed to protect investors from the consequences of their own mistakes, nor provide them with an insurance policy against the due exercise of the State\u2019s regulatory activity. This is even more so the case when the service provided is as vital as the provision of water and sewage services.34\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b64-6.\n\n3.3.4.\n\nWhen the Province wanted, and was within its rights, to rescind the Concession Agreement, CAA\u2019s owners improperly exerted their wealth and influence to force the Province to re-negotiate the Concession Agreement on terms more favourable to CAA. Notwithstanding their success in imposing new contractual conditions on the Province, CAA then unilaterally abandoned and unlawfully terminated the Concession Agreement, once it realised it had lost the trust and goodwill of the people of Tucum\u00e1n.35\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b67.\n\n3.3.5.\n\nFaced with Claimants\u2019 material breaches of the Concession Agreement, the Province had the right and the responsibility to take the requisite steps to ensure the availability of safe drinking water for its population on an affordable and accessible basis. Far from constituting an expropriation or unfair and inequitable treatment, Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s conduct merely discharged its responsibilities, both as a contracting party and as a government.36 On this basis, Respondent argues that Claimants\u2019 case must be dismissed.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b611; Rejoinder at \u00b619.\n\n3.3.6.\n\nFinally, in the event that the Tribunal should find that the Claimants are entitled to damages, Respondent says that these should be limited to *damnum emergens* and that Claimants have failed to provide appropriate and reliable evidence of such loss. Under no circumstances are Claimants entitled to recover any *lucrum* *cessans.*\n\n3.3.7.\n\nLike Claimants, Respondent seeks its costs and expenses associated with these proceedings.\n\n**4. FACTS**\n------------\n\n4.1.1.\n\nA review of disputing party\u2019s submissions, witness statements and the oral testimony given at the oral hearing indicates that, with few exceptions, the factual matrix out of which this dispute arises is either agreed or not seriously disputed. Put another way, most of the differences between the parties have to do with the implications arising from or the interpretation to be given to the events which unfolded. Real differences as to what, in fact, occurred or led to certain events exist in relation to four main areas. These involve:\n\n(i) the causes and foreseeability of episodes of turbidity which appeared in the water in San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n in late 1995 and January 1996;\n\n(ii) which of the disputing parties initiated (and what motivated) the parties\u2019 attempts to re-negotiate the Concession Agreement, which commenced in early 1996, shortly after the manganese turbidity phenomenon;\n\n(iii) whether the provincial water regulator, ERSACT, took regulatory action against CAA because of the latter\u2019s failure to meet its contractual obligations and in order to ensure adequate supplies of clean and potable water, or as part of a campaign to harass CAA until it agreed to renegotiate the terms of the Concession Agreement; and\n\n(iv) whether CAA had previously agreed to changes that were made to the 6 June 1997 legislative bill (which set out the terms of the proposed, renegotiated Concession Agreement) when the bill was amended in the course of being enacted as law No. 6826 on 13 June 1997.\n\n4.1.2.\n\nWe set out in some detail below a summary of the facts most relevant to the dispute - either as agreed, not disputed or determined by the Tribunal. We then turn in Sections 5 and 6 to the party\u2019s competing positions as to their respective rights and obligations arising out of what occurred.\n\n**4.2. Privatisation of Water and Sewage Services in Tucum\u00e1n**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.2.1.\n\nThe privatisation of the water and sewage services in Tucum\u00e1n coincided with a broader investment liberalisation effort across Tucum\u00e1n and Argentina as a whole. Prior to the Menem presidency, which began in 1989, nearly all public services in Argentina were state-owned and operated. President Menem introduced an ambitious set of economic reforms, including the privatisation of many traditionally-government owned services. Most provinces, including Tucum\u00e1n, adopted similar measures to assist with the national liberalisation efforts.37\n\nSee eg Law No. 6071, 15 January 1991 (Exhibit 102).\n\n4.2.2.\n\nBefore privatisation, Tucum\u00e1n residents received water and sewage services in one of two ways. Most residents received services from the provincial entity (Direcci\u00f3n Provincial de Obras Sanitarias, \"DiPOS\"). Some residents, in areas not served by DiPOS, received services from municipalities, local communities, or private entities. Some residents did not receive any water and sewage services.\n\n4.2.3.\n\nOver the years, DiPOS experienced a number of challenges. By the beginning of the 1990s, DiPOS revenues covered only 30% of its expenses, with the remainder of its operating funds coming from state subsidies. Moreover, despite a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 60% between 1991 and late 1994, DiPOS did not raise its tariffs. DiPOS\u2019s physical infrastructure was also deteriorating, and major investments were needed.\n\n4.2.4.\n\nOn 17 January 1993, the Governor of the Province (then Ram\u00f3n Ortega) issued Decree No. 7/1, declaring that the Province\u2019s water and sewage services were to be privatised.38 About three weeks later, Tucum\u00e1n invited national and international companies to submit bids for the water and sewage concession services in Tucum\u00e1n.39\n\nDecree No. 7/1, 17 January 1993 (Exhibit 103).\n\nDecree No. 288/93, 10 February 1993 (Exhibit 104).\n\n4.2.5.\n\nOn 15 April 1993, the provincial legislature of Tucum\u00e1n (\"Legislature\") passed Law No. 6445, establishing the basic guidelines for the privatisation process. Law 6445 also provided that the Court of Accounts (of which more later) would oversee the privatisation process.40\n\nDecree No. Law No. 6445, 15 April 1993 (Exhibit 105); Provincial Law No. 6445 (Exhibit 750).\n\n4.2.6.\n\nOn 11 May 1993, Governor Ortega invited consulting firms to bid to advise the provincial authorities on the process of privatisation.41 A consulting contract was granted to Centro de Estudio de Transporte e Infrastructura S.A. (\"CETI\") in July 1993 and CETI issued its report in 1994. In its report, CETI, citing international health standards, said, *inter alia,* that fees for potable water services should not exceed 3% of a family\u2019s income.42\n\nDecree No. 949/3, 11 May 1993 (Exhibit 112).\n\nDiPOS Resolution No. 1189/3, 8 July 1993 (Exhibit 113); CETI, Capacidad de Pago de los Usanos e Incidencia de la Facturaci\u00f3n de los Servicios de Agua y Cloacas en el Ingreso Familiar para el \u00c1rea de Prestaci\u00f3n de DiPOS (Payment Capacity of Customers), undated, circa 1994 (the \"CETI Report\") (Exhibit 8).\n\n4.2.7.\n\nIn response to the invitation to bid for the concession, representatives of five interested groups visited the Province at the beginning of 1993. One of the five groups was the consortium known as \"Aguas del Aconquija\" - later to become CAA (\"AA Consortium\" or \"Consortium\").\n\n4.2.8.\n\nOn 18 January 1994, the provincial Legislature passed Law No. 6529, which established the minimum requirements for the concession and the mandate, powers and duties of the new provincial water regulator (the \"Regulator\" or \"ERSACT\", formerly \"ERAT\") which had been created by Law No. 6445 the previous year)43\n\nProvincial Law No. 6529, 18 January 1994 (Exhibit 82).\n\n4.2.9.\n\nOn 20 January 1994, all five interested consortia successfully pre-qualified to tender for the concession44 A copy of the \"Bid Conditions\" (a draft Concession Agreement was attached to the Bid Conditions as Annex XIII) was delivered to each of the five pre-qualified bidders on 10 May 1994.45\n\nMinutes of the Opening of Bids for Prequalification of Offerors, 20 January 1994 (Exhibit 398).\n\nConcesi\u00f3n del Servicio de Agua y Desag\u00fces Cloacales en la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n: Pliego de Bases y Condiciones Generales para la Licitaci\u00f3n (Bid Conditions), with Annexes, 10 May 1994 (Exhibit 115).\n\n4.2.10.\n\nGiven DiPOS\u2019s heavy reliance on provincial subsidies and its poor physical infrastructure, the provincial authorities understood that the decision to privatise necessitated a complete overhaul of the economics of the system. This meant that the Province\u2019s Bid Conditions would need to be financially viable from a bidders perspective, while still accommodating the Province\u2019s objectives. In short, given the Province\u2019s political decision to shift the cost of services from the public treasury (through subsidies) to customers making use of the service, a significant tariff increase was inevitable.\n\n4.2.11.\n\nIn presenting their proposed tariffs, the Bid Conditions required bidders to calculate an adjustment coefficient showing the projected increase in tariff rates for each category of user (Article 3.8.1). Article 15.3 of the Bid Conditions and Article 9.2 of the draft Concession Agreement provided that \"[w]ith the exception of the Earnings Tax and Value-Added Tax (VAT) or those they replace, all other taxes, whether national, provincial, or municipal, affecting the concession-holder *will be considered as costs* for purposes of tariff calculation.\"46 (emphasis added)\n\nConcesi\u00f3n del Servicio de Agua y Desag\u00fces Cloacales en la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n: Pliego de Bases y Condiciones Generales para la Licitaci\u00f3n (Bid Conditions), with Annexes, 10 May 1994 (Exhibit 115).\n\n4.2.12.\n\nOn 20 July 1994, in a step which later took on considerable importance, the Ministry of Economy issued Circular No. 2, which revised the Bid Conditions\u2019 earlier requirements relating to the treatment of taxes as costs for the purposes of tariff calculation. Article 3.8.1 of Circular No. 2 provided that \"[p]ursuant to Article 51 of Law No. 6529 and for selection purposes, the Offeror shall propose adjustment factors based on representative values for the quantity and effective rate for each category of user. In calculating said factors, *municipal taxes and/or levies on the use of public property or the stamp tax payable on the concession agreement shall not be counted as costs* of the concession.\"47 (emphasis added)\n\nMinistry of Economy, Circular No. 2, 20 July 1994 (with English translation) (Exhibit 116).\n\n**4.3. CAA\u2019s Initial Bid, Improved Bid, and Bid Approval**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.3.1.\n\nDespite five bidders having prequalified, only one bid was received on the 1 August 1994 tender submission date - that being the bid of the AA Consortium. At that time the AA Consortium comprised CGE, DYCASA, Roggio and Supercemento S.A. (\"Supercemento\")48\n\nLegislature of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n Resolution No. 10, 28 September 1995 (with English translation) (Exhibit 143) and Legislature of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n Resolution No. 2, 12 December 1995 (Exhibit 149).\n\n4.3.2.\n\nIt is not disputed that CGE and its partners analysed market conditions in Tucum\u00e1n before preparing a bid for the concession49 Indeed, before the submission of its final bid in mid-1994, CGE conducted extensive additional analyses onsite in Tucum\u00e1n (see para 4.3.7 below).\n\nMemorial at \u00b6\u00b636 and 37; Counter-Memorial at \u00b648. Technicians from the Consortium\u2019s three-partner companies began arriving in Tucum\u00e1n as early as 1993 to analyse financial, technical and socio-economic conditions that the Concessionaire would face. CGE officials studied the conclusions of the CETI Report, and the Consortium prepared its own internal analyses of appropriate tariff levels based on the study of reports by the World Health Organization and the World Bank regarding appropriate tariff levels in the region.\n\n4.3.3.\n\nThe Consortium\u2019s initial bid proposed a tariff adjustment coefficient of 1,941. Stated somewhat differently, a coefficient of 1,941 would have led to a 94% higher tariff than that being charged at that time by DiPOS.50 As required by Circular No. 2, the Consortium\u2019s initial bid *excluded* taxes from the service tariff51\n\nCAA Oferta Econ\u00f3mico-Fianciera (Economic Offer), with Annexes, 1 August 1994 (Exhibit 306).\n\nCAA Oferta Econ\u00f3mico-Fianciera (Economic Offer), with Annexes, 1 August 1994 (Exhibit 306).\n\n4.3.4.\n\nThe Bid Conditions upon which the initial bid was based required bidders to assume a final 85% collection rate from customers. Specifically, Article 3.8.4 provided that \"in accordance with the provisions of Article 77 of Law N\u00b0 6529, Concessionaire shall be responsible for the degree of efficiency of its commercial system, and may not include in its plans or forecasts a non-payment rate higher than FIFTEEN PER CENT (15%) of its total billing.\"52\n\nConcesi\u00f3n del Servicio de Agua y Desag\u00fces Cloacales en la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n: Pliego de Bases y Condiciones Generales para la Licitaci\u00f3n (Bid Conditions), with Annexes, 10 May 1994 (Exhibit 115).\n\n4.3.5.\n\nOn 22 August 1994, three weeks after the receipt of the Consortium\u2019s bid, the Province\u2019s \"Pre-Award Commission\" (made up of members of the Provincial legislature and the executive), established to review bids for the concession, recommended acceptance of the technical portion of the bid, after having received, presumably, satisfactory answers to several questions it had posed to CGE.53\n\nComisi\u00f3n de Preadjudicaci\u00f3n, Solicitud de Aclaraciones en Relaci\u00f3n a la Oferta - su Respuesta, 22 August 1994, (Exhibit 120); Letter from CAA to Comisi\u00f3n de Preadjudicaci\u00f3n, 31 August 1994 (Exhibit 121); Ministry of Economy Resolution No. 261/MIN, 16 September 1994 (Exhibit 122).\n\n4.3.6.\n\nThe Ministry of the Economy thereupon approved the technical portion of the initial bid,54 but requested the Consortium to consider revisions to the economic offer to provide a reduced tariff adjustment coefficient and an increased projected recovery rate.55\n\nResolution 261/MIN, 16 September 1994 (Exhibit 122).\n\nLetter from Ministry of Economy to CAA, 30 September 1994 (Exhibit 123).\n\n4.3.7.\n\nAt this point the Consortium seemed likely to be awarded the concession and officials from CGE and its partners began to conduct extensive analyses and preparations for the takeover and operation of the concession. Mr. G\u00e9rald Gu\u00e9rin, then director of CGE\u2019s regional center in Orl\u00e9ans, France, was asked to coordinate these preparations and to serve as the Consortium\u2019s general manager when it began operations.56 Technicians from the Consortium\u2019s three-partner companies visited Tucum\u00e1n as early as 1993 to analyse financial, technical and socio-economic conditions that the concessionaire would face. Subsequently, in October 1994, Mr. Gu\u00e9rin visited Tucum\u00e1n as a representative of the Consortium to investigate, *inter alia,* DiPOS\u2019s offices, the water and sewage treatment systems, and DiPOS\u2019s laboratory and organisation structure.57\n\nGu\u00e9rin Affidavit, 9 February 2006, at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 (Exhibit 793).\n\nMr. Gu\u00e9rin again visited Tucum\u00e1n in February 1995 at which time he had met with the head of DiPOS and other DiPOS officials to discuss the Consortium\u2019s plan for takeover and operation of the Concession.\n\n4.3.8.\n\nAs requested by the Ministry of Economy, the Consortium submitted an improved economic offer on 7 October 1994. The improved economic offer proposed a reduced tariff adjustment coefficient of 1,679. This was based on the Consortium increasing its projected recovery rates from 85% to 89 % in the first year, 90% in the second year and 91% in the third year.58\n\nLetter from CAA to Comisi\u00f3n de Preadjudicaci\u00f3n (Improved Economic Offer), 7 October 1994 (Exhibit 124).\n\n4.3.9.\n\nAll relevant government entities in Tucum\u00e1n reviewed and approved the Consortium\u2019s improved offer. The first approval came from the Pre-Award Commission. In a detailed report issued on 14 October 1994, the Pre-Award Commission concluded that the proposed tariff adjustment coefficient in the improved economic offer was reasonable from a commercial and economic perspective.59\n\nComisi\u00f3n de Preadjudicaci\u00f3n, Informe de Evaluaci\u00f3n de la Oferta (Report of Pre-Award Commission), 14 October 1994 (Exhibit 11).\n\n4.3.10.\n\nWith respect to the increase to the projected collection rate, the Pre-Award Commission noted that:\n\n*\"Despite progressive improvements in its commercial management, the DiPOS currently has not achieved a collection rate higher than 55%. In any event, the collection rate provided by the Bidder for billings on services is felt to be insufficient, given that it sets a figure of 85% at the start of the concession term, which gradually increases to 90% by the 15th year... Our own projections start from a collection index of 85% and attain 90% by the third year, and 95% after the eight year and through the end of the concession. These returns are considered to be reasonable taking into account the results achieved by the DiPOS and the improvements that can be achieved by effective private management as demonstrated in international experiences \".60*\n\nComisi\u00f3n de Preadjudicaci\u00f3n, Informe de Evaluaci\u00f3n de la Oferta (Report of Pre-Award Commission), 14 October 1994 (Exhibit 11).\n\n4.3.11.\n\nThe Pre-Award Commission concluded that \"the values ultimately adopted (in the Consortium\u2019s bid) are reasonable, taking into consideration the collectability indicators achieved by DiPOS and the improved efficiency expected from a private operator.\"61\n\nComisi\u00f3n de Preadjudicaci\u00f3n, Informe de Evaluaci\u00f3n de la Oferta (Report of Pre-Award Commission), 14 October 1994 (Exhibit 11).\n\n4.3.12.\n\nSubsequently, on 18 November 1994, the Tucum\u00e1n legislature ratified the Pre-Award Commission\u2019s recommendation to award the Concession to the AA Consortium.62\n\nLegislature of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, Resolution Approving CAA\u2019s Offer, 18 November 1994 (Exhibit 125).\n\n4.3.13.\n\nThereafter, on 26 December 1994, the Governor formally awarded the concession to the AA Consortium by Decree No. 35 1 2/3.63 In awarding the concession, the Governor cited, *inter alia,* the Pre-Award Commission\u2019s opinion that the tariff contemplated by the amended bid was \"just and reasonable\". Approximately three months later, on 10 March 1995, Governor Ortega approved the draft Concession Agreement, pursuant to Decree No. 459/3,64 which was then submitted to the Court of Accounts for its review.\n\nDecree No. 3512/3, 26 December 1994, Article 1 (Exhibit 128).\n\nDecree No. 459/3, 10 March 1995 (Exhibit 129).\n\n4.3.14.\n\nIn a 28 April 1995 report, a consultant to the Province, Dr. Ismael Mata, supported the tariff that had been proposed in the Consortium\u2019s improved offer, stating his belief that the lower tariff adjustment coefficient of 1,679, combined with the two 10% increases provided for in the draft Concession Agreement, essentially implemented his earlier advice to the Province that tariff increases should be introduced progressively.65\n\nCopy of fax sent by Dr. Ismael Mata to Eng. Garcia Posse (DiPOS) re: improved offer submitted by CAA on 7 October 1994 in file 757/300-ME-94, incorporated in file 56-110-M-93, 28 April 1995 (Exhibit 416).\n\n4.3.15.\n\nOn 17 March 1995, the Court of Accounts, having completed its review of the draft Concession Agreement, issued Resolution No. 398/95, approving the draft, provided that the executive power made certain amendments. Specifically, the Court of Accounts stated that, until the executive branch corrects or modifies \"...the contractual text in compliance with the hereinabove indications, neither Executive Order N\u00b0 459/3 nor the acts resulting as a consequence shall be executed...\".66\n\nCourt of Accounts Resolution No. 398, 17 May 1995 (Exhibit 130); Court of Accounts Resolution No. 398/95, 17 May 1995 (Exhibit 421).\n\n**4.4. Execution of the Concession Agreement and Delays in Takeover**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.4.1.\n\nPrior to the execution of the Concession Agreement, a take-over date of 1 May 1995 had been projected. This date was subsequently delayed, along with the signing of the Concession Agreement, due to the intervention by the Court of Accounts and the Legislature\u2019s Commission on the Oversight of the DiPOS Privatisation.67 The signing of the Concession Agreement was rescheduled for 5 May 1995, and the take-over for 11 May 1995. In light of further interventions by the Court of Accounts, the signing and take-over of services were delayed twice more.\n\nGu\u00e9rin Affidavit, 9 February 2006, at \u00b627 (Exhibit 793).\n\n4.4.2.\n\nPursuant to the Bid Conditions, the concessionaire was required to be a locally incorporated company.68 CAA was thus incorporated as an Argentine company on 17 May 1995, by the then members of the AA Consortium, CGE and the Argentine companies DYCASA and Roggio; Supercemento having left the Consortium in March of that year.69\n\nConcesi\u00f3n del Servicio de Agua y Desag\u00fces Cloacales en la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n: Pliego de Bases y Condiciones Generales para la Licitaci\u00f3n (Bid Conditions), with Annexes, 10 May 1994 (Exhibit 115) at Art. 5.1.\n\nLetter dated 9 March 1995, Consortium to Governor Ortega, notifying the withdrawal of Supercemento (Exhibit 417).\n\n4.4.3.\n\nThe next day, 18 May 1995, Governor Ortega approved the final text of the Concession Agreement by Decree No. 852/3, and CAA and the Province executed the Concession Agreement.70 The takeover of the service was scheduled for 1 June 1995.71\n\nDecree No. 852/3, 18 May 1995 (Exhibit 131).\n\nConcesi\u00f3n del Servicio de Agua y Desag\u00fces Cloacales en la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n, Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n (Concession Agreement), with Annexes XIV, XX-XXIII, 18 May 1995 (Exhibit 127).\n\n4.4.4.\n\nWith the Concession Agreement now signed and in the belief that the transfer of the service would take place on 1 June 1995, CAA purchased supplies, leased buildings, transferred personnel and arranged for a caravan of trucks from Buenos Aires for the delivery of the supplies. However, a few hours before the transfer was to take place, a messenger delivered a copy of Decree No. 68/3-95 which again postponed the takeover until 14 June 199572\n\nGu\u00e9rin Affidavit, 9 February 2006 (Exhibit 793), at \u2018 28. Decree No. 68/3-95 was issued at the request of the Legislative Commission on the Oversight of the DiPOS privatization, ostensibly in order to provide the Commission with the opportunity to review documents relating to several amendments to the Concession Agreement required by the Court of Accounts.\n\n4.4.5.\n\nOn 20 June 1995, following the execution of the Concession Agreement, the executive branch issued executive order No. 1142/3, implementing the changes previously required by the Court of Accounts.73 CAA unsuccessfully challenged this Order by way of administrative appeal dated 11 July 1995.74\n\nExecutive Order No. 1142/3, 20 June 1995 (Exhibit 423).\n\nAdministrative appeal of CAA against Executive Order No. 1142/3, 11 July 1995 (Exhibit 546).\n\n4.4.6.\n\nOn 18 July 1995, the Province responded to CAA\u2019s administrative appeal of Executive Order 1142/3 with Executive Order No. 1371/3-1995. The latter confirmed the validity of the clarifications to the text of the Concession Agreement and set 22 July 1995 as the date for the takeover of the services by CAA. This was the date that CAA assumed the Concession.75\n\nExecutive Order No. 1371/3, 18 July 1995 (Exhibit 483).\n\n4.4.7.\n\nThe disputing parties differ on the reasons for the delay to the takeover of services, each blaming the other. The Province attributes the delay to CAA\u2019s inadequate processes for hiring former DiPOS employees and to its failure to obtain insurance as required by the Concession Agreement.\n\n4.4.8.\n\nAlthough not much turns on this question, the Tribunal is satisfied that the CAA was not responsible for the delay.76 In the period before the takeover of the service, the Consortium partners, and, subsequently, CAA, operated with a staff of approximately 50 persons. Amongst the tasks of this core team was the hiring of permanent employees to operate the concession after the takeover. Article 8.1 of the Concession Agreement required CAA to employ a minimum of 1000 employees for at least the first three years of the concession and that the concessionaire hire 90% of its permanent employees from personal of the outgoing provider, DiPOS.77\n\nSee Letter from CAA to Minister of Economy, 7 June 1995 (Exhibit 819); Letter from CAA to Minister of Economy, 15 June 1995 (Exhibit 897) and Guerin Affidavit, 9 February 2006 (Exhibit 793), at \u00b6 32.\n\nConcesi\u00f3n del Servicio de Agua y Desag\u00fces Cloacales en la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n, Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n (Concession Agreement), with Annexes XIV, XX-XXIII, 18 May 1995 (Exhibit 127).\n\n4.4.9.\n\nTo comply with the Article 8.1 staffing requirements, Mr. Guerin and his staff instituted a hiring process initially based on the review of resumes of DiPOS employees. After an initial cut, the more promising candidates were interviewed by members of Mr. Gu\u00e9rin\u2019s team, assisted by two psychologists recommended by Roggio. According to the minutes of the meeting of the \"Joint DiPOS/CAA Commission\" (which had been established in preparation for and to facilitate the takeover), CAA had conducted approximately 1,500 interviews by 17 April 1995. Further, CAA had successfully completed the process of interviewing and selecting more than 900 former DiPOS employees before the 1 June 1995 date initially scheduled for the takeover.78\n\nComisi\u00f3n Mixta DiPOS - Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija - Minutes of Meeting No. 19, 22 May 1995 (Exhibit 895) and Comisi\u00f3n Mixta DiPOS - Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija - Minutes of Meeting No. 20, 23 May 1995 (Exhibit 811).\n\n4.4.10.\n\nAs regards the procedural requirements under Article 3.9 of the Concession Agreement, relating to the verification of CAA\u2019s insurance policies, the Ministry of the Economy granted CAA approval with respect to its proposed insurance policies on 18 May 1995.79 The Court of Accounts subsequently certified that it had reviewed and was satisfied with the evidence that CAA had obtained insurance policies as required by the Concession Agreement.80\n\nMinistry of Economy Resolution No. 118 Expte.

During the first year of the Concession, the tariffs pertaining to each category and class of Users arise from applying the offered adjustment coefficient (K=1,679) to the tariff framework in force. The resulting values are included in ANNEX XXI. During the second year of the Concession, the tariffs pertaining to each category and class of Users arise from applying a multiplying coefficient equal to ONE AND TEN HUNDREDTHS (1.10) to the tariff framework in force during the first year (the values of which are included in ANNEX XXI). The resulting values are included in ANNEX XXII During the third and subsequent years of the Concession, the tariffs to be applied to each category and class of Users arise from applying a multiplying coefficient equal to ONE AND TEN HUNDREDTHS (1.10) to the tariff framework in force during the second year (the values of which are included in ANNEX XXII). The resulting values are included in ANNEX XXIII \"*\n\n4.5.3.\n\nArticle 12.3 stipulated that these tariff values were the maximum amounts to be charged by the concessionaire.\n\n**Treatment of Taxes**\n----------------------\n\n4.5.4.\n\nArticle 9.2 addressed the question of taxes, levies and contributions as follows:\n\n*\"9.2 INCLUSION IN TARIFF Taxes, duties and/or local contributions shall not be considered Concession costs. The same will apply to stamp taxes to be paid on the Concession Agreement. Any modification to a higher or lower figure, the introduction of new taxes and the abolition of existing taxes that may arise as from the date of presentation of the Bid, shall allow the renegotiation of tariffs and prices so as to properly reflect such modifications in costs. \"*\n\n**Investment Obligations**\n--------------------------\n\n4.5.5.\n\nUnder the Concession Agreement, CAA agreed to invest USD 386 million over its 30-year-life (see in particular Annex XIV to the Concession Agreement). Of this investment, 54% (US$209 million) was allocated to the expansion of the network, 10% (US$37 million) was earmarked for new sewage treatment facilities and 36% (US$140 million) was for renovating the existing sewage treatment system.\n\n**Concessionaire\u2019s Rights of Enforcement**\n------------------------------------------\n\n4.5.6.\n\nTo enforce payment by customers for the services provided, CAA was granted the right to cut off service to non-paying customers, subject to certain conditions specified in Article 12.9.81 CAA could not cut service where customers had made an agreement regarding payment of their debts or where ERSACT had issued an order temporarily preventing disconnection (such orders could only be issued in unforeseen or extraordinary circumstances and according to a \"well-founded\" decision).82\n\nComisi\u00f3n de Preadjudicaci\u00f3n, Informe de Evaluaci\u00f3n de la Oferta (Report of the Prequalifiaction Committee), 14 October 1994 (Exhibit 11).\n\nConcesi\u00f3n del Servicio de Agua y Desag\u00fces Cloacales en la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n, Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n (Concession Agreement), with Annexes XIV, XX-XXIII, 18 May 1995 (Exhibit 127), at Article 12.9.7.\n\n**Termination and Damages for Breach**\n--------------------------------------\n\n4.5.7.\n\nArticle 15.3 of the Concession Agreement permitted the Governor unilaterally to rescind the agreement under certain specific conditions, for example, in case of grave, unjustified violations by CAA of applicable laws, ERSACT regulations or contractual provisions.\n\n4.5.8.\n\nSimilarly, under Article 15.4, CAA had the right to rescind in the event of acts or omission either by ERSACT or the Province that resulted in grave, unjustified violations of obligations under the Concession Agreement. Before terminating under this provision, CAA was required to provide the Province with 15 days prior notification and the opportunity to rectify its breaches.\n\n4.5.9.\n\nArticle 15.8.3 of the Concession Agreement provided that if CAA\u2019s rescission was due to material breach by the Province, then CAA could obtain an award of damages.\n\n**4.6. Provincial Authorities of Tucum\u00e1n**\n------------------------------------------\n\n4.6.1.\n\nThe province of Tucum\u00e1n has three main branches: executive, legislative, and judicial.83\n\nProvincial Constitution (Exhibit 397), Article 87.4.\n\n**Legislative Branch**\n----------------------\n\n4.6.2.\n\nThe legislative branch comprises the \"Legislature\" which, by majority vote, has the power to enact laws and issue proclamations through resolutions.84 Such laws, proclamations and resolutions issued by the Legislature have binding effect throughout the Province.85\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6 23 ; Provincial Constitution (Exhibit 397), Articles 1 and 63.\n\nProvincial Constitution (Exhibit 397), Article 1.\n\n4.6.3.\n\nUp to 40 individual legislators may be elected and the provincial constitution grants legislators immunity (fuero) for any opinions they express while discharging their legislative duties.86\n\nProvincial Constitution (Exhibit 397), Articles 58 and 59.\n\n**Executive Branch**\n--------------------\n\n4.6.4.\n\nThe executive branch (\"Executive\") is made up of the Governor and the Lieutenant or Vice Governor.87 The Governor, in whom the powers of government and the provincial administration are vested, heads the Executive. Under the constitution, the Vice Governor is the president of the Legislature. During the pertinent period (late 1995 - 1999) this role was fulfilled by Vice Governor Raul Roque Topa.\n\nTestimony of Ra\u00fcl Roque Topa, Transcript of the hearing on the merits, Day 7, page 1886 (30 July 2006).\n\n4.6.5.\n\nThe Governor has the right to regulate / issue resolutions (\"Executive Orders\") on matters referred to in laws enacted by the Legislature, as provided by the provincial constitution.88 The Governor may also rule on general matters where there is \"need and urgency\", *ie* whenever exceptional circumstances prevent the completion of ordinary processes under the constitution. Such Executive Orders are provisional and must be ratified by the Legislature.89\n\nProvincial Constitution (Exhibit 397), Article 87 at sub-para. 3.\n\nLaw No. 6686 (Exhibit 999); see also Counter-Memorial at \u00b6 26.\n\n4.6.6.\n\nMinisters, the so-called \"hands of the Governor\", are non-elected officials, appointed by the Governor and are part of the Executive. During the Bussi government, there were five ministers: the Minister of Government and Justice, the Social Affairs or Health Minister, the Minister of Production, the Minister of the Economy, and the Minister of Education.90\n\nTestimony of Topa, Transcript of the hearing on the merits, Day 7, pages 1887-1888 (30 July 2006).\n\n4.6.7.\n\nThe Attorney General is the chief legal advisor to the Executive and the legal comptroller of the administration. The Attorney General is the non-elected head of the Attorney-General\u2019s Department and ranks as a minister. He or she reports directly to the Governor. The Attorney General is empowered, by Provincial Law No. 3623, *inter alia,* to:91\n\n(i) advise the Governor and his ministers on any legal matter, for which purpose the provincial Attorney General may request from the Province\u2019s various administration offices such reports, records and files as may be necessary;\n\n(ii) undertake such studies as may be necessary for the purpose of updating laws and regulations;\n\n(iii) intervene in legislative acts and duties of the Executive; and\n\n(iv) intervene in administrative matters in which the interpretation of the rules in force is at issue.\n\nLaw No. 6823 (Exhibit 749).\n\n**Judicial Branch**\n-------------------\n\n4.6.8.\n\nThe judicial branch is comprised of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Court of Appeals, the trial courts in the various forums such as the administrative courts, the labour courts, the criminal courts, the commercial and civil courts.92\n\nTestimony of Topa, Transcript of the hearing on the merits, Day 7, page 1888-1889 (30 July 2006).\n\n**Other Entities**\n------------------\n\n4.6.9.\n\nThree of the Province\u2019s administrative entities played an important role in the events which unfolded and it is useful to provide a summary description of each. These are: the Province\u2019s water regulator, ERSACT, the Defender of the People (also known as Defender of the Public, or the provincial Ombudsman -collectively, \"Ombudsman\") and the Court of Accounts.\n\n**ERSACT**\n----------\n\n4.6.10.\n\nERSACT was created on 15 April 1993 as an independent provincial agency by the initial privatisation bill, Provincial Law No. 6445. At all relevant times it was responsible for exercising enforcement powers related to the regulation and control of drinking water and sewage service in the province of Tucum\u00e1n.\n\n4.6.11.\n\nERSACT\u2019s numerous powers and obligations included:\n\n(i) enforcement of the provisions of Laws No. 6445 and Law No. 6529;\n\n(ii) oversight of the concession and the services provided by the concessionaire to users;\n\n(iii) monitoring of the concession holder\u2019s compliance with its investment obligations, expansion plans, and its timely and proper compliance with the price and rate schedules;\n\n(iv) addressing users\u2019 complaints regarding deficient service or over-billing; and\n\n(v) taking any necessary steps to meet these objectives, subject to the prevailing law and the applicable provisions of the Concession Agreement.93\n\nCounter-Memorial, at \u00b6 33; Law 6529 (Exhibit 751).\n\n4.6.12.\n\nUnder the applicable law, ERSACT\u2019s finances depended on fees paid by the concessionaire.94\n\nLaw 6529 (Exhibit 751), Article 13.\n\n**Ombudsman\u2019s Office**\n----------------------\n\n4.6.13.\n\nThe office of the Ombudsman was created on 15 August 1995, by Law No. 6644.\n\nArticles 1 and 2 of the law explain the purpose and the scope of the office:\n\n*\"Art. 1 - Create the Office of the Defender of the People for the protection and defence of the legal rights and interests of persons and community, as contained in the National and Provincial Constitutions and in the laws passed as a consequence thereof before the acts, events and omissions of the Provincial Public Administration, with the provisional scope of this law, the head of which shall be an official called \"Defender of the People \".*\n\n*\"Art. 2 - JURISDICTION - For the purposes of this law, the concept of provincial public administration, includes the centralised and decentralised administration; self-governed entities; State enterprises; State companies; State-partially-owned Companies; State-majority-owned Companies; and any other agency of the Provincial State whatever is its legal nature, name, special regulatory law, or place where its service is provided. This Office of the Defender of the People shall have jurisdiction over public non-state legal entities that exercise public powers, as well as over private suppliers of public utilities. In this case,* *and without prejudice to the remaining powers granted by this law, the Defender of the People may demand the competent administrative authorities in pursuance of the powers granted by law.*  *The Office of the Defender of the People shall not have jurisdiction over the Judicial Power and the Legislative Power.* \"95 (emphasis added)\n\nLaw No. 6644 (Exhibit 450), Articles 1 and 2.\n\n4.6.14.\n\nThe Ombudsman has the power to issue non-legally-binding recommendations only. The Ombudsman is an \"independent agency\" that must act fairly and equitably and according to law.96 The Ombudsman is obliged to examine all non-frivolous complaints or those made in bad faith and those holding public office are required to assist the Ombudsman\u2019s Office in the pursuit of its duties.97\n\nLaw No. 6644 (Exhibit 450), Articles 4, 5 and 13.\n\nLaw No. 6644 (Exhibit 450), Article 12.\n\n**Court of Accounts**\n---------------------\n\n4.6.15.\n\nThe Court of Accounts, an administrative body created by provincial Executive Order N\u00b0 960/3 is responsible for reviewing the expenditure of public funds by any provincial governmental entity. It also has *ex post facto* control over all administrative actions, including actions taken by public officials, involving public funds.98 At the relevant time, the Court of Accounts was made up of a number of the directors, nominated by the Governor and whose appointment was then ratified by the Legislature. Between 1995 and 1999 directors served a fixed term and could only be removed following a special political proceeding known as \"juicio politico\". The directors are not part of the judiciary.99 Though technically not part of the judicial branch, the decisions of the Court of Accounts are binding and are subject to appeal before the Contentious Administrative Court of Appeals (C\u00e1mara Contencioso-Administrativo) which is part of the Judiciary.100\n\nDecree No. 960/3, 24 April 1986 (Exhibit 471), Article 131.\n\nTestimony of Topa, Transcript of the hearing on the merits, Day 7, page 1890 (30 July 2006).\n\nDecree No. 960/3, 24 April 1986 (Exhibit 471), Article 120.\n\n**4.7. System Condition on Takeover**\n-------------------------------------\n\n4.7.1.\n\nThe condition of the water and sewage facilities in Tucum\u00e1n at that time they were transferred to CAA in late July 1995 was very bad and had declined rapidly in the months immediately preceding the transfer. This rapid degeneration appears to have been caused by a variety of factors including neglect (this set in following the April 1993 provincial approval of the privatisation - the Province generally withdrew its financial support while DiPOS was still the official system operator),101 abuse and looting.\n\nLefaix Affidavit, 3 November 2004 (Exhibit 2), at \u00b610.\n\n4.7.2.\n\nThe general deterioration of the system which occurred at this time was not controverted in its essentials and is reflected in the minutes of the Joint DiPOS/CAA Commission:\n\n*\"[Regarding the state of the facilities at the time of their transfer,]* *CAA... agrees with what was expressed by DiPOS, since it has also noticed a significant deterioration in the organization and in the state of the equipment, plant, etc., making it very onerous and difficult to place it in a normal working order.\"102*\n\nMinutes Nos. 12 and 13 Joint DiPOS/CAA Commission, April 1995 (Exhibit 319).\n\n4.7.3.\n\nMessrs. Gu\u00e9rin and Lefaix gave uncontradicted evidence that, at the time of takeover, many pipes in the network were broken, leaking or permanently backed up. Sewer pipes were overflowing, vehicles, equipment and tools were broken down, missing or stolen. Client files were scattered across the floors of DiPOS offices by the hundreds, and hundreds more files were discarded in heaps outdoors, near trucks and trash bins. DiPOS\u2019s central laboratory similarly appear to have been looted and lacked nearly all supplies.103\n\nSee photographs of DiPOS vehicles, strewn and discarded DiPOS files; Guerin Affidavit (Exhibit 793), at \u00b640. and Lefaix Affidavit, 3 November 2004 (Exhibit 2), at \u00b611.\n\n4.7.4.\n\nThe Minutes of a Joint CAA/ERSACT meeting held on 27 July 1995 (five days after the take-over) characterised the condition of the laboratory as \"a pitiful situation of total abandonment\".104\n\nMinutes of CAA/ERSACT Meeting No. 2, 27 July 1994 (Exhibit 318).\n\n4.7.5.\n\nIndeed, in the period immediately prior to the takeover, the system had deteriorated to such an extent that many chlorination facilities were not in service and, in many cases, makeshift systems had been substituted for necessary chlorine injection pumps. In the result, CAA began voluntarily to provide DiPOS with basic supplies and equipment prior to the takeover, including chlorine and trucks needed to clear obstructed sewage lines.105\n\nSee de Rochambeau Affidavit, 5 November 2004 (Exhibit 1), at \u00b633; Lefaix Affidavit, 3 November 2004 (Exhibit 2), at \u00b69.\n\n4.7.6.\n\nIn summary, the rapid deterioration experienced by the water and sewage system in the 10 months between the submission of CAA\u2019s economic offer in October 1994 and the transfer of service in late July 1995 left CAA with a system in considerably worse condition than that it had analysed at the time it was preparing its bid.\n\n**4.8. Politics of Privatisation Change**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n4.8.1.\n\nThe pro-privatisation views of the Ortega government were not shared by the various provincial opposition parties of the day and, by the time of its execution in late 1994, the Concession Agreement had become something of a political flashpoint in the provincial election campaign that had begun earlier the year. The longstanding opposition of the *Fuerza Republicana* party, led by General Bussi, which in late 1995 was to succeed the Ortega led *Justicialista* party government is key to an understanding of the events that occurred in the six to nine months after CAA took control of the concession in late July 1995.\n\n4.8.2.\n\nIn December 1994, during the provincial election campaign, General Bussi and his party had proclaimed their \"most solid opposition to transferring the patrimonies of the Province\".106 Vice Governor Topa explained in his written evidence \"our party had announced that one of its government actions - if it was elected - would be to consider examining the details of the concession agreement... taking into account the interests of the users,\" and that the agreement had been \"born defective\".107\n\n*\"FR sostiene una posici\u00f3n coherente\", Sigio XXI,* 4 December 1994 (Exhibit 1081).\n\nTopa Affidavit, 10 November 2005 (Exhrbit 386,) at \u00b6 8 and \u00b672.\n\n4.8.3.\n\nAt the municipal level, a number of municipalities publicly rejected the Concession Agreement, asserting legal invalidity. The Municipality of Aguilares \"municipalised the former DiPOS\" and established the Municipal Directorate for Sanitation Works, whilst municipal officials in Monteros formally sought suspension of the concession.108\n\nde Rochambeau Affidavit, 5 November 2004 (Exhibits 134-136), at \u00b692.\n\n4.8.4.\n\nIn his 2001 report to the World Bank (A Case Study on the Tucum\u00e1n Water Privatisation - \"Rais Report\"), Dr. Jorge Rais, the then Undersecretary of Water Resources of the Federal Ministry of the Economy (and a witness for Respondent) explained the political dynamic of the times, \"In order to avoid confrontation with the anti-privatisation propaganda of the political opposition, the Tucum\u00e1n Government chose not to explain the objectives and procedures involved in the transformation of DiPOS, foregoing any kind of public relations strategy.\" He continued \"[t]he decision to privatize DiPOS was generally rejected by the local political forces (one of which took over the government shortly thereafter)...\".109\n\nCase Study, Concession for the potable Water and Sewarage Services in Tucum\u00e1n, Argentine Republic, by Jorge Carlos Rais, Maria Esther Esquivel, Sergio Sour, Consultants, April 2001 (Exhibit 858), at \u00b616-17.\n\n4.8.5.\n\nGeneral Bussi won the election on 2 July 1995 and took office on 30 October, shortly after CAA had issued its first invoices. By then, as detailed more fully below, political opposition was growing within the Legislature more generally and this set the political stage for the intense scrutiny to which the concession and the concessionaire were to become subject.\n\n**4.9. Initial Operation of the Concession**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n4.9.1.\n\nIt is Respondent\u2019s case that Claimants precipitated a crisis of confidence in the concession by immediately increasing tariffs to the contractual maximum (doubling the amount of any water bill that customers had ever received before) and by failing to comply with its investment and water quality testing obligations (thus allowing manganese to permeate the domestic water supply, leading to weeks of turbid - at times completely black - water in customer\u2019s taps).110 What actually occurred, however, points to a different explanation of the events of turbidity which occurred December 1995 / January 1996 and, to the extent it existed, any crisis of confidence in the Province\u2019s water service.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b6115-118.\n\n4.9.2.\n\nUpon the transfer of service, it is clear that CAA took emergency measures to reduce serious bacteriological risk, to improve water quality more generally and to upgrade the water and sewage infrastructure. In the first five months of the concession (August - December 1995) CAA refurbished the chlorination systems in drinking water facilities (replacing approximately 45% of the chlorination systems in Tucum\u00e1n wells), arranged for the cleaning of the drinking water distribution system and spent almost US$140,000 to rebuild the former DiPOS laboratory and purchase supplies and new equipment.111\n\nde Rochambeau Affidavit, 5 November 2004 (Exhibit 1), at \u00b6\u00b640, 42 and 46.\n\n4.9.3.\n\nChristian Lefaix, who served as CAA\u2019s Manager of Operations from 22 July 1994 until mid February 1998, testified as to the poor state of the water and sewer services in Tucum\u00e1n and the considerable deterioration of the system that had occurred in the six-month period before CAA\u2019s takeover. He also described the water quality, testing, technical operations and improvements made by CAA to the water and sewer services between 1995 - 1998. The chart below summarises Mr. Lefaix\u2019s evidence as to the improvements made during the last five months of 1995. His evidence was unchallenged and the Tribunal accepts it as an accurate record of CAA\u2019s initial activity.\n\n**CAA\u2019s Initial System Improvement112**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | 1995 Last Five Months |\n| Water network repairs | 5,018 |\n| Change and renewed values | 188 |\n| New interconnections (m) | 5,070 |\n| Purging and removing encrustations from pipes (m) | 18,150 |\n| New and renewed connections (m) | 118 |\n| New chlorinators | 115 |\n| Removing electrical panels | 51 |\n| Change of well pumps | 42 |\n| Repairs of sewer leaks | 405 |\n| Repairs of manhole covers | 166 |\n| Clearing sewer network obstructions | 2,596 |\n| Renovating sewage pumping stations | 2 |\n| Cleaning sewage pipes (m) | 295,800 |\n| Water analysis (number of tests) | 3,044 |\n| Water analysis (parameters of tests) | 15,220 |\n\nLefaix Affidavit, 3 November 2004 (Exhibit 2), at \u00b626.\n\n**4.10. CAA\u2019s First Bills to its Customers**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n4.10.1.\n\nOn 1 August 1995, CAA\u2019s General Manager, G\u00e9rald Gu\u00e9rin, wrote to each of Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s municipalities explaining that, under the terms of the Concession Agreement, taxes were to be charged separately from the service tariff on CAA\u2019s invoices and requested that each municipality inform CAA of the applicable taxes and contributions to be added to CAA\u2019s invoices for its residents.113\n\nLetter from CAA to Municipalities of Province of Tucum\u00e1n, 1 August 1995 (Exhibit 831).\n\n4.10.2.\n\nShortly thereafter, on 4 August 1995, CAA wrote to ERSACT advising that CAA would soon start issuing bills to its customers and enclosing a copy of Mr Gu\u00e9rin\u2019s letter to the municipalities. (A model invoice was also enclosed).\n\n4.10.3.\n\nIn mid-September 1995, CAA started to invoice its customers for its first billing period (July - August 1995).114 CAA\u2019s rates reflected an approximate 67.9% average tariff increase from the rates previously charged by DiPOS. The invoices corresponded precisely to the model previously submitted to ERSACT and, as with the model, also contained an additional charge for taxes, which included provincial taxes, municipal levies and federal taxes. In total, CAA\u2019s first invoices reflected on average, an approximate 110% increase over the rates previously charged by DiPOS. However, this rate increase was not uniform, due to the reclassification of numerous customers. This led to higher increased in the middle and higher range, with the lower income population experiencing little or no change.115\n\nRespondent argues that the initial billing period was only 41 days, and thus customers would not initially have appreciated the impact of the increase in tariffs and the billing of taxes: Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder at \u00b6\u00b6 205-209.\n\nCAA Invoice, 1 March 1996 (Exhibit 139). See also the Rais Report, \u00b646.\n\n4.10.4.\n\nOn 17 September 1995, ERSACT published an advertisement in *La Gaceta* and *Sigio XXI* stating that the 67.9% tariff increase, the separate charges for municipal, provincial and federal taxes, and the separate 6% contribution to ERSACT were all mandated under the Concession Agreement.116\n\nERSACT advertisement, *La Gaceta,* 17 September 1995 (Exhibit 140).\n\n4.10.5.\n\nDespite the substantial increase in charges to customers, CAA\u2019s collection rate for its first invoices, for the July - August 1995 billing period, was 64.5%, although, as Mr. de Rochambeau testified under cross-examination, the actual collection rate was closer to 74%, given the fact that CAA had no addresses for 15,000 of its 170,000 customers when it sent its first bills.117\n\nde Rochambeau Affidavit, 5 November 2004 (Exhibit 1) at \u00b678, Testimony of de Rochambeau, Transcript of the hearing on the merits, Day 2, p. 360 (25 July 2006).\n\n**4.11. Post-Election Manifestations of Political Concern**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.11.1.\n\nAs noted in 4.8 above, by the time Governor Bassi took office, the political views about water services privatisation in general, and about the Concession Agreement in particular had shifted. As Vice Governor Topa confirmed during his cross-examination, both he and the Legislature held the view that the Concession Agreement had been \"born defective\":\n\n*\"Not from a legal point of view, but with everything that was going on, evidently it was out of line in terms of equations, possibility of providing the service, and particularly the possibility of a community to pay.* *However much, legally it might have been perfectly well adjusted.\"118*\n\nTestimony of Topa, Transcript of the hearing on the merits, Day 7, p. 1756 (30 July 2006).\n\n4.11.2.\n\nAn example of the early concern of one legislator is Gumersindo Paraj\u00f3n\u2019s proclamation on 6 September 1995, before CAA issued its first invoices, that \"[t]he people must join the civil resistance and refuse to pay the bloated invoices they will receive for potable water and sewage services\".119\n\n\"Paraj\u00f3n insta a resistir y no pagar el agua\", *La Gaceta,* 6 September 1995 (Exhibit 137).\n\n4.11.3.\n\nAnd Legislator Paraj\u00f3n\u2019s concern was not the expression of a voice in the wilderness. Despite ERSACT\u2019s prior vetting of CAA\u2019s first invoices, the publication of its 17 September 1995 advertisements, and an ERSACT representatives\u2019 confirmation on 28 September 1995 that\n\n*\"We have not detected any error in the first invoice that CAA has sent to its customers: the invoicing coincides with what is set forth in the Concession Agreement and Annex XIII which the executive power signed for the concession of the sanitation service \"120*\n\nthe Legislature passed a resolution that same day ordering ERSACT to provide information on the tariff increase and inviting members of the public to provide input on tariff rates. The resolution also instructed the Court of Accounts to investigate the legality of each item that appeared on CAA\u2019s invoices. And this occurred before the new government took office on 30 October 1995.121\n\n\"Revisaron Facturas de agua\", *La Gaceta,* 28 September 1995 (Exhibit 142).\n\nLegislature of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n Resolution No. 10, 28 September 1995 (Exhibit 143), at \u00b6\u00b61, 2 and 4. As Dr. Rais put it, the government blamed the previous government and the legislators, - even those from the party which had approved the privatisation - denied any part in the matter and felt free to join the opposition.\n\n4.11.4.\n\nAfter 30 October 1995, opposition to the Concession Agreement increased steadily. On 31 October 1995, legislators argued for a re-evaluation of the privatisation process.122 About two weeks later, on 17 November 1995, the Attorney General suggested that CAA\u2019s tariffs were unrealistic and advocated for \"tariff levels that are adjusted to the economic reality which the province is facing.\"123 In this same time frame a number of individual legislators began to call for the outright suspension of CAA\u2019s tariff structure and the outright repeal of the privatisation.124\n\n\"Los motores a toda marcha\", *Siglo XXI,* 31 October 1995 (Exhibit 144).\n\n\"La Legislatura quiere suspender el aumento de la traifa del agua\" *Siglo XXI,* 17 November 1995 (Exhibit 145).\n\n\"DiPOS: objetan privatizaci\u00f3n\", *Le Gaceta,* 29 November 1995 (Exhibit 147).\n\n4.11.5.\n\nDespite CAA\u2019s protestations to Governor Bussi that what was happening in the Legislature was harming its standing, impairing its ability to collect on its invoices and inconsistent with the Province\u2019s obligations under the Concession Agreement to cooperate with the concessionaire, on 12 December 2005, the Legislature adopted Resolution No. 2 which recommended that the Governor unilaterally impose a temporary tariff reduction to a rate no more than 35% greater than the old DiPOS tariff. The tariff change sought by the Legislature was to be retroactive to 22 July 1995 (the date CAA assumed the concession) and would continue with \"the establishment of a just and reasonable new tariff system.\"125\n\nLegislature of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n Resolution No. 2, 12 December 1995 (Exhibit 149).\n\n4.11.6.\n\nThe year ended with a legislative debate in which legislator Virgilio N\u00fa\u00f1ez argued in favour of the departure of CAA, the \"feudal lord\" rather than to require the people to pay the \"abusive\" tariffs. Mr. N\u00fa\u00f1ez concluded by comparing CAA officials to \"pirates\" taking the \"treasures\" that belong to the people of Tucum\u00e1n\".126\n\nLegislature of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, Legislative Debate, 28 December 1995 (Exhibit 151), at p. 3971.\n\n4.11.7.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of political criticism and uncertainty, CAA\u2019s initial collection rate for its first bills fell from 64.5% (for the July - August billing period) to 57.6% (for the September - October billing period) to 52.6% (for November - December billing period).127\n\nde Rochambeau Affidavit, 5 November 2004 (Exhibit 1), at \u00b6\u00b6 73 and 77.\n\n**4.12. Episodes of Turbidity**\n-------------------------------\n\n4.12.1.\n\nBetween December 1995 and February 1996, there were episodes of turbidity in the drinking water in areas of Tucum\u00e1n. The disputing parties disagreed on the cause, extent and impact of these episodes. Extensive evidence was tendered and much time was spent during the oral hearing on this subject.\n\n4.12.2.\n\nFor their part, Claimants contended that it was necessary to distinguish between localised \"reddish turbidity\" which occurred in certain areas in Tucum\u00e1n in December 1995 and January 1996 (said to be caused by the iron and copper oxides which were an unavoidable by-product of the cleaning and system improvements made by CAA at this time, and which posed no risk to human health) and the \"manganese turbidity\" that occurred in late January and early February 1996 (caused by the unforeseeable entry of manganese from the bottom of the El Cadillal reservoir into the water system in San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n). The manganese turbidity was also said not to pose any risk to human health.\n\n4.12.3.\n\nAccording to Respondent, all turbidity was one and the same, having started in mid-December and lasting through February 1996. Respondent argued that CAA should have foreseen the risk of the possible appearance of manganese and that the \"Blackwater\" was eminently foreseeable and avoidable.128\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b6165-168.\n\n4.12.4.\n\nOn these questions, the Tribunal concludes that there were two distinct and isolated incidents of water turbidity in the Tucum\u00e1n water system, that neither incident posed any health risk to the people of Tucum\u00e1n and that both incidents were resolved promptly in a manner which demonstrated CAA\u2019s efficiency and professionalism.\n\n**Appearance of Reddish Turbidity**\n-----------------------------------\n\n4.12.5.\n\nIn late 1995 and early 1996, turbid water of a reddish colour appeared intermittently in localised portions of the water system of the provincial capital, San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n (\"San Miguel\"). As was pointed out by Mr. de Rochambeau, reddish turbidity had appeared periodically when the system was under DiPOS management and was unlikely to have been startling to San Miguel consumers. This turbidity almost certainly resulted, as was the case in late 1995, from the harmless break-away and release into the water supply of by-products of internal corrosion such as iron and copper oxides.129\n\nde Rochambeau Affidavit, 5 November 2004 (Exhibit 1), at \u00b6100. Customers in Tucum\u00e1n had been experiencing red turbidity on a recurring basis for many years - see ERSACT / CAA Sub-Committee on Water Quality, Final Report (with partial English translation), May 1996 (Exhibit 870). Importantly, the red turbidity posed no risk to human health.\n\n4.12.6.\n\nIronically, the reddish turbidity episode which occurred in December 1995 was a side effect of CAA\u2019s initial system improvements. Corroded elements broke away from the pipes, in part due to increases in water pressure, and in part due to reversals of the water flow following installation of new interconnections in the network. When reddish turbidity occurred, CAA responded by purging the system and injecting caustic soda at water treatment facilities, which effectively resolved the problem.\n\n4.12.7.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Claimants\u2019 witnesses evidence (that of Messrs, de Rochambeau, Lefaix, Roberson and Dr. Gibb) that the effects of the appearances of reddish turbidity were minimal. According to data maintained by CAA, the reddish turbidity appeared only in water that passed through or in that part of the system that was interconnected with cast-iron pipes, and affected, intermittently, only about 5-10% of CAA\u2019s customers. Importantly, as was recognised by ERSACT itself, these episodes never posed any health risk and periodic repetition of the treatment process described above prevented any repeat occurrences.130\n\nde Rochambeau Affidavit, 5 November 2004 (Exhibit 1), at \u00b6\u00b6100-102; Lefaix Affidavit, 3 November 2004 (Exhibit 2), at \u00b6\u00b631 and 36; Roberson Affidavit, 11 February 2006 (Exhibit 798), at \u00b6\u00b66-17 and Gibb Report, 10 February 2006 (Exhibit 797), at \u00b6\u00b68-11, 26-28 and 36-37. In its Resolution No. 21/96 of 19 January 1996, ERSACT said that the analyses its laboratory carried out showed that the water was suitable for human consumption and posed no risk to human health (Exhibit 832).\n\n**Appearance of Manganese Turbidity**\n-------------------------------------\n\n4.12.8.\n\nIn late January 1996, the water system in parts of San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n also experienced the appearance of a dark, blackish turbidity due to the presence in the water supply of manganese from the El Cadillal reservoir. The manganese turbidity was far more widespread than the previous episodes of reddish turbidity and, given the unattractive appearance of the water, it had the potential to be, and no doubt was very upsetting to consumers.\n\n4.12.9.\n\nThe manganese turbidity episode occurred as the result of a complex chemical reaction, the seeds for which had been sown over many years. In simple terms, manganese exists in the mud at the bottom of lakes (generally old lakes) and under certain circumstances dissolves in the lake water. Such water will turn dark in colour when it comes into contact with chlorine or oxygen.\n\n4.12.10.\n\nIn order to understand why the manganese problem occurred, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of the water in the El Cadillal basin. During the summer, the water stratifies into two layers. The temperature in the top layer of water rises, which causes it to circulate and become highly oxygenated. The bottom lawyer is relatively cold, does not circulate freely and contains very little oxygen. The two layers do not mix well.\n\n4.12.11.\n\nAlthough El Cadillal is a fairly young lake, it turns out the silt at the bottom of the basin contained crystalised manganese. Manganese is soluble in unoxygenated water and in January 1996 the crystalline manganese in the silt in the bottom of El Cadillal dissolved in the unoxygenated bottom layer of water. Manganese crystals do not dissolve easily and will do so only under certain conditions. These occurred that January.\n\n4.12.12.\n\nAs Mr. Lefaix explained in his testimony, the water in the El Cadillal basin had not been renewed for sometime (it having not rained for months in Tucum\u00e1n and because the deep water outlets from the basin had been closed in an effort to prevent mud slides in the bottom of the reservoir comparable to those that had occurred in 1983). These factors, together with the presence of algae, further reduced the oxygen level at the bottom of the lake and increased the volume of the unoxygenated bottom layer of water. This confluence of events caused the manganese crystals to dissolve in the unoxygenated water at the bottom of the lake.\n\n4.12.13.\n\nDuring December 1995 and until mid-January 1996 CAA had been pumping water from the reservoir to the treatment plant through the raw water intake. CAA tested for manganese at the entrance of the treatment plant in December 1995 and January 1996 and no manganese was detected.\n\n4.12.14.\n\nAt the time CAA took over the water service, a second water intake, located at the floating pumping station, was not working. During November and December 1995, CAA had renovated the surface pumping station to restore it to good working order. On 17 January 1996 it tested the floating pumping station. No manganese turbidity occurred at this time.\n\n4.12.15.\n\nHowever, by 22 January 1996, the lower layer of unoxygenated water had risen above the level of the raw water intake, which meant that the water then being pumped to the treatment station through the raw water intake contained dissolved manganese. Thus water containing manganese in solution was pumped throughout the network. However, since that water was not oxygenated, the manganese remained in solution and the water remained clear. Nevertheless, the manganese in the solution began to collect on the sides of the pipes throughout the system through the process of absorption.\n\n4.12.16.\n\nAt about this time, the treatment of water taken from the reservoir though the raw water intake was becoming difficult and CAA decided to start pumping water from the renovated surface pumping station. Within hours of beginning to do so, turbidity started to appear in the water and at dawn on 26 January 1996 a generalised turbidity appeared in the San Miguel network. As a result of highly oxygenated water being pumped into the system from the surface layer of water from the floating pumping station, the manganese that had been dissolved in the water that was already in the system (or deposited on the walls of the pipes) precipitated and turned the water turbid.\n\n4.12.17.\n\nThe disputing parties differed sharply as to the foreseability of a potential manganese turbidity problem at the time CAA took over the concession. Respondent contended that the potential problem was entirely foreseeable and could and should have been averted. Claimants argued that nothing in the history of the service suggested the possibility of such an occurrence and that its causes were unique and not reasonably to have been anticipated.\n\n4.12.18.\n\nOn this point, the Tribunal accepts as accurate the evidence of Mr. Lefaix, that neither DiPOS nor CAA knew of the presence of manganese prior to the problem in January 1996 and that no historical records indicated that the silt at the bottom of the El Cadillal reservoir contained manganese.\n\n4.12.19.\n\nMr. Lefaix\u2019s evidence was confirmed by Respondent\u2019s witness, Dr. Courel, who testified under cross-examination that DiPOS did not conduct sampling to detect manganese. As Dr. Courel was in charge of the water quality control service at ERSACT in January 1996, having worked at DiPOS since 1984, we are satisfied by this evidence, and the fact that there were no facilities in place to treat manganese at any of the treatment plants in Tucum\u00e1n, that the episode of manganese turbidity which occurred in January 1996 was not foreseeable.131\n\nLefaix Affidavit, 3 November 2004 (Exhibit 2), at \u00b641. and Testimony of Courel, Transcript of the hearing on merits, Day 9, pp. 2153-2154 (2 August 2006).\n\n4.12.20.\n\nWe are also satisfied that CAA\u2019s response to the manganese episode was swift, professional and effective. CAA diagnosed the cause of the turbidity within hours after it appeared and adopted corrective measures in the early morning of 26 January 1996. The same day, CAA notified ERSACT that it believed it knew the cause of the turbidity.132 Within 72 hours of the peak in turbidity, CAA had in place a standard treatment programme to separate the manganese dioxide from the water, by injecting potassium permanganate and then using filters and decanters. It had also put in place an intensive sampling and analysis programme to prevent such future incidents. By the beginning of February, a few days after the dark turbidity appeared, water distributed through the network already had manganese concentrations below the level specified in the Concession Agreement.133 The Joint ERSACT / CAA Sub-Committee on Water Quality reached the same conclusion, noting as well that CAA\u2019s monitoring of the water quality in the days following the incident which included more than 500 turbidity analyses per week, was \"exceptional\".134\n\nLetter from CAA to ERSACT, 26 January 1996 (Exhibit 853).\n\nLefaix Supplemental Affidavit, 8 February 2006 (Exhibit 789), at \u2018\u00b683.\n\nERSACT / CAA Subcommittee on Water Quality, Final Report (with partial English translation), May 1996 (Exhibit 870).\n\n4.12.21.\n\nAlthough it is generally well understood that the presence of manganese in water poses no health risk, CAA nonetheless retained an Argentine doctor, an expert in water-borne infectious diseases, who conducted a detailed study and confirmed that no health risk existed. Throughout, the population was informed about the absence of health risks and CAA held a press conference shortly after the incident to explain the phenomenon to its customers. All in all, the manganese episode was resolved in about two weeks and the phenomenon gradually disappeared over that time.135\n\nLefaix Affidavit, 3 November 2004 (Exhibit 2), at \u00b6\u00b664-67. de Rochambeau Affidavit, 5 November 2004 (Exhibit 1), at \u00b6\u00b6113-115 and Dr. Pedro Calm evaluaci\u00f3n microbiol\u00f2gica del sistema de aguas de San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n, February 1996 (Exhibit 54), Testimony of Roberson, Transcript of the hearing on the merits, Day 5, pp. 1219-1221 (28 July 2006) and Testimony of Gibb, Transcript of the hearing on the merits, Day 5, pp. 1273-1277, 1293-1296 (28 July 2006).\n\n**4.13. Regulatory and Political Responses to \"Water Quality\" and TurbidityEpisodes**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.13.1.\n\nDespite the measures taken at the outset by CAA to improve the Tucum\u00e1n water service, despite having confirmed that CAA\u2019s first billings were mandated by the Concession Agreement and despite a six-month contractual grace period (against regulatory fines relating to quality controls),136 in early December, and over the next several months, ERSACT initiated a series of \"regulatory\" proceedings against CAA for alleged problems with water quality and its invoices. During this same period, members of the Executive and a number of provincial entities also became publicly engaged on these issues.\n\nConcesi\u00f3n del Servico de Agua y Desag\u00fces (loacales en la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n, Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n (Concession Agreement), with Annexes XIV, XX-XXII, 18 May 1995 (Exhibit 127), at Article 14.8.2.\n\n4.13.2.\n\nAn understanding of what motivated these regulatory and political responses to CAA\u2019s initial operation of the concession, its billings and the episodes of turbidity described above is key to determining whether or not Claimants\u2019 Treaty rights were contravened in this case.\n\n**101 Charges of Water Quality Control Breaches**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n4.13.3.\n\nOn 6 December 1995, ERSACT accused CAA of breaching its water quality control obligations under the Concession Agreement by not taking samples and testing in 78 different localities in the interior in August and September 1995.\n\n4.13.4.\n\nBy letter dated 8 January 1996 (misdated 1995), CAA denied liability, requested that the 78 separate claims be consolidated into a single proceeding, and invoked its rights under the grace period.\n\n4.13.5.\n\nOn 7 February 1996, ERSACT rejected CAA\u2019s challenge and levied 78 fines on CAA for a total of US$78,000. On the same date, it accused CAA of 23 further breaches of its water quality control obligations under the Concession Agreement by not taking samples and testing in 23 locations in the interior in October 1995. (These regulatory charges did not result in fines at this time, but were dealt with 20 months later - ERSACT\u2019s behaviour in late 1997 is dealt with later in this Award).\n\n4.13.6.\n\nDr. Daniel Paz (CAA\u2019s then Director of Legal Affairs) testified that, shortly after these first fines were imposed, he requested (and was granted) a meeting with Engineer Franco Davolio, the Sub-Interventor (the \"Intervention\" of ERSACT by the Executive on 26 January 1996 is described below), the second highest official at ERSACT. Given CAA\u2019s increasingly difficult relationship with ERSACT, Dr. Paz had become more cautious in his dealings with the Regulator, and had sought an in-person meeting to confirm (against the originals) the completeness of the annexes to an ERSACT Resolution of which CAA had recently been notified. A meeting was fixed for late in the day of Friday, 16 February 1996 and Dr. Paz asked Mr. Jos\u00e9 Padilla, a notary public, to accompany him to make an official notarial record *(Acta) of* what transpired. (Under Argentine law, the events verified by a notary public in his or her presence and transcribed in the form of an *Acta* over his or her signature are to be considered as totally authentic, not only between the parties, but also with respect to third parties).137\n\nPadilla Affidavit, 6 January 2006 (Exhibit 794) at \u00b6 3. Mr. Padilla\u2019s evidence on this point was not challenged.\n\n4.13.7.\n\nAlthough Engineer Davolio testified that the 16 February 1996 meeting never took place, the Tribunal is satisfied that the meeting occurred on the date and as described by Messrs. Paz and Padilla. (This on the basis of (i) the contemporaneous letter, prepared in the ordinary course of business, sent by CAA to Mr. Fogliata (Mr. Davolio\u2019s superior) on 19 February 1996 (the Monday following the Friday meeting) that refers specifically to the meeting, its purpose, the discussion that took place and the fact that notarial records had been made,138 (ii) the testimony of Messrs. Paz and Padilla, and (iii) the contents of Mr. Padilla\u2019s *Acta* No. 60.139 Under cross-examination, Mr. Davolio testified that he saw CAA\u2019s confirmatory letter at the time but, rather than respond, he and Mr. Fogliata decided simply to \"set it aside\".140\n\nLetter from CAA to ERSACT, 19 February 1996 (Exhibit 860).\n\nActa No. 60, Notary Public Alvaro Padilla, 16 February 1996 (Exhibit 859).\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 8, pp. 1937-1938 (31 July 2006).\n\n4.13.8.\n\nBecause of its importance, that part of Notary Padilla\u2019s record of the Paz / Davolio exchange on the subject of the 78 fines that had just been imposed by ERSACT, is set out fully below:\n\n*\"Dr. Paz then told Mr. Davolio: \"Don \u2019tyou think we \u2019re getting buried in paper from all these cases being fded lately? Take the case of the 78 fines: don \u2019tyou think a single case could have been filed, instead of 78? \" Mr.* *Davolio replied, \"[t]hat \u2019s how I see it. If it were up to me,* *I would resolve most of these matters with a telephone call.* *As far as the 78 fines, I agree,*  *but my superiors are asking me to put pressure on Aguas del Aconquija to renegotiate the rates. \"*\n\n*\"Dr. Paz then told Mr. Davolio, \"Lately our engineers are spending more time on inspections in response to resolutions than on technical work. Do you think a relationship can be kept up under those conditions for 30 years? \".*\n\n*\"Mr. Davolio replied; \"* *Look, this whole problem came about because of the high rates and, what is worse, you had the misfortune that the manganese thing happened, which it never had before in Tucum\u00e1n. So until the rates are renegotiated like the government wants, the order from* *higher up is to keep applying pressure with whatever we\u2019ve*  *got\"*\n\n*Mr. Davolio then said \"you have no idea how much I want to get out of here. I am sure that right now someone is on the phone saying, \"What is Davolio doing meeting with CCA \u2019s [sic] people for over half an hour?*  *But I don\u2019t care.* *You two leave and I will deny everything* *\".*141 (emphasis added)\n\nPadilla Affidavit, 6 January 2006, Annex B (Exhibit 794).\n\n4.13.9.\n\nAfter the completion of his re-examination Mr. Davolio was invited by the Chairman of the Tribunal to reconsider his testimony - that the 16 February 1996 meeting never occurred - on the basis of his memory possibly being refreshed by reference to CAA\u2019s 19 February 1996 letter to Mr. Fogliata. Mr. Davolio declined to do so, and stated \"I\u2019m absolutely certain it did not happen.\"142\n\nTranscript of the hearing on merits, Day 8, pp. 1979-1980 (31 July 2006).\n\n4.13.10.\n\nFor the reasons noted at 4.13.7 above, the Tribunal accepts as accurate the testimony of Messrs. Paz and Padilla as to what happened on 16 February 1996.\n\n**Regulatory and Political Responses to the Episodes of Turbidity**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.13.11.\n\nAs noted above, episodes of red turbidity had been experienced on a recurring basis in San Miguel for many years and were known to be harmless. Indeed, on 19 January 1996, about a week before the occurrence of manganese turbidity, ERSACT confirmed that its own laboratory\u2019s analyses showed that the water in San Miguel posed no risk to human health and was suitable for human consumption.143\n\nERSACT Resolution No. 21/96, 19 Januaiy 1996 (Exhibit 832).\n\n4.13.12.\n\nSimilarly, the evidence is clear that the manganese turbidity, while disagreeable in the words of G\u00e9rald Gu\u00e9rin, even \"repugnant\"144, never posed a risk to human health. Claimants\u2019 experts testimony to this effect, echoed ERSACT\u2019s announcement, published in Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s two leading newspapers on 26 January 1996 that the manganese related turbidity did not pose a threat to human health.145\n\nLetter from G\u00e9rald Gu\u00e9rin (CAA) to ERSACT re file 128/300 (\"Just as repugnant as harmless\"), 28 February 1996 (Exhibit 661).\n\nGibb Report, 10 February 2006 (Exhibit 797), at \u00b640; ERSACT advertisement in *Siglo XXI* and *La Gaceta,* 26 January 1996 (Exhibit 152).\n\n4.13.13.\n\nHowever, instead of seeking to calm consumers during this difficult period, as might have been expected, government ministers and the executive behaved in a manner which undermined both the water services operator and the Regulator. On 24 January 1996, under the headline \"Guraiib says that the water damages our health\", *La Gaceta* reported Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s Health Minister telling the Legislature that the water in San Miguel could cause cholera, typhoid and hepatitis.146 Thereafter, on 31 January 1996, the Minister of Health, during a legislative debate, stated that CAA was supplying \"bacteriologically contaminated water\".147\n\n*La Gaceta,* 24 January 1996 (Exhibit 548).\n\nLegislature of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, Legislative Debate, 31 January 1996 (Exhibit 160).\n\n4.13.14.\n\nVice Governor Topa testified at the oral hearing that the Health Minister had come to see him before making the former statement. His evidence was that, when told that the Minister believed the water could be a risk to public health, he presumed that a health specialist, such as the Minister, would have \"conducted a number of analyses and tests with his technicians to say that the water was not drinkable\" before making such public statements.148 However, no evidence of any such analyses was submitted by the Respondent.\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 7, p. 1709 (30 July 2006).\n\n4.13.15.\n\nTwo days after the Health Minister\u2019s first statement, and on the day ERSACT published its advertisements reassuring the public that the manganese turbidity posed no health threat, Vice Governor Topa, acting on behalf of Governor Bussi, \"took the decision to intervene in the agency\", replaced its board of directors and appointed Mr. Franco Fogliata to serve as \"Interventor\", heading ERSACT as its \"chief government inspector\". (Prior to his appointment as Interventor, Mr. Fogliata had served - and continued to do so - as Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s Minister of Production.) Three days later, Mr. Franco Davolio, was appointed as Sub-Interventor of ERSACT, becoming Interventor on 7 March 1996, \"upon the delegation of that office by the Minister of Production\".149\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 7, pp. 1906-1907 (30 July 2006); Davolio Affidavit, 29 September 2005 (Exhibit 383), at \u00b62.\n\n4.13.16.\n\nUnder Argentine law, the intervention into an agency such as ERSACT is permissible only in an emergency. When an Interventor is installed, his or her job is not to take over the agency permanently, but to reorganise it and resolve the emergency.150\n\nBianchi Report, 13 February 2006 (Exhibit 801), at \u00b6\u00b6192-196.\n\n4.13.17.\n\nVice Governor Topa explained the Province\u2019s decision to intervene ERSACT was based on \"a public alert situation\", \"a public situation with extreme pressure on the government\" which resulted from \"a sudden increase in the tariff of over a hundred percent in the first bill\", \"the episode of water turbidity\" and with the regulatory agency not responding with clarity, but with ambiguities.151\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 7, pp. 1629-1632 (30 July 2006).\n\n4.13.18.\n\nThat the decisions of ERSACT were \"politicised\" and directed by the Executive from that point forward is not in doubt. Mr. Davolio testified under cross-examination as to the decision / resolution making process when Mr. Fogliata was Interventor, and after:\n\n***\"A.***  *The regulatory body, its function was to oversee compliance with the contract in every respect, and when there was what is called a breach or non-performance, then a resolution was issued when that non-performance was well-founded and duly proven. That is what you call resolution against CAA.*\n\n***Q.***  *Thank you for that clarification. When such a resolution was issued, was the ultimate decision whether or not such a resolution should be issued a decision of Minister Fogliata?*\n\n***A.***  *Exactly. Until the day that I took over as Interventor, but despite that, even after that, I always consulted with him \"... \"Well, while he was the Interventor, its not that he would issue it. It would be drawn up by ERSACT. It would be taken to Minister Fogliata for him to it define or decide whether it was appropriate because he would have a political view or policy view beyond the resolution and in light of how the relationship with the company stood\"152*\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 8, pp. 1941-1943 (31 July 2006).\n\n4.13.19.\n\nOn the same day it was intervened, ERSACT issued Resolution 51/96 declaring CAA to be *at fault* for the manganese incident and imposing, *as a penalty,* 35 days free service for affected customers.\n\n**4.14. Regulatory and Political Responses to CAA\u2019s Invoices**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.14.1.\n\nAs noted at 4.11.3 above, the legality of CAA\u2019s first invoices (specifically, the addition of certain federal, provincial and municipal taxes to CAA\u2019s service tariff) was put in issue initially by the Legislature\u2019s 28 September 1996 Resolution calling for their examination by the Court of Accounts. This was followed shortly by the establishment of the Legislature\u2019s Special Commission and the Attorney General\u2019s call for the CAA\u2019s \"unrealistic\" tariffs to be adjusted to reflect the economic reality the Province was facing.\n\n4.14.2.\n\nGiven the importance that the tax component of CAA\u2019s bills assumed in this dispute, it is useful to summarise briefly the taxes that were involved.\n\n4.14.3.\n\nWhen the decision was taken to privatise, the Province elected to impose six new taxes (or charges) on users of the water service. These were:\n\n(i) *\"Ingresos Brutos\"* (\"IB\"), a provincial tax on CAA\u2019s gross income equal to 2.5% of the service tariff;\n\n(ii) *PACIS,* a municipal tax equal to 1.2% of the service tariff;\n\n(iii) *Contribuci\u00f3n de Ocupaci\u00f3n de Suelos* (\"OS\"), a municipal tax that varied between the municipalities but was equal to 6.0% of the service tariff in San Miguel Tucum\u00e1n;\n\n(iv) a municipal retention levy (\"RM\"), collected on behalf of the municipalities, and equal to 2.0% of the service tariff;\n\n(v) a federal value-added tax (\"IVA\"), being 21% of the sum of the service tariff and the IB, PACIS and OS taxes; and\n\n(vi) \"ENTE, a charge paid to ERSACT, being 6% of the sum of the service tariff and the IB, PACIS, OS, RM and IVA taxes and levies.\n\n4.14.4.\n\nThe total value of the six taxes was approximately 38.7% of CAA\u2019s service tariff (slightly higher when grossed-up as required), and it is Respondent\u2019s present position that the parties dispute over taxes concerned only the addition to CAA\u2019s tariff changes of IB (2.5%), PACIS (1.21%) and a municipal tax (assessment) on the supply of network water and sewage service (4.52%).153 Put another way, whatever may have appeared to be in issue at the time, disputing parties now agree that amounts totalling approximately 30% of CAA\u2019s service tariff were properly to be charged on top of the 67.9% increase over the former DiPOS rates which was permitted in the first year *(ie* for an undisputed total increase of 98% over the DiPOS rate).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief at \u00b6 9. Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Closing argument (\u00b6\u00b611, 14 and 16) notes that the Province never questioned CAA\u2019s interpretation regarding the tax for the municipal assessment of the public space (\u00b614), but it seems clear the charge for this tax was in issue, given Respondent\u2019s position that it had been repealed when CAA charged for it in its invoices (at \u00b616).\n\n4.14.5.\n\nAlthough ERSACT\u2019s early position on the propriety of CAA adding the taxes in question to its service tariff is clear - its 17 September 1995 advertisement in *La* *Gaceta* stated:\n\n*\"2. The billings by \"AGUAS DEL ACONQUIJA S.A. \" include a 67.9% increase over the rate schedule amounts for the last billing by DiPOS, plus the cost to the Concessionaire of provincial taxes and municipal taxes (on the rate for service net of VAT) and the 6% contribution to the Regulatory Agency \".154*\n\nCarlos Barrionuevo, ERSACT\u2019s then head, told his board on 20 September 1995, that \"the Concession Agreement contains absurd provisions\" and asked the board to \"issue an administrative act ordering a halt to the attempt to collect all these charges\".155 The board minutes record a discussion about the scope of the Regulator\u2019s power to interpret the contractual provisions, but a complete copy of the minutes not having been produced, it is not possible to say what then transpired.\n\nERSACT advertisement, *La Gaceta,* 17 September 1995 (Exhibit 140).\n\nMinutes No. 9 of the Board of Directors of ERSACT, 20 September 1995 (Exhibit 434).\n\n4.14.6.\n\nOn 25 September 1996, five days after Mr. Barrionuevo\u2019s presentation to the board, ERSACT requested the Attorney General to issue a report on the difference between the signed Concession Agreement and the Bid Conditions. Three days later, on 28 September 1996, the Legislature ordered ERSACT to provide information on the tariff increase, invited public comment on tariff rates and instructed the Court of Accounts to investigate the legality of each item on CAA\u2019s invoices.\n\n4.14.7.\n\nOn 16 November 1996, legislators from the governing party filed a bill to form a commission to investigate the tariff structure of the concession. At the same time, opposition legislators brought forward another bill to create a commission to investigate the privatisation process. The next day, both bills were merged and an Investigative Commission was formed for both purposes. Mr. Prospero Barrionuevo (a member of the legislature and the opposition *Justicialista* party - not to be confused with Carlos Barrionuevo, Head of ERSACT) was appointed to the Commission.\n\n4.14.8.\n\nLess than a month later, on 12 December 1996, and *before* receiving reports from the Attorney General, the Court of Accounts or the Investigative Commission, the Legislature adopted a resolution calling for CAA\u2019s tariffs to be reduced -retroactive to 22 July 1995.\n\n4.14.9.\n\nA month after that, on 15 January 1996, the Attorney General issued his opinion, concluding that the Circular No. 2 (described above at 4.2.12) did not justify Article 9.2 of the Concession Agreement - this on the basis that such ministry circulars should be limited to the modification of non-essential provisions. However, no suggestion was made by the Attorney General that CAA had acted improperly, or that its invoicing procedures breached the Concession Agreement. Nor did he recommend that CAA be sanctioned, or that the Province act, on its own, to amend the Concession Agreement. Rather, he stated, \"it is necessary to convene the board of directors of Aguas del Aconquija, through its chairman or representative, with the purpose of *reaching an agreement* that would make it possible to restructure the rate charge... in accordance with our findings.156 (emphasis added)\n\nOpinion of the Attorney General, 15 January 1996 (Exhibit 159) at pp. 3-4.\n\n4.14.10.\n\nAbout three weeks later (two weeks after it had been intervened), on 9 February 1996, ERSACT issued Resolution 170/96 in which it found CAA\u2019s invoicing procedures to be *\"invalid acts\"* and \"order[ed] that they be revoked or replaced *for reasons of illegitimacy*... in order to avoid [ERSACT] issuing an administrative decision that forces CAA to reduce the current rate charged\".157 (emphasis added) The resolution also directed CAA, within 48 hours, to submit a corrected rate schedule based on the Attorney General\u2019s opinion and subject to ERSACT\u2019s approval. Until such approval was received, CAA was enjoined from issuing new invoices or collecting on outstanding invoices. The resolution also directed that it be distributed broadly to associations of users and consumers as well as to the Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\nERSACT Resolution No. 170/96, 9 Februaiy 1996 (Exhibit 154).\n\n4.14.11.\n\nThe next day, in a statement to the press, the Ministry of the Interior, Alberto Germano, stated that CAA\u2019s Concession Agreement should be rescinded, because CAA provides \"a very bad service with a high tariff\u2019. The Minister went on to say that the Province was prepared to take over the concession.158\n\nStatement to the press, 10 February 1996 (Exhibit 436).\n\n4.14.12.\n\nOn 13 February 1996, ERSACT issued Resolution No. 173/96, directing that CAA grant affected customers a 35-days billing holiday (from 2 January to 6 February 1996). ERSACT subsequently affirmed the billings holiday order by Resolution 213/96 on 19 March 1996.\n\n4.14.13.\n\nCAA appealed Resolution 170/96 on 14 February 1996. In doing so, it disagreed with the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, but noted that, even if the opinion were accepted, the resolution was inconsistent with it.\n\n4.14.14.\n\nOn 15 February 1996, in a statement to the press, Governor Bussi announced the intention of his government to rescind the Concession Agreement:\n\n***\"Journalist -***  *is the agreement going to be rescinded? Is the Executive Branch continuing to pursue this issue?*\n\n***Mr. Bussi -***  *that is the intention. Unless there is a miracle, and I do believe in miracles, but...*\n\n***Journalist -***  *do you believe that such a miracle is close?*\n\n***Mr. Bussi -***  *No, no. I have said this before and I will say it again: I don\u2019t see any possibility of a miracle any time soon\"159*\n\nStatement to the press by Governor Bussi, 15 February 1996 (Exhibit 141).\n\n4.14.15.\n\nThe next day, 16 February 1996, the Court of Accounts rendered its opinion. It endorsed the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation and found that CAA should not be invoicing for IB (2.5%) and PACIS (1.21%) taxes. It concluded that the RM (2%) tax was the only *municipal* tax that could be charged on top of the service tariff (emphasis added). The Court of Accounts endorsed the Attorney General\u2019s recommendation that ERSACT negotiate with CAA to resolve the issue.160\n\nCourt of Accounts Resolution No. 015, 16 February 1996 at Article 3 (Exhibits 170 and 170A).\n\n4.14.16.\n\nThat same day an advertisement appeared in *AMBITO Financiero* which was titled \"The Water Problem in Tucum\u00e1n, Governor Bussi\u2019s report to the Tucum\u00e1n Legislature on \"Aguas del Aconquija\" \". The advertisement appeared over Governor Bussi\u2019s name and title. The advertisement contained, *inter alia,* the following relevant statements:\n\n*\"the company... has not given much thought to the consequences of trying to convert its breach of contract into a political issue...\"*\n\n*\u2019\u2019the concessionaire company has been systematically ignoring and evading performance of the agreement. \"*\n\n*\"neither... the Ambassadors of France and Spain have had to suffer what the 700,000 Tucum\u00e1n residents had to suffer for a good part of the month of January, during which substance which was anything but water was distributed through the pipes. That substance was neither potable nor usable \".*\n\n*\"the possible application to Aguas del Aconquija of the maximum sanction set forth in the Concession Agreement -* *Rescission - is not a capricious action by Governor Bussi.* *It is the response to a unanimous request by the entire social, political, guild and business spectrum of the province, duly represented by the Honourable Legislature, which has been supporting without hesitation the actions undertaken by the Executive Branch. \"*\n\n*\"I will not hesitate to personally move forward with the administrative measures, as well as to also drive the legislative and legal actions that may be necessary to resolve the problem affecting the people of Tucum\u00e1n\",161*\n\nAdvertisement by Governor Bussi, *AMBITO Financiero,* 16 February 1996 (Exhibit 167).\n\n4.14.17.\n\nOn 19 March 1996, ERSACT issued Resolution 212/96 by which it (i) rejected CAA\u2019s appeal, (ii) maintained that CAA had breached the Concession Agreement, (iii) stated that ERSACT had not approved CAA\u2019s invoice, (iv) ordered CAA to correct its future invoices and credit users for the items improperly included on past invoices, and (v) informed the Executive Branch of CAA\u2019s \"serious and unjustified failure\" to comply with ERSACT\u2019s previous order, Resolution 170/96162. The Resolution stated that Resolution 170/96 had immediate effect, despite the pendency of CAA\u2019s appeal, and declared CAA to be in violation of its terms and required notification, amongst others, of the existing users and consumer associations. In support of its decision, ERSACT stated that the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, with which it agreed, \"leads to the need and obligation to take *urgent measures* in view of the *serious losses* that may be caused, or to attenuate those that have already been caused due to the incorrect billing, in addition to the *great social repercussions\".* It went on to note that \"the user is the first victim of this situation because of the undue funds charged, and the *disobedience is serious...* because of the *high amounts involved...* (emphasis added)\n\nERSACT Resolution No. 22/96, 19 March 1996 (Exhibit 157).\n\n4.14.18.\n\nAs regards the amounts involved, the three taxes at issue (IB, PACIS and OS - or, as now argued, \"the municipal taxes on the supply of network water and sewerage services\"), total approximately between 8.2 - 9.7% of the service charge. Having regard to Mr. de Rochambeau\u2019s uncontradicted evidence, that the average monthly invoice for water and sewage services in Tucum\u00e1n during CAA\u2019s operation of the concession was US$25.92. The Tribunal finds that the amount involved in the party\u2019s dispute concerning \"improper\" charges was approximately US$2.10 - US$2.50 per month - even in Tucum\u00e1n, a relatively small amount for the average customer. However, from CAA\u2019s perspective, a 3.7% reduction in revenue was substantial when looked at against the 11.7% rate of return it projected when it made its improved economic offer.163\n\nde Rochambeau Affidavit, 5 November 2004 (Exhibit 1), at \u00b627.\n\n4.14.19.\n\nOn 21 March 1996 the Attorney General advised customers \"not to pay the last invoice (January - February) until the company responds to the order issued by ERSACT instructing it to refrain from charging for the service provided from January 6 through February 6\".164\n\n\"El *fiscal Frias Silva inst\u00f3 a no pagar el agua\", Siglo XXI,* 21 March 1996 (Exhibit 171).\n\n**4.15. First Attempted Renegotiation**\n---------------------------------------\n\n4.15.1.\n\nOn 20 February 1996, Governor Bussi wrote to CGE\u2019s President, inviting him to a meeting to discuss \"the grave situation\" facing the Province and CAA.\n\n4.15.2.\n\nThe requested meeting by the Governor took place on 26 February 1996. CAA and CGE / Vivendi were represented by Mr. de Maud\u2019huy (CAA\u2019s Vice Chairman and a representative of CGE) and Mr. Erize (a director of CAA and counsel to CAA/CGE). They were accompanied by a representative of the French Embassy. Mr. de Maud\u2019huy testified as to what occurred at the meeting. His testimony was not contradicted and the Tribunal accepts his evidence in this regard.\n\n4.15.3.\n\nMr. de Maud\u2019huy recalled that Governor Bussi began by saying that there had been a \"misunderstanding\" between himself and CAA. He went on to say that taxes were part of CAA\u2019s tariff, that CAA must not charge customers the taxes in addition to its tariffs and that this was sufficient cause for the Province to repudiate the Concession Agreement. Nevertheless, in the light of President Menem\u2019s upcoming trip to France, he (Governor Bussi) was willing to negotiate a solution. He requested CAA\u2019s investors to bring forward a proposal for lower tariffs and corresponding adjustments to related contractual provisions that would correspond to the Tucum\u00e1n population\u2019s ability to pay. Mr. de Maud\u2019huy replied that the tariffs in the Concession Agreement were consistent with the terms set by the Province at the time of privatisation and had been calibrated to the population\u2019s ability to pay. However, Mr. de Maud\u2019huy indicated that, if necessary, CAA/ CGE would negotiate to resolve the crisis. The Governor responded that the investors in CAA had not answered his earlier invitation to renegotiate and that CAA did not seem fully to understand the risk it faced that the Concession Agreement might be declared null and void. He indicated that he was not prepared to continue to debate, that he intended to turn the matter over to the provincial Attorney General, and that if CAA wished to resolve matters by negotiation it should submit a firm proposal on new tariffs. He concluded the meeting by saying that he would wait only eight more days before rescinding the Concession Agreement.165\n\nde Maud\u2019huy Affidavit, 5 November 2004 (Exhibit 4), at \u00b6\u00b615-22.\n\n4.15.4.\n\nOn 6 March 1996, CAA submitted a proposal to Governor Bussi for a renegotiation of the Concession Agreement. The proposal contemplated, *inter alia,* a reduction in the concession area, a reduction in the investment obligations, a change in the tariff system to one based on actual consumption, and a reduction in tariffs.\n\n4.15.5.\n\nOn 11 March 1996, Minister Germano, the Head of the Ministry of Government, rejected CAA\u2019s proposal. He noted that the company did not appear to have \"welcomed the suggestions\" of Governor Bussi.166\n\nLetter from Minister Germano to CAA, CGE and DYCASA, 11 March 1996 (with English translation) (Exhibit 174).\n\n4.15.6.\n\nOn 18 March 1996, Minister Germano advised CAA of the government\u2019s preconditions for negotiation, which included an immediate tariff cut of 30%.\n\n4.15.7.\n\nOn 27 March 1996, CAA and representatives of the Province convened as the \"Commission for the Renegotiation of the Concession Agreement\" under the chairmanship of Minister Germano. In the course of the meeting, the parties agreed they would work on an analysis of a proposal submitted on the same date by CAA (in essence similar to the proposal submitted on 6 March 1996). The parties also agreed on terms to govern the period during the negotiations in March and April. Specifically, the parties agreed to a temporary 25% tariff reduction and a suspension of CAA\u2019s investment commitments. They also agreed, in principle, on a future reduction in the size of the concession area and on CAA\u2019s proposal to transition to a new usage-based rate structure.167\n\nComisi\u00f3n de Renegociaci\u00f3n del Contrato, Minutes of Meeting No. 1, 27 March 1996 (with English translation) (Exhibit 16).\n\n4.15.8.\n\nAs a result of the agreement in principle reached at this meeting, the Province agreed to suspend enforcement of ERSACT Resolutions 212/96 and 213/96 for the duration of the renegotiation. This decision was duly implemented on 14 April 1996, by ERSACT Resolution No. 289/96.168\n\nERSACT Resolution No. 289/96, 30 April 1996 (with English translation) (Exhibit 175)\n\n4.15.9.\n\nThe effect of the suspension of these resolutions 212/96 and 213/96 was to permit CAA to recommence invoicing its customers for its services (based on a 25% reduction) as well as for the disputed taxes and fees. ERSACT\u2019s 35-day billing holiday was also suspended (but not the 10-day billing holiday which CAA had offered at the time of the manganese turbidity incident). The Province also agreed to encourage the payment of all outstanding bills, by instalments over 90 days.\n\n**Failure of First Renegotiation**\n----------------------------------\n\n4.15.10.\n\nAlthough the first renegotiation initially seemed to promise an end to the crisis, it foundered as a result of concerns arising from the publication, on 10 May 1996, of the Legislature\u2019s \"Final Report of the Special Investigative Commission on the Privatization of DiPOS\".169\n\nLegislature of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, Informe de la Comisi\u00f3n Especial Investigadora del Proceso de Privatizaci\u00f3n de la EX Di.P.O.S., 10 May 1996 (Exhibit 176).\n\n4.15.11.\n\nThe report criticised the privatisation process and expressed concerns of corruption. According to the report, the Attorney General was expected to initiate criminal investigations as to the alleged irregularities. The Governor was also expected to take appropriate action, including nullification of the Concession Agreement if necessary.170\n\nLegislature of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, Informe de la Comisi\u00f3n Especial Investigadora del Proceso de Privatizaci\u00f3n de la EX Di.P.O.S., 10 May 1996 (Exhibit 176).\n\n4.15.12.\n\nAlthough the Attorney General later concluded that the report\u2019s charges were unfounded, it intensified criticism of CAA. Minister Germano stated that the \"Government could not continue to deal with criminals\" if the Legislature concluded that the Concession Agreement \"was riddled with \u2018irregularities\u2019 that would be felonies\" and on 14 May 1996, the renegotiations were suspended pending instructions from the Legislature.171\n\n\"EL *Gobierno decidi\u00f3 suspender la negociaci\u00f3n con la concesionara\", Siglo XXI,* 8 May 1996 (Exhibit 179).\n\n4.15.13.\n\nA few days later, a decision by ERSACT brought to an end the provisional arrangements that had been agreed to govern the first negotiations. On 16 May 1996, ERSACT issued Resolution No. 322/96, reactivating Resolutions No. 212/96 (prohibiting CAA from charging for the municipal taxes separately from its service tariff) and No. 213/96 (prohibiting CAA from invoicing for services from 2 January through 6 February 1996).172\n\nERSACT Resolution No. 322/96, 16 May 1996 (Exhibit 180).\n\n4.15.14.\n\nAlthough the Governor ordered the Interventor to repeal Resolution No. 322/96 (ERSACT complied with this direction on 29 May 1996, by issuing Resolution No. 333/96), the Court of Accounts moved to condemn the legality of ERSACT\u2019s latter resolution.\n\n4.15.15.\n\nAlso, on 30 May 1996, the Ombudsman issued his own resolution expressing his approval of ERSACT\u2019s Resolution No. 212/96 and, on the next day, established a claims procedure to permit CAA\u2019s customers to refuse to pay their water and sewage bills.173\n\nOmbudsman\u2019s Resolutions Nos. 66/96 and 67/96, 30-31 May 1996 (Exhibits 184 and 185).\n\n**4.16. Second Attempted Renegotiation**\n----------------------------------------\n\n4.16.1.\n\nDespite the unsettled environment and the failure of the first attempted renegotiation, a second round of renegotiations commenced in mid-1996. This was conducted with the assistance of representatives of the federal government (in particular Under-Secretary for Water Resources, Dr. Jorge Rais) and the World Bank. For the duration of these negotiations, CAA agreed not to exercise its right under Article 12.1 of the Concession Agreement to increase tariffs by 10% in the concession\u2019s second year.\n\n4.16.2.\n\nThe second attempted re-negotiation continued through the Argentine winter and reached its tentative conclusion on 30 August 1996, when the parties executed a \"Framework Agreement for the Reformulation of the Concession Agreement for the Water and Sewage Services\" (\"Framework Agreement\").174 On the same day, the Province, the national government and the World Bank signed a letter of intent to provide assistance in implementing any agreement between the parties modifying the Concession Agreement.175\n\nAcuerdo Marco para la Reformulaci\u00f3n del Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n del Servicio de Agua y Cloacas (Framework Agreement), 30 August 1996 (Exhibit 187).\n\nLetter of Intent signed by Province of Tucum\u00e1n, ENOHSA and World Bank, 30 August 1996 (Exhibit 188).\n\n4.16.3.\n\nThe Framework Agreement provided, *inter alia,* for the reduction of the concession area, changes in CAA\u2019s personnel structure, reductions in billings to customers and compensation to the concessionaire for reduced billings, *inter alia,* through decreased investment obligations. Under clause four of the Framework Agreement, customers would receive an average reduction in billings of 28% over a set period. In contrast to the terms of the 1995 Concession Agreement regarding separate charges for service and tax, the reduction in the Framework Agreement applied to \"total billings\" - in other words, to the sum of the service tariff and the taxes and other charges on the bill.\n\n4.16.4.\n\nThe Framework Agreement was then sent to the Legislature for ratification. The parties had agreed that, if the Legislature rejected the Framework Agreement, the Concession Agreement would remain in force as originally negotiated.\n\n4.16.5.\n\nDespite the Province\u2019s participation in this second round of renegotiations, the Concession Agreement, CAA\u2019s billings and its attempt to collect on its invoices remained subject to attack whilst the second renegotiation was in process.\n\n4.16.6.\n\nOn 28 June 1996, Carlos Barrionuevo - the former head of ERSACT and now adviser to the Court of Accounts - issued a report commissioned by the Court of Accounts questioning CAA\u2019s invoicing practices.176\n\nOpinion of Carlos Barrionuevo to Court of Accounts, 28 June 1996 (Exhibit 189).\n\n4.16.7.\n\nFurther to this report, the Court of Accounts reiterated its opposition to ERSACT\u2019s Resolution 333/96 and took the position that CAA should not bill its customers separately for municipal taxes and that ERSACT Resolutions 212/96 and 213/96 should be reinstated.177\n\nCourt of Accounts Resolution No. 470, 2 August 1996 (Exhibit 190).\n\n4.16.8.\n\nOn 15 August 1996, CAA put ERSACT on notice that, while it would comply with any official order not to invoice customers separately for municipal taxes, it would hold the Province responsible for the significant losses that would result.178\n\nLetter from CAA to ERSACT, 15 August 1996 (Exhibit 191).\n\n4.16.9.\n\nOn 22 August 1996, ERACT officially accepted the opinions of Mr. Barrionuevo and the Court of Accounts, and issued a Resolution 484/96 which, once again, resurrected Resolutions No. 212/96 and 213/96.179 Thus, CAA was again prohibited from charging customers for municipal taxes in addition to its service tariff and the 35-day billing holiday was again re-imposed.\n\nERSACT Resolution No. 484/96, 22 August 1996 (Exhibit 192).\n\n4.16.10.\n\nIn mid-October 1996, CAA announced publicly that it would cut-off or reduce water to those who were in arrears in the district of Yerba Buena, a residential area near the capital.\n\n4.16.11.\n\nOn 4 November 1996, the Court of Accounts, which had been sent a copy of the Framework Agreement for its review, issued a highly critical opinion of the agreement, concluding that it would violate laws No. 6445 and No. 6529 (the original privatisation statutes).180\n\nCourt of Accounts Resolution No. 709, 4 November 1996 (Exhibit 193).\n\n4.16.12.\n\nAt about the same time, Legislator Pr\u00f3spero Barrionuevo published a form letter, advising members of the public of their rights, setting out procedures to be followed if they felt that had a grievance against CAA regarding its invoices for the quality of that service. He included a model letter which customers might use to make such claims. He also explained that CAA was not entitled to cut them off from water if they had a valid claim against the company.181 Legislators Barrionuevo, Segu\u00ed and Sangenis also set up a table in the downtown area of San Miguel to advise customers on how to use the legal system to avoid losing service if they chose not to pay their bills.\n\nForm letter from Legislator Pr\u00f3spero Barrionuevo, November 1996 (Exhibit 88).\n\n4.16.13.\n\nOn 22 November 1996, the Ombudsman also volunteered his office to advise customers on how to file claims against CAA.\n\n4.16.14.\n\nOn 2 December 1996, against this backdrop, the Framework Agreement came before the Legislature for debate and ratification. It was rejected on 3 December 1996, with the Legislature declaring that it \"did not conform to the legal framework derived from laws Nos. 6445 and 6529, the Bid Conditions, and the Company\u2019s Economic Proposals\".182 At the same time, the Legislature refused to reaffirm the original Concession Agreement, stating that it \"must be readjusted\". The Legislature also concluded that the separate billing of certain taxes under the Concession Agreement, and the 10% increases provided in the second and third year of the concession were without legal basis.\n\nLegislature of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n Resolution No. 6, 3 December 1996 (Exhibit 196).\n\n4.16.15.\n\nOn 10 December 1996, following the political collapse of the Framework Agreement, the Ombudsman issued Resolution 504 indicating that the Province would provide a legal defence (including the possibility of seeking an injunction) if CAA sought to challenge non-payment or sought to cut off the service of nonpaying customers.183\n\nOmbudsman Resolution No. 504/96, 10 December 1996 (with English translation) (Exhibit 48).\n\n4.16.16.\n\nOn 26 December 1996, after the failure of the second attempted renegotiation, CAA and CGE initiated ICSID arbitration proceedings. The Province and ERSACT were notified on the same day.\n\n**4.17. Third Attempted Renegotiation**\n---------------------------------------\n\n4.17.1.\n\nA third and final attempt to renegotiate the Concession Agreement began in early 1997.\n\n4.17.2.\n\nOn 8 January 1997, Vice Governor Topa informed officials of CAA/CGE that the Province would engage in further renegotiations if the ICSID proceedings were suspended. This was followed by a series of meetings between CAA and CGE officials and officials of the federal and provincial authorities to discuss possible renegotiations. Federal officials significantly increased their involvement in negotiations following the initiation of the ICSID proceedings.\n\n4.17.3.\n\nDespite these meetings, on 17 January 1997, Vice Governor Topa publicly stated that the original Concession Agreement was \"inapplicable\" and \"unenforceable\"184 and on 20 January 1997, the provincial Ombudsman issued a further resolution concluding that CAA had breached Article 12.7.3 of the Concession Agreement and requiring CAA to reimburse its customers for legal fees incurred in the course of legal actions brought against them by CAA for nonpayment of bills.185\n\n\"Es inaplicable el contrato con Aguas del Aconquija,\" 17 January 1997 (Exhibit 210).\n\nERSACT Resolution No. 33/97, 20 January 1997 (Exhibit 209).\n\n4.17.4.\n\nOn 7 February 1997, Governor Bussi delivered a note to CAA and CGE inviting them to renegotiate the Concession Agreement under the auspices of an *\"AdHoc* Negotiating Commission\" consisting of a variety of stakeholders from across the political spectrum in Tucum\u00e1n.186 The invitation was accepted and, on 27 February 1997, CAA and CGE agreed to suspend the pending ICSID proceedings as of the commencement of the negotiations on 3 March 1997.187 CAA submitted a new proposal for renegotiation of the Concession Agreement to the *Ad Hoc* Negotiation Commission on 3 March 1997.\n\nLetter from Governor Bussi to CGE, 7 February 1997 (Exhibit 203).\n\nThe parties extended the suspension several times, ultimately for a period of 110 days: Letter from CAA and CGE to Governor Bussi, 27 February 1997 (Exhibit 207).\n\n4.17.5.\n\nA week later, Vice Governor Topa gave a television interview, during which he discussed the potential imposition of a two to three year moratorium on payment of all outstanding customer invoices - because the invoices exceeded customer\u2019s economic means and were issued \"under great uncertainty\".188\n\nTranscripts of news reports (Exhibit 141).\n\n4.17.6.\n\nDuring a meeting of *A\\q* *Ad Hoc* Negotiating Commission on 15 March 1997, the parties discussed revised terms for the concession which were incorporated into a signed *\"Acta\",189*\n\n*Ad Hoc* Negotiating Commission, Agreement, 15 March 1997 (Exhibit 212).\n\n4.17.7.\n\nOn 18 March 1997, on the same day that Governor Bussi was later to appear on television expressing his approval of the revised Concession Agreement -provincial legislator Pedicone led a public rally against CAA in San Miguel. During the course of the rally legislator Pedicone attacked CAA\u2019s intentions in Tucum\u00e1n, and described CAA and its investors as \"French sons of bitches:\" as regards the proposed revisions to the Concession Agreement he said:\n\n*\"the Province has put things in their place... the French have had to take one step back in their excessive ambitions which aimed at getting the people, and above all the poorest people, to have a really hard time as a result of the subjugation of the previous government resulting from the* *privatization.190*\n\nTranscripts of news reports, 18 March 1997 (Exhibit 141).\n\n4.17.8.\n\nOn 8 April 1997, the parties formally endorsed the *Acta* and the \"8 April Agreement\" was signed by Governor Bussi, the President of Legislature, CAA, a representative of Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s union of sanitary workers, as well as the federal Undersecretary of Water Resources.191\n\nAuthentication of Agreement of April 8, 1997 (Exhibit 213); Acta Acuerdo Sobre Modificaciones al Marco Regulatorio del Contrato de Prestaci\u00f3n de los Servicios de Abastecimiento de Agua Potable y Desag\u00fces Cloacales (April 8, 1997 Agreement and Notarial Protocol, with attached March 15, 1997 Acta, Draft Law, Annexes to Draft Law, \"Reformas Finales\" Document, and Letter from Union) 8 April 1997 (Exhibit 900).\n\n4.17.9.\n\nOn 22 April 1997, Governor Bussi submitted a draft law to the Legislature to implement the 8 April Agreement.192 He explained that the draft law, which contained a few minor agreed modifications to the 8 April Agreement, was based on the 15 March Report and the 8 April Agreement (the draft law included several exhibits, amongst which was a detailed draft of the proposed new Concession Agreement).193\n\nDraft Law, with Annexes, 22 April 1997 (Exhibit 901).\n\nLetter from Governor Bussi to Legislature, 22 April 1997 (Exhibit 218).\n\n4.17.10.\n\nOn 6 June 1997, Governor Bussi withdrew the original legislative bill from the Legislature and submitted in its place a modified legislative bill (\"Second Version of the Revised Concession Agreement\").194\n\nSecond Version of Revised Concession Agreement sent by Governor Bussi to Legislature, 6 June 1997 (Exhibit 219).\n\n4.17.11.\n\nBetween 6 June 1997 and 13 June 1997, the Tucum\u00e1n Legislature made changes to the Second Version of the Revised Concession Agreement, which it approved on 13 June 1997 as part of Law No. 6826.\n\n4.17.12.\n\nUltimately, on 13 June 1997, the Legislature enacted a version of the renegotiated agreement which contained approximately 70 changes to the draft law submitted to it on 22 April 1997. The parties were in substantial disagreement as to whether the changes were minor in nature, made known to CAA in advance or negotiated with CAA in advance. Although the Tribunal has concluded that nothing turns on this disagreement for the purposes of this Award, we summarise briefly below what occurred.\n\n4.17.13.\n\nLaw No. 6826 was first published without its annexes *(ie* without the accompanying draft text of the contract) on 23 June 1997, such annexes being published only 11 July 1997. Because most of the changes that had been made appeared in the contract text, they were not evident when the bill was passed.\n\n4.17.14.\n\nThe fact that the draft law, submitted by Governor Bussi to the Legislature on 22 April, had been substantially modified was discovered by CAA only in late June. At that time, Vice Governor Topa and Mr. de Maud\u2019huy, amongst others, were part of a Tucum\u00e1n delegation visiting the World Bank in Washington. Mr. de Maud\u2019huy was advised by telephone of the fact that approximately 70 changes had been made to the negotiated new agreement. He immediately brought his concerns to the attention of Vice Governor Topa whose reaction was to understate the importance of the changes and to suggest that they could be corrected by regulation.195\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 4, pp. 848-849 (27 July 2006).\n\n4.17.15.\n\nAfter protesting to Governor Bussi, CAA wrote to the Attorney General on 30 June 1997, seeking an official copy of the Annexes to Law No. 6826.196 The Attorney General responded on 4 July 1997, stating that the Annexes would be published on 7 July 1997.197\n\nLetter from CAA to Attorney General, 30 June 1997 Ref.: PB/FR/97014 (Exhibit 903).\n\nLetter from Attorney General to CAA, 4 July 1997 (Exhibit 904).\n\n4.17.16.\n\nGovernor Bussi initially ignored CAA\u2019s protests and on 17 July 1997 asked it to sign the modified agreement, but CAA refused. In its response of 23 July 1997, CAA stated that the text of the modified agreement, as found in Law No. 6826, was unacceptable because of its significant adverse effect on the economic value of the renegotiated agreement.198\n\nLetter from CAA to Governor Bussi, 23 July 1997 (Exhibit 225).\n\n4.17.17.\n\nBased on unequivocal testimony from CAA, that the changes made to the proposed new concession agreement between the 22 April 1997 version and that found in Law 6826 were not agreed in advance, and based on the equivocal testimony on this point from Respondent,199 the Tribunal concludes that the changes were made unilaterally by the Legislature. The Tribunal also accepts that the unilateral changes modified, in some cases materially, the terms of the renegotiated agreement.\n\nTestimony of Topa, Transcript of the hearing on the merits, Day 7, pp. 1621-1631 (30 July 2006).\n\n4.17.18.\n\nOn 25 July 1997, CAA met with Governor Bussi and a representative of the Federal Ministry of the Economy and reiterated that the modified agreement was not acceptable. Governor Bussi replied that it was not possible to change the law.200\n\nGarc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez Affidavit, 22 November 2004 (Exhibit 5), at \u00b6 39.\n\n**4.18. CAA\u2019s Rescission of the Concession Agreement**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.18.1.\n\nBy mid-July 1996, CAA officials had begun to deliberate on the deteriorating situation in Tucum\u00e1n and authorised Mr. de Maud\u2019huy to take all necessary steps to resolve the situation. Thus, on 27 July 1997, Mr. de Maud\u2019huy advised Federal Secretary Guibert that CAA planned to terminate the Concession Agreement imminently.\n\n4.18.2.\n\nIn the hope of somehow resolving the crisis, federal officials requested CAA to postpone the termination.\n\n4.18.3.\n\nAfter a series of day-to-day postponements, on 4 August 1997, CAA decided to terminate and informed both the French Embassy in Argentina and the Argentine Embassy in Paris of its decision.\n\n4.18.4.\n\nFollowing further interventions from high ranking officials in the French and Argentine Governments, the decision to terminate was again postponed to allow Mr. Jorge Rottenberg, Chief of Staff to President Menem\u2019s Chief of Cabinet, to seek to save the concession.\n\n4.18.5.\n\nFollowing a number of fruitless meetings, the Rottenberg mission failed and, on 18 August 1997, CAA concluded that there was no hope of solution to the crisis. However, because of an official visit to Argentina by a member of the French Government, CAA delayed sending notice of its termination until 27 August 1997, when it notified Governor Bussi that it had rescinded the Concession Agreement due to its breach by the Province.\n\n4.18.6.\n\nOn the same day, the Provincial Legislature passed Law No. 6837, which revoked Law No. 6826 and reinstated the terms of the original Concession Agreement.\n\n**CAA\u2019s Recovery Rate on Bi-Monthly Billings - 22 July 1995 to 27 August 1997**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.18.7.\n\nOver the period from the date CAA took over the concession (22 July 1995) until the date it rescinded the Concession Agreement, CAA\u2019s recovery rates on its billings dropped steadily. From a high of 64.50% for the first bi-monthly period, the rates dropped consecutively to 57.60%, 52.60%, 46.60%, 48.60%, 44.50%, 41%, 39.20%, 36.50%, 33.90%, 34.30%, 24.70% and 2O.1O%.201\n\nde Rochambeau Affidavit, 5 November 2004, (Exhibit 1), at \u00b677-78.\n\n**4.19. Tucum\u00e1n Rejects CAA\u2019s Rescission and Terminates Agreement**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.19.1.\n\nThe Province\u2019s initial reaction to CAA\u2019s notice of rescission was a series of regulatory responses, the first occurring on 3 September 1997 in the form of ERSACT Resolution 558/97. This resolution, which was dated three weeks earlier, on 13 August 1997, alleged that CAA had not complied with the investment plan under the Concession Agreement.\n\n4.19.2.\n\nThe next day, ERSACT notified CAA of Resolution No. 616/97, which alleged non-compliance with Concession Agreement obligations regarding creation of prevention and emergency plans.202\n\nERSACT Resolution No. 616/97, 2 September 1997 (Exhibit 31).\n\n4.19.3.\n\nBetween 2 and 4 September 1997, CAA received notification from ERSACT of 19 resolutions (some of which dated back months), according to which CAA had allegedly not complied with the Concession Agreement.203 Simultaneously, ERSACT began to prosecute all pending resolutions - some dating to 1995.\n\nERSACT Resolution No. 495/97, 22 July 1997 (Exhibit 17); ERSACT Resolution No. 514/97, 29 July 1997 (Exhibit 18); ERSACT Resolution No. 515/97, 29 July 1997 (Exhibit 19); ERSACT Resolution No. 558/97, 13 August 1997 (Exhibit 20); ERSACT Resolution No. 595/97, 4 September 1997 (Exhibit 21); ERSACT Resolution No. 607/97, 1 September 1997 (Exhibit 22); ERSACT Resolution No. 608/97, 1 September 1997 (Exhibit 23); ERSACT Resolution No. 609/97, 1 September 1997 (Exhibit 24); ERSACT Resolution No. 610/97, 1 September 1997 (Exhibit 25); ERSACT Resolution No. 611/97, 1 September 1997 (Exhibit 26); ERSACT Resolution No. 612/97, 1 September 1997 (Exhibit 27); ERSACT Resolution No. 613/97, 1 September 1997 (Exhibit 28); ERSACT Resolution No. 614/97, 1 September 1997 (Exhibit 29); ERSACT Resolution No. 616/97, 2 September 1997 (Exhibit 31); ERSACT Resolution No. 617/97, 2 September 1997 (Exhibit 32); ERSACT Resolution No. 620/97, 2 September 1997 (Exhibit 33); ERSACT Resolution No. 138/97, 10 March 1997 (Exhibit 51); and ERSACT Resolution No. 576/97, 20 August 1997 (Exhibit 232).\n\n4.19.4.\n\nOn 10 September 1997, Governor Bussi issued Decree No. 2270/1, informing CAA that the Concession Agreement was terminated by reason of CAA\u2019s repeated violations of the agreement and its unacceptable and unlawful attempt to terminate the agreement by itself.\n\n4.19.5.\n\nDecree No. 2270/1 also formally rejected CAA\u2019s rescission and purported to extend the duration of CAA\u2019s service for an additional 18 months or until the Province could find a replacement, based upon Article 15.11 of the Concession Agreement.204\n\nDecree No. 2270/1, 10 September 1997 (Exhibit 172).\n\n4.19.6.\n\nOn 25 and 30 September 1997, CAA challenged Decree No. 2270/1.205 Almost a year later, on 11 August 1998, Governor Bussi responded to CAA\u2019s objections, rejecting Decree No. 2270/1.206\n\nLetter from CAA to Governor Bussi, Answer to Decree 2270/1, 25 September 1997 (Exhibit 234); Letter from CAA to Governor Bussi, Supplemental Answer to Decree 2270/1, 30 September 1997 (Exhibit 235).\n\nDecree No. 1332/1, 11 August 1998 (Exhibit 236).\n\n**4.20. CAA\u2019s Operation of the Services After Termination - the alleged \"HostagePeriod\"**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.20.1.\n\nOn 21 October 1997, the Executive filed an action in the Province\u2019s contentious administrative courts, seeking a declaratory judgement to the effect that the Province had the legal authority to compel CAA to continue to provide services for 18 months. The Executive also unsuccessfully sought an injunction while the lawsuit was pending.\n\n4.20.2.\n\nThe 90-day notice period given by Claimants for termination of the Concession Agreement passed without transfer of the services on 27 November 1997.\n\n4.20.3.\n\nBy letter from CAA to Governor Bussi, dated 2 December 1997, CAA explained that, as of 27 November 1997, CAA\u2019s legal responsibility as concessionaire had ended and the economic risk of the concession had thus been transferred to the Province. CAA added that the Province was liable for all damages due to the Province\u2019s default.207\n\nLetter from CAA to Governor Bussi, 2 December 1997 (Exhibit 229).\n\n4.20.4.\n\nAt the same time, CAA sought direction as to the tariff rate to be applied with respect to the continued provision of services. On 2 January 1998, Governor Bussi informed CAA it should apply a tariff rate consistent with the original 1995 Concession Agreement and Law No. 6529, but Governor Bussi made reference to the legitimate expectation of the both the Government and the population that CAA would significantly reduce its tariffs below the rates set forth in the 1995 Concession Agreement because, after rescission, CAA was not longer subject to investment obligations.208\n\nLetter from Governor Bussi to CAA, 2 January 1998 (Exhibit 238).\n\n4.20.5.\n\nOn 28 January 1998, Governor Bussi approved bid terms for a tender for a new concessionaire. However, the government announced the failure of the tender for a transitional service provider on 5 June 1998.209\n\nDecree No. 1058/3 (MP), 5 June 1998 (Exhibit 249)\n\n4.20.6.\n\nOn 6 July 1998, Vivendi President Messier wrote to President Menem expressing his concern that CAA was being forced to provide a service notwithstanding the rescission of the Concession Agreement and on 10 July 1998, the federal government offered to serve as Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s transitory water and sewage service provider through ENHOSA.210\n\nLetter from Vivendi to Argentine President Menem, 6 July 1998 (Exhibit 250).\n\n4.20.7.\n\nOn 5 August 1998, the federal government and the Province signed an agreement whereby ENOHSA would supply the service under a power granted by the Province. This agreement was approved by the Legislature on 7 September 1998 and provided that ENHOSA would take over the service within 30 days.211\n\nLaw No. 6894, 7 September 1998 (Exhibit 252).\n\n4.20.8.\n\nFinally, on 7 October 1998, the service was taken over by ENOHSA, which provided the service through an Argentine public entity designated as Obras Sanitarias de Tucum\u00e1n (\"OST\"). CAA\u2019s role as operator of Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s water and sewage services effectively terminated on that date.\n\n**4.21. CAA\u2019s Post-Termination Collection Efforts**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n4.21.1.\n\nFrom 8 October 1998, after termination of the service, CAA retained a small staff, as well as local counsel in Tucum\u00e1n, to continue the company\u2019s efforts to collect payment for the services that it had provided to customers.\n\n4.21.2.\n\nIn 2000, CAA decided to undertake a fresh effort at collections by preparing formal legal notices containing a detailed breakdown of each customer\u2019s overdue payments. Between July and October 2000, CAA dispatched 146,559 notices to its delinquent customers via registered mail. Initially this effort met with some success and, immediately after the mailing of the first of these notices, customers began remitting payments at a rate of approximately 3,000 pesos per day.\n\n4.21.3.\n\nHowever, CAA\u2019s collections slowed significantly when the Ombudsman and a number of Legislators advised customers, whom they met as they came to CAA\u2019s offices, that it was not necessary to pay their bills. In this period, CAA received over 17,000 form letters that had been distributed by the Ombudsman, over 5,000 distributed by Legislators Pr\u00f3spero Barrionuevo and Guido Luis Garcia and over 1,700 distributed by DUDAS, a consumer defence association.\n\n4.21.4.\n\nWhen it became clear that its renewed collection efforts would not work, CAA decided to initiate summary proceedings (executory judicial proceedings known as *juicios ejecutivos')* against 2000 of its most significant debtors. Having over 150,000 delinquent accounts at this time, CAA hoped that if judgements could be obtained in short order against a significant number of its customers, its other debtors would elect to pay, rather than face suit.212\n\nHahn Affidavit, 5 November 2004 (Exhibit 3), at \"26-30.\n\n4.21.5.\n\nAt this stage, the Ombudsman and the Legislature intervened. On 20 November 2001, the Ombudsman brought a summary proceeding seeking the suspension of proceedings in all of CAA\u2019s collection lawsuits filed against non-paying customers, as well as a bar against CAA filing any new collection suits.213\n\n*Defensor del Pueblo de Tucum\u00e1n vs. Compa\u00f1\u00eda Aguas del Aconquija S.A. s/Amparos Colectivos,* Demanda\u2014 Inicio Acci\u00f3n de Amparo Colectivo, 20 November 2001 (Exhibit 263).\n\n4.21.6.\n\nOn 20 December 2001, after these proceedings were rejected, primarily on procedural grounds, the Legislature enacted Law No. 7196, prohibiting CAA from pursuing any collection lawsuits for a period of 180 days.214 This law was subsequently held unconstitutional by a civil court in Tucum\u00e1n on 20 August 2002.215\n\nLaw No. 7196, 14 February 2002 (Exhibit 265).\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. v. Omodeo, Pedro C\u00e9sar s/ Cobra Ejecutivo,* Sentencia, 20 August 2002 (Exhibit 267). The Ombudsman acted again three years later, by asking the court to declare that CAA cannot collect through executory judicial proceedings seeking interim measures to prevent CAA from initiating any new actions of this type. CAA filed a defence on October 2004.\n\n4.21.7.\n\nUndeterred, on 5 September 2002, the Legislature took a different approach and enacted Law No. 7234, this time barring CAA from *enforcing,* for a period of 180 days, judgments already rendered or to be rendered in proceedings against debtors. The temporary nature of this enactment was illusory, since the Legislature re-enacted a new version of the same law every 180 days, with the fourth version being in effect at the time Claimants\u2019 case was pleaded.216\n\nLaw No. 7234, 5 September 2002 (Exhibit 268); Law No. 7274, 2 May 2003 (Exhibit 269); Law No. 7322, 20 November 2003 (Exhibit 270); and, Law No. 7402, 15 July 2004 (Exhibit 271).\n\n4.21.8.\n\nIn a statement made during the Legislative debate over Law No. 7322, Legislator Ter\u00e1n Nogues (the former Vice Governor, Mr. Topa\u2019s successor, who had left the Executive one month earlier) explained the need for the enactment of this third version of the law:\n\n*\"In order to place it on the historical record, I want to specifically state the citizens of Tucum\u00e1n are the victims of a situation of defencelessness into which they were placed by two state powers: the Executive Power first and, thereafter, the Judicial Power. The only exception is the protection granted by the Honourable Legislature in successive sessions, in defence of their rights.*\n\n*The Executive Power told the citizens of Tucum\u00e1n, at a given time not to pay their water bills; it said it in all the tones and in all the forms; additionally it told the citizens the invoicing system did not correspond to the terms of the contract* *.*  *And for that reason, the people did not pay for the water,* *in addition to the lack of a culture ofpayment of* *Utilities, etc.,*  *but there was an explicit appeal made by the Executive Power about not paying for the water...* *. But in the certain fact is that, in spite of my natural demeanour which leads me not to sanction regulations obstructing judicial processes between private citizens, the*  *certain fact is that currently the citizens were urged not to pay by the Executive Power.* \"217 (emphasis added)\n\nLegislature of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, Legislative Debate, 20 November 2003 (Exhibit 69).\n\n**4.22.

The AFIP claim asserts that CAA should have paid a minimum presumed income tax in 1998 through 2002 on its customer\u2019s unpaid invoices as well as on assets CAA transferred to the Province at the end of the alleged \"hostage period\".\n\n4.22.2.\n\nCAA replied to and contested AFIP\u2019s tax assessment on 21 September 2004.218\n\nAdministraci\u00f3n Federal de Ingresos P\u00fablicos, Tax Assessment against CAA for fiscal years 1998-2002, 30 July 2004 (Exhibit 276); *Fisco Nacional (AFIP-DGI) v.

CLAIMANTS\u2019 CASE**\n----------------------\n\n**5.1. Tribunal\u2019s Approach**\n----------------------------\n\n5.1.1.\n\nIn this section we summarise the elements and scope of the claims made by Claimants, as advanced in their pleadings, written submissions and during the course of the oral hearing.\n\n5.1.2.\n\nClaimants advance two principal arguments. First, the acts and omissions of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n cannot be reconciled with Argentina's obligation under the Treaty to provide fair and equitable treatment to French investors and their investments. Second, the Province\u2019s actions constitute an expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment, for which Claimants have never been compensated.\n\n**CAA is a Proper Claimant**\n----------------------------\n\n5.1.3.\n\nClaimants also say that Respondent\u2019s argument, that CAA is not a proper claimant, must be rejected because that issue was decided in the first proceeding and is now *res judicata.* Claimants point to the Decision on Jurisdiction in which this Tribunal held \"[b]ecause the First Tribunal found that CAA was a French company under the ICSID Convention and the BIT and the *ad hoc* Committee did not annul this finding, the finding remains in force and is *res judicata\"*,220 In any event, Claimants submit that Respondent\u2019s argument rests on two erroneous premises. First, CAA did not become a French company until CGE acquired more than 50% of CAA\u2019s shares, and second, CGE acquired its majority shareholding in violation of the Concession Agreement because the Province did not consent to the share transfer.221\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b697; Reply at \u00b6221.\n\nReply at pp. 112-119.\n\n5.1.4.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s first assertion, Claimants point to the fact that CAA has been deemed a \"French\" national since its incorporation. Claimants rely on the Article 1 (2)(c) of the BIT, which provision contains France\u2019s and Argentina\u2019s agreement that certain companies having the nationality of one party are treated as a national of another party if they are effectively controlled, directly or indirectly, by nationals of that other party. Accordingly, an Argentine company will qualify as a French national where more than half its equity is owned by a French company, or, where a French company exerts \"decisive influence\".222\n\nReply at \u00b6\u00b6223-225.\n\n5.1.5.\n\nBased on factual findings by the First Tribunal, Claimants claim that CGE clearly exerted \"decisive influence\" over CAA\u2019s decision-making processes at all times since CAA\u2019s incorporation. Accordingly, CAA is a proper claimant that acquired its Treaty rights on the day it was formed.\n\n5.1.6.\n\nWith respect to Respondent's complaints about the process by which CGE/Vivendi acquired its current 85% stake in CAA, Claimants argue that all share acquisitions were either approved by the Province or did not require its approval.223\n\nReply at \u00b6\u00b6228-235.\n\n5.1.7.\n\nClaimants also rely on the conclusion of the Original Tribunal, which finding was not annulled and is *res judicata,* that \"the Tribunal has determined that CGE controlled CAA and that CAA should be considered a French investor from the effective date of the Concession Contract\".224\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b69, Note 6; Reply at \u00b6236.\n\n**5.2. Claimants were Denied Fair and Equitable Treatment by the Tucum\u00e1nAuthorities**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.2.1.\n\nClaimants contend that the object and purpose of the Treaty is to guarantee the reciprocal protection and promotion of investments. Based in part on the objectives, as stated in the preamble and, in part, on the holdings of the *MTD v Chile Tribunal,* Claimants say that the signatory states\u2019 obligations under the Treaty are to be read as proactive, rather than as prescriptions for passive behaviour, such as the avoidance of impermissible behaviour or conduct toward the investor.225\n\nMemorial at \u00b6291.\n\n5.2.2.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent\u2019s contention that the fair and equitable treatment obligation is synonymous with the international minimum standard of treatment.226 They claim that Respondent\u2019s restrictive interpretation is not supported by the text of Article 3 of the Treaty, and is based on an inapposite reliance on the fair and equitable treatment provision of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\").227 Claimants argue that Respondent\u2019s reliance on the minimum standard of treatment lacks support outside the NAFTA context.228\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6550.\n\nNorth American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\") at Art. 1105.\n\nReply at \u00b6\u00b6289-293.\n\n5.2.3.\n\nClaimants assert that the fair and equitable treatment standard has evolved from the minimum standard of treatment long required under international law and that the relevant authorities have found content in the fair and equitable treatment obligation that includes (i) refraining from arbitrary or discriminatory conduct; (ii) providing transparency and due process; (iii) acting in good faith; and (iv) providing security for reasonable, investment-backed expectations.229 Claimants\u2019 position on each of these four propositions is summarised below.\n\nMemorial at \u00b6288; Reply at \u00b6295.\n\n**Tucum\u00e1n Authorities\u2019 Attacks on Claimants and Their Investment were Arbitrary and Discriminatory**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.2.4.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Tucum\u00e1n authorities - from the Legislature, to the Governor, to the Province\u2019s regulatory authorities - relentlessly \"attacked\" CAA and the Concession Agreement almost from its inception, with a view to pressuring CAA and its investors to renegotiate the terms (in particular, the tariff) of the concession.230 As a result of this regulatory harassment, as well as direct unilateral modifications of the Concession Agreement\u2019s terms, and the Province vitiated the principal asset of a concessionaire - the stream of expected payments from customers - by encouraging customers not to pay their bills and devising means by which customers could withhold payment without fear of adverse consequences.\n\nMemorial at pp. 135-141.\n\n5.2.5.\n\nThe Province\u2019s \"relentless attacks\" on Claimants, taken singly or collectively, are said to be inconsistent with Argentina's Treaty obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment to investors and their investments and are the direct opposite of Argentina\u2019s affirmative duty to protect and promote investments.\n\n5.2.6.\n\nClaimants say that the Provincial authorities acted arbitrarily when:\n\n(i) Through a misuse of its regulatory power, the Province adopted an excessively and systematically adversarial posture toward CAA - perhaps the best example being ERSACT\u2019s simultaneous issuance of dozens of resolutions and fines, not for regulatory purposes but rather in a deliberate effort to \"pressure\" CAA to agree to lower tariffs.\n\n(ii) governmental actors inflamed popular sentiments, incited and led protests against CAA, and actively encouraged and facilitated non-payment of CAA invoices.\n\n(iii) ERSACT and the Legislature deprived CAA of all of its legal recourses against delinquent customers, first by preventing CAA from cutting service to non-paying customers, then by attempting to prevent CAA from using expeditious judicial processes, and ultimately by directly blocking CAA\u2019s access to the judicial system to enforce its right to payment.231\n\nMemorial at \u00b6294.\n\n5.2.7.\n\nClaimants also point to the Province\u2019s treatment of CAA\u2019s successor, OST, which was demonstrably more favourable than its treatment of CAA - even in the face of service problems and OST's express admission that it was unable to maintain or properly provide the service.232 In contrast to the treatment of CAA, the Province publicly supported OST, subsidized it, exempted it from significant tax and investment obligations, protected its ability to collect from customers and even its ability to restrict service to defaulting customers.233 The Province also downplayed important service problems. Claimants\u2019 argue unjustified discriminatory treatment is by definition unfair and inequitable.234\n\nMemorial at \u00b6298.\n\nMemorial at \u00b6\u00b6297-298.\n\nMemorial at \u00b6298.\n\n5.2.8.\n\nClaimants also argue that the actions of the office of the federal tax authorities, in seizing CAA\u2019s bank accounts and threatening to impose tax liabilities premised on the CAA\u2019s unpaid invoices - whose value the Province has destroyed, have further violated the fair and equitable treatment obligation.235\n\nMemorial at \u00b6297.\n\n5.2.9.\n\nIn so acting, Claimants say that the Province and, through it, Argentina exhibited arbitrary and capricious hostility toward Claimants and the Concession Agreement under which Claimants invested, thereby violating Respondent's obligation of fair and equitable treatment under Article 3 of the Treaty.236\n\nMemorial at \u00b6295.\n\n**Lack of Transparency and Due Process in the Treatment of Claimants**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.2.10.\n\nClaimants define transparency as requiring the legal framework for an investor\u2019s operations to be readily apparent and that any decision affecting the investor to be traceable to that legal framework. Due process or \"fair procedure\" is said to be an essential complement to transparency and includes, *inter alia,* proper notice of legal action and the opportunity to appear and be heard. Due process may be violated not only by the courts, but also through legislative and administrative actions.237\n\nMemorial at \u00b6300.\n\n5.2.11.\n\nClaimants contend that the Province violated the principles of transparency by failing to provide Claimants with due process on multiple occasions, and that, individually and collectively, these violations constitute a breach of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment under Article 3 of the BIT.238\n\nMemorial at \u00b6301.\n\n5.2.12.\n\nTo illustrate, Claimants provide six examples of the Province\u2019s deficient treatment of CAA:\n\n(i) ERSACT unilaterally overrode the terms of the Concession Agreement by arbitrarily and without legal foundation issuing Resolution 212/96 (which implemented Resolution 170/96). Further, Resolution 212/96 was repeatedly imposed, suspended and then re-imposed again and again, in a manner that Claimants\u2019 allege tracked the Province\u2019s need for leverage in different phases of its renegotiations with CAA.\n\n(ii) the Province created an environment of legal uncertainty, in violation of its obligations to provide a transparent and predictable legal environment.\n\n(iii) ERSACT issued 78 resolutions and fines on a single day, not for legitimate regulatory purposes, but, in an admitted attempt to pressure Claimants to renegotiate the terms of the Concession Agreement. That action was also in direct violation of the express terms of the Concession Agreement, which restricted ERSACT\u2019s ability to sanction CAA for a six-month period.\n\n(iv) the Tucum\u00e1n authorities' actions in the face of concededly harmless manganese-related turbidity - a situation that CAA did not create, could not foresee, and acted professionally and promptly to correct - were illegitimate and unfair to CAA.\n\n(v) ERSACT\u2019s and the Governor's actions after CAA\u2019s notification that it was terminating the Concession Agreement, based on the Province\u2019s defaults, further confirm the lack of transparency and due process in Tucum\u00e1n's treatment of CAA. Following CAA\u2019s notice, ERSACT proceeded to issue a number of Resolutions, which were not received by CAA on a timely basis, violating the transparency and due process obligations of proper notice. The Governor later relied on ERSACT\u2019s Resolutions in Decree 2270/1 as a basis for (purportedly) terminating the Concession Agreement for fault of CAA.\n\n(vi) the Governor and the Legislature - unilaterally and secretly - introduced some seventy changes into the text of the 8 April Agreement regarding amendments to the Concession Agreement, and presented it to Claimants as a \"fait accompli\".239\n\nMemorial at \u00b6\u00b6301-307.\n\n**Province\u2019s Bad Faith During Contract Renegotiations**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.2.13.\n\nClaimants say that it is not necessary to prove bad faith to establish a violation of a fair and equitable treatment standard. Nevertheless, Claimants note actual bad faith dealings with an investor by a government is necessarily inconsistent with Article 3 of the Treaty.240\n\nMemorial at \u00b6308.\n\n5.2.14.\n\nRelying on, *inter alia,* the principle of good faith articulated in *Aminoil241* Claimants say that, having been invited by the Province and the National Government to engage in a third round of renegotiations in early 1997, they were entitled to expect that the Province would act in good faith in those negotiations. However, they say that the submission of the unilaterally amended version of the agreement to the Legislature, and further unilateral amendments made by the Legislature, violated not only transparency, stability and the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations, but also the elemental requirement of good faith dealings. In particular, the manner in which the amendments were made - unilaterally and without any attempt at notification or consultation with Claimants - is impossible to reconcile with any notion of good faith.242\n\n*Government of the State of Kuwait v. American Independent Oil Co.,* 21ILM 976 (1978) *(\u2018Aminoil\").*\n\nMemorial at \u00b6\u00b6313-314.\n\n**Tucum\u00e1n's Actions Deprived Claimants of Their Legitimate Expectations With Respect to the Concession**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.2.15.\n\nClaimants further assert that the fair and equitable treatment standard imposes an affirmative obligation on government to treat investors in good faith in a reasonable and measured manner that respects the contractual provisions that embody the expectation of the parties and to promote the realisation of their expectations - including a fair profit for the investor.\n\n5.2.16.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 submission, the Province not only failed to protect, but itself directly undermined, Claimants\u2019 legitimate, investment-backed, expectations with respect to the Tucum\u00e1n concession when the Province:\n\n(i) directly and unilaterally modified the terms of the Concession Agreement. This occurred when ERSACT issued Resolution 212/96 which reversed the Province\u2019s own pre-contract specifications and contradicted the terms of the Concession Agreement, by requiring CAA to include certain taxes within its tariff caps; when CAA was prevented from cutting service to non-paying customers; and when the Legislature put into force reduced tariffs and other economically harmful contractual terms under Law 6826;\n\n(ii) incited the population of Tucum\u00e1n to refuse to pay CAA\u2019s bills and shielded customers from the legal consequences of such refusals; and\n\n(iii) forced CAA to continue providing services in Tucum\u00e1n for over ten months in violation of the termination provisions of the Concession Agreement.243\n\nMemorial at \u00b6\u00b6318-319.\n\n**Tucum\u00e1n Authorities Deprived Claimants of Fair and Equitable Treatment in the Form of Protection and Full Security**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.2.17.\n\nClaimants contend that the text of the provisions of Article 5(1) of the Treaty intimately links the protections there granted with Article 3, such that protection and full security is an application of the principle of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n5.2.18.\n\nClaimants argue that the protection and full security required extends beyond physical security, to encompass security against harassment that impairs the normal functioning of an investors business. They say that the Tucum\u00e1n authorities not only failed to guarantee Claimants protection and full security, but went further and themselves participated in and encouraged acts that affirmatively undermined any such security. They engaged in illegitimate regulatory harassment of CAA, and they deliberately incited the population to inflict harm on Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n**5.3. Tucum\u00e1n Authorities Expropriated Claimants\u2019 Investment**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.3.1.\n\nClaimants rely on six principal arguments in support of their case that the Province expropriated their investment without compensation in breach of Treaty Article 5(2):\n\n(i) the Treaty\u2019s guarantee against uncompensated expropriation is broad;\n\n(ii) Article 5 bars the expropriation of concession and contract rights;\n\n(iii) the Tucum\u00e1n authorities\u2019 deprivation of Claimants\u2019 reasonably expected economic benefit constitutes expropriation;\n\n(iv) whether taken singly or cumulatively, the Province\u2019s acts and omissions constitute expropriation;\n\n(v) the forced provision of services during the alleged \"hostage period\" constitutes expropriation; and\n\n(vi) the effects of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities\u2019 actions are determinative.244\n\nMemorial at pp. 154-185.\n\n**Treaty's Guarantee against Uncompensated Expropriation is Broad**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.3.2.\n\nClaimants say that the concept of \"expropriation\" has been broadly defined in ICSID jurisprudence to include any unjustified interference with an investor's property that deprives the investor of the use or value of that property. For example, a state is responsible for an unlawful expropriation when it subjects alien property to regulatory or other action that is confiscatory, or that prevents, unreasonably interferes with, or unduly delays, effective enjoyment of that property. Further, Treaty Article 5(2) has been drafted with particular care to be inclusive, as it refers not only to indirect measures of expropriation, but also to equivalent measures that have a similar effect to dispossession.\n\n**Article 5 Bars the Tucum\u00e1n Authorities from Expropriating Concession and Contract Rights**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.3.3.\n\nClaimants point out that Article 1 of the Treaty specifically defines the term \"investment\" to include \"concessions granted by law or by virtue of an agreement\". The Treaty\u2019s provisions are thus consistent with the well-established principle of international law that the taking of contract rights constitutes an expropriation or a measure having an equivalent effect. Accordingly, the Province\u2019s taking or denial of valuable contract rights under the concession, and the destruction of the economic value of the concession itself, constitute expropriation affecting Claimants\u2019 \"investment\" as defined under Article 1, for which compensation is required under Article 5(2) of the Treaty.\n\n5.3.4.\n\nIn cases such as this one, involving an investor\u2019s rights under a contract with the government itself, international law distinguishes between a mere commercial breach and an expropriation of a contractual right. Claimants say that expropriation occurs when the government does not act in its role as a commercial party to the contract, but instead exercises its sovereign powers to defeat the expectations of the parties by undercutting or destroying the value of the contract.\n\n5.3.5.\n\nHere, the Province\u2019s actions cannot under any circumstances be characterised as mere commercial breaches of contract terms, and are precisely the type of sovereign actions that constitute expropriation by a government authority. Three non-exhaustive examples of the Province\u2019s unilateral alterations of contract rights are said to be particularly significant in terms of their effects on the economic balance of the concession.\n\n(i) First, the Provincial Government used its regulatory authority to compel CAA to stop invoicing customers for certain taxes, contrary to the Province\u2019s own prior instructions and to the express terms of the Concession Agreement. Specifically, Claimants argue that ERSACT Resolution 170/96, Court of Accounts Resolution No. 015, and ERSACT Resolution 212/96 forced CAA to reduce its tariffs by almost 10%, with severe adverse consequences for the economic balance of the concession.\n\n(ii) Second, the Province used its authority over CAA effectively to deny CAA the 10% tariff increases to which it was entitled in each of the second and third years of the concession. In the hostile atmosphere that government officials in Tucum\u00e1n had created, CAA had no choice but to agree to try to renegotiate the Agreement, not once, not twice, but three times during the two-and-a-half year effective life of the concession.\n\n(iii) Third, the Legislature unilaterally changed the legal framework that governed CAA in June 1997, drastically altering the economic balance of the concession. Law 6826 purported to approve a new contract to govern the concession, but the version enacted contained approximately 70 economically significant changes to the terms agreed upon by Claimants and the Governor in the 8 April Agreement. Nevertheless, Law 6826 was legally effective in its own right and remained in force from 1 May 1997 (the third bi-monthly invoicing period for 1997) until its repeal on August 27, 1997.\n\n5.3.6.\n\nClaimants further contend that as a party to the Concession Agreement, the Province had an obligation not actively to undermine the Agreement\u2019s viability. The provincial regulator was also expressly obliged to \"cooperate with the Concessionaire in a manner such as to facilitate the fulfillment of the Concession Agreement, exercising the powers to police, regulate, and control in a reasonable manner...\".\n\n5.3.7.\n\nClaimants assert that the Tucum\u00e1n authorities breached those obligations with vigorous and sustained attacks on CAA that substantially destroyed the value of the concession by driving down the company's collection rates.\n\n5.3.8.\n\nThese actions of the Province destroyed the value of Claimants\u2019 investment in the Tucum\u00e1n concession and the prospect of continued such losses forced the termination of the Concession Agreement, completing the Province\u2019s expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n**The Tucum\u00e1n Authorities' Deprivation of Claimants\u2019 Reasonably Expected Economic Benefits Constitutes Expropriation**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.3.9.\n\nAccording to Claimants, it is well-established in international arbitration decisions that expropriation may arise, not only from the deprivation of valuable contractual rights through sovereign acts, as discussed above, but also from government interference with an investor's ability to obtain reasonably expected economic benefits from their investment.\n\n5.3.10.\n\nIn this case, based on the Province\u2019s own undertakings in the Concession Agreement, Claimants legitimately expected that their investment would operate and be governed consistent with those terms. The Province\u2019s actions thus worked an expropriation, not only as a direct deprivation of valuable rights, but also as an interference with Claimants\u2019 reasonably expected economic benefits of their investment in the concession. The Tucum\u00e1n authorities also crippled the asset that is at the heart of a concession investment - the revenue stream of payments from users of the service. Claimants legitimately expected that they would be paid for the services they rendered, but the Tucum\u00e1n authorities actively and relentlessly undermined that expectation.\n\n5.3.11.\n\nIn support of this proposition, Claimants point out that the government attacks against the concession began in July and August 1995, when the municipalities demanded that they be given control over the water and sewerage services. These actions were followed quickly by public statements from the Governor, legislators, and the Attorney General condemning the concession. By the end of 1995, the Legislature had introduced a series of bills and other proposals demanding the nullification or renegotiation of the Concession Agreement. The Legislature also appointed an Investigative Commission to review the privatisation and analyse the options for renegotiating the tariff. The intent of these actions was made clear by Franco Davolio, the Deputy Engineering Supervisor of ERSACT, who, when asked why ERSACT was harassing CAA in violation of the language and spirit of the Agreement, stated that \"my superiors are asking to put pressure on [CAA] to renegotiate the rates... So until the rates are renegotiated like the government wants, the order from higher up is to keep applying pressure with whatever we have at hand.\"\n\n5.3.12.\n\nClaimants assert that the attacks continued in 1996, when the Attorney General issued an opinion impugning the validity of the Concession Agreement. ERSACT then adopted Resolution 170/96, which prohibited CAA from issuing invoices, and Resolution 212/96, which affirmed Resolution 170/96 and forced CAA to reduce its tariffs below the levels permitted under the Concession Agreement. Resolution 212/96 was alternately suspended and reactivated on several occasions, contributing further to the confusion over the applicable tariff rates which had been precipitated by the government\u2019s arbitrary actions.\n\n5.3.13.\n\nLegislators handed out 3,000 applications in the public square to encourage people to submit claims against CAA and to block CAA\u2019s collection efforts. Similarly, the Ombudsman established a claims procedure that would allow users to refuse to pay for CAA\u2019s services. It also issued a formal resolution which effectively prevented CAA from cutting the service to customers who refused to pay their bills and to provide a legal defence to customers if CAA challenged their refusal to pay.\n\n5.3.14.\n\nClaimants contend that in 1996 and 1997, the Province and the Argentine government left Claimants no choice but to engage in multiple rounds of attempted renegotiations. However, the provincial authorities continued to backtrack and undercut the proceedings, demanding the nullification or renegotiation of the Concession Agreement. And though the parties were twice able to reach preliminary agreements on a renegotiated Concession Agreement in 1996, the provincial government quickly backed away from those settlements. The final blow to the concession came when the Governor unilaterally and secretively rewrote the 8 April Agreement and then submitted it to the Legislature for approval.\n\n5.3.15.\n\nAgainst this relentless assault, CAA\u2019s recovery rate declined steadily throughout the life of the concession, even after the tariffs had been lowered. By the time CAA notified the authorities that the Concession Agreement was rescinded, CAA\u2019s recovery rate hovered around 20 percent, in stark contrast to the rate of 89-90% upon which the Concession Agreement was premised. This interference with Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations constituted a clear deprivation of their property. And when government officials incite the population to take action against a specific foreign party, as happened here, the government under international law is responsible for the actions taken by the population.\n\n**Province\u2019s Acts and Omissions Constitute Expropriation Whether Taken Singly or Cumulatively**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.3.16.\n\nClaimants emphasise that it is well established under international law that even if a single act or omission by a government may not constitute a violation of an international obligation, several acts, taken together, can warrant a finding that such obligation has been breached. This concept is reflected in Article 15(1) of the International Law Commissions\u2019 *Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts* (2002) (\"ILC Articles\"). Article 15(1) also defines the time at which a composite act \u2018occurs\u2019 to be the time at which the last action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act without it necessarily having to be the last of the series.\n\n5.3.17.\n\nHere, Claimants contend that the Province\u2019s actions, beginning in the opening months of the concession and culminating in the secret and unilateral changes to the 8 April Agreement in 1997, had the necessary consequence of forcing the CAA to terminate the Concession Agreement. The accumulation of the Province\u2019s failures to live up to its obligations, including those of the Concession Agreement and of good faith commercial dealing, resulted in the termination, and thus expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n**Tucum\u00e1n Authorities' Actions relating to the Alleged \"Hostage Period\" Constituted an Expropriation**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.3.18.\n\nClaimants say that even after the expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment in the concession was complete *(ie* upon termination of the Concession Agreement), the Tucum\u00e1n authorities effected a further taking, by compelling CAA to continue to provide services to the Province outside the terms of any contractual arrangement. In effect, the Province appropriated for itself and its citizens the value of CAA\u2019s services for a period of over ten months, and yet paid no compensation to CAA for the services received.\n\n5.3.19.\n\nHaving notified the Province of the termination of the Concession Agreement for fault of the grantor on 27 August 1997, Claimants submit that the concession should have terminated 90 days later, on 27 November 1997. The actions by government authorities that forced CAA to provide services beyond that date constituted a separate and independent act of expropriation.\n\n5.3.20.\n\nClaimants emphasise that the provisions of Article 15.11 of the Concession Agreement, which provide for the 18-month extension of the concessionaire\u2019s term following termination, is not applicable here for two reasons.\n\n5.3.21.\n\nThe first is because the applicable rule in the Concession Agreement is not Article 15.11 but Article 15.9.5, which provides the special rules and procedures governing termination based on the breach of the Province.\n\n5.3.22.\n\nThe second is that the eighteen-month extension period provided for under Article 15.11 of the Concession Agreement is expressly conditioned on the Province\u2019s inability to find another operator to take over the service. Thus, even if the Province could impose the eighteen-month extension on a provider that has rescinded based on the fault of the Province, the exercise of this prerogative must be accompanied by effective confirmation of non-existence of an operator (public or private) capable of taking charge of the service. Here, however, the Province had operated the service for years and was fully capable of taking charge of the service. In these circumstances the Province abused its power when it forced CAA to remain the service provider pursuant to Article 15.11.\n\n5.3.23.\n\nBy requiring CAA to provide services during this time, the Province forced CAA to continue to absorb all of the costs associated with operating the concession. At no point did the Province offer to compensate CAA for these costs, which amounted to over US$10.5 million. Claimants argue that there simply is no principle of international law that could justify the actions of the government authorities in this case. Claimants are therefore entitled to all of their costs incurred in operating the service during the more than 10-month alleged \"hostage period\".\n\n**Effects of the Tucum\u00e1n Authorities' Actions are Determinative**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.3.24.\n\nClaimants argue that in determining whether a taking constitutes an expropriation it is particularly important to examine the effect that such taking may have had on the investors\u2019 rights. Effects are determinative, and it is well established that the government's intent to expropriate, or lack thereof, is not a principal concern.\n\n5.3.25.\n\nThis means, whatever the motivations for the Province\u2019s actions against the concessionaire, it is the destructive economic effects of those action that are determinative to the expropriation analysis under Treaty Article 5. Claimants therefore contend that, even if the motivations of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities were unclear, the Tribunal need only find that - regardless of whether they intended to do so - the Tucum\u00e1n authorities in fact deprived Claimants of the value of their investment.\n\n**5.4. Respondent is Responsible under the Treaty for the Actions Complained ofby Claimants**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.4.1.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s defence, that the actions of individual provincial legislators and the Ombudsman are not attributable to Argentina, Claimants first observe that Respondent does not deny responsibility for actions (which may found to constitute treaty breaches) of the Legislature (as a body), the Executive and provincial organs such as ERSACT, the Attorney General or the Court of Accounts.\n\n5.4.2.\n\nThen, citing Articles 4 and 5 of the ILC Articles, Claimants contend that:\n\n(i) the provincial legislators of Tucum\u00e1n, exercising as they do \"legislative\" functions at \"a territorial unit of the State\", individually and collectively are \"State organs\" whose conduct shall be considered an act of the state under international law, and\n\n(ii) the Ombudsman, having regard to his governmental functions, relationship with the Legislature and sweeping authority, also has the status of a \"State organ\" for whose conduct the state is responsible. And even if the Tribunal were to conclude that the Ombudsman is not a state organ, it is certainly an entity \"empowered by the law\" of Argentina \"to exercise elements of governmental authority\" within the meaning of Article 5 for which the state must take responsibility.\n\n5.4.3.\n\nFor these reasons, Claimants say that Respondent is incorrect when it argues that the conduct of the provincial legislators of Tucum\u00e1n and the Ombudsman is not attributable to Respondent. Their conduct, which Claimants assert to be in breach of the Treaty, is attributable to Respondent and thus Respondent is liable to compensate Claimants in accordance with the Treaty.\n\n**5.5. Respondent Must Answer All Treaty Claims, Including Those Related toMatters of Contract**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.5.1.\n\nClaimants rej ect Respondent\u2019s arguments that they have advanced only contract claims, that the existence of a forum selection clause prevents the Tribunal from deciding the meaning of the contract and that they must demonstrate conduct of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities that amounts to more than mere breach of contract - a showing of \"breach plus\" - to establish breach of the Treaty under international law.\n\n5.5.2.\n\nClaimants contend that the *ad hoc* Committee concluded that a new tribunal could (even must) consider and decide such contractual issues as might be necessary to adjudicate Claimants\u2019 Treaty claims.\n\n5.5.3.\n\nClaimants note that the *ad hoc* Committee described the Treaty standard as \"independent\", that is, distinct from, but not necessarily additive to, issues of contract performance or breach. Thus, a breach of Articles 3 or 5 does not depend on showing \"more\" than a contractual breach and, in the right circumstances, a showing of contractual breach(es) may lay the foundation for demonstrating - or may itself constitute - a Treaty breach. However, even if \"more\" were required, \"more\" is present here, where the government acted not in a commercial capacity, but instead used its sovereign authority to defeat the parties\u2019 expectations and destroy the value of the contract. Claimants point to the *Shufeldt245 Philips Petroleum246 Seaco247* and *SPP248* decisions to illustrate that tribunals consistently award compensation where sovereign authority is used to destroy or unilaterally modify contract rights.249\n\n*Shufeldt Claim (U.S.A. v. Guatemala),* Decision of the Arbitrator of 24 July 1930, 2 INT\u2019L ARB AWARDS 1083, 1095-96.\n\n*Phillips Petroleum Company Iran v. the Islamic Republic of Iran and NIOC,* Award No. 425-39-2, Award of 29 June 1989, 21 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 79 at \u00b6\u00b6765-76.\n\n*Searco, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran,* Award No. 531-260-2, Award of 25 June 1992, 12 Iran - U.S. C.T.R. 335 at \u00b645.\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3), Award on the Merits of 20 May 1992, 32 LL.M. 937 (1993) at 164-65.\n\nMemorial at \u00b6\u00b6329-34; and Reply at \u00b6269.\n\n5.5.4.\n\nIn sum, Claimants argue that Respondent must answer to each and every Treaty claim advanced by Claimants. This includes Treaty claims based on the impact of the Province\u2019s actions with respect to Claimants\u2019 rights under the concession. And to the extent that adjudicating Claimants\u2019 Treaty claims requires the Tribunal to evaluate the parties' contentions with respect to their contractual rights, that is its responsibility. According to Claimants, Respondent cannot be heard to contend, in disregard of the jurisdictional decisions reached in this case, that all claims resting on contractual issues are excluded from the Tribunal\u2019s purview or that contractual breaches as such cannot also support Treaty claims without \"more\".\n\n**5.6. Respondent\u2019s Allegations that CAA Breached the Concession Agreement areMisleading and did not Justify Termination**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.6.1.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent\u2019s allegations that CAA breached the Concession Agreement are misleading and did not justify termination by the Province.\n\n5.6.2.\n\nClaimants say that immediately after receiving CAA\u2019s notice of rescission, ERSACT issued a flurry of new and old resolutions accusing CAA of all manner of breaches of the Concession Agreement. Two weeks later, the Province issued Decree 2270, which cited all of the defaults just claimed by ERSACT and purported to terminate the Concession Agreement.\n\n5.6.3.\n\nClaimants describe Decree 2270 and the flurry of ERSACT resolutions that preceded it as a naked exercise of politics\u2014a perfect example of the politically driven \"parody of regulation\" that governed CAA during the concession. Claimants rely on the simple factual falsity of so many of those allegations of breach as evidence of their \"sham\" nature.\n\n**CAA\u2019s Alleged Failure to Make Investments**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n5.6.4.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s claim that CAA failed to meet its annual contractual capital investment obligations, Claimants rely on Barbier Frinault & Associ\u00e9s\u2019 (Arthur Andersen) April 1998 report (Exhibit 882) which demonstrates that, at the end of the concession's second year, CAA was within US$75,000 of the required investment targets set in the contract, after having invested nearly four times more than the investments required in the first year of the concession.\n\n5.6.5.\n\nClaimants say that Respondent\u2019s witnesses fail to take into account the contractual structure of the company's investment obligations. Within each year's total investments, there was a portion designated for \"extensions\". However such extensions were conditioned on CAA receiving requests from customers to carry them out, and on certain levels of commitments from the customers partially to finance the works. CAA did not perform the extensions because it received no requests through this procedure, and therefore it was not obligated to make the \"extensions\" investments. This is not to say that the network was unchanged during that time\u2014to the contrary, over 10,300 extensions were performed. However, these were self-contracted by the customers and so did not use the procedure set out in Article 12.2 of the Concession Agreement.\n\n**Alleged Shortcomings of CAA\u2019s Water Sampling and Testing Program**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.6.6.\n\nConcerning Respondent\u2019s assertion that CAA failed to comply with the required contractual water quality control program, Claimants say that, to the extent that a limited number of tests were not performed, CAA observed at all times the necessary water testing and sampling requirements to ensure that the water it provided to its customers was of the highest possible quality, and this testing was later recognised by the Province as a more appropriate and effective regime. Indeed, the Province ultimately adopted the water testing and quality regime proposed by CAA, with slight modification, and planned to subject any future concessionaire to that programme.\n\n5.6.7.\n\nClaimants submit that CAA\u2019s regimen improved on the testing requirements of the Concession Agreement in important ways that were recognised and agreed to by ERSACT\u2019s technical professionals. The logical conclusion is that it was only for political reasons that ERSACT continued to use Annex XHI-related allegations to harass CAA.\n\n**Alleged Shortfall in CAA\u2019s Paid-in Capital**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n5.6.8.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s position that CAA was under-capitalised, Claimants submit that this was flatly wrong. As certified by CAA\u2019s independent auditors and recorded in CAA\u2019s shareholders' register (exhibit 880), CAA was fully capitalised with US$30 million in May 1997, ahead of the contractual deadline of the end of the second year of the concession.\n\n**CAA\u2019s Alleged Failure to Maintain Performance Bonds**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.6.9.\n\nClaimants counter Respondent\u2019s allegation of default for lack of contractually required performance bonds (guarantees) by pointing out that CAA had the required US$30 million and US$4.15 million guarantees in place before the takeover of the concession, and maintained the necessary insurance policies in effect at all times throughout the life of the Concession Agreement.\n\n**Alleged Defects in CAA\u2019s Emergency Plan**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n5.6.10.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s claim that CAA did not submit, or submitted an inadequate emergency plan, Claimants contend that the emergency plan submitted by CAA was perfectly adequate and was based on an emergency plan that was already in force and functioning in Poitiers, France. Its summary rejection by ERSACT provides another example of the arbitrary and intransigent attitude that the Regulator adopted towards CAA.\n\n**CAA\u2019s Alleged Poor Service**\n------------------------------\n\n5.6.11.\n\nClaimants say that Respondent misrepresents the events concerning the turbidity episodes when it offers them as evidence of CAA\u2019s allegedly poor service. Claimants submit that these events demonstrate the exact opposite of what Respondent claims. The brief and innocuous red turbidity that occurred in December 1995 was the unavoidable result of the necessary repairs carried out by CAA in the water network and the darkish and equally innocuous turbidity in late January 1996 that was caused by the presence of manganese in the reservoir\u2014a circumstance beyond the control of CAA\u2014demonstrated the professionalism with which CAA dealt with an unforeseeable *force majeure* event and how efficiently it diagnosed and redressed the problem.\n\n5.6.12.\n\nAs regards these separate events of turbidity, Claimants note five points of commonality. First, neither incident posed any health risk to the population of Tucum\u00e1n. Second, neither incident was caused by negligence on the part of CAA. Third, both incidents were detected, diagnosed, and corrected by CAA in a prompt and professional manner. Fourth, CAA was transparent and precise in the information it provided to the authorities and its customers throughout the turbidity episodes. Fifth, the actions of CAA ensured that similar problems of turbidity could either be prevented or mitigated in the future.\n\n**5.7. Claimants Claim Compensation for Deprivation of Treaty Rights**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.7.1.\n\nClaimants submit that they have been deprived of their rights under Articles 3 and 5 of the Treaty: they have suffered multiple forms of unfair and inequitable treatment in violation of international law; they have also seen their investment expropriated, without compensation. Claimants seek damages for these harms inflicted upon them.\n\n5.7.2.\n\nClaimants say, for the most part, that harm arises out of the same acts and omissions of the Province, whether it results from breaches of Article 3 or Article 5 of the Treaty, but that it is most readily measured in terms of the full value of their property rights that were expropriated by government authorities in Argentina.\n\n5.7.3.\n\nTherefore, Claimants first seek damages arising from the forced reduction of the tariff and the depression of the recovery rate during the two and a half year life of the Concession Agreement. Second, Claimants seek damages arising from the premature termination of the Concession Agreement, including CAA\u2019s lost profits, the value of its investments, the amount of its redundancy costs, and costs associated with the breaching of subcontracts as a result of the termination of the concession. Finally, Claimants seek damages for the period in which CAA was forced to provide additional services after the termination of the Concession Agreement, as well as damages incurred up to the present.\n\n5.7.4.\n\nClaimants emphasise that international decisions have consistently required that governments pay compensation for the full value of expropriated property. Article 5(2) of the Treaty provides the specific framework for this case. It directly incorporates these principles, stating that, if Argentina \"directly or indirectly, [adopts] measures of expropriation or nationalization or any other equivalent measure having an effect similar to dispossession,\" then it shall allow the payment of a prompt and adequate compensation, the amount of which, computed on the basis of the actual value of the investments affected, shall be evaluated in relation to the normal economic situation, and prior to any threat of dispossession.\n\n5.7.5.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 submission, in this case, the Concession Agreement itself provides the best guidance for assessing the value of what was taken and the parties' understanding of the normal economic conditions under which the concession would operate. Thus, the value of Claimants\u2019 investment is essentially the value of the concession, and that valuation is best made using the agreed upon economic terms and financial assumptions of the Concession Agreement itself. Claimants argue that Tucum\u00e1n authorities destroyed, or otherwise diminished Claimants\u2019 valuable economic rights under the Concession Agreement whilst that agreement was in effect. Claimants also submit the Provincial authorities deprived them of the value of their contractual rights under the remaining 27-plus years of the Concession Agreement, which CAA was forced to terminate as a result of the Province\u2019s unlawful conduct. Claimants have calculated the damages owed on these two components of its claims as of the date of the termination of the Concession Agreement on 27 November 1997. Claimants also request damages for the post-termination period during which CAA was forced to provide water and sewage treatment services in Tucum\u00e1n, and for net losses incurred after that time in connection with Claimants\u2019 mitigation efforts.\n\n5.7.6.\n\nClaimants seek damages in the amount of US$316,923,000, plus compound interest and litigation costs and expenses.250 In support of their calculations of the damages incurred, Claimants provided a Statement of Amounts Claimed, with a corresponding verification report of Ernst & Young.251\n\nReply at \u00b6438.\n\nStatement of Amounts Claimed, with verification report of Ernst & Young, 19 November 2004 (Exhibit 7).\n\n**Damages for Losses During the Life of the Concession Agreement**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.7.7.\n\nClaimants argue that the Province is responsible for the damages resulting from at least three key modifications of essential economic terms of the Concession Agreement.\n\n5.7.8.\n\nFirst, Resolution 212/96 prevented CAA from invoicing customers for local taxes (IB, PACIS, and OS). During the periods when CAA was prohibited from invoicing customers for these taxes, it was forced to bear the cost of the taxes itself within its capped service tariffs, resulting in losses of more than US$3,578,000. Second, CAA suffered losses because of its inability to apply the 10% increases permitted to the tariff in the second and third years of the concession - losses that totalled over US$5,846,400. Third, Provincial Law 6826 passed, in connection with the third renegotiation, imposed tariff reductions in line with the unilaterally modified text that. Law 6826 was retroactively effective to 1 May 1997, and remained in effect until 27 August 1998, notwithstanding the failure of the renegotiation as a result of the Province\u2019s bad faith acts. Losses for this period are claimed in the amount of US$5,718,600.\n\n5.7.9.\n\nClaimants contend that the acts of government officials during the effective life of the Concession Agreement, *ie,* for the period 22 July 1995 to 27 November 1997, reduced CAA\u2019s actual recovery rate significantly below the levels established with the Concession Agreement. Here Claimants seek to recover US$47,658,000, made up of:\n\n(i) US$41,686,000 in losses as a result of diminished revenues (calculated by multiplying the difference between the recovery rate assumed in the Concession Agreement and the actual recovery rate, by the actual tariff);\n\n(ii) US$2,108,000 in losses associated with the 6% CENTE fee payable to ERSACT. CAA was forced to pay the CENTE fee as soon as an invoice was issued and regardless of whether the customer actually paid the invoice; and\n\n(iii) US$3,864,000 losses from financing costs arising from the cash flow deficit for CAA created by the drop in the recovery rate.\n\n**Damages for Losses Resulting from the Termination of the Concession Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.7.10.\n\nClaimants request full compensation for the value of the concession at the time of the taking. They rely, *inter alia,* on Article 15.8.3 of the Concession Agreement which is said to be entirely consistent with international law standards. In pertinent part, it provides that:\n\n*\"in the case of return or of termination of the Concession due to misconduct by the Authority, the procedure set out in Art. 15.9.5 herein shall be followed. The Authority will return the Guaranty for the due completion of the Contract, the non-depreciated value of the assets acquired or built by the Concessionaire, the concession investments which have not been totally depreciated at the date of return, in conformity with the depreciation plan and will indemnify the Concessionaire for the damages generated by the termination, which will be duly confirmed and will, furthermore, take responsibility for the subcontracts then in progress. \"*\n\n5.7.11.\n\nOn this basis, Claimants seek:\n\n(i) US$12,117,000 for the value of CAA\u2019s depreciated investments in the concession (corresponding to the net value of the investments made by the Concessionaire as defined in Article 15.8.3 of the Concession Agreement);\n\n(ii) US$642,000 of incidental losses related to the termination of the Concession Agreement (under international law as well as Articles 8.15 and 15.8.3 of the Concession Agreement); and\n\n(iii) US$228,600,000 being the net present value of CAA\u2019s lost profits for the \"going concern\" of the concession (calculated with reference to the fair market value prior to expropriation and the future cash flows set out in the cash flow projections in the Concession Agreement as provided for in Article 15.8.3 of the Concession Agreement).\n\n**Damages Incurred During and After the Alleged \"Hostage Period\"**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.7.12.\n\nClaimants contend that the Province forced CAA to provide services for a period of over 10 months after the termination of the Concession Agreement. Thus, the damages claimed for this period arise not from the expropriation of CAA\u2019s rights under the Concession Agreement, but for the expropriation of CAA\u2019s services after that first taking was effectively completed. Claimants seek payment for all of their costs incurred in providing over 10 months of extra-contractual services, as well as costs incurred thereafter, when CAA was engaged in continued mitigation efforts to collect unpaid invoices.\n\n5.7.13.\n\nClaimants submit that CAA\u2019s damages during the period of forced provision of services amounted to US$10,580,000. Additional damages in the amount of US$4,409,000 were incurred after that alleged \"hostage period\" for CAA\u2019s costs as it worked to collect unpaid invoices, resulting in a total claim for restitution for these periods of US$14,989,000.\n\n**Tax Liability Contingency**\n-----------------------------\n\n5.7.14.\n\nRegarding AFIP\u2019s tax claim against CAA, described at 4.22 above, Claimants say that if AFIP\u2019s claim is upheld, CAA\u2019s damages arising out of the expropriation will be increased by this additional tax liability. Accordingly, Claimants include in their damages a contingent claim of at least US$1,402,000 - the claimed tax liability, exclusive of penalties or interest (which Claimants reserve the right to add when any final liability becomes known).\n\n**Interest**\n------------\n\n5.7.15.\n\nClaimants argue that they are entitled to an award of interest on the damage amounts claimed, in order to place them in the position they would have occupied had Respondent paid adequate compensation promptly upon the date of its expropriation. Interest should date from 27 November 1997, the date as of which Claimants have calculated and stated their amounts claimed.\n\n5.7.16.\n\nClaimants further submit that it is appropriate under international law to apply compound, rather than simple, interest in expropriation cases, and seek compound interest at the rate of 9.70%. This rate corresponds to the \"discount rate\" applied in Claimants\u2019 DCF analysis to calculate the net present value (as of 27 November 1997) of the remaining term of the expropriated Concession Agreement. That discount rate was based on the quoted rate on the Argentine Treasury bond \"Argentina Rep 17\" on that same date. Claimants argue that it represents a reasonable proxy for the interest rate Claimants could have earned on the compensation that was due to them upon expropriation, had that compensation been paid promptly on 27 November 1997. According to Claimants, this rate thus would properly compensate Claimants for the opportunity costs of Respondent's failure to pay prompt and adequate compensation for the Province\u2019s expropriatory, unfair and inequitable acts.\n\n**Litigation Costs and Expenses**\n---------------------------------\n\n5.7.17.\n\nClaimants sought reimbursement of their litigation costs and expenses.252 As specified in the parties\u2019 procedural agreement of 6 June 2006, confirmed by the Tribunal\u2019s order of 16 June 2006, Claimants filed their submission on costs on 29 September 2006. Claimants sought over US$6.3 million in costs, including attorney\u2019s fees, in respect of the merits stage of the proceedings. In addition, Claimants reasserted their request for US$706,273.23 in respect of costs incurred in the jurisdictional proceedings, as detailed in Claimants\u2019 costs report of 31 August 2005.\n\nMemorial at \u00b6409.\n\n**Mode of Payment**\n-------------------\n\n5.7.18.\n\nClaimants\u2019 investments were made in Argentina in US dollars and/or French francs. Claimants\u2019 damages are calculated in US dollars, and Claimants request payment of any award in the same currency. Claimants made their investments with funds transferred into Argentina by CGE/Vivendi. Accordingly, Claimants jointly request that the Tribunal order that payment be made to Claimants in France, to the account of Vivendi.\n\n**6. RESPONDENT\u2019S CASE**\n------------------------\n\n**6.1. Tribunal\u2019s Approach**\n----------------------------\n\n6.1.1.\n\nIn this section we summarise the elements and scope of the defences and arguments raised by Respondent, as advanced in its pleadings, written submissions and during the course of the oral hearing.\n\n6.1.2.\n\nRespondent defends on the basis of six main propositions, which in summary may be stated as follows:\n\n(i) neither CAA nor CGE / Vivendi are proper Treaty claimants on the facts;253\n\n(ii) Claimants\u2019 case exclusively involves contractual matters, over which this Tribunal has no jurisdiction, and discloses no treaty violations;254\n\n(iii) CAA frustrated the Concession Agreement, causing its Tucum\u00e1n operations to fail, as a result of its own mismanagement, contractual breaches and public relations blunders;255\n\n(iv) the Province responded reasonably, properly and proportionately to CAA\u2019s failure to meet its contractual obligations - both as a contracting party and a government. Claimants were always treated fairly and equitably and provided with security and full protection. None of the actions of the provincial authorities constituted expropriation;256\n\n(v) Respondent had cause to terminate, and properly terminated the Concession Agreement.257 Requiring CAA to provide service thereafter was lawful and did not amount to expropriation, and\n\n(vi) Claimants\u2019 case should also be dismissed on the basis that its claim for damages is groundless, as well as unsubstantiated and unjustified. In the event the Tribunal finds Claimants entitled to damages, these should be limited to *damnum emergens,* based on reliable evidence of loss. Under no circumstances are Claimants entitled to recovery any *lucrum* *cessans.258*\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b614-15.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b62.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b63-4.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b63.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b611.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b617.\n\n**6.2. CAA is not a Proper Claimant**\n-------------------------------------\n\n6.2.1.\n\nRespondent argues that CAA is not entitled to recover any losses because it acquired its rights in violation of the Concession Agreement.259 Because CGE did not become a majority shareholder of CAA until June 1996, CAA was not a \"French\" company within the meaning of Article 1(2) of the BIT when the Concession Agreement was signed, because CAA was not controlled directly or indirectly by CGE.260\n\nRejoinder at pp. 140-142.\n\nRejoinder at \u00b6\u00b6408-410.\n\n6.2.2.\n\nRespondent further argues CGE's acquisition of its controlling stake in CAA was contrary to Article 2.3.2 of the Concession Agreement, because the Executive did not consent to the transfer of the ownership of CAA\u2019s shares which led to CGE's stake of 85%. Accordingly, CAA became entitled to pursue a claim under the BIT only through an express violation of the terms of the Concession Agreement. Respondent says that CAA\u2019s claim should be dismissed because it has been brought in bad faith, and that for policy reasons, CAA should not be permitted to pursue a claim for violation of treaty rights that it acquired illegitimately.\n\n6.2.3.\n\nRespondent accepts that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine CAA\u2019s claim, but contends that, in the proper exercise of that jurisdiction, CAA\u2019s claim must be dismissed for these reasons.\n\n**6.3. Claimants\u2019 Case Exclusively Involves Contractual Matters**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.3.1.\n\nRespondent claims that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over any dispute arising under the Concession Agreement. Insofar, as the concession is concerned, the Tribunal\u2019s task is limited to \"taking into account the terms of the contract\" for the purposes of determining - principally - whether there has been a breach of Argentina\u2019s obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the principles of international law. If the Tribunal concludes that Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s actions are plausibly justified on the basis of the terms of the Concession Agreement, and if there has been no denial of justice in relation to the forum for the resolution of contractual disputes, it is difficult to see on what basis Argentina could be internationally responsible for the alleged acts of the Province.\n\n6.3.2.\n\nIn the course of Respondent\u2019s closing submissions during the hearing on the merits, Respondent attempted to clarify its position on the extent to which the Concession Agreement could and should be considered by the Tribunal.261\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 11, pp. 2921-2929 (4 August 2006).\n\n6.3.3.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Decision on Annulment did not suggest that the First Tribunal could or should have ruled on the Concession Agreement, but that it \"should have tried harder to see whether any of the facts of the case could be disentangled from the contractual dispute, and whether those facts fell into the category of sovereign power, and whether the sovereign power had been used in such a way as to breach a pertinent Treaty standard.\"262\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 11, pp. 2924-2925 (4 August 2006).\n\n6.3.4.\n\nRespondent argued that Article 16.4 of the Concession Agreement prevents the Tribunal from interpreting or applying the contract, but does not require the Tribunal to ignore factual matters related to the contract.263 In response to an inquiry from the Tribunal with respect to the apparent contradiction between Respondent\u2019s position and its reliance on its allegations that Claimants were in breach of the Concession Agreement, Respondent argued that exploring the \"reasonableness of the model which was embodied in the contract\" was not interpreting or applying the contract.264 Respondent further submitted that the Tribunal could and must take into account Respondent\u2019s case and consider whether it is plausible that Respondent\u2019s actions were justified under the Concession Agreement.265\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 11, p. 2926 (4 August 2006).\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 11, p. 2927 (4 August 2006).\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 11, pp. 2919-2929 (4 August 2006).\n\n**6.4. CAA Frustrated its Own Agreement and Failed to Discharge its Obligationsin Good Faith**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.4.1.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants frustrated the Concession Agreement when CAA failed to comply with its contractual obligations in good faith.266\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b6423-430.\n\n6.4.2.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, CAA implemented an erroneous commercial policy by increasing the tariffs by 110% in its first billing, when under the \"price cap\" principle provided for in the Concession Agreement, they would have been able to do so on a gradual or progressive basis.267 Respondent submits that this effectively destroyed CAA\u2019s credibility in the eyes of its customers.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6424.\n\n6.4.3.\n\nAccording to Respondent, CAA failed to invest in accordance with its obligations. Respondent argued that when CAA took over the concession, one of the most urgent priorities was the upgrading of the laboratory, including the acquisition of equipment necessary to undertake the water quality tests mandated by the Concession Agreement. However, CAA neglected the test laboratory's equipment and operations, failing to improve the laboratory building for over three months, until November 1995. Even then, according to Respondent, CAA expended only minimal amounts that were insufficient to allow CAA to have the necessary equipment to test the water supply properly and maintain the water delivery infrastructure.268\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6118, citing ERSACT report about investment in laboratory (Exhibit 592).\n\n6.4.4.\n\nWhilst Claimants say that CAA spent nearly ARS 140,000 in the first six months of the Concession to rebuild the laboratory and purchase new equipment and supplies, Respondent notes that CAA\u2019s \"Annual Report of Advancement of the Five-Yearly Plan,\" indicates that CAA invested only ARS 62,414.90 in the laboratory during the entire first year of the Concession which represents only 0.4% of CAA\u2019s overall required investment during the first year of the Concession.269\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b6118-119.\n\n6.4.5.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the fact that it took as long as six months \"to get the laboratory up and running\"270 demonstrates CAA\u2019s lack of commitment to what should have been a high priority. Thus, CAA failed during this period to establish proper water quality control and to meet its obligations under the Concession Agreement. In this respect, Respondent say that most laboratory equipment that had to be purchased and installed at the central lab and at the labs in the main water treatment facilities in order to comply with the Bid Conditions was never purchased by CAA.271\n\nde Rochambeau Affidavit, 5 November 2004 (Exhibit 1), at \u00b642.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6122.\n\n6.4.6.\n\nFrom the beginning of the Concession, Respondent asserts that the Regulator demanded that CAA comply with its contractual obligation to execute a sampling program to ensure water quality. Nevertheless, Respondent argues that CAA failed to equip the laboratory properly or expeditiously. By way of example, Respondent notes that CAA waited more than two months from the takeover of the concession and more than four months from execution of the agreement to purchase a necessary instrument (a spectrophotometer), the price of which was less than the salary of one of its managers.272\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6123, citing Invoice for purchase of a spectrophotometer for the amount of ARS 7,022 + VAT = 8,496.62 (Exhibit 56), and Copy of list of demanded wages by CAA to the Province, in File No. 849/300-C, 12 September 1995 (Exhibit 424).\n\n6.4.7.\n\nCAA\u2019s failures in relation to the laboratory and water quality testing are said by Respondent to be indicative of its general failure to comply with its investment obligations throughout its tenure in Tucum\u00e1n.273 CAA also failed to make the necessary investments to comply with its obligations to expand the area of service.274 This was a key requirement of the Concession Agreement and in fact one of the principal reasons why the Province decided to privatise water service in the first place. The resulting inadequate supply of potable water posed a severe risk of disease to people in the more remote areas of the Province.275\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6127.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6128.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6128, citing United National Development Programme, Human Poverty Profile and Index (28 January 1999), Pam American Health Organization, Health in the Americas, 1998 Edition, Volume I (attached as Exhibit 27 to Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial from the first arbitration proceeding) (\"Inadequate water supply and excreta disposal generate high-risk conditions that especially endanger the country\u2019s poorer areas\").\n\n6.4.8.\n\nMore generally, Respondent asserts that CAA rendered a deficient service, characterised by a constant lack of water pressure, lack of service in the poorest towns, and their own negligence in allowing the network to be contaminated with manganese. This situation led to the distribution of water of a \"repugnant\" quality, exhibiting a black appearance that had never been seen before and that shocked customers. Respondent claims that the blackwater began to flow into people's homes in December 1995 and continued for approximately six weeks, until mid February 1996. In this respect, Respondent submits that:\n\n(i) CAA made varied, contradictory and erroneous announcements about the cause of the contamination and whether or not it constituted a danger to health.276 In the beginning of January 1996, CAA publicly explained that the discolouration, what it called \"red turbidity\", was due to the disembedding of rust particles from the inside of cast iron pipe networks after certain cleansing operations undertaken by CAA in some areas of San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n.277 Respondent rejects CAA\u2019s explanations for the early turbidity and submits that CAA\u2019s failure properly to diagnose the true cause of the problem actually made the situation even worse.278 Based on its incorrect diagnosis of bacterial contamination, CAA treated the problem with the addition of chlorine, when in fact, the turbidity was caused by the presence of manganese in the water supply. The chlorine injected by CAA into the system reacted with the manganese to create an even darker appearance.\n\n(ii) CAA failed to undertake tests mandated by the Concessions Agreement that would have prevented the water quality problems, refused to respond to the Regulator's repeated requests to see the test results, complained that the tests were too costly and said it would not perform any quality control tests unless tariffs were increased to cover the performance costs.279 Respondent submits that periodic tests required by the Concession Agreement would have prevented the blackwater problem.280\n\n(iii) Having found that CAA had violated the Concession Agreement by failing to comply with the frequency of quality control tests in August and September 1995, ERSACT therefore formally declared the existence of 78 violations to the Concession Agreement, issuing Resolutions No. 38/95 to 115/95 on 6 December 1995.281\n\n(iv) Apart from the contractual testing regime, Respondent claims that CAA should have anticipated the potential for the blackwater problem.282 Having performed extensive due diligence on the water infrastructure in Tucum\u00e1n for more than 12 months, CAA knew or should have known the correct procedures to extract water from the El Cadillal reservoir without creating the risk of manganese contamination.283 Moreover, in Respondent\u2019s submission the blackwater was eminently foreseeable and avoidable and CAA\u2019s failure to foresee and consequently avoid it was due to CAA\u2019s own failure to perform the contractually mandated water quality tests, to carry out the emergency works promptly, and to undertake proper investigations into the chemical and geological characteristics of one of its largest reservoirs.284\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6147.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b6147-149.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b6150-151.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6157.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6158. Respondent relies on the four scientific publications it submitted as Exhibit 18 in the first arbitration, which according to Respondent explain \"the means to prevent and control, by quality testing and other measures, the processes that occur in lakes and dams like El Cadillal that may lead to manganese contamination of the public water supply\".\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b6159-160.

This is because CAA never appealed or otherwise sought judicial review of the relevant resolutions and Claimants have presented no evidence that would allow the Tribunal to review the merits of any of these ERSACT resolutions.285\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6159, Note 237.\n\n6.4.10.\n\nIn sum, Respondent submits that to allow Claimants to rely on alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement, they must first demonstrate they fulfilled their own obligations under the agreement in good faith.286\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b6423-430.\n\n**6.5. Actions of the Tucum\u00e1n Authorities Were Responsible, Proportionate, anddid not Constitute Expropriation**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.5.1.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants\u2019 property was not expropriated within the meaning of the BIT for the following reasons:\n\n(i) the submissions made by Claimants as to the nature and content of indirect expropriation are not recognized as a matter of international law, and Claimants\u2019 assertions that the BIT must be broadly construed do not find support in the relevant case-law;\n\n(ii) Claimants assert that two types of property have been expropriated: contractual rights and \"reasonably expected economic benefits\" which were expected to flow from the concession. As to the first, Respondent submits the Tucum\u00e1n authorities did not destroy Claimants\u2019 rights under the contract. Rather, it was Claimants\u2019 refusal to comply with their contractual obligations that led to termination of the Agreement, which remained in effect until Claimants themselves initiated its termination. As to the second, Respondent argues the BIT does not insure against investments that are not profitable or guarantee that an investment will be profitable, especially where Claimants\u2019 own mismanagement and contractual breaches were the source of any failure to realise their initial expectations.\n\n(iii) with respect to legislative acts, Claimants bear the significant burden of rebutting the strong presumption that state regulatory legislation is legitimate. The challenged acts were legitimate and proportionate measures directed to protecting public health and the well-being of the population in response to Claimants\u2019 failure to provide a reliable supply of quality water, a fundamental human need which the state has a responsibility to safeguard and maintain.\n\n(iv) some of the acts about which Claimants complain were not performed or acquiesced in by any governmental authority. Such private acts cannot serve as the basis of an expropriation claim.\n\n(v) the Tucum\u00e1n authorities were entitled under the Contract to require a period of service after termination of the Contract and did so for entirely legitimate reasons directed to public health and well-being. Furthermore, the federal government took appropriate steps to intervene and shorten the post-contract service period.287\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6460.\n\n6.5.2.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimants appear to suggest that any act or measure by the Tucum\u00e1n authorities which diminished the profitability of the contract in some way can and should be deemed a measure \"tantamount to expropriation\" and thus a violation of Article 5(2) of the BIT. In Respondent\u2019s submission, this argument is erroneous and groundless.288\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6461.\n\n6.5.3.\n\nRespondent submits that the BIT was intended to incorporate a standard of conduct grounded in customary international law.289 According to Respondent the BIT drafters did not intend to expand the concept of \"expropriation\" beyond the established international law standard. In Respondent\u2019s submission, Claimants have provided no evidence to support the proposition that it was the intention of the drafters of the BIT to protect the investors\u2019 \"reasonably expected economic benefits\", but have instead proceeded on the basis of a manifest misunderstanding as to the scope of the BIT, and the extent to which the BIT is intended to provide comfort and protection to investors.290\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6462.\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6462.\n\n6.5.4.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent stresses that, having regard to the findings of the *ad hoc* Committee, the Tribunal, when considering Claimants\u2019 expropriation case, ought to bear in mind the distinction which must be drawn between breaches (if any) of the Concession Agreement by the Tucum\u00e1n authorities, and expropriation within the meaning of international law and the BIT as set out above. The *ad hoc* Committee noted that \"Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT do not relate directly to breach of a municipal contract. Rather they set an independent standard. A State may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and vice versa, and this is certainly true of these provisions of the BIT\".\n\n6.5.5.\n\nRespondent submits that any breach of contract on the part of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities accordingly would be insufficient to provide grounds for a claim for breach of the BIT. Claimants therefore have the burden of demonstrating conduct on the part of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities that amounts to more than mere breach of contract and instead rises to the level of expropriation under international law.\n\n6.5.6.\n\nRespondent contends that the specific matters about which Claimants\u2019 complains arise out of the application of provisions of the Concession Agreement (the recoverability of taxes, the increase in tariffs in years two and three and the renegotiation of its terms). Therefore, it is important for the Tribunal to have regard to the distinctions which have been drawn by respected jurists and tribunals between conduct which amounts to expropriation and conduct which does not warrant a remedy under international law.\n\n6.5.7.\n\nIt is Respondent\u2019s position that the case law has specifically addressed whether an expropriation can be established from alleged breaches of contract, where Claimants had an opportunity to seek redress through a contractually chosen forum. In that context, expropriation can only be established if a claimant proves a denial of justice, or a repudiation of a right, that could not be redressed by the contractually chosen forum, thereby denying the exercise of that right entirely or substantially.\n\n6.5.8.\n\nRespondent submits that nothing in the facts of this case discloses conduct by the Tucum\u00e1n authorities which comes within the narrowly-defined scope of expropriation as recognized by international law. Accordingly, there has been no conduct amounting to an expropriation which gives rise to liability under the BIT.\n\n6.5.9.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s submission, the challenged actions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities represented a proper exercise of governmental authority and a reasonable, proportionate and necessary response to the dire emergency caused by CAA\u2019s failure to provide potable water, its serious and persistent breaches of its obligations under the Concession Agreement (described above) and to the public outcry over its supply of undrinkable water at inflated prices. These facts show incontrovertibly that CAA\u2019s own actions \u2014 and not the actions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities \u2014 led to Claimants\u2019 failure to realise their anticipated profits under the Concession Agreement.\n\n**The Regulator\u2019s Response**\n----------------------------\n\n6.5.10.\n\nRespondent asserts the propriety of ERSACT\u2019s resolutions concerning the frequency and quality control testing for the reasons described above, at 6.4.\n\n6.5.11.\n\nAs regards the steps taken by the Regulator to ensure that CAA did not overcharge customers by imposing taxes on them which were properly for CAA\u2019s account and should already have been comprised in the tariff, Respondent points out that ERSACT\u2019s response:\n\n(i) followed public complaints that had prompted the Ombudsman to ask CAA to clarify its position by holding a meeting on 26 December 1995;\n\n(ii) was based on advice received from the Attorney General as to the legality and validity of the charging structure which CAA had adopted;\n\n(iii) was intended to clarify an issue which had been specifically and expressly addressed in the Bid Conditions but which was left unclear in the Concession Agreement and subject to contradictory construction; and\n\n(iv) was ultimately upheld by the Court of Accounts in a ruling, that bound both ERSACT and the Executive, that Claimants\u2019 did not challenge in the local courts.\n\n6.5.12.\n\nRespondent contends that these facts disclose no act by a state organ which had the effect of expropriating Claimants\u2019 investment. Claimants may not have been happy with the Regulator, but unhappiness with legitimate regulation is not a valid basis for an expropriation claim under the BIT.\n\n**Claimants have Failed to Rebut the Presumption that State Regulation was Legitimate**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.5.13.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants\u2019 contention that the Tucum\u00e1n authorities' regulation of CAA\u2019s activities under the Concession Agreement was merely a guise to force a renegotiation. Respondent says that governmental regulation is bound to affect the value of an investment and the fact that the value of an investment may have been affected by one or more acts of regulation does not make such regulation expropriatory in character.\n\n6.5.14.\n\nRespondent argues that there is a necessary presumption that states are regulating when they say they are regulating and, in this context, non-responsibility of the state must be presumed for non-discriminatory regulatory actions that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety and the environment. In addition to the strong presumption of legitimacy when states regulate property rights, it is a well established principle that valid regulation does not constitute expropriation.\n\n6.5.15.\n\nRespondent submits that the regulatory actions adopted by the Tucum\u00e1n authorities were intended to give effect to the Concession Agreement and to \"protect legitimate public welfare objectives\" in the province of Tucum\u00e1n, namely the provision of accessible drinking water supplies to the population as a whole. It is plain that this process discloses no bad faith or *ultra vires* conduct on the part of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities.\n\n6.5.16.\n\nAs regards Claimants\u2019 suggestion that the parties various attempts to renegotiate the Concession Agreement provide a foundation for their Article 3 and 5 claims, Respondent says that these negotiations were anything but forced upon Claimants. Rather, the renegotiation of the Concession Agreement was an attractive option for Claimants. The alternatives were rescission of the agreement by the Province, on account of CAA\u2019s many breaches, or continued operation of the agreement, potentially for 30 years. CAA and its investors wanted neither.291\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b6 200-205.\n\n6.5.17.\n\nRespondent answers Claimants\u2019 criticisms of speeches made and action taken by legislators and the government by pointing out that they were the natural byproduct of CAA\u2019s own conduct. A provider of an essential necessity of life, such as water, must expect that its performance will be closely scrutinised by the public, including legislators and the news media.\n\n6.5.18.\n\nAs to Claimants\u2019 complaints, which are based on the suspension of the provisions of the Concession Agreement that purportedly entitled CAA to increase tariffs by 10% in years two and three, Respondent describes this position as unfathomable.\n\n6.5.19.\n\nIndeed, from March 1996, CAA put forward renegotiation proposals which incorporated tariff reductions. Thus, CAA plainly deemed appropriate tariff rates to be a proper matter for negotiation. For example, at the meeting between CAA and the Renegotiation Commission on 27 March 1996, CAA proposed a temporary tariff reduction pending the outcome of those negotiations. Later, in August 1996, CAA and the Province signed the Framework Agreement which provided for CAA to reduce tariffs by 28% from the rates which applied under the Concession Agreement. Finally, in a proposal made by CAA on 3 March 1997, CAA stated that it would be prepared to agree to a tariff reduction if it achieved its three primary goals: geographical limitation of the concession area; reduction of the required level of investment; and consumption-based charges. By this time, CAA knew and accepted that it could not raise tariffs given its inability to meet acceptable service standards\n\n6.5.20.\n\nIn sum, Respondent says that a deferral of tariff increases to which CAA was not entitled and to which it voluntarily agreed, cannot be deemed state action intended to deprive Claimants of their protected rights.\n\n6.5.21.\n\nRespondent further submits that Claimants\u2019 assertions that the Legislature secretly and unilaterally made material changes to the 8 April Agreement are baseless.\n\n6.5.22.\n\nThe evidence shows that, after a lengthy period of negotiation, CAA obtained from the Tucum\u00e1n authorities a new concession agreement which, in essence, provided to CAA the three elements it had been seeking, and the legislative bill presented to the Legislature on 22 April 1997 was the product of negotiation and drafting between the parties. Following adverse reaction to the legislative bill in the Legislature, the Executive and CAA carried out a general analysis of the bill in the Legislature\u2019s Public Services and Works Committee in May 1997.\n\n6.5.23.\n\nStarting in June 1997, Respondent argues that pro-Executive legislators and the Regulator's technicians discussed with CAA changes to a new bill which was then submitted to the Legislature by Governor Bussi on 6 June 1997. CAA approved the revised legislative bill, as demonstrated by the fact that CAA itself placed an advertisement promoting its advantages on 10 June 1997, and further by the fact that CAA calculated its invoices for the bi-monthly period of May-June 1997 on the basis of the tariff provisions in the draft concession agreement attached to the revised legislative bill.\n\n6.5.24.\n\nRespondent further argues that Claimants have submitted no evidence that alterations made to the new concession agreement between the execution of the April Memorandum and the version presented to the Legislature in July 1997 were \"unilateral\". Rather, the evidence discloses the parties\u2019 negotiated to find a mutually acceptable solution to the key problems that had plagued the performance of the concession from its beginning in 1995. Thus, when CAA repudiated the terms of the revised concession agreement as set forth in Law No. 6826, it had no justification for alleging that there had been \"substantial\" and \"unilateral\" alterations to the text of the renegotiated agreement.\n\n6.5.25.\n\nAgainst this factual backdrop, Respondent concludes that Claimants\u2019 expropriation case must fail. The Tucum\u00e1n authorities were prepared to continue to deal with CAA as the appointed concessionaire had CAA not repudiated the concession. The Tucum\u00e1n authorities never attempted to nationalise the concession or to divest CAA of its assets. Nor were the measures complained of disproportionate or unreasonable. Respondent stresses that even if regulation by the Tucum\u00e1n authorities had the effect of making the concession less profitable than Claimants hoped, such an effect was an incidental and appropriate consequence of public regulation in relation to public welfare. It was not, as Claimants argue, an attempt to \"destroy the concession\", and no evidence has been put before the Tribunal to establish that it was. To the contrary, the evidence is clear that CAA\u2019s lack of profitability was due to CAA\u2019s own gross mismanagement of the enterprise. In any event, the Tucum\u00e1n authorities were plainly exercising their regulatory authority to ensure the delivery of clean water at reasonable prices. There can be no doubt that this is a legitimate purpose and a fundamental responsibility of local government.\n\n**6.6. No Unfair or Inequitable Treatment in Violation of Article 3 of the BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.6.1.\n\nRespondent says that the content and scope of the obligations reflected in Article 3 of the BIT are significantly narrower than those advanced by Claimants and that, in any event, the facts of this case do not permit a finding of any violation of Article 3, on either a \"broad\" or \"narrow\" interpretation of the \"fair and equitable\" standard.\n\n6.6.2.\n\nRespondent suggests that the fair and equitable standard has always been intended to provide a minimum international law yardstick to measure a state's treatment of foreign investors. Despite attempts to suggest, principally by academics, that \"fair and equitable treatment\" should now be viewed more broadly than under the international law minimum standard, the adoption of a broader standard has not been accepted in practice.\n\n6.6.3.\n\nRespondent relies on what is said to have become a classic formulation of the international minimum standard, expressed by the US-Mexico Claims Commission in the *Neer Claim* as follows:\n\n*\"The propriety of governmental acts should be put to the test of international standards... the treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinquency should amount to an outrage, to badfaith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and* *impartial man would readily recognise its insufficiency\"292*\n\n*Neer Claim,* Mexico-U.S. General Claims Commission, Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Vol. IV, p. 60 (1926).\n\n6.6.4.\n\nBased on cases such as *Mondev, Loewen Group, Alex Genin* and *CME,* Respondent argues that a review of more recent decisions by tribunals both under NAFTA and under BITs shows that a broader interpretation of the minimum standard has not been accepted.293\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b6552-562. citing *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award of 11 October 2002, 42 LL.M. 85 (2003), 6 ICSID Reports 192; *The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/5), Award of 26 June 2003, at \u00b6128; *Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil Genin v. Republic of Estonia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2 Award of 25 June 2001 (rectification denied)); *CME Czech Republic B. V. (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic,* Partial Award of 13 September 2001 (UNCITRAL).\n\n6.6.5.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants\u2019 attempts to re-characterise the obligation by reference to particular \"components\" of the standard is novel, unsupported by authority, and misconceived. Rather, as a matter of principle and of practice, international bodies and tribunals have recognised and applied a context-specific standard of conduct for fair and equitable treatment, that, consistent with the minimum international law standard, requires conduct that amounts \"to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency.\"\n\n6.6.6.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants cannot succeed on their claim of unfair and inequitable treatment because the Tucum\u00e1n authorities acted only in response to serious and persistent contractual breaches by Claimants, and to genuine anger and outrage on the part of Claimants\u2019 customers, who were persistently supplied with poor water, poor service and huge bills, and thus had every reason to be dissatisfied with the services supplied by Claimants. The challenged actions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities were simply necessary responses to the inadequate implementation of Claimants\u2019 contractual obligations in light of the need to secure accessible supplies of water to the population of Tucum\u00e1n.\n\n6.6.7.\n\nEven if Claimants\u2019 four \"component principles\" were relevant factors, Claimants cannot prove that their investment received unfair and inequitable treatment. There was nothing arbitrary about the Tucum\u00e1n authorities' insistence that Claimants comply with their contractual obligations to provide potable water to its customers. There is no evidence of any \"discriminatory\" conduct, *ie,* of similarly situated concessionaires being treated better than Claimants. In Respondent\u2019s view, the Tucum\u00e1n authorities certainly acted transparently, at all times making the need for water quality testing, infrastructure improvements, adequate provisioning of potable water, etc. known to the CAA and to the public. The many warnings given to Claimants certainly comported with due process. To give one example, the Regulator's resolution in respect of the unlawful additional charges for tax levied by Claimants on their customers was based upon an investigation and report by the Attorney General and did not simply emerge from the Regulator without warning.\n\n**No Failure to Provide Protection and Full Security in Violation of Article 5(1) of the BIT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.6.8.\n\nRespondent also contends that the content and scope of the obligation reflected in Article 5(1) are significantly narrower than that Claimants seek and reject Claimants\u2019 view that \"the protection and security required extends beyond physical security, to encompass security against harassment that impairs the normal functioning of the investor's business.\" In any event, the facts of this case do not support a finding of any violation of Article 5(1), on either a \"broad\" or \"narrow\" interpretation of that provision.\n\n6.6.9.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants seek to portray the situation as one in which they were driven to terminate the contract after a concerted campaign against them by the Tucum\u00e1n authorities. In fact, Respondent argues, the Tucum\u00e1n authorities acted in response to Claimants\u2019 serious and persistent contract breaches and to the actions of Claimants\u2019 customers, who revolted against Claimants for their supply of poor water, poor service and unjustifiable tariff increases.\n\n**6.7. Termination of the Concession was Lawful and the Provision of ServicesFollowing Termination does not Amount to Expropriation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.7.1.\n\nRespondent contends that CAA\u2019s purported termination of the Concession Agreement was ineffective both under the terms of the agreement itself and the law. Respondent further contends, however, that CAA\u2019s abandonment of its obligations to provide water service created a grave crisis within the Province, by posing a serious risk to public health, and the Province had to act.\n\n6.7.2.\n\nAccordingly, on 10 September 1997, the Province issued Executive Order No. 2270/1, which terminated the concession based on CAA\u2019s repeated violations of the Concession Agreement and its unlawful attempt to rescind the Concession Agreement.\n\n6.7.3.\n\nClaimants say that, pursuant to Article 15.11 of the Concession Agreement, CAA agreed that it could be required to operate the concession for up to 18 months after termination of the concession for any reason, in the event the Province did not have a replacement. On this basis, Respondent says that the requirement in Order No. 2270/1, which required CAA to continue to provide water and sewage service for 18 months, or until the Province could find a replacement, was lawful.\n\n6.7.4.\n\nRespondent says that the Province acted in accordance with its legitimate governmental responsibility to preserve the provision of water to the population of the Province. Also, by requiring CAA to continue to provide service until a replacement company could be found, Tucum\u00e1n avoided a public health disaster.\n\n6.7.5.\n\nTucum\u00e1n is said to have sought to minimise any burden on CAA, by diligently searching, and organising a bidding process for the appointment of a temporary provider.\n\n6.7.6.\n\nRespondent also contends that the federal government went beyond what was statutorily required when it assumed temporary management of the system, on 7 October 1998, pending identification of a suitable replacement operator, and relieved Claimants of any further operating responsibilities.\n\n6.7.7.\n\nIn these circumstances, Respondent argues that Claimants offer no plausible explanation as to how a decision to enforce a contractual post-termination period of service, coupled with federal assistance designed to release Claimants earlier than contractually required, amounts to expropriation.\n\n**6.8. Most of the Acts Alleged by Claimants do not Involve Actionable StateConduct Under the BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.8.1.\n\nRespondent notes that the dispute between the parties as to Argentina\u2019s responsibility for the actions complained of by Claimants centres largely on the alleged actions of provincial legislators and the Ombudsman. It says that neither of these classes of individuals raises any issue of state responsibility.\n\n6.8.2.\n\nArgentina does not dispute that the ILC Articles represent, in part, an authoritative summary of international law on the issue of attribution of responsibility to a state. However, the general rule is that the only conduct attributed to the state at the international level is that of its organs of government, or of others who have acted under the direction, instigation or control of those organs, *ie,* as agent of the state.\n\n6.8.3.\n\nThus, Respondent points out that, for each person or body for whose actions it is said to be responsible, two questions must be answered:\n\n(i) is it an organ of government?\n\n(ii) alternatively, does it act under the direction, instigation or control of an organ of government, *ie,* as an agent of the state?\n\n6.8.4.\n\nAs regards the acts of individual, mostly opposition, legislators, Respondent points out that the missing link is the notion of \"governmental authority\". Respondent says that individual legislators are not in a position themselves to exercise any authority. They can only channel their electors\u2019 views in hope that those who do exercise authority will take them into account. As the tribunal in the *Salvador Commercial Company* case stated, \"... a state is responsible for the acts of its rulers, whether they belong to the legislative, executive or judicial department of the government, so far as the acts are done in their official capacity\".294 However, in Respondent\u2019s submission, an individual legislator, particularly one from an opposition party, is not \"ruling\" in any sense of the word when he or she expresses the views of constituents. The Respondent points to *Tradex v. Albania,* where the tribunal emphasised the speech of a politician \"was neither a legislative or an executive act\" and accordingly could not contribute to any finding of expropriation.295\n\nUNRIAA, Vol. XV, p. 455 (1902) at \u00b6477.\n\n*Tradex Hellas SA v. Republic of Albania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2), Final Award of 29 April 1999 at \u00b6\u00b6156-7.\n\n6.8.5.\n\nRespondent further says that Claimants improperly ignore the context in which legislators\u2019 speeches were made or actions taken. According to Respondent, the vast majority of the legislators to whom Claimants have referred were members of opposition parties and none of the acts described by Claimants were undertaken on behalf of the Executive. Even those who were members of the ruling party were not members of the Executive itself.\n\n6.8.6.\n\nRespondent also argues that these legislators, regardless of their political affiliation, would not be doing their duty to the people who elected them if they ignored their complaints over matters of public service and health. There was no co-ordinated assault on CAA. The speeches given about CAA were in fact no more than the natural outcome of its conduct relating to the concession and its treatment of its customers and the examples cited by Claimants of the comments and actions of legislators constitute nothing more than evidence of CAA\u2019s own failures in the Province and the unrest and upheaval it caused by its abysmal service and mismanagement of the concession.\n\n6.8.7.\n\nRespondent also says that Claimants cannot attribute statements or actions of the Ombudsman or his office to Argentina because the Ombudsman is neither a state organ nor an agent of the state.\n\n6.8.8.\n\nIn this connection, Respondent relies on the domestic characterisation of the functions of the Ombudsman (considered to be of prime importance in the ILC Articles) as a body opposed to government: it has the role of asserting the rights of the individual. And, although the Ombudsman is organised by and reports to the Legislature, he and his office are fully independent and the Legislature and the Executive cannot exert control over his/its substantive actions.\n\n6.8.9.\n\nRespondent contends that the Ombudsman\u2019s advocacy and scrutiny functions are of a type commonly exercised by non-governmental organisations and, the fact that it is funded by and reports to the Legislature cannot convert its intrinsically non-governmental functions into functions of the state.\n\n6.8.10.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants have the burden of proving that CAA customers did not pay their bills due to the incitement of Tucum\u00e1n officials acting in their official capacity. Claimants cannot meet that burden. The evidence demonstrates, however, that the public unrest in Tucum\u00e1n, including the failure to pay invoices from CAA, resulted from the failure of CAA to meet even minimally acceptable levels of service while immediately doubling tariffs, only to be further compounded by a long string of commercial blunders. In any event, the statements on which Claimants rely were not made by state officials in their official capacity but rather by individual representatives in response to the outrage of their constituents.\n\n**6.9. Claimants\u2019 Request for Damages is Groundless as well as Unsubstantiatedand Unjustified**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.9.1.\n\nRespondent advances five key arguments for the rejection of Claimants\u2019 claim for damages:\n\n(i) the bulk of Claimants\u2019 claim is for lost future profits, but such a claim is not available in the present case because the compensation quantum cannot be established with certainty, and in any event, the doctrine of abuse of rights and the protection of the public interest must also be considered in any determination of lost profits;\n\n(ii) Claimants may not rely on the provisions of the Concession Agreement to calculate their damages. For claims alleging breach of a BIT, damages must be calculated in accordance with the prevailing standards of international law;\n\n(iii) even if it were possible to rely on the provisions of the Concession Agreement to assess damages, the assumptions of profitability, and of a 30-year duration are erroneous and misleading. A 30-year term was not guaranteed, nor was there a guarantee of a certain level of profitability throughout the 30-year period;\n\n(iv) Claimants failed to take into account the economic crisis Argentina endured after the execution of the Concession Agreement. The crisis would have had a huge impact on the profitability of Claimants\u2019 enterprise in Argentina over the period of the concession; and\n\n(v) Claimants wrongly calculate damages using a discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") methodology, but DCF valuation is only proper for a genuine going concern with a proven track record of profitability. Absent these conditions, compensation should be calculated on the basis of the so-called liquidation value method or, if that is not workable, based on \"replacement value\" or \"book value\".\n\n**Claimants Not Entitled to Compensation for Lost Profits**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.9.2.\n\nRespondent says that under general public international law, loss of profits is only exceptionally recoverable and, relying on Article 36 of the ILC Draft on State Responsibility, contends that this is limited to circumstances in which such loss of profits can be \"established\".\n\n6.9.3.\n\nThe availability of lost profits in this type of proceedings is thus limited to cases in which,\n\n(i) the loss is certain (which is not the case here), *ie* there must be no uncertainty or speculation about both the fact that a loss has been suffered and that the quantification is already established. \"Established\" meaning in this context that the amount of damages is certain, unchallengeable and does not the result from speculative calculations; and\n\n(ii) the loss has already been suffered and has already been established at the time of adjudication of the dispute. In other words, there are no remedies available under international law for the loss of profits that the Claimants expected to earn in the period of time after the judgment is rendered, let alone over a 30-year period.\n\n6.9.4.\n\nBased on case law established, *inter alia,* in *Levitt,* and ICSID cases, *Metalclad,* *S.P.P., AAPL* and *Wena,* Respondent also argues that where, as here, the enterprise has not operated for a sufficiently long time to establish a performance record or where it has failed to make a profit, future profits cannot be compensated, or used to determine a going concern or fair market value.296\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b6602-611. citing *Levitt v. Iran,* 14 Iran-US. CI. Trib. Rep. 191, 209-10 (1987); *Metalclad* *Corp v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/97/l), Award of 30 August 2000; *S.P.P. v. Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3), 20 May 1992 32 LL.M. 933 (1993); *Asian Agricultural Products Ltd v. Republic of Sri Lanka* (ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3), Final Award of 27 June 1990 (4 ICSID Reports 246 (1990)); *Wena Hotels Ltd v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Final Award of 8 December 2000.\n\n6.9.5.\n\nRespondent further contends that under the public international law doctrine of abuse of rights, a tribunal may not uphold claims for lost profits where the investment from which they should yield has not yet been made, or has been made only in part, and/or where the award would have a disproportionate impact on a state due to its economic condition. Parties are expected to act in good faith in exercising their rights and where they do not do so, that conduct may be classed as an abuse of rights which limits their ability to recover losses.\n\n6.9.6.\n\nAlthough it is not disputed that some funds were invested by CAA in the concession, Respondent argues that the limited nature of the investment points to an abuse of rights where Claimants\u2019 claim for loss of profit is based upon the level of investment they claim would have been made over the life of the Concession Agreement.\n\n6.9.7.\n\nRespondent points out that claims for lost profits have also failed where the amount of damages for *lucrum cessans* could be disproportionate to the nature, the extent and the circumstances of the breach. Respondent argues claims for lost profits are normally doomed to fail where the injured party's lost profits do not correspond to the benefits that the breaching party gained by failing to perform. In such cases, justice may be served by requiring the breaching party to pay the claimant reliance expenses but not his expected profits.\n\n**No Proper Basis for Claiming Damages on the Assumptions set out in the Concession Agreement**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.9.8.\n\nRespondent contends that the terms of the Concession Agreement cannot supply the relevant measure of damages because Claimants are not entitled to pursue such a claim for breach of contract in these proceedings, thus the relevant measure of damages is provided by reference to international law.\n\n6.9.9.\n\nRespondent describes Claimants\u2019 argument, that the assumptions in the Concession Agreement reveal the \"value of the investment\", as misconceived, for a number of reasons:\n\n(i) whilst the \"agreed upon economic terms and financial assumptions\" of the Concession Agreement may provide some background as to a hypothetical best-case, they are a wholly unrealistic measure by which to ascertain the actual losses which Claimants may have incurred in light of CAA\u2019s failure to perform its obligations under the Concession Agreement and the prior recovery experience of DiPOS.\n\n(ii) there are many factors which would adversely affect the value of the investment (both before and after the date on which the acts alleged to have amounted to expropriation occurred) which are not reflected in the optimum economic terms and financial assumptions underlying the Concession Agreement and upon which Claimants\u2019 lost profits case is based.\n\n(iii) Claimants were fully aware, at the time they undertook the concession, that DiPOS had been unable to achieve a recovery rate in excess of 55%. Claimants were well aware of the difficulties inherent in attempting to privatise the provision of water services in Latin American countries and had, indeed, considered the advisability of introducing tariff increases on a staged basis. This they failed to do in the instant case. Claimants also knew of the risks inherent in operating the concession and these were expressly accepted by Claimants in the terms of the Concession Agreement. These risks necessarily have to be reflected in any award of damages.\n\n(iv) insofar as Claimants\u2019 claim concerns lost profits, events which would have occurred had CAA continued to operate the concession in Tucum\u00e1n, would plainly have had a significant impact on CAA\u2019s profits, and those events must be taken into account in calculating any award of damages on this basis.\n\n(v) in the absence of information demonstrating a consistent history of such investments producing income, it is inappropriate to apply a projection of future performance based on unproven assumptions to try to establish the appropriate measure of damage. The likelihood of profit being made in respect of such investments must be sufficiently certain in order for an award to be made in respect of such profits. In short, for Claimants to rely, without more, on the assumptions underlying the Concession Agreement, is hopelessly to mislead the Tribunal as to the actual value of the assets in question.\n\n**No Profit Guarantee in the Concession Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n6.9.10.\n\nRespondent submits that CAA was not only aware prior to entry into the Concession Agreement of the rate of recovery under the DiPOS regime but it also knew that the minimum recovery rates required for the bid of 85% was and only ever could be an assumption rather than a reflection of what might happen in practice. Indeed, the Concession Agreement expressly provided that the concession was to be operated by reference to the usual principles of business risk. This constitutes a de facto recognition by both parties that profit for the concessionaire was in no way guaranteed.\n\n6.9.11.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s submission, it is entirely inappropriate for Claimants to make a claim based on a measure of damages which ignores the risks which they willingly entertained by entering into the Agreement.\n\n**Claimants\u2019 Claim Fails to Take into Account Argentina\u2019s Economic Crisis**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.9.12.\n\nRespondent points out that the report of Ernst & Young calculates the future cash flow of the Concession as from 1997 without regard of events which have taken place since 1997 in Argentina. These events affected the economy of Argentina to a profound degree, and would inevitably have had a major impact on the cashflow achievable by Claimants in the region in that period and subsequently. In Respondent\u2019s view, no attempt has been made by Claimants to explain the basis for their projections, save for their continuing reliance on the terms of the improved economic offer.\n\n6.9.13.\n\nRespondent says that the projections made by Claimants in the improved economic offer could not in practice have been achieved in the longer term, in the light of the events affecting Argentina's economy in the course of, in particular, 2001 and early 2002. During that period the economy of the whole country was subject to considerable change and adjustment. By way of example only, the peso was devalued in January 2002 and quickly depreciated to a quarter of its previous value, inflation rose to 41% in 2002, unemployment rose from 12.4% in 1998 to 38.3% in 2001 and 23.6% in 2002, the poverty rate reached 57.5% in 2002, inflation-adjusted wages fell 23.7% in 2002, and supermarket sales fell by 5% in 2001 and 26% in 2002.\n\n6.9.14.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants cannot pursue their claim in damages without reference to these matters, which demonstrate that the DCF analysis advanced by Claimants is fatally flawed, as it fails to take into account events which would have affected the performance of the concession in any event.\n\n**CAA\u2019s Concession was not a Going Concern and Was Never Profitable**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.9.15.\n\nAs noted above, Respondent asserts that, in order to recover lost profits damages Claimants must prove that CAA was \"sufficiently certain\" to receive the incomes necessary to achieve the profits they now seek. Respondent says that the evidence on that issue squarely refutes Claimants\u2019 damage claim.\n\n6.9.16.\n\nFirst, it is not disputed that the concession never realised any profit. Respondent argues that, for example, while the bid assumed a collection rate of 85%, CAA never achieved more than 64%.\n\n6.9.17.\n\nAs regards Claimants\u2019 pretence that CAA\u2019s business in Tucum\u00e1n was a longstanding going concern, Respondent submits this is simply wrong. Sewage and water services before and after CAA\u2019s tenure were provided not by a private concessionaire but by the government on a completely different commercial basis and Claimants failed to account for the far-lower collection rates and financial performance that marked those other periods.\n\n6.9.18.\n\nRespondent says that Claimants never established a proven track record that could possibly sustain their lost profits calculations and this fatally precludes recovery of lost profits. As the Tribunal in *Metalclad* explained, where the enterprise has not operated for \"a sufficiently long time to establish a performance record or where it has failed to make a profit\" future profits cannot be ascertained or recovered. Likewise, in the absence of a demonstrated history of profitability, \"future profits cannot be used to determine going concern or fair market value\".297\n\n*Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/l), Award of 30 August 2000, 40 LL.M. 36 (2001), 16 ICSID Rev. - Foreign Inv. L.J.\n\n**No Evidence to Support Claim Argentina\u2019s Conduct Caused the Losses**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.9.19.\n\nRespondent also submits that Claimants have to prove a causal link between the events they complain of and their alleged losses. On the question of causation, Claimants have failed to take account of the factors which adversely affected their business as a result of their own repeated breaches of the Concession Agreement.\n\n6.9.20.\n\nAs to Claimants\u2019 first class of damages *(ie* losses caused by the allegedly forced reduction of tariffs and the depression of the recovery rate), Respondent points to the fact that the tariffs imposed by CAA immediately upon its assumption of the concession were hugely unpopular with the population. There was also considerable confusion and suspicion as a result of the inclusion in its invoices of amounts for taxes which ought not to have been charged. This doubtless contributed to CAA\u2019s poor recovery rates and was entirely attributable to CAA\u2019s own management of the concession, its failings in the provision of services, and not to any actions taken by or on behalf of the Argentine Republic. Respondent also says that the reduction in tariff was effected by Law N\u00b0 6826 on and from 1 May 1997, following a lengthy renegotiation process which granted Claimants three main strategic objectives: a reduction in the service area, a reduction in the concessionaire\u2019s investment requirements and a rate structure based on measurement of actual consumption. Accordingly, there were considerable benefits afforded to CAA by the new law, to which Claimants do not advert and in respect of which no credit has been allowed in their calculation of loss.\n\n6.9.21.\n\nWith respect to Claimants\u2019 claim for the difference in income between that which CAA obtained under the reduced tariff structure and that which it would have obtained under the original Concession Agreement, Respondent says that Claimants\u2019 projected 90% recovery rate was not a contractually-guaranteed minimum backed by some form of indemnity from the Argentine Republic. It was for CAA to effect recoveries on its invoices and non-payment by its customers is not a matter which can or should properly be laid at the door of Argentina.\n\n6.9.22.\n\nAs regards Claimants\u2019 claim for the recovery of the value of the investments CAA made during the operation of the concession, Respondent argues that those investments have not been shown to have been lost by the actions of Argentina. Rather, the evidence demonstrates that CAA invested whilst voluntarily participating in the renegotiation of the Concession Agreement and before it abandoned the concession and its investments.\n\n6.9.23.\n\nAs to the sums claimed relating to CAA\u2019s exposure to third parties, as a result of the termination of the Concession Agreement, these costs arise as a result of CAA having opted, improperly, to terminate the Concession Agreement. Respondent also argues that, pursuant to Article 15.11 of the Concession Agreement, the Province was entitled, in the event of termination, to require Claimants to continue to provide service for a further period of 18 months. Furthermore, CAA was entitled to charge, throughout the period of continued service, as it would have done in the ordinary course. Thus there is no basis on which Claimants can seek damages, in circumstances where the only \"losses\" which CAA may have incurred would have arisen as a result of its failure to secure payment from the customers for its continuing service pending the appointment of a replacement supplier.\n\n6.9.24.\n\nAs to Claimants\u2019 case for lost profits, and quite apart from the significant obstacles to their recovery as a matter of international legal principle, Respondent contends that it is impossible, as a matter of causation, for Claimants to demonstrate, first, that the concession would have been profitable but for the activities the Argentine Republic and, second, had it been profitable, that the profits would have been of the order asserted in the claim.\n\n6.9.25.\n\nOn this point, it is not in disputed that Claimants\u2019 recovery rate, at best, was of the order of 64%, which is in no way comparable to the 89%+ recovery rate which Claimants claim was intended to be realised pursuant to the Concession Agreement. Respondent also emphasises, as previously noted, that Claimants have failed to take into account the economic conditions applicable throughout Argentina, particularly during the crisis in late 2001 and early 2002, which would have affected the profitability of the concession irrespective of any involvement by the Argentine Republic.\n\n6.9.26.\n\nRespondent also says that the DCF model upon which Claimants rely is unsupported by evidence other than the report of Ernst & Young. Respondent argues that the assumptions on which that report is premised are not properly explained or supported on any independently verifiable basis and cannot properly stand as the measure of damage in these circumstances. Respondent further submits that Claimants\u2019 selected discount rate is wholly inappropriate, bearing in mind the events in Argentina since the termination of the Concession Agreement. In particular, Claimants\u2019 reliance on the DCF model set out in a dictum in *Phillips* *Petroleum* is said to be flawed, because this dictum can be distinguished, on its face, from the situation in the present case. According to Respondent, there is no evidence to suggest that CAA\u2019s participation in the concession at any stage produced, or was likely to produce, revenues of the order prescribed in the discounted cash flow model which has been prepared. In order to make a \"careful and realistic appraisal of the revenue-producing potential\" of the concession, the Tribunal would have to take into account CAA\u2019s performance pre-dating the matters complained of in these proceedings. In Respondent\u2019s submission, this would have to be discounted further to take account of Claimants\u2019 own breaches of contract and errors and omissions in performance.\n\n**\"Double Counting\" by Claimants**\n----------------------------------\n\n6.9.27.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants seek to recover damages based in part on the calculation of the financial position in which they would have been had the concession been performed over its full term (via their claims for alleged losses actually suffered in the period of the Concession Agreement and the DCF analysis of future profits), and in part on restitution of the level of investment made by them in the concession prior to its termination (via their claim for restoration of the value of their investment in the Concession).\n\n6.9.28.\n\nRespondent says this is obvious double-counting. Either Claimants seek restitution, or they seek a contractual measure of damages to put them in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed. In Respondent\u2019s submission, Claimants cannot recover on both bases since, had the concession been performed, Claimants\u2019 level of investment in it should have been taken into account in the calculation of its likely profits, and should have been be deducted from those profits to produce a true picture of Claimants\u2019 position had the 30-year term been fulfilled.\n\n**Alternative Method of Calculating Damages**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n6.9.29.\n\nFinally, and in the alternative, Respondent submits that if Claimants succeed in establishing any liability in these proceedings, the Tribunal should, after taking into account the points made above as to the likelihood that Claimants\u2019 investment would ever in reality have yielded a profit, take as its starting point for any award of damages, the book value of CAA\u2019s assets, or the value of Claimants\u2019 actual investment.\n\n**Damages must be Calculated in Pesos**\n---------------------------------------\n\n6.9.30.\n\nIn the event the Tribunal decides an award of damages should be made, Respondent argues that would be inappropriate for such damages to be calculated or awarded in US dollars. According to Respondent, there is no basis on which Claimants can assert a right to be reimbursed in US dollars under the Concession Agreement (on which they rely for all other purposes where the terms of the Concession Agreement are favourable to Claimants\u2019 position) which was expressed to be in Argentine pesos. Respondent further argues that any profits in respect of the performance of the Concession Agreement would have been paid to Claimants in Argentine pesos.\n\n**Failure to Mitigate**\n-----------------------\n\n6.9.31.\n\nRespondent also argues that Claimants failed to mitigate the losses which they claim flowed from the Argentine Republic\u2019s alleged Treaty breaches. Respondent says that the most obvious way Claimants might have mitigated their losses would have been for CAA to remain as concessionaire and to charge consumers on the basis of the provisions of Law No. 6826. Although the rates recoverable under Law No. 6826 were below those allowed under the Concession Agreement, they would have served to offset Claimants\u2019 claims for loss of future earnings pending a determination by the appropriate tribunal of Claimants\u2019 entitlements. Having chosen not to proceed in that way, Claimants\u2019 failure to mitigate ought to be taken into account by the Tribunal in any calculation of an appropriate award of damages.\n\n6.9.32.\n\nRespondent emphasises CAA also waited until 2001 to bring proceedings against customers who failed to pay its 1995, 1996 and 1997 invoices. Such delay obviously increased the risk that recovery would not be realised from those users. CAA\u2019s delay in taking such steps should also be taken into account in calculating any award of damages which the Tribunal may make.\n\n**Deduction for Amounts Attributable to Tax**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n6.9.33.\n\nAs regards Claimants\u2019 claims based on taxes to be paid to the Argentine Republic, if the Tribunal finds that such amounts are recoverable by Claimants pursuant to the Treaty, Respondent submits that these sums must be offset against any other damages payable to Claimants.\n\n**Deduction for Status of Ownership as at Date of Loss**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.9.34.\n\nFinally, Respondent points out that the claim as formulated by Claimants in their pleadings is premised entirely upon CAA\u2019s alleged losses. No attempt has been made to identify the losses of CGE as shareholder.\n\n6.9.35.\n\nMoreover, as to CGE\u2019s claim as an investor, Respondent argues that CGE cannot recover any losses other than those which it has suffered as a shareholder of CAA and that any such claim should be restricted to its original 36% shareholding in CAA.\n\n**6.10. Provincial and Municipal Taxes in CAA\u2019s Invoices**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.10.1.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimants argue that Tucum\u00e1n \"used its regulatory authority to compel CAA to stop invoicing customers for certain taxes.\" This complaint arises out of the Regulator\u2019s Resolution N\u00b0 170, passed on 9 February 1996, which required CAA not to invoice customers for amounts relating to certain provincial and municipal taxes.\n\n**6.11. Tariff Increases in Years Two and Three of the Concession Agreement**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.11.1.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimants also base their expropriation claim on their own agreement with the Tucum\u00e1n authorities during the renegotiation process to suspend provisions of the Concession Agreement that purportedly entitled CAA to increase tariffs by 10% in years two and three of Concession. It is Respondent\u2019s position that this contention is frankly unfathomable.\n\n6.11.2.\n\nRespondent submits that the agreement was entered into voluntarily by CAA with full knowledge that the ongoing renegotiation was considering an entirely different tariff structure, including a proposal based rates on actual customer consumption.\n\n6.11.3.\n\nRespondent contends that on the other hand, the Concession Agreement did not provide Claimants with any right to increase tariffs by 10% in years two and three. The Concession Agreement expressly provided that the tariffs set out in Article 12.1 were maximum and that Claimants would not be permitted to increase tariffs during the first ten years. Provisions addressing tariff review concerned tariff reductions where Claimants were not making the required level of investment. Thus, Claimants had no right to the 10% tariff increase, reference of which is made in their written submissions, which could have been expropriated.\n\n6.11.4.\n\nIn this respect, Respondent argues that the Tucum\u00e1n authorities\u2019 regulation of Claimants\u2019 user charges and other aspects of its business did not constitute expropriation since this regulation was a legitimate - indeed, mandatory -exercise of the Province\u2019s valid power to regulate in the public interest. The state has the responsibility to legislate and regulate to protect public health, including the provision of adequate and accessible potable water. A measure which is regarded as essential to the efficient functioning of the state cannot be expropriatory in character. And it should not be the function of international law to insulate the foreign investor from the regulatory regime of the host state\u2019s laws.\n\n6.11.5.\n\nThus, it is Respondent\u2019s position that regulatory measures that are for a public purpose, are non-discriminatory and are enacted in accordance with due process do not amount, under international law, to expropriation.\n\n6.11.6.\n\nWith respect to Claimants\u2019 argument that the Tucum\u00e1n authorities bear responsibility for events not attributable to any regulatory or administrative or public act on the part of those authorities but which Claimants contend resulted in their loss of \"reasonably expected economic benefits\", Respondent contends that it is without foundation in law or fact.\n\n**6.12. Tucum\u00e1n Authorities Cannot be Liable for any Losses not Resulting from Administrative or Regulatory Acts**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.12.1.\n\nRespondent observes that Claimants contend that their \"reasonably expected economic benefits\" were expropriated.\n\n6.12.2.\n\nRespondent also argues that Claimants have completely failed to demonstrate that the consequences which they allege flow from the conduct of the Argentine Republic in this regard are causative of the losses which they claim. According to Respondent, it is apparent from the foregoing that Claimants\u2019 losses arising from the initial period during which they held the Concession were as a result of their failure to fulfill their obligations pursuant to the Concession in respect of the provision of satisfactory services to the people of Tucum\u00e1n, and not as a result of any step taken by the Argentine Republic.\n\n**6.13. Litigation Costs and Expenses**\n---------------------------------------\n\n6.13.1.\n\nRespondent sought reimbursement of its litigation costs and expenses. Respondent filed its submission on costs on 29 September 2006. Respondent sought US$1,151,119.35, including US$355,000 on account of its payments to ICSID, but included no claim for the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings.\n\n**7. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS OF AND CONCLUSIONS ON THEISSUES**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**7.1. Introduction**\n---------------------\n\n7.1.1.\n\nMany of the relevant factual issues and legal arguments pertaining to the parties\u2019 claims and defences are the same or overlap. Nonetheless, it is convenient to consider the principal claims and defences separately in light of the factual findings already made by the Tribunal in this Award. It is appropriate to start with the Argentine Republic\u2019s contention that, in the proper exercise of its jurisdiction, the Tribunal must dismiss CAA\u2019s claim by reason of it having acquired its treaty rights in violation of the terms of the Concession Agreement. We then turn to the overarching issue put in play by Respondent - the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional scope, in assessing a possible Treaty breach, to consider whether disputing parties breached the Concession Agreement - before dealing with the substantive case advanced by Claimants under Articles 3 and 5 of the Treaty. Questions of causation and damages are dealt with thereafter.\n\n**7.2. Whether CAA is a Proper Claimant?**\n------------------------------------------\n\n7.2.1.\n\nRelying on the Decision on Annulment, Respondent points out that CGE only became a controlling shareholder of CAA in June 1996, when CGE increased its stake in CAA to 85%. In these circumstances, the Argentine Republic asserts that CGE acquired its controlling stake contrary to the expressed terms of the Concession Agreement which, at Article 2.3.2 provides that:\n\n*\"...at least FIFTY-ONE PERCENT (51 %) of the voting corporate capital, excluding the TEN PERCENT (10%) set forth in Section 2.3.3 hereof, shall be composed of registered stock*  *and ownership thereto shall not be transferred during the term of this concession without prior express consent given by the Executive Branch* \" (emphasis added).\n\n7.2.2.\n\nBecause the Executive did not consent to the transfer of the ownership of CAA\u2019s shares which led to CGE\u2019s 85% stake, CAA acquired the right to pursue its BIT claim only through an express violation of the terms of the Concession Agreement. In these circumstances, Respondent says that CAA\u2019s claim should be dismissed, having been brought in bad faith. Respondent concludes that, for fundamental policy reasons, CAA ought not to be permitted to pursue a claim for treaty rights which it acquired illegitimately.\n\n7.2.3.\n\nThe Argentine Republic seeks to distinguish this, its first argument, from its earlier, unsuccessful assertion that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction. Thus, for the avoidance of doubt, it accepts that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine CAA\u2019s claim, but contends that, in the proper exercise of that jurisdiction, CAA\u2019s claim must be dismissed because it has been brought in bad faith.\n\n7.2.4.\n\nTo the Tribunal\u2019s mind, Respondent\u2019s current argument seeks to re-litigate issues of jurisdiction, on this occasion in the guise of an objection to admissibility, that have been heard and rejected in the course of the determination of its jurisdictional objections.\n\n7.2.5.\n\nTo the extent that this is so, our Decision on Jurisdiction disposes of the question. There we found that the First Tribunal\u2019s summary of the history of CAA\u2019s equity ownership disclosed that a majority of CAA\u2019s equity was under French ownership well before the parties consented to submit this dispute to arbitration, originally, on 26 December 1996 and that the *ad hoc* Committee endorsed the First Tribunal\u2019s finding that CAA was a French company under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.298 In these circumstances, we concluded that,\n\n*\"because the first Tribunal found that CAA was a French company under the ICSID Convention and the BIT and the ad hoc Committee did not annul this finding, the finding remains in force and is res judicata. \"299*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction at \u00b6 96.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction at \u00b6 97.\n\n7.2.6.\n\nIn any event, Respondent\u2019s proposition that CGE required its majority shareholding in violation of the Concession Agreement, because the Province did not consent to this share transfer, is wrong. The Concession Agreement required the Province\u2019s prior consent only to share transfers involving 51% of CAA\u2019s shares. As was explained in Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, the share increases acquired by CAA were either approved by the Province, were outside the 51% over which the Province had authority, or were acquired after the termination of the Concession Agreement and its authorisation requirement.\n\n7.2.7.\n\nCAA was established as an Argentine company on 17 May 1995 with 30 million equity shares divided amongst four shareholders. CGE initially held 36% of the shares. CGE consortium partners DYCASA, a Spanish company, Roggio, an Argentine company, each initially held 27% of the shares. The remaining 10% was set aside for former DiPOS employees who worked for CAA.300\n\nFirst Award at N.6.\n\n7.2.8.\n\nThe transfer of CAA\u2019s shares was limited in several ways while the Concession Agreement was in effect. Most importantly, 51% of the voting shares could only be divested with prior approval of the Tucum\u00e1n Executive.301 Also, the operator (CGE) had to maintain an ownership interest of 25% of the voting shares and could not divest those shares without prior approval of the Tucum\u00e1n Executive,302 and DYCASA and Roggio each had to maintain a 13% interest.303\n\nConcesi\u00f3n del Servicio de Agua y Desag\u00fces Cloacales en la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n: Pliego de Bases y Condiciones Generales para la Licitaci\u00f3n (Bid Conditions), with Annexes, 10 May 1994 (Exhibit 115) at Articles 5.2.3, 5.2.4.\n\nConcesi\u00f3n del Servicio de Agua y Desag\u00fces Cloacales en la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n: Pliego de Bases y Condiciones Generales para la Licitaci\u00f3n (Bid Conditions), with Annexes, 10 May 1994 (Exhibit 115) at Article 5.2.3; and Concesi\u00f3n del Servicio de Agua y Desag\u00fces Cloacales en la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n, Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n (Concession Agreement), with Annexes XIV, XX-XXIII, 18 May 1995 (Exhibit 127), at Articles 2.3.1, 2.3.2.\n\nSee CAA Acta Constitutiva y Estatutos Sociales (Exhibit 356) at Clause 12.\n\n7.2.9.\n\nIn January 1996, Roggio transferred all of its shares to its partners. Because Roggio thus transferred some shares (13%) that were subject to the restrictions on transferability, Executive approval was sought for the restricted part of the transaction. The Tucum\u00e1n Executive authorised that transfer under Decree 270/3.304 Following this transaction CGE and DYCASA each held 45% of CAA\u2019s equity (13.5 million shares each).\n\nSee Decree No. 270/3, 5 December 1995 (Exhibit 357).\n\n7.2.10.\n\nOn 26 March 1996, DYCASA entered into an agreement with CGE to sell to CGE 12 million shares, representing 40% of all CAA\u2019s shares.305 While the transfer of title for the shares was to occur later, in two stages, the sale agreement provided that CGE would immediately enjoy the share\u2019s voting rights thus making CGE their beneficial owner.\n\nSee Agreement between DYCASA and CGE, 26 March 1996 (Exhibit 258) at Clause Cl.\n\n7.2.11.\n\nOn 19 June 1996, pursuant to this agreement, DYCASA transferred to CGE seven million *unrestricted* shares representing 23.33% of CAA stock. Although no Executive authorisation was required for the transfer of such shares, DYCASA and CGE notified Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s Governor Bussi of the transaction on the same date. The Executive never registered any objection. As a result of this transfer of *unrestricted* shares, CGE held a 68.33% stake in CAA. Thus, as of 19 June 1996 CGE held the majority of CAA stock.\n\n7.2.12.\n\nIn addition, also on 19 June 1996, the parties sought Executive approval for the transfer to CGE of title to five million *restricted* shares, representing 16.67% of CAA\u2019s stock.306 The Executive never responded to the request; thus authorisation was never granted. Nevertheless, under the terms of the March 1996 agreement, CGE became and remained the beneficial owner of those five million shares.307\n\nSee letter from DYCASA and CGE to Governor Bussi, Request for Authorization, 19 June 1996 (Exhibit 360).\n\nSee First Award at N.6 (stating that, by June 1966, CAA had \"acquired beneficial ownership of additional 16.67% of the equity capital of CAA\").\n\n7.2.13.\n\nOn 8 October 1998, the parties completed the transfer of the five million shares.308 Executive authorisation was not required at this point as the restrictions on transfer were removed with the termination of the Concession Agreement in late 1997. CGE thus became the *de jure* owner of 85% of CAA\u2019s equity. Also, as held in our Decision on Jurisdiction, CGE\u2019s successor, Vivendi, now holds the title to these shares.309\n\nSee CAA Register of Shares (Exhibit 348).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction at \u00b683.\n\n7.2.14.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal finds there to be no basis for Respondent\u2019s contention that CAA\u2019s claim should be dismissed because it has been brought in bad faith.\n\n**7.3. Tribunal\u2019s Scope to Consider Alleged Breaches of Contract**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.3.1.\n\nIn various ways and at various times over the course of these proceedings the Argentine Republic has sought to limit the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of the Concession Agreement *(ie* the interpretation of the Concession Agreement and any assessment of whether the provincial authorities have acted in breach of its provisions). In its Counter-Memorial, Respondent notes that:\n\n*\" in order to determine if Argentina breached the standards contained in the BIT, the Tribunal must apply Argentine law in general, and the law regulating the Concession Agreement in particular,*  *taking into account that this Tribunal cannot grant any relief arising from alleged violations to the Concession Agreement.* *\"310* (emphasis added)\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6 421.\n\n7.3.2.\n\nRespondent further asserts that:\n\n\" *... the existence of a forum selection clause prevents the Tribunal from deciding the meaning of the contract,* *not only because of the express provisions in the contract, but because doing so would otherwise violate the principle of mutuality,*...\"311 (emphasis added)\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6 436.\n\n7.3.3.\n\nThis thesis was developed further during the course of the oral hearing and in Respondent\u2019s post-hearing submissions. There, counsel for the Argentine Republic construed the provisions of Article 16.4 of the Concession Agreement as preventing the Tribunal from interpreting or applying the contract.312 Further, it was said to be impermissible in law for this Tribunal to determine whether:\n\n*\" there have or have not been breaches of the contract because we say such a finding is expressly reserved by the parties to the Courts of Tucum\u00e1n themselves. \"313*\n\n*\" on our analysis you do not have jurisdiction to decide whether CAA or Argentina did, in fact, breach the contract. \"314*\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 11, at pages 2921-2933 (4 August 2006).\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 11, at page 2929, lines 3-11 (4 August 2006).\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 11, at page 2928, lines 6-8 (4 August 2006).\n\n7.3.4.\n\nAgainst these assertions, Respondent accepted that the Concession Agreement could not be considered irrelevant to the Tribunal\u2019s determination of the case. And while Article 16.4 is said to prevent the Tribunal from interpreting or applying the contract, Respondent accepts that it does not require the Tribunal to ignore factual matters related to the contract. For the Tribunal to explore the case in any meaningful way it was conceded that the contractual background is required to be taken into account. Thus, Argentina\u2019s case, that the Tucum\u00e1n authorities acted as they did in response to what they responsibly and in good faith considered to be CAA\u2019s contractual breaches, is a proper matter for assessment in determining whether the acts of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities were reasonable in light of their views that breaches of the contract had occurred.\n\n7.3.5.\n\nFrom Claimants\u2019 perspective, in seeking to limit the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of the Concession Agreement in this way, Respondent sought to revive its earlier arguments - rejected by the Original Tribunal in the first proceedings, by the *ad hoc* Committee and by this Tribunal - that characterised Claimants\u2019 case as comprised of claims for contractual breaches thus allowing it to escape scrutiny under the Treaty. They contend that any suggestion that the forum selection clause prevents the Tribunal from deciding the meaning of the contract and whether a violation or series of violations of the contract amounted to an expropriation, or to unfair and inequitable treatment, flies in the face of the prior decision in this case which confirm that the Tribunal may - indeed, even must, or risk annulment - consider and decide such contractual issues as are necessary to adjudicate Claimants\u2019 Treaty claims.\n\n7.3.6.\n\nIn its award, the First Tribunal reasoned that in order to determine whether the Argentine government was liable under the Treaty, it would have to \"... undertake a detailed interpretation and application of the concession contract\".315 The First Tribunal also concluded that it was impossible to separate potential breaches of contract claims from BIT violations without interpreting and applying the concession contract.316 But this - that is, interpreting and applying the concession contract - the First Tribunal decided it could not do, because that task was assigned expressly to the local courts. It therefore concluded that it was \"... not possible to determine which actions of the Province were taken in exercise of its sovereign authority and which in the exercise of its rights as a party to the concession contract.\"317\n\nFirst Award at \u00b6 79.\n\nFirst Award at \u00b6 81.\n\nFirst Award at \u00b6 79.\n\n7.3.7.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee came to the opposite conclusion. It disagreed with the First Tribunal\u2019s finding that it was impossible to decide the Treaty claims because to do so would require the Tribunal to interpret and apply the concession contract. It went on to hold that \"the Tribunal had jurisdiction to base its decision upon the Concession Contract\", at least \"so far as necessary in order to determine whether there had been a breach of the substantive standards of the BIT\".318\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b6110.\n\n7.3.8.\n\nWithout, at this stage considering whether or not acts or omissions of the provincial authorities may have constituted a breach of the Concession Agreement, the Tribunal does not accept the limitation proposed by Respondent on its ability to ascertain whether a Treaty breach may have occurred as a result of or having regard, *inter alia,* to breaches (by either of the parties) of the Concession Agreement.\n\n7.3.9.\n\nThis is because, in the forum selection clause of the Concession Agreement, the parties submit themselves to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Administrative Courts of Tucum\u00e1n *only* \"for purposes of *interpretation and application* of this contract\".319 (emphasis added) The use of the conjunctive in this clause leaves it open to the Tribunal, should it feel it necessary for its analysis of Treaty breach, to interpret the Concession Agreement and come to a view as to whether either of the parties failed to live up to its terms. In doing so, the Tribunal would not be *applying* the contract by deciding a contractual issue, determining the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations or granting relief under the agreement. It would be doing no more than the Respondent concedes is its right - *ie,* taking the contractual background into account in determining whether or not a breach of the Treaty has occurred.\n\nConcesi\u00f3n del Servicio de Agua y Desag\u00fces Cloacales en la Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n, Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n (Concession Agreement), with Annexes XIV, XX-XXIII, 18 May 1995 (Exhibit 127), Article 16.4.\n\n7.3.10.\n\nWhether there is a breach of contract or a breach of the Treaty involves two different inquiries. Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT do not relate to breach of a municipal contract. Rather, they set an independent standard. A state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract; it may also breach a treaty at the same time it breaches a contract. And, in the latter case it is permissible for the Tribunal to consider such alleged contractual breaches, not for the purpose of determining whether a party has incurred liability under domestic law, but to the extent necessary to analyse and determine whether there has been a breach of the Treaty. In doing so, the Tribunal would in no way be exercising jurisdiction over the contract, it would simply be taking into account the parties behaviour under and in relation to the terms of the contract in determining whether there has been a breach of a distinct standard of international law, as reflected in Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT.\n\n7.3.11.\n\nAll of this being said, in reaching our conclusions below, we do not consider it necessary to come to a definitive view as to whether either party has or has not breached the Concession Agreement.320\n\nClaimants accept that, in the early days of its operations and prior to the joint ERSACT/CAA Sub Committee on Water Quality recommended variations to the water quality control programme set out in the contract, CAA did not perform every test required under the Concession Agreement.\n\n**7.4. Fair and Equitable Treatment - Article 3**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n7.4.1.\n\nAs noted above, the disputing parties differ as to the content and scope of the fair and equitable treatment obligation expressed in Article 3 of the Treaty. Article 3 provides:\n\n*\"Each of the Contracting Parties undertakes to grant, within its territory and its maritime area, fair and equitable treatment according to the principles of international law to investments made by investors of the other Party, and to do it in such a way that the exercise of the right thus recognized is not obstructed de jure or de facto. \"*\n\n7.4.2.\n\nIt was undisputed that the BIT is a treaty. It is thus to be interpreted in accordance with the international law rules of interpretation reflected in Article 31 (1) of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"Vienna Convention\") *ie* \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose\".\n\n7.4.3.\n\nAs was noted by the tribunal in *Methanex*,321 Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention is comprised of three separate principles. The first, good faith, requires no further explanation. As to the second, interpretation in accordance with the ordinary meaning of a term, scholars have noted that this is not merely a semantic exercise in uncovering the literal meaning of a term.322 As to the third, the term is not to be examined in isolation or *in abstract/),* but in the context of the treaty and in the light of its object and purpose. One result of this third general principle is that, as noted by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in *The MOXPlant Case* (as also applied in the *OSPAR Case)',* \"the application of international rules on interpretation of treaties to identical or similar provisions of different treaties may not yield the same results, having regard to, *inter alia,* differences in their respective contexts, objects and purposes, subsequent practice of parties and *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires\".323*\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America,* Final Award of the Tribunal on Jurisdiction and Merits, 3 August 2005 (UNCITRAL).\n\nSee *eg* Sinclair, *The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,* 2 ed., 1984, p. 121. *Bin Cheng, General* *Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals,* 1953, p. 114.\n\n*The MOX Plant Case (Irelandv. UnitedKingdom),* Order on Provisional Measures, 3 December 2001, 51, 41 ILM 405 at 413 quoted in *Access to Information Under Article 9 of the OSPAR Convention (Ireland v. United Kingdom),* 41, 42 ILM 1118 at 1144.\n\n7.4.4.\n\nAs to the object and purpose of the BIT, the Tribunal notes the parties\u2019 wish, as stated in the preamble, for the Treaty to create favourable conditions for French investments in Argentina, and *vice versa,* and their conviction that the protection and promotion of such investments is expected to encourage technology and capital transfers between both countries and to promote their economic development. In interpreting the BIT, we are thus mindful of these objectives. The provisions of Article 2 also provides context for the interpretation of Articles 3 and 5. Article 2 provides:\n\n*\"each of the Contracting Parties shall admit and*  *promote*  *within the framework of its laws and the provisions of this agreement,*  *all investments made by investors of the other Party in its territory* *and its maritime area \".* (emphasis added)\n\n7.4.5.\n\nDealing first with Respondent\u2019s argument that the fair and equitable treatment is limited to and to be weighed against the so-called minimum standard of treatment under international law, the Tribunal concludes that there is no basis for such a limitation and that such an interpretation runs counter to the ordinary meaning of the text of Article 3.\n\n7.4.6.\n\nArticle 3 refers to fair and equitable treatment *in conformity* with the principles of international law, and not to the minimum standard of treatment. The French and Spanish text of the Treaty support this proposition. The French text reads \"un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable, conform\u00e9ment aux principes du Droit International\". The Spanish text refers to \"un tratamiento justo y equitativo, conforme a los principios de derecho internacional\".\n\n7.4.7.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no basis for equating principles of international law with the minimum standard of treatment. First, the reference to principles of international law supports a broader reading that invites consideration of a wider range of international law principles than the minimum standard alone. Second, the wording of Article 3 requires that the fair and equitable treatment *conform* to the principles of international law, but the requirement for conformity can just as readily set a floor as a ceiling on the Treaty\u2019s fair and equitable treatment standard.324 Third, the language of the provision suggests that one should also look to contemporary principles of international law, not only to principles from almost a century ago.325\n\n*American Manufacturing & Trading, Inc. (AMT) v. Democratic Republic of Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1), Award of 21 February 1997, reprinted in 36 ILM 1531 (1997); and.l/cw *Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A. S. Baltoil v. The Republic of Estonia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2), Award of 25 June 2001, at \u00b6367. The floor-not-a-ceiling principle was also recently accepted by the *Azurix* Tribunal: *Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Award of 14 July 2006, at \u00b6361.\n\nAny suggestion that the minimum standard remains effectively unchanged since the 1926 *Neer Claim* (Mexico-U.S. General Claims Commission, Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Vol. IV, p. 60 (1926)) is not supportable. Indeed, NAFTA cases that preceded the Free Trade Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Chapter Eleven F&ET provision, (eg *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada,* NAFTA Arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Award of 13 November 2000, and *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. The Government of Canada,* Arbitration under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (UNCITRAL (NAFTA)), affirm that the minimum standard has evolved significantly beyond *Neer.* Also, *the ADF Group* Tribunal held that the minimum standard is not a static photograph dated 1927 *(**ADF Group, Inc. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/l), (2003), 6 ICSID Reports 470 at \u00b6179), and the Tribunal in *Mondev* held that the content of the minimum standard today cannot be limited to the content of customary international law as recognised in arbitral decisions in the 1920\u2019s. It added that, to the modem eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with outrageous or egregious: *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award of 11 October 2002, 42 LL.M. 85 (2003), 6 ICSID Reports 192, at \u00b6116.\n\n7.4.8.\n\nAs Dr. F.A. Mann, one of the twentieth century\u2019s leading authorities on the interaction between municipal law and public international law wrote in 1981:\n\n*\"the terms \u2018fair and equitable treatment \u2019 envisage conduct which goes far beyond the minimum standard and afford protection to a greater extent and according to a much more objective standard than any previously employed form of words. A Tribunal would not be concerned with a minimum, maximum or average standard. It will have to decide whether in all circumstances the conduct in issue is fair and equitable or unfair and inequitable. No standard defined by any other words is likely to be material. The terms are to be understood and implied independently and autonomously \".326*\n\nF.A. Mann, *British Treaties for the Promotion and Protection of Investments,* 52 BRIT. YB Int\u2019l L. 241, 244 (1981).\n\n7.4.9.\n\nDr. Mann\u2019s conclusions have been echoed by others.327 Like Dr. Mann, an UNCTAD Report on Fair and Equitable Treatment concluded that \"where the fair and equitable standard is invoked, the central issue remains simply whether the actions in question are in all the circumstances fair and equitable or unfair and inequitable\".328 Stephen Vascianne reached the same conclusion in his extensive study of the concept of fair and equitable treatment.329\n\nSee *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of 12 May 2005, \u00b6284; *Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Award of 14 July 2006, at \u00b6361; *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed SA. v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2), Award of 29 May 2003 (Spain/Mexico BIT). See also UNCTAD, *Fair and Equitable Treatment* 40 (UNCTAD Series on Issues in Int\u2019l Investment Agreements) (1999).\n\nUNCTAD, *Fair and Equitable Treatment* 40 (UNCTAD Series on Issues in Int\u2019l Investment Agreements) (1999).\n\nStephen Vascianne, *The Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in International Investment Law and Practice,* 70 BRIT. Y.B. Int\u2019l L 99, 144 (1999). (\"Following Mann, where the fair and equitable treatment standard is invoked, the central question remains simply whether the actions in question are in all of the circumstances fair and equitable or unfair and inequitable.\")\n\n7.4.10.\n\nTo the extent that Respondent contends that the fair and equitable treatment obligation constrains government conduct only if and when the state\u2019s courts cannot deliver justice, this appears to conflate the legal concepts of fair and equitable treatment on the one hand with the denial of justice on the other.\n\n7.4.11.\n\nBut if this Tribunal were to restrict the claims of unfair and equitable treatment to circumstances in which Claimants have also established a denial of justice, it would eviscerate the fair and equitable treatment standard. Although the standard is commonly understood to include a prohibition on denial of justice, it would be significantly diminished if it were limited to claims for denial of justice.\n\n7.4.12.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s argument that Claimants\u2019 so-called component principles (described at 5.2.3 above, and following) are misconceived, being unsupported by authority, the difference between the parties may be more one of labelling rather than of substance. Significantly the parties find common ground in acceptance of the proposition that, in assessing whether the standard has been transgressed, a tribunal must determine whether, in all of the circumstances of the particular case, the conduct properly attributable to the state has been fair and equitable, or unfair and inequitable. That this is an objective standard was recognised recently by the *CMS* tribunal which noted that it was \"unrelated to whether the Respondent has had any deliberate intention or bad faith in adopting the measures in question. Of course, such intention and bad faith can aggravate the situation but are not an essential element of the standard.\"330 However, before turning to the assessment of Respondents\u2019 conduct against this standard, we deal with Respondent\u2019s arguments concerning the interpretation of Article 5(1)\u2019 s provision concerning protection and full security.\n\n*CMS Gas Transportation Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICISD Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of 12 May 2005, \u00b6280.\n\n**Protection and Full Security - Article 5(1)**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n7.4.13.\n\nIn their Memorial, Claimants assert that the Tucum\u00e1n authorities\u2019 actions deprived Vivendi / CAA of fair and equitable treatment in the form of protection and full security, as the last component of fair and equitable treatment arguments.331 Article 5(1) of the Treaty - guarantees that \"... investments... shall enjoy... protection and full security in accordance with the principle of fair and equitable treatment referred to in Article 3 of this Agreement.\" In brief, Claimants say that this treaty provision extends beyond physical security, and encompasses what may be described as a general obligation of a host state proactively to provide security against harassment that impairs the normal functioning of an investor\u2019s business.\n\nMemorial, IV ARGUMENTS ON THE MERITS, A. Section 6 at \u00b6 320 et seq.\n\n7.4.14.\n\nFor its part, the Argentine Republic argues that Claimants have no viable authority to support the proposition that the principle of protection and full security imposes a general duty to ensure a stable and predictable business or fiscal environment. Rather the case law on this standard has consistently limited its applicability to \"physical interferences\".\n\n7.4.15.\n\nAs to these competing positions, the Tribunal notes that the text of Article 5(1) does not limit the obligation to providing reasonable protection and security from \"physical interferences\", as Respondent argues. If the parties to the BIT had intended to limit the obligation to \"physical interferences\", they could have done so by including words to that effect in the section. In the absence of such words of limitation, the scope of the Article 5(1) protection should be interpreted to apply to reach any act or measure which deprives an investor\u2019s investment of protection and full security, providing, in accordance with the Treaty\u2019s specific wording, the act or measure also constitutes unfair and inequitable treatment. Such actions or measures need not threaten physical possession or the legally protected terms of operation of the investment.\n\n7.4.16.\n\nThis interpretation is consistent with the decisions of recent international tribunals. The *CME* tribunal interpreted the \"full security and protection\" clause in the Czech Republic - Netherlands BIT as obligating the host state \"to ensure that neither by amendment of its laws nor by actions of its administrative bodies is the agreed and approved security and protection of the foreign investor\u2019s investment withdrawn or devalued\".332 In *Ceskoslovenska ObchodniBanka A.S. v. The Slovak Republic,* the tribunal found that respondent\u2019s denial of CSOB\u2019s right to receive payment on a loan effectively guaranteed by the Slovak Republic \"would deprive CSOB from any meaningful protection for its loan and thus breach the Slovak Republic\u2019s commitment to let CSOB enjoy \u2018full protection and security\u2019... \"333 And the *Azurix* tribunal found that the inter-relationship of the two standards (fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security) \"indicates that full protection and security may be breached even if no physical violence or damage occurs as it (sic) was the case in *Occidental v. Ecuador \"334*\n\n*CME Czech Republic B. V. (The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic,* Partial Award of 13 September 2001 (UNCITRAL), at \u00b6613.\n\n*Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka A.S. v.

The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award of 14 July 2006, at \u00b6406.\n\n7.4.17.\n\nBy contrast, the cases cited by Respondent do not limit the protection and full security standard to protection from violence or outright seizure of property. In the *Case Concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A (\"ELSI\")335* although the US claim was based principally on a physical occupation, nowhere in the judgement, contrary to Respondent\u2019s contention, does the Court interpret the full protection and security obligation as limited to such circumstances. The United States also argued that a 16-month delay in obtaining a ruling on its appeal violated Italy\u2019s duty to provide full protection and security. If the protection and full security standard applied only to circumstances of physical occupation, the Court can be expected to have said so explicitly and dismissed the US claim on that basis. Instead, after examining the factual basis for the US position, it concluded that. [I]t must be doubted whether *in all the circumstances,* the delay in the Prefect\u2019s ruling in this case can be regarded as falling below [the] standard.\" (emphasis added)336 In *Wena Hotels,* the Tribunal found a breach of the full protection and security obligation where the respondent permitted the physical occupation of the claimants\u2019 property, but, as in *ELSI,* the tribunal did not interpret the obligation as limited to those circumstances.337 In *Rankin,* the tribunal held that statements of the Iranian revolutionary leaders were \"inconsistent with the requirements of the Treaty of Amity and customary international law to accord protection and security\" because they could have reasonably been expected to initiate \"harassment\", *as well as,* \"violence\" against foreigners and their property.338 Similarly, in *Eureko v. Poland,* although the tribunal had concluded that the respondent had not breached its obligation, it indicated that it might have reached a different conclusion if there had been \"clear evidence\" that the respondent \"was the author or instigator of the actions in question\". It added that if the actions of harassment \"were to be repeated and sustained, it may well be that the responsibility of the [respondent] would be incurred by failure to prevent them\".339 Thus protection and full security (sometimes full protection and security) can apply to more than physical security of an investor or its property, because either could be subject to harassment without being physically harmed or seized.\n\n*Case Concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A.* (United States of America v.

In truth, a veritable chorus was formed, where legislators, journalists, politicians and leaders from civil society competed to be perceived as the most virulent.\"340*\n\nCase Study, April 2001 - Concession for the Potable Water and Sewerage Services in Tucum\u00e1n, Argentine Republic, by Jorge Carlos Rais, Maria Esther Esquivel, Sergio Sour, Consultants (Exhibit 858), at \u00b647.\n\n7.4.21.\n\nThat this campaign had nothing to do with CAA\u2019s initial operation of the concession (or its alleged, or minor admitted, breaches of the Concession Agreement) is clear. Before taking office, the new Governor stated repeatedly he would not respect appointments made by the outgoing Governor and that he doubted the need for the new water regulator, ERSACT, because he rejected the privatisation of DiPOS.341 Recall also General Bussi\u2019s declaration in December 1994, during the provincial election campaign, of his party\u2019s \"most solid opposition to transferring the patrimonies of the Province\", and Vice Governor Topa\u2019s evidence that \"our party had announced that one of its government action - if it was elected - would be to consider examining the details of the concession agreement... taking into account the interest of the users,\" and that the Concession Agreement had been \"born defective\".\n\n*Ibid.,* at \u00b645.\n\n7.4.22.\n\nERSACT\u2019s 25 September 1995 decision to refer the Concession Agreement\u2019s *\"absurd\"* tariff provisions to the Attorney General, not 10 days after having published its own full page advertisement endorsing CAA\u2019s addition of taxes to its service tariff, and the Legislature\u2019s 17 November 1995 formation of an investigative commission to investigate both CAA\u2019s tariff and the privatisation as a whole are best understood in this context. Respondent led no cogent evidence to explain the apparent about-face in ERSACT\u2019s thinking on the legitimacy of the addition of taxes to CAA\u2019s tariff. In these circumstances we are entitled to infer that ERSACT\u2019s reference of the Concession Agreement to the Attorney General was politically motivated.\n\n7.4.23.\n\nDr. Rais described these measures - which he labelled (correctly in our view) as the Province\u2019s \"first attack\" - as \"... depriving the concessionaire\u2019s billing of formal legitimacy... which led to a series of official decisions that voided the billing in question. And in December, the Legislature itself issued a kind of censure of the billing.\" As to their effect on the concession, he observed that CAA\u2019s \"... customers immediately picked up on the message that was being sent to them from all around, intimating that CAA\u2019s efforts, including all its official acts, were provisional, and so they gradually stopped paying their invoices.\"342\n\n*Ibid.,* at \u00b648.\n\n7.4.24.\n\nDespite a six-month contractual grace period (against regulatory fines relating to quality controls) Argentina sought to describe ERSACT\u2019s levelling of 101 separate charges for water quality control breaches in early December 1995 as normal \"regulatory\" proceedings. They were anything but. We accept Dr. Paz\u2019s testimony that Mr. Davolio (then ERSACT\u2019s Sub-Interventor) told him he would have resolved these early water testing questions with a telephone call, but that ERSACT instead laid 101 separate charges and imposed 78 fines of US$1,000.00 (23 of the charges were not dealt with at this time) because his superiors had asked him \"... to put pressure on Aguas del Aconquija to negotiate the rates.\" Mr. Davolio added \"... until the rates are renegotiated like the government wants, the order from higher up is to keep applying pressure with whatever we\u2019ve got.\" These early charges and the subsequent fines are evidence of what Dr. Rais described as early efforts by the members of ERSACT \"... to ingratiate themselves with the political \"views\" of the new Governor.\"343 Having been laid and imposed \"to put pressure\" on CAA \"to negotiate the rates\", these charges and fines constitute a blatant misuse of the Province\u2019s regulatory powers for illegitimate purposes.\n\n*Ibid.,* at \u00b645.\n\n7.4.25.\n\nThe Legislature\u2019s Resolution No. 2, issued on 12 December 1995, which recommended that the Governor *unilaterally impose a temporary tariff reduction* to no more than 35% greater than the old DiPOS tariff also illuminates the new government\u2019s immediate imperative; \"... the establishment of a *just and reasonable new tariff system\"* (emphasis added)\n\n7.4.26.\n\nAnd as Dr. Rais observed, \"... the turbid water episode did nothing but heighten the campaign to discredit CAA.\"344 While provincial officials knew that there was never a health risk, the manganese episode led to \"an open call for nonpayment by all the political leadership,\" to the Province \"threatening to terminate the contract,\" and to the appointment of an ERSACT Interventor, \"who quickly declared war on the concession.\"345 We conclude that the Province\u2019s reaction to the episodes of turbidity was irresponsible, unreasonable and disproportionate. Having regard to the motivation for this response, it clearly breached the Article 3 standard.\n\n*Ibid.,* at \u00b651.\n\n*Ibid.,* at \u00b651.\n\n7.4.27.\n\nThe disagreeable appearance of manganese turbidity in the water system in parts of San Miguel in late January 1996 was most unfortunate; it was also unforeseen and unforeseeable. Despite this, as Respondent\u2019s witness Mr. Arancibia stated, \"Within 72 hours, treatment was implemented for oxydising the colorless, soluable manganese that was detectable only by chemical analysis, after precipitation, filtration and as a result of its removal.\"346 In addition, CAA took appropriate steps to inform the public about what had occurred and what steps the company was taking to address the problem.\n\nArancibia Supplementary Affidavit, 26 March 1999, at Section IX, \u00b613 (Exhibit 377).\n\n7.4.28.\n\nBy contrast, instead of working with CAA to understand the problem and alleviate consumers\u2019 concerns, the Province\u2019s most senior officials acted irresponsibly. The Minister of Health, for example, made the inflammatory announcement that CAA was supplying \"bacterialogically contaminated\" water. Indeed, even before manganese turbidity appeared, he said publicly that the water could cause cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis. When asked in cross-examination about the effect of that statement, Vice Governor Topa acknowledged that it \"has an impact on the community\".347 When asked if he was aware whether the Minister of Health had any evidence to support his latter statement, he replied, \"we presume that he was a man with the technical background and necessary responsibility to say what he said.\"348 Mr. Topa added \"I imagine, or I assume that a health specialist, who is also the Minister of Health, well, when he publicly makes these statements, I am assuming that he conducted a number of analyses..,\".349 No evidence of any such analyses was ever submitted by Respondent. This is perhaps not surprising as it is generally well understood that the presence of manganese in water poses no health risk and that, as noted earlier, CAA retained an Argentine doctor, an expert in water-borne infectious diseases, who conducted a detailed study and confirmed that no health risk existed.\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 7, p. 1674, lines 1-2 (30 July 2006).\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 7, p. 1706, lines 1-9 (30 July 2006).\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 7, p. 1709, lines 14-20 (30 July 2006).\n\n7.4.29.\n\nTwo days after the Health Minister\u2019s 24 January 1996 statement warning of cholera and typhoid, and on the day ERSACT published advertisements reassuring the public that the manganese turbidity posed no health threat, Vice Governor Topa, acting on behalf of Governor Bussi, placed the agency under government supervision, dismissed its directors and appointed Mr. Franco Fogliata to serve as Interventor. Prior to his appointment Mr. Fogliata had served, and he continued to do so, as the Province\u2019s Minister of Production. That the decisions of ERSACT were politically directed by the Executive from that point forward is not in doubt. As from this date, Dr. Rais considered that it was now ERSACT\u2019s role \"... to execute the political directives that it was given\". He put it plainly in his report: the Interventor \"... quickly declared war on the concessionaire.\"350 We accept Dr. Rais\u2019s rather fierce description as reflecting reality.\n\nCase Study, April 2001 - Concession for the Potable Water and Sewerage Services in Tucum\u00e1n, Argentine Republic, by Jorge Carlos Rais, Maria Esther Esquivel, Sergio Sour, Consultants (Exhibit 858), at \u00b6\u00b651 and 52.\n\n7.4.30.\n\nGiven Mr. Paz\u2019s testimony and the non-partisan opinion expressed by Dr. Rais in his report to the World Bank in 2001,351 the measures adopted by ERSACT after its intervention must be regarded as infected, and, thus robbed of legitimacy, by the Province\u2019s determination to rescind or force a renegotiation of the Concession Agreement.\n\nAlthough Dr. Rais provided evidence on behalf of Respondent, his opinions expressed in the Rais Report may be considered non-partisan, in the sense that the Report was prepared in 2001 as a case study for the World Bank to identify causes of failure of private sector participation in the area of potable water and sewerage public utilities.\n\n7.4.31.\n\nSimilarly, while it would have been entirely proper for a new government with a different policy perspective on privatisation to seek to renegotiate a concession agreement in a transparent non-coercive manner, it is clearly wrong (and unfair and inequitable in terms of the BIT) to seek to bring a concessionaire to the renegotiation table through threats of rescission based on colourable allegations after having wrongly deprived the concessionaire\u2019s billings of formal legitimacy. But this is exactly what happened here.\n\n7.4.32.\n\nOn 9 February 1996, two weeks after it had been intervened, ERSACT issued Resolution No. 170/96 in which it found CAA\u2019s invoicing procedures to be \"invalid acts\" and ordered \"... that they be revoked or replaced for reasons of illegitimacy... in order to avoid [ERSACT] issuing an administrative decision that forces CAA to reduce the current rate charged\". A week later it directed CAA to grant its customers a 35-day billing holiday, affirming its early \"penalty\" for CAA\u2019s fault as found in Resolution 51/96.\n\n7.4.33.\n\nThe next day, the Ministry of the Interior, Alberto Germano, joined in, announcing that the Concession Agreement should be rescinded because of \"very bad service with a high tariff\u2019. On cross-examination, Vice Governor Topa was asked to respond to the Minister\u2019s statement that the Province was \"prepared to take immediate charge of the water and sewage services\". He responded that, \"... that is not serious at all\". Adding that \"... the government understood that it was not in a position, and it did not have the capabilities to take over the service, and we had no plans in this regard..,\".352 The Tribunal accepts Mr. Topa\u2019s testimony that the government did not have a plan at this time to take back the concession, but merely to threaten to do so. And that is exactly what Governor Bussi did when he announced to the press on 15 February 1996 that only a miracle could save the Concession Agreement from being rescinded by the Executive. This threat and all that preceded it brought Claimants to the table to renegotiate.\n\nTestimony of Topa, Transcript of the hearings on the merits, Day 7, pp. 1846 (lines 8-19), 1847 (lines 12-21, and 1848 (lines 1-2) (30 July 2006).\n\n7.4.34.\n\nAs we have found above, CAA\u2019s initial proposal for a renegotiated agreement was immediately rejected. Then, on 19 March 1996, a day after Minister Germano advised CAA of the government\u2019s preconditions for the negotiations, ERSACT issued Resolution 212/96 dealing with CAA\u2019s initial billings and its tariff. Despite the fact that both the Attorney General and the Court of Accounts had recommended only that ERSACT *negotiate* with CAA over the addition to its tariff of certain of the municipal taxes, Resolution 212/96 hit hard. Resolution 212/96 rejected CAA\u2019s appeal against Resolution 170 and found CAA to be in breach of the Concession Agreement. It also held that Resolution 170 had taken effect on 9 February 1996 and informed the Executive of CAA\u2019s \"serious and unjustified failure\" to comply with it, despite the pendency of CAA\u2019s appeal.\n\n7.4.35.\n\nIt is to be recalled that Resolution 170 had enjoined CAA from issuing new invoices or collecting on outstanding invoices until ERSACT had approved a new rate schedule for CAA based on the Attorney General\u2019s opinion.\n\n7.4.36.\n\nFor the reasons noted above, Resolution 212/96 provides a particularly good example of an unfair and inequitable measure by the governmental authorities of Tucum\u00e1n. To the extent that plausible questions may have been raised as to exactly what taxes CAA was entitled to add to its service charges in its invoices, ERSACT\u2019s references to the need for *\"urgent measures\", \"serious losses\", \"great social repercussions\", \"serious disobedience \"* and the *\"high amounts involved\"* points unmistakably to the fact that the Regulator was improperly being used as an instrument of political re-engineering. It is to be remembered that the disputed taxes totalled only about US$2.50 per month and that it was not disputed that CAA had the right to increase its service charge by approximately 30% to cover taxes on top of the 67.9% increase over the former DiPOS rates.\n\n7.4.37.\n\nAs to the on-again, off-again, renegotiations which were carried on from the end of February 1996 through mid-May 1997, it is not necessary to address each of the matters Claimants advance as examples of unfair and inequitable treatment over this period. It is sufficient to observe that Claimants had been brought to the negotiation table by Governor Bussi\u2019s repeated threats of recession and the Province\u2019s impermissible campaign to reverse the privatisation or force CAA to renegotiate, and were kept there (they continued to negotiate as long as they felt it was possible to salvage the concession on renegotiated terms) by the Regulator\u2019s repeated suspension and reactivation of its Resolutions Nos 212/96 and 213/96. This so-called regulatory activity constituted ongoing, unfair and inequitable behaviour because it was no more than politically driven arm-twisting aimed at compelling Claimants to agree to new terms to the Concession Agreement which were acceptable to the new government.\n\n7.4.38.\n\nWe also find that the effect of the Regulator\u2019s conduct over this period, taken against a background of the highly critical Report of the Special Investigative Commission, Minister German\u00f3\u2019s observations about continuing to deal with criminals, the Court of Accounts\u2019 attack on the Framework Agreement and the efforts by legislators and the Ombudsman to assist CAA\u2019s customers in resisting payment of invoices, had a devastating effect on the economic viability of the concession.\n\n7.4.39.\n\nUnder the fair and equitable standard, there is no doubt about a government\u2019s obligation not to disparage and undercut a concession (a \"do no harm\" standard) that has properly been granted, albeit by a predecessor government, based on falsities and motivated by a desire to rescind or force a renegotiation. And that is exactly what happened in Tucum\u00e1n.\n\n7.4.40.\n\nThe record conclusively demonstrates the accuracy of Legislator Nogu\u00e9s\u2019 description of what CAA\u2019s customers were told by the Bussi Government. As he said, the provincial authorities:\n\n*\"told the citizens of Tucum\u00e1n, at a given moment, not to pay their water bills; it said it in all tones and in all the forms; additionally, it told the citizens the invoicing system did not correspond to the terms of the contract.... there was an explicit appeal made by the Executive Power about not paying for the water.... the certain fact is that currently* *the citizens were urged not to pay by the Executive* *Power.353*\n\nLegislature of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, Legislative Debate, 20 November 2003 (Exhibit 69).\n\n7.4.41.\n\nIn his cross-examination, Vice Governor Topa testified that the Province would never have discouraged payment because that would be \"inconsistent with the letter of the contract\". He claimed that he constantly encouraged customers to pay their bills. However, although he also testified that \"members of the media were on top of us, and they were publishing every single comma and period of the statements made\",354 there is no evidence before the Tribunal that any such statements, encouraging customers to pay, were ever made by Vice Governor Topa or any other provincial official.\n\nTestimony of Topa, Transcript of the hearing on the merits, Day 7, pp. 1670 (lines 10-12) and 1672 (lines 3-11) (30 July 2006).\n\n7.4.42.\n\nBy contrast, contrary statements and conduct were well documented. In the 1995 election campaign, General Bussi\u2019s party told the people that the tariff was too high and that, if elected, it would fix it. Subsequently the Legislature adopted its own resolution challenging CAA\u2019s invoices and calling for a tariff no more than 35% higher than the old DiPOS rate. In January 1996, the Minister of Health cautioned about typhoid and cholera when ERSACT knew no such risks existed. General Bussi and others threatened to terminate the concession and its shareholders were branded as possible criminals. On this record, it is hardly surprising that CAA\u2019s recovery rate on its invoices was driven further and further down. Thus, measured by a \"do no harm\" standard, Respondent directly undermined Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations of their investment355 and breached its Treaty commitments under Article 3.\n\nAccording to the Tribunal, it was not reasonable for the Claimants to expect that they would achieve the recovery rates or internal rates of return upon which they modeled their investment. Investments always carry risk and returns are seldom guaranteed. However, they had every reason to expect that their privatisation partner, the Province, would not mount an illegitimate campaign to force them, on threat of rescission, to renegotiate a lower tariff.\n\n7.4.43.\n\nAs noted above, after learning that the Executive had failed to support the 8 April Agreement (when, in mid-June 1997, it accepted some 70 unilateral amendments to the agreed bill that had been placed before the Legislature), CAA formally gave 90 day notice of rescission of the Concession Agreement on 27 August 1997. Having regard to our mandate to adjudicate on Treaty breach, we do not need to offer a view, nor do we, on whether CAA had contractual grounds to rescind the Concession Agreement at this time. We do say, however, that when it did so the Tucum\u00e1n authorities (the Governor, the Vice-Governor, the Ministers, the Executive, the Legislative, the Attorney-General and the Regulator), whose actions are unquestionably attributable to the Argentine Republic, had committed numerous breaches of the Article 3 fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n7.4.44.\n\nDisputing parties spent much time on the responsibility, or lack thereof, of the Argentine Republic for the acts of individual opposition party legislators and of the Ombudsman. The Tribunal notes that Respondent did not contest its responsibility for the acts of the Legislature in the exercise of its governmental authority, the Executive, the Attorney-General or the Regulator. Respondent only denies responsibility for the acts of individual legislators, particularly opposition politicians and the Ombudsman. We do not need to decide these questions given our conclusion that multiple acts of members of the Executive, government ministers, the Regulator (which was politically guided by the Executive) and the Legislature violated the Article 3 standard. Had it been necessary, we would have been inclined to find that many of the acts of the Ombudsman that were complained of involved the exercise of governmental authority and would thus have been attributable to Argentina in the event they too constituted a breach of Article 3.\n\n7.4.45.\n\nAs to Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s post-termination behaviour, we also leave aside contractual questions associated with whether or not the Province had the right to require CAA to continue to provide service during the alleged \"hostage period\". The answers to this question would have no material bearing on the outcome. However, the Legislature\u2019s enactment in 2001 of Law No. 7196, prohibiting CAA from pursuing its collection lawsuits, and in 2002 of Law No.7234, barring CAA from enforcing judgments rendered or to be rendered in proceedings against debtors, cannot plausibly be justified. These measures were, and can only be seen as a vindictive exercise of sovereign power aimed at punishing CAA and its shareholders for seeking to terminate the Concession Agreement and for exercising their rights to arbitrate under the BIT. As such, these measures, and the repeated re-enactment of successor versions of Law No. 7234, also infringe BIT Article 3.\n\n7.4.46.\n\nFinally, even if we had accepted Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the scope of the Article 3 standard (which this Tribunal has concluded is obsolete), we are in no doubt that Respondent\u2019s many acts and omissions cumulatively constituted an \"international delinquency\" as defined in the *Neer Claim356* and thus infringed the \"minimum standard of treatment\" it relies upon.\n\n*Neer Claim,* Mexico-U.S. General Claims Commission, Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Vol. IV, p. 60 (1926).\n\n**7.5. Expropriation Without Compensation - Article 5**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.5.1.\n\nAs with Article 3, disputing parties differ as to the scope of the protection against expropriation expressed in Article 5 of the Treaty. In relevant part, Article 5(2) provides:\n\n*\"The Contracting Parties shall not adopt, directly or indirectly, measures of expropriation or nationalization or any other equivalent measure having an effect similar to dispossession, except for public purpose and provided that such measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a specific commitment. \"*\n\n*\"Such measures referred to above which could be adopted, shall allow the payment of a prompt and adequate compensation, the amount of which, computed on the basis of the actual value of the investments affected, shall be evaluated in relation to the normal economic situation, and prior to any threat of dispossession\"*\n\n7.5.2.\n\nIt is evident that the contractual rights at issue in the present dispute *(ie* those provided by the Concession Agreement) are covered under Article l\u2019s definition of rights protected by the Treaty. Article 1 provides, in pertinent part:\n\n*\"1. The term \"investments \" means assets such as property, rights and interests of any kind, and in particular, but without limitation;*\n\n\u2026\n\n*e) Concessions granted by law or by virtue of an agreement, particularly those concessions related to... exploitation of natural resources...\"*\n\n7.5.3.\n\nRespondent appears to contend that an act or measure that breaches a contract cannot give rise to an expropriation because contract breaches could be addressed and must in law be addressed in other fora, without recourse to the Treaty.\n\n7.5.4.\n\nThis proposition is incorrect. There can be no doubt that contractual rights are capable of being expropriated, and a number of treaty cases have arisen out of contractual disputes. The same act that may violate a treaty may also violate a contract, or both the treaty and the contract. The fact that there is overlap does not prevent a tribunal from considering the act as a possible treaty breach. Further, whether a given act was in breach, or was thought by one of the parties to be in breach of the contract, may well inform the tribunal\u2019s assessment of that act for purposes of a treaty claim.\n\n7.5.5.\n\nIn *Phillips Petroleum,* the Iran-US Claims Tribunal considered whether a claim that the termination of an oil concession agreement constituted an \"expropriation of contract rights\" and, \"alternatively,... [a] breach and repudiation\" of the contract.357 The termination of the contract followed a series of actions by the Iranian Government that slowly eroded claimant\u2019s rights under the contract. The Claims Tribunal held that \"... expropriation by or attributable to a State of the property of an alien gives rise under international law to liability for compensation, and this is so whether the expropriation is formal or de facto and whether the property is tangible... or intangible, such as the contract rights involved in the present case.\"358 The Tribunal considered \"that the acts complained of appear more closely suited to assessment of liability for the taking of foreign-owned property under international law than to assessment of the contractual aspects of the relationship, and so decided to consider the claim in this light.\"359\n\n*Phillips Petroleum Company Iran v. the Islamic Republic of Iran and NIOC,* Award No. 425-39-2, Award of 29 June 1989, 21 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 79, at \u00b675.\n\n*Ibid.,* at \u00b676.\n\n*Ibid.,* at \u00b675.\n\n7.5.6.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *SPP v. Egypt* noted that contract rights are entitled to the protection of international law and the taking of such rights involves an obligation to make compensation, and that it has long been recognised that contractual rights may be indirectly expropriated.360\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3), Award on the Merits of May 20, 1992, 321.L.M. 937 (1993).\n\n7.5.7.\n\nRespondent cites *Waste Management II* and *Azinian* for the proposition that a state\u2019s contractual non-performance, without more, will not constitute an expropriation within the meaning of an investment treaty.361\n\nSee Counter-Memorial at \u00b6$10, 474-489.\n\n7.5.8.\n\nHowever, the measures identified at 7.4 herein, which constituted the Province\u2019s destructive campaign against CAA and CGE / Vivendi cannot in any circumstance be cast as simple commercial acts of or relating to non-performance by a contracting counter-party. Here we have illegitimate sovereign acts, taken by the Province in its official capacity, backed by the force of law and with all the authoritative powers of public office.\n\n7.5.9.\n\nThe 1948 *Jalapa Railroad Case* held that international responsibility was triggered when the government of Veracruz stepped out of the role of contracting party and sought to escape vital obligations under the contract by exercising its superior governmental power.362\n\n*Jalapa R.R. & Power Co. Claim* (1948), Whitesman\u2019s Digest of International Law, Volume 8 at pp. 908-909 (1976) (American Mexican Claims Commission under the Act of Congress Approved December 18, 1942, Report to the Secretary of State with Decisions Showing the Reasons for the Allowance or Disallowance of the Claims (Dept. of State Pub. No. 2859, Arbitration Series No. 9) (1948)).\n\n7.5.10.\n\nThus, even if one were to accept Respondent\u2019s arguments requiring some extra element in order to find a Treaty violation in acts of a contractual nature, an abundance of such elements are present in this case. In any event, the Article 5(2) requirement, that state measures not be contrary to a particular commitment, suggests that the breach of a commitment by a state is an appropriate factor for consideration in determining whether the state action is expropriatory in nature.\n\n7.5.11.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s position that it is novel and far-reaching for Claimants to suggest that the *value* of their investment has been expropriated, it is not infrequent in cases of indirect expropriation that the investor suffers a substantial deprivation of value of its investment. Numerous tribunals have looked at the diminution of the value of the investment to determine whether the contested measure is expropriatory. The weight of authority (further discussed below) appears to draw a distinction between only a partial deprivation of value (not an expropriation) and a complete or near complete deprivation of value (expropriation).\n\n7.5.12.\n\nIn *Tecmed,* the tribunal held that a measure is equivalent to expropriation if:\n\n*\"the Claimant, due to\\* the actions of the Respondent] *was radically deprived of the economical use and enjoyment of its investments, as if the rights related thereto... had ceased to exist. In other words, if due to the actions of Respondent, the assets involved have lost their value or economic use for their holder... \"363*\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2), Award of 29 May 2003 (Spain/Mexico BIT), at \u00b6115.\n\n7.5.13.\n\nThe *Tecmed* tribunal also recognised that, although terms such as \"equivalent to expropriation\" or \"tantamount to expropriation\" (so called indirect or creeping expropriation), do not have a clear or unequivocal definition \"... it is generally understood that they materialize through actions or conduct, which do not explicitly express the purpose of depriving one of rights or assets, but actually have that effect.\"364\n\n*Ibid.,* at \u00b6114.\n\n7.5.14.\n\nThe tribunal in *CME* similarly recognised that destruction of the value or the benefit of property can constitute expropriation:\n\n*\"De facto expropriations or indirect expropriations, i.e. measures that do not involve an overt taking but that effectively neutralize the benefit of the property of the foreign owner, are subject to expropriation claims. This is undisputed under international law... \"365*\n\n*CME Czech Republic B. V. (the Netherlands) v.

In *Tippetts,* the tribunal found that a deprivation or taking of property may occur under international law through interference by a state in the use of that property or with the enjoyment of its benefit, even where legal title to the property is not affected.367 Similarly, the tribunal in *Starrett Housing* stated that \"it is recognised in international law that measures taken by a State can interfere with property rights to such an extent that these rights are rendered so useless that they must be deemed to have been expropriated, even though the State does not purport to have expropriated them and the legal title to the property formally remains with the original owner\".368\n\n*Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton and TAMS-AFFA Consulting Engineers of Iran* (Award No. 141-7-2), Award of 29 June 29 1984, (Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 219).\n\n*Starrett Housing Corporation, Starrett Systems, Inc., Starrett Housing International, Inc., v.

It observes that measures short of physical takings may amount to takings in that they result in the effective loss of management, use or control, or a significant depreciation of the value of the asset of a foreign investor;369 that takings tantamount to expropriation are those that result in a substantial loss of control or value of a foreign investment;370 that creeping expropriation may be defined as the slow and incremental encroachment on one or more of the ownership rights of a foreign investor that diminishes the value of its investment. This is so even though the legal title to the property remains vested in the foreign investors but the investors\u2019 rights of use of the property are diminished as a result of the interference by the state.371\n\nUNCTAD, TAKING OF PROPERTY 36, (UNCTAD Series on International Investment Agreements 2000), at p. 4.\n\n*Ibid.,* atp. 41.\n\n*Ibid.,* at pp. 11-12.\n\n7.5.18.\n\nAt several points in its submission, Respondent appears to press for a return to a regime in which liability for expropriation is limited to physical or formal expropriations. Put another way, so long as Claimants remain in physical and managerial control of the water and sewage treatment assets of the concession, including during the alleged \"hostage period\", they were not deprived of their ownership rights in the concession. However, it has been clear since at least 1903, in the *Rudolff case,* that the taking away or destruction of rights acquired, transmitted and defined by contract is as much a wrong entitling the sufferer to redress as the taking away or destruction of a tangible property.372\n\n*Rudloff Case* (1903), U.S.-Venezuelan Claims Commission, Interlocutory Decision 9 RIAA 2144, Reports of International Arbitral Awards, Volume 9, p. 250.\n\n7.5.19.\n\nRespondent fails to appreciate that in the context of Claimants\u2019 case for expropriation of the Concession Agreement, the ownership rights which are subject to deprivation are Claimants\u2019 contractual rights themselves, *ie* the right to the use, enjoyment and benefit of those rights. And here, CAA\u2019s principal contractual right was to invoice its customers and pursue payment for the water and sewage services it provided in accordance with the tariff and terms provided for in the Concession Agreement. The fact that CAA remained, and during the alleged \"hostage period\" may have been \"forced\" to remain in control of the physical operation of the water treatment plants and the water and sewage network has no bearing whatever on whether CAA was effectively deprived of the right to operate the concession and to be compensated in accordance with the Concession Agreement, as originally negotiated.\n\n7.5.20.\n\nTurning to Respondent\u2019s proposition that an act of state must be presumed to be regulatory, absent proof of bad faith, this is incorrect. There is extensive authority for the proposition that the state\u2019s intent, or its subjective motives are at most a secondary consideration.373 While intent will weigh in favour of showing a measure to be expropriatory, it is not a requirement, because the *effect* of the measure on the investor, not the state\u2019s intent, is the critical factor. As Professor Christie explained in his famous article in the British Yearbook of International Law more than 40 years ago,374 a state may expropriate property where it interferes with it even though the state expressly disclaims such intention. Indeed international tribunals, jurists and scholars have consistently appreciated that states may accomplish expropriations in ways other than by formal decree; often in ways that may seek to cloak expropriative conduct with a veneer of legitimacy.375\n\n*Tippetts, Abbett, McCarthy, Stratton v.

If we conclude that the challenged measures are expropriatory, there will be violation of Article 5(2) of the Treaty, even if the measures might be for a public purpose and non-discriminatory, because no compensation has been paid. Respondent\u2019s public purpose arguments suggest that state acts causing loss of property cannot be classified as expropriatory. If public purpose automatically immunises the measure from being found to be expropriatory, then there would never be a compensable taking for a public purpose. As the tribunal in *Santa Elena* correctly pointed out, the purpose for which the property was taken \"does not alter the legal character of the taking for which adequate compensation must be paid.\"376 The legal element in question is whether the act is expropriatory or not. If Respondent\u2019s invocation of public purpose were correct, Costa Rica would have prevailed in the *Santa Elena* case and thus would not have faced the prospect of having to compensate.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v.

Having also come to the view that the measures which made up that campaign violated the Treaty\u2019s fair and equitable standard we turn now to our assessment of whether they may also be seen as expropriatory.\n\n7.5.24.\n\nWhere, as here, there has been no taking or dispossession, as such, and the question turns on whether there have been measures equivalent to expropriation which have had an effect similar to the dispossession of Claimants\u2019 rights and expectations, it is necessary to consider whether the challenged measures have or will (i) radically deprive Claimants of the economic use and enjoyment of its investment - *Deemed377* (ii) effectively neutralise the benefit of Claimants\u2019 property - *CME378* (iii) deprive the owner of the benefit and economic use of its contractual rights - *Santa Elena379* (iv) render Claimants\u2019 property rights useless *- Starrett Housing380* or have a similar dispossessory effect.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v.

CAA\u2019s recovery rate declined dramatically over the life of the concession, as illustrated in the graph below.381 The recovery rate continued to fall even after the tariffs were lowered as part of the interim agreement reached during the attempted renegotiations and, by the time CAA notified the authorities that the Concession Agreement was rescinded, it hovered around 20%; a stark contrast with the rate of 89-90% upon which the Concession Agreement was premised.\n\nThe graph represents the recovery rate observed as of 27 November 1997 on the invoicing for each bimonthly period, as well as the recovery rate at 2 months and 6 months after the invoicing for these bimonthly periods. The invoices due for the bimonthly periods 97-5 and 97-6 (which accounts for 27 days) were due as of November 27, 1997 but had not been sent yet. Statement of Amounts Claimed, with verification report of Ernst & Young, 19 November 2004 (Exhibit 7).\n\n7.5.27.\n\nWe have already indicated that it would not have been reasonable for Claimants to expect they would achieve the recovery rates or internal rates of return upon which they had modelled their investment (see fn. 355 above). However, they had every right to expect their privatisation partner, the Province, would not mount a wrongful and damaging campaign to force them, on threat of rescission, to abandon their contractual rights and renegotiate the concession based on lower tariffs.\n\n7.5.28.\n\nThe provincial measures earlier identified, taken cumulatively, rendered the concession valueless and forced CAA and Vivendi to incur unsustainable losses. As former Legislator Nougu\u00e9s said, the provincial authorities, including the Executive, told the citizens of Tucum\u00e1n not to pay and they did not.382 By August 1997, they had also so undermined CAA and the legitimacy of the Concession Agreement that it is utterly unrealistic to suggest that CAA (and its investors) should simply have stayed put, continuing to provide services for which it was not being paid and accepting ever increasing losses.\n\nLegislature of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n, Legislative Debate, 20 November 2003 (Statement of Legislator Nougu\u00e9s) (Exhibit 69).\n\n7.5.29.\n\nThis is not a case where the value of a claimant\u2019s investment had simply been diminished. Here, as in *Tecmed383* Claimants were radically deprived of the economic use and enjoyment of their concessionary rights. The *ad hoc* Committee well understood the potential for such a finding when it stressed that:\n\n*\"\u2026 the conduct complained of here was not more or less peripheral to a continuing successful enterprise. The Tucum\u00e1n conduct (in conjunction with the acts and decisions of Claimants) had the effect of putting an end to the investment. \"384*\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v.

Argentina,* and *Azurix v. Argentina* is unavailing. In *CMS385* the tribunal approached the question of expropriation using the same standards as we, *ie* substantial deprivation, or whether the enjoyment of property had been effectively neutralised. It simply concluded that the measures in question had not had such an effect, given that CMS\u2019s export sales had been unaffected and CMS was able to continue operations.386 In Azurix,387 the tribunal disagreed with the claimant as to whether Argentina had behaved wrongfully concerning Azurix\u2019s attempt to recover its Canon payment or had interfered inappropriately in its requested revision to the Retail Price Index. The tribunal made it clear that if it had found in favour of Azurix\u2019s contentions on these points, it \"... would agree that the breaches of the Concession Agreement would have had a devastating effect on the financial viability of the Concession...,\"388 It also considered that the management of the concession company had been affected, but not sufficiently for a finding of expropriation. In the result, it found that the provinces\u2019 actions did not impact Azurix\u2019s investment *to the extent required389* More recently in *LG&E Energy v. Argentina,* which was decided after receipt of disputing parties final submissions to us, the tribunal also concluded that the measures at issue did not, on the facts, constitute indirect expropriation. However, the tribunal made it clear that its conclusion would have been different had the evidence indicated an \"... almost complete deprivation of the value of LG&E\u2019s investment\".390\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

The *ad hoc* Committee recognised this when it noted that \"[i]t was open to Claimants to claim, and they did claim, that these acts taken together, or some of them, amounted to a breach of Articles 3 and/or 5 of the BIT.\"391 Similarly, the tribunal in *Santa Elena* stated \"[i]t is clear... that a measure or series of measures can still eventually amount to a taking, though the individual steps in the process do not formally purport to amount to a taking or to a transfer of title\".392\n\nDecision on Annulment at \u00b6112.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, SA. v The Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1), Award of 17 February 2000, 15 ICISD REV - FILJ 169 (2000), at \u00b676.\n\n7.5.32.\n\nArticle 15(1) of the ILC Articles is to like effect where it defines the time at which a composite act \"occurs\" as the time at which the last action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act, without it necessarily having to be the last of the series.393\n\nSee The International Law Commission, Articles on State Responsibility (2001), reprinted in James Crawford, ed., *The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2002). See also UN GAOR, 56th Sess, Supp No. 10, p 43, UN Doe A/56/10 (2001).\n\n7.5.33.\n\nHere, the Province\u2019s actions - from the very opening months of the concession, continuing through its wrongful regulatory action and culminating in the unilateral amendments to the 8 April Agreement - had the necessary consequence of forcing CAA to terminate the Concession Agreement. The provincial government was simply not prepared to countenance and support CAA\u2019s operation of the concession on the terms of the Concession Agreement as originally agreed. Ultimately, the Province simply left CAA with no choice. It could not continue in the face of mounting losses, under significantly reduced tariffs and with no reasonable prospect of improved collection rates. CAA\u2019s contractual rights under the Concession Agreement were rendered worthless by the Province\u2019s actions while its losses would only continue to mount. Vivendi suffered direct harm in its capacity as CAA\u2019s principal shareholder, with the value of its shareholding being eradicated.\n\n7.5.34.\n\nParaphrasing the words of the *Tecmed394 CME395 Santa Elena396* and *Starrett* *Housing397* tribunals, Claimants were radically deprived of the economic use and enjoyment of their investment, the benefits of which *(ie* the right to be paid for services provided) had been effectively neutralised and rendered useless. Under these circumstances, rescission of the Concession Agreement represented the only rational alternative for Claimants. By leaving Claimants with no other rational choice, we conclude that the Province thus expropriated Claimants\u2019 right of use and enjoyment of their investment under the Concession Agreement.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v.

Causation**\n------------------\n\n7.6.1.\n\nBefore turning to damages we deal briefly with Claimants\u2019 obligation to show that the damages alleged were caused by the measures we have found to infringe the BIT, and were not, for example, simply the result of general dissatisfaction with the privatisation and CAA\u2019s services.\n\n7.6.2.\n\nOn this issue, there can be no serious dispute. Upon the transfer of service, CAA immediately took emergency measures to reduce serious bacteriological risk, to improve water quality more generally, and to upgrade the water and sewage infrastructure. We have already found its initial operation of the concession to have been satisfactory. Nor can it seriously be alleged that the episodes of turbidity by themselves led to the steady decline in CAA\u2019s recovery on its invoices. The incidents of red turbidity were intermittent, non-harmful and in no way out of the ordinary. They affected only a relatively small part of the population (5-10%) for short periods and occurred over only one or two months. As to the manganese turbidity, it was unquestionably unpleasant but it only lasted about two weeks, posed no health risks and CAA\u2019s response to an unforeseeable event was highly professional. By contrast, the actions taken by government officials in Tucum\u00e1n had the effect of pressuring, and were meant to pressure CAA by destroying its base of paying customers. The persistent steps taken by the Province to prevent the collection of payments due for services from the investors\u2019 customers are perhaps the most important of the Province\u2019s breaches of the fair and equitable standard and the prohibition against expropriation without compensation. We find that the destruction of the concession brought about by the decline in recovery rates is directly attributable to (and was proximately caused by) the government authorities in Tucum\u00e1n and thus, is the responsibility of the Argentine Republic.\n\n**8. DAMAGES**\n--------------\n\n**8.1. Introduction**\n---------------------\n\n8.1.1.\n\nClaimants\u2019 case for damages is not without complications. Relying on the principle established in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory Case398* over US$317 million is claimed as the amount necessary to eliminate the adverse financial consequences of the Province\u2019s illegal acts. This amount is made up of four components: (i) US$59,173,000 for damages suffered during the life of the concession period, *ie* before 27 November 1997; (ii) US$241,359,000 for damages suffered as a result of the expropriation of the remainder of the concession; (iii) US$14,989,000 for damages for the forced provision of services during the alleged hostage period; and (iv) US$1,402,000 as a contingency related to a potential tax liability based on CAA\u2019s control of the concession\u2019s assets.399 Claimants also seek interest on the amounts claimed, and costs and expenses.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial at \u00b6 379. citing *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Germany v.

This part of the claim rests on a comparison of what Claimants contend the concession would have earned, but for the Province\u2019s actions. For the period 22 July 1995 to 27 November 1997, a comparison was made of actual cash flows versus cash flows projected based on the terms of the Concession Agreement. For the 27.5 years remaining, lost profits were estimated using a DCF analysis which discounted anticipated future net cash flow to a 27 November 1997 present value.\n\n8.1.3.\n\nIn its comprehensive challenge to Claimants\u2019 damages, Respondent put squarely in issue the appropriateness and availability, on the facts of this case, of a damages claim that includes future lost profits calculated using the DCF methodology. Claimants\u2019 methodology and underlying assumptions were also contested. Respondent also noted that Claimants\u2019 damage claim was formulated entirely upon CAA\u2019s alleged losses and that no attempt had been made to identify or claim for any alleged losses of CGE/Vivendi as shareholder.\n\n8.1.4.\n\nDespite these challenges, Claimants elected not to offer the Tribunal in their further pre-hearing pleadings any alternative approaches to their claim for or calculation of damages.\n\n8.1.5.\n\nDuring the course of the oral hearing, the Tribunal noted the absence in Claimants\u2019 submission of an alternative to the lost profits claim and the apparent reliance on only CAA\u2019s alleged losses. It also invited Claimants to direct it to the portions of the existing record that were relevant to possible alternative approaches to calculating damages *(eg* liquidation value, book value, replacement value or amounts invested) that had been noted by Respondent. Towards the end of Day 11, in response to a request from Claimants for clarification as to its queries, the Tribunal\u2019s President responded as follows:\n\n*\"PRESIDENT ROWLEY:... if a claim is asserted by Vivendi for its wasted investment, it can only be asserted based on the evidence in these proceedings, and so we would need to have brought to our attention the evidence that is in these proceedings. That\u2019s what I mean. It was not an invitation to seek to introduce new evidence at this stage of the matter.*  \n*MR PRICE: Thank you. You have clarified it. \"400*\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 11, pp. 2959-2960 (3 August 2006).\n\n8.1.6.\n\nDespite this clarification, on 23 August 2006, after the conclusion of the hearing on the merits, Claimants sought to introduce new evidence to support alternative approaches to the calculation of damages.\n\n8.1.7.\n\nRespondent objected to the introduction of such evidence by Claimants at this stage of the proceeding. In Respondent\u2019s view, even if the Tribunal had sought further discussion from the parties as to the *effects* of the various methods of calculation on Claimants\u2019 damages claim, the record was clear that no new evidence was to be introduced.\n\n8.1.8.\n\nClaimants responded by letter dated 1 September 2006: \"to be sure\", they conceded, \"there are facts on the existing record that the Tribunal can use for that purpose\". Nevertheless, Claimants requested that Tribunal exercise its discretion to accept further evidence to give the Tribunal the \"full picture\" relevant to alternative calculation methods.\n\n8.1.9.\n\nFor reasons elaborated in its letter to the parties dated 15 September 2006, attached hereto as Schedule A, the Tribunal declined to exercise its discretion to accept Claimants\u2019 new evidence. Accordingly, we have disregarded the fresh evidence Claimants provided in their 25 August 2006 Post-Hearing Brief as well as argumentation therein contained based on that fresh evidence. Claimants\u2019 arguments regarding compensation which were not based on fresh evidence were admitted.\n\n8.1.10.\n\nAs regards the queries concerning possible claims for CGE/Vivendi\u2019s losses, in their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants jointly requested an award totalling 100% of CAA\u2019s damages. And for the avoidance of doubt, Vivendi made an express claim for 94.4% of CAA\u2019s damages as its 94.4% *de facto* shareholder.401\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief at \u00b668. See also Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b675, Note 118.\n\n**8.2. Principles Relevant to an Award of Compensation**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.2.1.\n\nHaving concluded that Respondent has violated the provisions of both Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT, the Tribunal must now determine the appropriate compensation to be awarded.\n\n8.2.2.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention requires the Tribunal to decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the present case, Article 8(4) of the Treaty sets out a basic framework for the Tribunal\u2019s determinations, including those relating to the appropriate measure of damages:\n\n*\"The arbitration body shall decide on the basis of the provisions of this agreement, the law of the Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute - including its conflict of law rules - and the terms of possible specific agreements concluded in relation to the investment, as well as the principles of international law on the subject-matter.\"*\n\nThe BIT also expressly addresses compensation for expropriation. Article 5(2), in relevant part, provides:\n\n*\"Such measures referred to above \\ie* of expropriation] *which could be adopted,* *shall allow the payment of a prompt and adequate compensation,*  *the amount of which,*  *computed on the basis of*  *the actual value* *of the investments affected, shall be evaluated*  *in relation to the normal economic situation, and prior to any threat of dispossession*\n\n*\"Such compensation, its amount and payment method shall be established, at the latest, on the date of dispossession.* *Such compensation shall be effectively realizable, paid without delay and freely transferable.*  *It shall bear interests,* *computed at an appropriate rate, until the date of payment. \"* (emphasis added)\n\n8.2.3.\n\nThe Treaty thus *mandates* that compensation for *lawful* expropriation be based on the *actual value* of the investment, and that interest *shall* be paid from the date of dispossession. However, it does not purport to establish a *lex specialis* governing the standards of compensation for *wrongful* expropriations.402 As to the appropriate measure of compensation for the breaches other than expropriation, the Treaty is silent.\n\nThe distinction established by the Permanent Cout of International Justice in *Chorz\u00f3w* between *lawful* and *unlawful* taking, was explored by Chamber Two of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in *Phillips Petroleum Company Iran v. the Islamic Republic of Iran and NIOC,* Award No. 425-39-2, Award of 29 June 1989, 21 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 79. For a lucid analysis of possible different standards of damages assessment under customary international law and a *lex specialis* established in a BIT, see *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. The Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/10), Award of 2 October 2006, at pp. 89 *et seq.* However, as the Award in this case was issued after disputing parties\u2019 Post-Hearing Briefs, it was not cited to us and we do not rely on it here.\n\n8.2.4.\n\nIn the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory Case,* the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) set out the following principles of compensation for *unlawful* acts by states:\n\n*\"The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act - a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals - is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. \"*\n\n*\u2019\u2019Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss* *sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it...\"403*\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorzow,* Judgment No. 13, 13 September 1928, Merits, 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, atp. 47.\n\n8.2.5.\n\nThere can be no doubt about the vitality of this statement of the damages standard under customary international law, which has been affirmed and applied by numerous international tribunals as well as the PCIJ\u2019s successor, the International Court of Justice.404 It is also clear that such a standard permits, if the facts so require, a higher rate of recovery than that prescribed in Article 5(2) for *lawful* expropriations.\n\n*S.D.

Slovakia), Judgment 25 September 1997, 1997 I.C.J. 7.\n\n8.2.6.\n\nDisputing parties also cite to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.405 Article 36 requires that a \"state responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution\" and that such compensation \"shall cover any financially assessable damage, including loss of profits insofar as it is established\".406\n\nReply at \u00b6394; Counter-Memorial at \u00b6593, citing Article 36 of the ILC Draft on State Responsibility, Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its Fifty-third session, *Official Records of the General Assembly,* Fifty-sixth session, Supplement N\u00b0 10 (A/56/10), at chapter IV.E.2.\n\nReport of the International Law Commission on the work of its Fifty-third session, *Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-sixth session, Supplement N\u00b0 10* (A/56/10), at chapter IV.E.2.\n\n8.2.7.\n\nBased on these principles, and absent limiting terms in the relevant treaty, it is generally accepted today that, regardless of the type of investment, and regardless of the nature of the illegitimate measure, the level of damages awarded in international investment arbitration is supposed to be sufficient to compensate the affected party fully and to eliminate the consequences of the state\u2019s action.\n\n8.2.8.\n\nOf course, the level of damages necessary to compensate for a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard could be different from a case where the same government expropriates the foreign investment. The difference will generally turn on whether the investment has merely been impaired or destroyed. Here, however, we are not faced with a need to so differentiate, given our earlier finding that the same state measures infringed both relevant Articles of the BIT and that these measures emasculated the Concession Agreement, rendering it valueless. Put differently, the breaches of Articles 3 and 5 caused more or less equivalent harm.\n\n8.2.9.\n\nClaimants\u2019 principal claim for compensation is based on the \"fair market value\" of the concession established by a lost profit analysis. Respondent did not seriously contest that fair market value could be an appropriate basis upon which to award damages for breach of the Treaty, but challenged Claimants\u2019 methodology and calculations.\n\n8.2.10.\n\n\"Fair market value\" can be considered the equivalent of \"actual value\" as those words are used in Article 5. This standard has also generally been accepted as appropriate compensation for expropriation. However, as pointed out by the tribunal in *CMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentine Republic*,407 a \"fair market value\" standard might also be appropriate for other breaches which result in longterm losses. The *Azurix* tribunal also concluded that it could properly resort to fair market value to compensate breaches other than expropriation - in particular the fair and equitable standard.408 In its award, it noted the particular relevance of the government having taken over the concession.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of 12 May 2005, at \u00b6410.\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Award of 23 June 2006, at \u00b6424.\n\n8.2.11.\n\nOn the facts before us, and having regard to the parties\u2019 approaches to damages, the Tribunal is of the view that it is appropriate to assess compensation, *at least in part,409* based on the fair market value of the concession.\n\nWe say \"at least in part\" because of Claimants\u2019 need to fund CAA\u2019s ongoing costs/losses after 27 August 1997, the date of expropriation, through the end of the alleged \"hostage period\".\n\n**8.3. Damages Calculation**\n----------------------------\n\n8.3.1.\n\nClaimants contend that a DCF analysis is recognised as the preferred approach to valuation in modern practice where projected cash flows are reasonably capable of determination and are not speculative. They say there was nothing speculative about the concession\u2019s ability to operate, to provide services, or to attract customers; this was not a start-up enterprise or a project yet to be constructed. The provision of water and sewage services in Tucum\u00e1n was, and is today, a revenue-generating going concern. They point to CAA\u2019s achievement of a 65% recovery rate on its first invoices as demonstrative of the reasonableness of the Concession Agreement\u2019s projected 89-90% collection rate. Other utilities in Tucum\u00e1n were shown to have collection rates about 90% and Ms. Perrier testified as to the low economic risk of water services concessions. CGE\u2019s long and diverse global experience was cited as evidence that the 11.52% projected rate of return was conservative and likely to be achieved; why otherwise would CGE have agreed the terms of the concession.\n\n8.3.2.\n\nRespondent argued strongly against the appropriateness of a DCF valuation for the Tucum\u00e1n concession, contending, *inter alia,* that DiPOS was never a genuine going concern, there was no proven record of profitability and that Claimants\u2019 approach entirely ignores the substantial risk associated with the privatisation by wrongly assuming the Concession Agreement\u2019s income stream to be a minimum, rather than a maximum.\n\n8.3.3.\n\nAt international law, depending on the circumstances arising in a particular case, there are a number of ways of approximating fair market value. The Tribunal accepts, in principle, that fair market value may be determined with reference to future lost profits in an appropriate case. Indeed, theoretically, it may even be the preferred method of calculating damages in cases involving the appropriation of or fundamental impairment of going concerns. However, the net present value provided by a DCF analysis is not always appropriate and becomes less so as the assumptions and projections become increasingly speculative. And, as Respondent points out, many international tribunals have stated that an award based on future profits is not appropriate unless the relevant enterprise is profitable and has operated for a sufficient period to establish its performance record.410 The Tribunal notes that even in the authorities relied on by Claimants, compensation for lost profits is generally awarded only where *future profitability* can be established *(the fact of profitability* as opposed to the *amount)* with some level of certainty.\n\n*Levittv.

The United Mexican* *States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/l), Award of 30 August 2000, 40 LL.M. 36 (2001); *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v.

Arab Republic of Egypt* (Award) (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Award of 8 December 2000, 41 LL.M. 896 (2002).\n\n8.3.4.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the likelihood of lost profits must be sufficiently established by Claimants in order to be the basis of compensable damages. The Tribunal also recognises that in an appropriate case, a claimant might be able to establish the likelihood of lost profits with sufficient certainty even in the absence of a genuine going concern. For example, a claimant might be able to establish clearly that an investment, such as a concession, would have been profitable by presenting *sufficient* evidence of its expertise and proven record of profitability of concessions it (or indeed others) had operated in similar circumstances.\n\n8.3.5.\n\nIn the present case, as noted below, Claimants faced significant challenges and we conclude that they have failed to establish with a sufficient degree of certainty that the Tucum\u00e1n concession would have been profitable.\n\n8.3.6.\n\nClaimants\u2019 assertions that the concession operated as going concern before, during and after CAA\u2019s tenure border on the fanciful. A \"going concern\" is generally understood to be a business enterprise with demonstrable future earning power. However, the Tucum\u00e1n water concession was anything but, DiPOS was never self-sufficient - in the early \u201890\u2019s its revenues covered only 30% of its expenses. As Dr. Rais pointed out, before privatisation, it had routinely been looted by successive provincial governments, its operations had been deteriorating steadily, it could not provide services to cover the growth rate of the population, it operated with an average deficit of US$17 million. In 1991, it owed US$45 million to one contractor alone. DiPOS was financed with direct contributions from the provincial treasury. DiPOS had been unable to achieve a recovery rate of more than 55% on its invoices,411 and at the time of privatisation its accounts receivable totalled 19 months of billing.412 In Claimants\u2019 own words, \"the water and sewage system operated by DiPOS was not financially viable..,\"413\n\nRejoinder at \u00b652; Lentini Supplemental Expert Report, 8 May 2006 (Exhibit 918).\n\nCase Study, Concession for the Potable Water and Sewerage Services in Tucum\u00e1n, Argentine Republic, by Jorge Carlos Rais, Maria Ester Esquivel, Sergio Sour, Consultants (Exhibit 858).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial at \u00b622.\n\n8.3.7.\n\nIt is also common ground (and it is hardly surprising in the circumstances) that CAA never made a profit whilst it had operational control of the concession. Indeed, although CAA had a positive book value of US$22.5 million at the end of 1997, CAA\u2019s book value at this time distorts the economic reality due to the fact that CAA was required to carry a US$55 million asset of unpaid (and largely uncollectible) customer invoices.414\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief at \u00b682 and Note 211.\n\n8.3.8.\n\nAs previously noted, the absence of a history of demonstrated profitability does not absolutely preclude the use of DCF valuation methodology. But to overcome the hurdle of its absence, a claimant must lead convincing evidence of its ability to produce profits in the particular circumstances it faced. And here, we find Claimants\u2019 evidence deficient.415\n\nThis deficiency relates not to CGE/Vivendi\u2019s expertise, which is evident, but to the evidentiary record required as described at 8.3.4.\n\n8.3.9.\n\nIn the present circumstances, more was required than Ms. Perrier\u2019s statement that the water concession business is considered to have a very low risk, given her forthright admission that she had no personal experience as to their rates of return or recovery.416 The brief testimonial references made by Messrs, de Maud\u2019huy and de Rochambeau to CGE\u2019s success with concessions in Chile, Mexico and Morocco are similarly insufficient.\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 10, pp. 2609-2610 (3 August 2006).\n\n8.3.10.\n\nA claimant which cannot rely on a record of demonstrated profitability requires to present a thoroughly prepared record of its (or others) successes, based on first hand experience (its own or that of qualified experts) or corporate records which establish on the balance of the probabilities it would have produced profits from the concession in question in the face of the particular risks involved, other than those of Treaty violation. This approach was not taken here.\n\n8.3.11.\n\nIn these circumstances, we conclude that Claimants\u2019 evidence of the value of the concession - in the sum of US$300,532,000 - based on its lost profits analysis cannot be relied upon and need not be further analysed. We therefore turn to alternative methods of evaluating the concession.\n\n8.3.12.\n\nAs already noted, Claimants initially elected to rest their valuation case on lost profits. Until their closing argument and Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants did not advance or rely upon generally accepted alternative means of calculating fair market value, such as \"book value\" - the net value of an enterprise\u2019s assets, \"investment value\" - the amount actually invested prior to the injurious acts, \"replacement value\" - the amount necessary to replace the investment prior to the injurious acts, or \"liquidation value\" - the amount a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the investment in a liquidation process. These alternative approaches were addressed at Days 10 and 11 of the hearing on the merits.417 In their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants examined the alternative methods and pointed to the parts of the evidentiary record relevant to the determination of amounts invested.418\n\nTranscript of the hearing on the merits, Day 10, pp. 2623-2673 (3 August 2006); Transcript of the hearing on the merits, Day 11 (4 August 2006).\n\nIn their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants pointed to the unsuitability of the alternative methods, and, at the Tribunal\u2019s request, pointed to the portions of the evidentiary record relevant to the calculation of amounts invested: Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief at pp. 47-51.\n\n8.3.13.\n\nOf these alternatives, the \"investment value\" of the concession appears to offer the closest proxy, if only partial, for compensation sufficient to eliminate the consequences of the Province\u2019s actions.\n\n8.3.14.\n\nRespondent\u2019s arguments in favour of \"book\" value are unacceptable for reasons explained at 8.3.7 above, and neither of the parties provided any evidence on \"liquidation\" or \"replacement\" value.\n\n8.3.15.\n\nAs to \"investment value\", Respondent conceded in the event of finding of liability, that:\n\n*\"Alternatively, the Claimants may seek to be put in the position in which they would have been had they never agreed to enter into the Concession Agreement: the return to them of their investment in the Concession. \"419*\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6671.\n\n8.3.16.\n\nAs foreshadowed above, the evidence of what Claimants invested in the concession is incomplete - it not having been put forward initially by Claimants as an alternative to its lost profits analysis. Nevertheless, there is useful evidence on the record and it is well settled that the fact that damages cannot be fixed with certainty is no reason not to award damages when a loss has been incurred.420 In such cases, approximations are inevitable; the settling of damages is not an exact science.421\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3), Award on the Merits of 20 May 1992, ICSID Rev. - FILJ 1993, at 328 et seq.; ICSID Rep. 1995, at 189 et seq.; 32 LL.M. 933 (1993), at 933 et seq.\n\nAs to the tendency and appropriateness of international tribunals to approximate damages, see *American International Group, Inc. et al. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran and Central Insurance of Iran (Bimeh Markazi Iran) (Case No. 2)* (Award No. 93-2-3), Award of 19 December 1983, at 109; and *Payne v. Iran (Case No. 335)* (Award No. 245-335-2), Award of 8 August 1986, 12 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 3, at \u00b6\u00b635-37.\n\n8.3.17.\n\nIn ascertaining the amount of Claimants\u2019 investments the Tribunal accepts that CAA was initially capitalised in the amount of US$30 million.422 We also accept that subsequently, CGE/Vivendi were required to invest in the concession to cover its operational deficits. Vivendi had paid in, by way of loan to CAA, an additional US$21.5 million at the end of November 1997423 Vivendi continued to underwrite CAA\u2019s ongoing losses thereafter and Mr. Hahn, CAA\u2019s Administrative and Financial Director since September 1997 and Vice Chairman at the time of the hearing, testified that CAA\u2019s accounts at the end of 2005 showed a debt owing from CAA to Vivendi of approximately US$75 million. He noted that Vivendi was continuing to finance CAA as of the date of the hearing, which indicated to us that CAA\u2019s debt to Vivendi at the date of the oral hearing almost certainly exceeded US$75 million.424 Neither Ms. Perrier\u2019s nor Mr. Hahn\u2019s testimony was contested or contradicted on these points.\n\nHahn Supplementary Affidavit, 14 February 2006 (Exhibit 788), at \u00b6\u00b620-21.\n\nPerrier Report, 10 February 2006 (Exhibit 803), atp. 10.\n\nTestimony of Hahn, Transcript of the hearing on the merits, Day 5, p. 1322 (28 July 2006). Mr. Hahn\u2019s testimony is supported by Ms. Perrier\u2019s Expert Report in which she advised that Vivendi\u2019s shareholders account in CAA\u2019s books, reflecting its investment in CAA, had increased to US$69 million at the end of August 1998, as a result of related losses from 30 November 1997 forward.\n\n8.3.18.\n\nThus, based on the evidence in the record, which we find to be both credible and sufficient, we find that CGE/Vivendi and CAA\u2019s other shareholders contributed US$30 million in equity capital to CAA and that CGE/Vivendi invested further sums of US$75 million (by way of loans) to finance the operation of the concession until its management was taken over by ENHOSA on 7 October 1998, and thereafter in its efforts to mitigate its damages through its various attempts to collect on outstanding receivables.425\n\nAbsent evidence of the amount of CGE shareholders account at 27 August 1997, we fix by estimation the amount of further investment at the date of expropriation at US$21 million, based on the evidence that US$21.5 million had been invested as at 27 November 1997.\n\n8.3.19.\n\nHaving regard to the Province\u2019s violation of Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT, we fix the investment value of the concession at the date of expropriation, 27 August 1997, in the amount of US$51 million (US$30 million capital plus US$21 million further debt investments). We also find that CGE/Vivendi invested by way of debt an additional US$54 million in CAA after that date (US$75 million less US$21 million). Further, and absent evidence to the contrary, we find CAA currently to be of no or nominal value.\n\n8.3.20.\n\nIn these circumstances, we calculate CAA\u2019s investment damages to be US$105 million (US$51 million plus US$54 million). As its 94.4% *de facto* shareholder, Vivendi is entitled to a 94.4% share of CAA\u2019s damages. However, in order \"to wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if the act had not been committed\" (the *Chorz\u00f3w* principle),426 it is necessary for any award of damages in this case to bear interest. This question is dealt with below in Section 9.\n\nSee the discussion above at 8.2.4.\n\n8.3.21.\n\nClaimants having jointly requested an Award for 100% of CAA\u2019s damages. Payment of the damages awarded may be made either:\n\n(i) in totality to CAA, Vivendi being made whole through its participation in CAA, or\n\n(ii) in the proportion of 5.6% to CAA and 94.4% to Vivendi.\n\nIn any event, each dollar paid to either Claimant shall satisfy one dollar owed to the other Claimant.\n\n**8.4. Additional Considerations**\n----------------------------------\n\n8.4.1.\n\nWhile Claimants submit that the principle of full compensation of fair market value is applicable, Respondent contends that full compensation is not appropriate. In this regard, Respondent relied on the doctrine of abuse of rights, Respondent\u2019s economic condition, and the fact that Respondent acted in the public interest.427\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6\u00b6612-617.\n\n8.4.2.\n\nIn particular, in its challenge to Claimants\u2019 damages claim, Respondent points to the economic and social crisis that occurred in Argentina and to the events affecting Argentina\u2019s economy in the course of, in particular, 2001 and early 2002. During that period the economy of the whole country was subject to considerable change and adjustment. For example: (i) the peso was devalued in January 2002 and quickly depreciated to a quarter of its previous value, with an exchange rate of nearly four pesos to the US dollar; (ii) inflation rose to 41% in 2002; (iii) unemployment rose from 12.4% in 1998 to 38.3% in 2001 and 23.6% in 2002; (iv) the poverty rate reached 57.5% in 2002; (v) inflation-adjusted wages fell by 23.7% in 2002; and (vi) supermarket sales fell by 5% in 2001 and 26% in 2002.428\n\nCounter-Memorial at \u00b6656.\n\n8.4.3.\n\nHaving regard to the nature and time frame of Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s breaches, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to reduce the award of full compensation to Claimants on any of these bases.\n\n8.4.4.\n\nRespondent says that any award of damage should be expressed in pesos, arguing that all payments to be made under the Concession Agreement were to be in pesos. This contention in the pre-hearing pleadings was addressed particularly to Claimants\u2019 case for damages, based as it was on a lost profits analysis. However, it is not disputed that CGE/Vivendi\u2019s investments were made in US dollars and/or French francs, and that the peso has since 2002 been devalued and depreciated very significantly against the US dollar.\n\n8.4.5.\n\nIn the *Lighthouses Arbitration,* the Permanent Court of Arbitration held that an injured party has the right to receive the equivalent at the date of the award of the loss suffered as the result of the illegal act and ought not to be prejudiced by the effects of a devaluation that takes place between the date of the wrongful act and the determination of the amount of compensation.429 We agree with this principle and also note that it is frequently the practice of international tribunals to provide for payment in a convertible currency.430 Accordingly, all sums awarded in and to be paid by reason of this Award are expressed in US dollars.\n\n*The Lighthouses Arbitration (France v. Greece)* (1956), 12 R.I.A.A. 155; 23 I.L.R. 659.\n\nSee the discussion *mMcCollough & Company, Inc. v. Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone, National* *Iranian Oil Company, Bank Markazi,* Award No. 225-89-3, Award of 22 April 1986, Iran-U.S. Cl. Trib., Yearbook Commercial Arbitration Volume XII (1987), pp. 316-331, 11 Iran-U.S. Cl. Trib. 3 (1986) at \u00b6107.\n\n**9. INTEREST**\n---------------\n\n**9.1. Compound Interest Claimed**\n----------------------------------\n\n9.1.1.\n\nClaimants seek compound interest at the rate of 9.7% on the damage amounts claimed in order to place them in the position they would have been had Respondent paid adequate compensation promptly upon the date of its expropriation of the Concession Agreement.\n\n**9.2. Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions on Interest**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n9.2.1.\n\nAbsent treaty terms or provisions in the governing law to the contrary, it is generally accepted that international tribunals may award interest to an injured claimant; indeed the liability to pay interest is now an accepted legal principle.\n\n9.2.2.\n\nThe provisions of Article 5(2) of the BIT reflect this, requiring as they do that the compensation to be paid by a state party for lawful expropriation \"... bear interest, computed at an appropriate rate, until the date of payment.\" Other things being equal, it is just as, if not more appropriate for interest to be paid on compensation for a wrongful expropriation.\n\n9.2.3.\n\nThe object of an award of interest is to compensate the damage resulting from the fact that, during the period of non-payment by the debtor, the creditor is deprived of the use and disposition of that sum he was supposed to receive.431\n\n*Evaluation of Damages in International Arbitrations,* Derains & Kreindler, Dossiers, ICC Publication No. 668 (2006) at 167.\n\n9.2.4.\n\nTo the extent there has been a tendency of international tribunals to award only simple interest, this is changing, and the award of compound interest is no longer the exception to the rule.432\n\nThe Tribunal made a non-exhaustive review of previous investment arbitration cases and found seven awards granting compound interest and three granting simple interest. The awards granting compound interest include *Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/l), Award of 30 August 2000, 40 LL.M. 36 (2001); *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. The Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1), Award of 17 February 2000, 15 ICISD REV - FILJ 169 (2000); *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Award of 13 November 2000; *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (Award) (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Award of 8 December 2000, 41 LL.M. 896 (2002); *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Award of 25 May 2004; *Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Award of 14 July 2006; *wA ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. The Republic of Hungary* (\"The ADC Case\") (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16), Award of 2 October 2006. The awards granting simple interest include *CME Czech Republic B. V.* *(The Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic,* Partial Award of 13 September 2001 (UNCITRAL); *Marvin Feldman v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/l), Award of 16 December 2002; and *Occidental Exploration & Production Co. v. Republic of Ecuador* (LCIA Administered Case No. UN3467) (US/EcuadorBIT), Award of 1 July 2004. In a recent article published on the TDM (Transnational Dispute Management) website in 2006, Wilson, Cain and Gray, surveying ICSID arbitrator awards and costs, found that of the 14 decisions they reviewed, eight granted compound interest, two did not disclose the calculation method used and one did not grant interest: James Gray, Jason Cain, Wayne Wilson, (Alvarez & Marsal), \"ICSID Arbitration Awards and Cost\", *Transnational Dispute Management,* Vol. Ill (5) (December 2006), at http://www.transnational-dispute-management.com.\n\n9.2.5.\n\nThis development is not surprising once it is recognised that compound interest is *not punitive* in nature. As the tribunal in *Santa Elena Case* pointed out, \"It is not the purpose of compound interest to attribute blame to, or to punish, anybody for the delay in the payment made to the expropriated owner; it is a mechanism to ensure that the compensation awarded the Claimant is appropriate in the circumstances\".433 The tribunal had noted that where the owner of property has lost the value of his asset but not been timely compensated, the amount of compensation that is later awarded \"... should reflect, at least in part, the additional sum that his money would have earned, had it, and the income generated by it, been reinvested each year at generally prevailing rates of interest.\"434\n\n*Compania del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, SA. v. The Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1), Award of 17 February 2000, 15 ICISD REV - FILJ 169 (2000), at \u00b6104.\n\n*Compania del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, SA. v. The Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1), Award of 17 February 2000, 15 ICISD REV - FILJ 169 (2000), at \u00b6104.\n\n9.2.6.\n\nReflecting this rationale, a number of international tribunals have recently expressed the view that compound interest should be available as a matter of course if economic reality requires such an award to place the claimant in the position it would have been in had it never been injured *(ie* had the wrongful act not taken place).435\n\nSee *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. The Government of Canada,* Arbitration under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Award in Respect of Damages by Arbitral Tribunal of 31 May 2002, UNCITRAL (NAFTA), at $89; *Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Award of 8 December 2000, 41 LL.M. 896 (2002), at \u00b6129; *and* *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Award of 25 May 2004, at \u00b6251.\n\n9.2.7.\n\nClaimants contend that compound interest should be awarded at the rate of 9.7%, corresponding to the discount rate applied in Claimants\u2019 DCF analysis and the quoted rate on the Argentine Treasury bond \"Argentina Rep 17\" on 27 November 1997. The Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimants would have earned 9.7%, compounded, on their respective shares of damages awarded, had such sums been timely paid at the date of Argentina\u2019s expropriation of the concession.\n\n9.2.8.\n\nHaving regard to Claimants\u2019 business of investing in and operating water concessions, to the anticipated 11.7 % rate of return on investment reflected in the Concession Agreement (which the parties had agreed to be appropriate having regard to the nature of the business, the term and the risk involved) and the generally prevailing rates of interest since September 1997, the Tribunal concludes that a 6% interest rate represents a reasonable proxy for the return Claimants could otherwise have earned on the amounts invested and lost in the Tucum\u00e1n concession. The Tribunal is also satisfied on the factual record that it is appropriate in this case to provide for compounding of such interest in order adequately to compensate Claimants for the loss of use of their investment over most of the last decade.\n\n**10. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**10.1. Disputing Parties Claims for Costs**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n10.1.1.\n\nEach of the parties sought an award of costs and legal fees with respect to these proceedings,436 although, towards the end of the jurisdictional phase, Respondent\u2019s counsel withdrew its costs claim for that phase of the proceedings. Having done so, Respondent then argued that it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to assess such costs to either party, given the \"very delicate, very sensitive topics and issues on which there is no precedent or practical guidance as to how the parties should perform and how the Tribunal should perform or act.437\n\nMemorial at \u2018409. Reply at \u00b6438. Counter-Memorial at \u00b6686. Rejoinder at \u00b6453.\n\nTranscript from the Jurisdictional Proceedings, Vol. 2, at p. 176 (17 August 2006).\n\n10.1.2.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal\u2019s request, Claimants submitted its costs claim for the jurisdictional phase on 31 August 2005 in the amount of US$701,961.08, covering attorney\u2019s fees and other costs but excluding payments to ICSID. Claimants also sought the appropriate portion of payments it had made to ICSID and the US$4,312.15 in transportation costs involved for the hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n10.1.3.\n\nOn 29 September 2006, following the oral hearing on substantive issues, disputing parties each submitted detailed claims for their costs of the substantive phase of the proceedings. Thereafter, on 6 October 2006, each commented on each other\u2019s claims.\n\n10.1.4.\n\nFor this phase, Claimants sought reimbursement of US$6,343,585.78, including US$364,973.00 on account of its payments to ICSID, and Respondent sought US$1,151,119.35, including US$355,000.00 on account of its payments to ICSID.\n\n10.1.5.\n\nThus, excluding payments made to ICSID, disputing parties total claims for costs in these proceedings are\n\n(i) Claimants - US$6,680,533.86 (US$701,961.08 + US$6,343,585.78 -US$364,973.00)\n\n(ii) Respondents-US$786,119.35 (US$1,151,119.35 - US$365,000.00)\n\n**10.2. Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion on Costs**\n----------------------------------------\n\n10.2.1.\n\nWhen the Original Tribunal came to consider an award of costs for the prior proceedings it examined a number of the factors considered by the tribunal in *Robert Azinian et al. v. The United Mexican States*438 These included the \"new and novel mechanism for the resolution of international investment disputes\" under NAFTA and that the unsuccessful party had \"presented their case in an efficient and professional manner\". It noted that: the prior proceedings \"raised a set of novel and complex issues not previously addressed in international arbitral precedent relating to the interplay of a bilateral investment treaty, a Concession Contract with a forum-selection clause and the ICSID Convention\"; the parties\u2019 counsel had presented their arguments in an efficient and professional manner; and, the position of the parties had evolved in the course of the proceeding. Accordingly, it determined that each side should bear its own expenses for the proceedings, and should share equally the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre.439\n\n*Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian, & Ellen Baca v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/97/2), Award of 1 November 1999.\n\nFirst Award, at \u00b6\u00b694-95.\n\n10.2.2.\n\nAfter the first phase of the annulment proceedings, the *ad hoc* Committee also concluded that, due to the importance of the arguments raised by the parties, each party should bear its own expenses.440 However, as regards Respondent\u2019s subsequent Request for Supplementation and Rectification of its Decision Concerning the Annulment of the Award, the *ad hoc* Committee ordered Argentina to pay the Committee\u2019s fees and expenses, as Respondent\u2019s Requests were unfounded and inappropriate. In particular, the *ad hoc* Committee took issue with Respondent\u2019s attempts to re-argue substantive elements of the Committee\u2019s decision.441\n\nDecision on Annulment, at \u00b6118.\n\nDecision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Request for Supplementation and Rectification of its Decision Concerning the Annulment of the Award of 28 May 2003, at \u00b643.\n\n10.2.3.\n\nIn our earlier Decision on Jurisdiction, we noted that Respondent\u2019s objections were not only without merit, but four of the five had also been taken before both the Original Tribunal and the *ad hoc* Committee and that one of these objections had been raised, each time unsuccessfully, before numerous other tribunals before which Argentina had appeared. In addition, we noted that Respondent\u2019s fifth jurisdictional objection had been raised for the first time eight and a half years into the proceedings. We concluded that all of Respondent\u2019s objections were unfounded, and had been raised inappropriately and, in the case of four of the five, in an attempt to reargue elements of the earlier decisions. Nevertheless, we determined that all questions concerning costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the parties would be left for the present proceeding for determination442\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6128.\n\n10.2.4.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that, at the time the prior proceedings were initiated, the arguments and issues then in the dispute were important, complex and relatively novel. They remained so in this second phase of the proceedings.\n\n10.2.5.\n\nAs regards disputing parties comparative success in their claims and defences, Claimants have succeeded substantially in both the jurisdictional and substantive phases of these proceedings. Moreover, Respondent has on a number of occasions sought to reargue jurisdictional issues that had previously been determined by the Tribunal, the Original Tribunal and the *ad hoc* Committee. In so doing, it unnecessarily extended and added considerably to the cost of these proceedings.\n\n10.2.6.\n\nGiven the background and history of the dispute, as well as all of the other circumstances of the case, the Tribunal concludes that it is appropriate that Claimants should receive reimbursement for the whole of their reasonable costs and counsel fees from Respondent, covering the jurisdictional phase of these proceedings which are hereby assessed at US$701,961.08. As regards the substantive phase, the Tribunal decides that disputing parties shall bear their own costs and counsel fees. The Tribunal further decides that disputing parties shall bear equally the arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses and the cost of the ICSID Secretariat, together with any related costs or charges regarding the use of the ICSID facilities.\n\n**11.

Introduction:**\n--------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 13 December 2007, the Argentine Republic (\"Argentina\" or \"the Respondent\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"Centre\" or \"ICSID\") an application in writing requesting the annulment of an Award dated 20 August 2007, rendered by the Tribunal in the arbitration between Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. (\"Vivendi\" or \"the Claimants\") v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3).\n\n2.\n\nThe Application was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"the ICSID convention\"), in it the Respondent sought annulment of the Award on all five grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n3.\n\nThe Application also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceeding (\"Arbitration Rules\"), for a stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application for Annulment is decided.\n\n4.\n\nThe Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on 19 December 2007, and on the same date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Rules, transmitted a Notice of Registration to the Parties. The Parties were also notified that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of 22 May 2008, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Parties were notified that an *ad hoc* Committee (\"the Committee\") had been constituted, composed of Professor Jan Hendrik Dalhuisen (Dutch), Dr. Ahmed S. El Kosheri (Egyptian) and Ambassador Andreas J. Jacovides (Cypriot). On the same date the Parties were informed that Dr. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n6.\n\nOn 23 May 2008, Claimants submitted some Observations requesting the immediate termination of the provisional stay of enforcement. In the alternative, Claimants requested that the *ad hoc* Committee order Argentina to provide financial security as a condition of any continued stay, in the form of either (i) an escrow deposit of at least US$177,534,408.53 with a first-tier international bank outside Argentina, or (ii) an irrevocable bank guarantee or security bond in the same amount issued by a first-tier international bank outside Argentina, immediately payable to or cashable by Claimants upon the issuance of a decision denying annulment.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 30 May 2008, the Parties were notified that Dr. Ahmed S. El Kosheri had been designated President of the Committee.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 27 June 2008, the Centre sent to the Parties copies of the Declaration signed by each Member of the Committee pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(1) and Arbitration Rule 6(2).\n\n9.\n\nThe first session of the Committee was held, with the agreement of the Parties, on 17-18 July 2008, at the premises of the World Bank in Paris, France, and several issues of procedure were agreed and decided. During the session, both Parties addressed the Committee with their arguments on the question of the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n10.\n\nAfter having heard the arguments of both Parties, the Committee decided to continue the stay of enforcement until a decision is taken by the Committee, and granted the Parties the opportunity to submit post-hearing observations in a simultaneous manner by 1 August 2008.\n\n11.\n\nOn 1 August 2008, both Parties submitted their post-hearing briefs, and the Members of the Committee subsequently met to render the present Decision.\n\n**B. The Parties Contentions:**\n-------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn 23 May 2008, Vivendi submitted a brief containing its legal position on the \"Termination of the Stay of Enforcement\", focusing on the background of the dispute and the decade of litigation which led to the present annulment proceedings. According to the Claimants, \"Argentina\u2019s recent conduct with respect to ICSID awards has evidenced a clear disregard for its obligations, under the relevant investment treaties and the ICSID Convention, to abide by and comply with awards rendered against it\". The Claimants invoked such conduct in order to categorize Argentina\u2019s recourse to the annulment proceeding as a \"further avoidance tactics\". In the view of the Claimants, this could only be achieved by requiring Argentina to provide binding, irrevocable, and financially meaningful evidence of respect for the outcome of the ICSID\u2019s system *(paragraph 3, page 2).*\n\n13.\n\nThe Claimants relied in this respect on what they claimed to be \"the uniform practice of *ad hoc* committees under the ICSID Convention by conditioning a stay on the provision of reasonable assurances\" on immediate compliance with the terms of the Award once the annulment is rejected, considering that \"the only reasonable assurance that Argentina can provide is deposit of the full amount of the Award, including interest, in an escrow account, or an irrevocable bank guarantee or bond securing payment of that same amount\" *(paragraph 4, page 2).*\n\n14.\n\nInvoking the previous decisions rendered by *ad hoc* committees which have ordered the award-debtor seeking annulment to provide a bank guarantee in order to obtain a continuance of the stay *(paragraphs 18\u201435, pp. 7-13),* Vivendi argued that Argentina\u2019s conduct leaves no doubt about its serious disregard for the ICSID system and the lack of intention to comply with ICSID awards, not only through public announcements under what is known as the *\"Rosatti Doctrin\u00e9\",* but more importantly by refusing in practice to effect payment under any of the awards outstanding against it.\n\n15.\n\nSuch constant behavior, according to Vivendi, is particularly demonstrated in the *CMS* case where Argentina made a solemn promise to the *ad hoc* committee in charge of the annulment proceedings, but failed to abide by and comply with this promise. According to Vivendi, Argentina is trying to avoid payment, months after the annulment process was terminated, by publicly disavowing its commitment to comply with the *CMS* Award *(paragraphs 38-81, pp. 14 - 33)**.*\n\n16.\n\nVivendi maintains that even with regard to the *Azurix* case, where no financial security or official assurance were provided, the *ad hoc* committee made clear that \"if Argentina were shown to intend *not* to comply with awards against it,..., then a requirement of financial security would be appropriate\" *(paragraph 85, page 35).*\n\nPursuing the analysis of the negotiating history and commentary of the ICSID Convention, as well as the \"*overwhelming\"* practice of the Member States, Vivendi ascertains that the State\u2019s compliance required under the ICSID Convention \"is unaffected by any procedure for collection\" *(paragraphs 106\u2014125, pp. 43\u201452).*\n\n17.\n\nIn its Observations submitted on 20 June 2008, Argentina called for the continued stay of enforcement, invoking what was held by the *ad hoc* committee in the *Azurix* case, emphasizing that the remedy of annulment is essential for the purpose of bringing legitimacy to the dispute resolution system created by the ICSID Convention *(paragraphs 13\u201425),* concluding that the \"Case Law is unanimous in considering the need for granting a continued stay of enforcement of the Award; this has been the decision of all the Annulment Committees in all the cases reviewed..., which comprise every single publicly [reported] case\" *paragraph 27).*\n\n18.\n\nAfter describing the economic effects of the severe crisis encountered in the recent years, Argentina indicated that *\"suspending the continued stay of enforcement of the Award* would bring about serious damage not only to Argentina,... but also to the investment arbitration system under the 1965 Washington Convention\" *(paragraph 41).*\n\nAs to Vivendi, Argentina argues that it cannot be considered \"suffering a damage derived from implementing a remedy especially provided for in the ICSID Convention...\" *paragraph 43).* Over and above, payment of interest \"constitutes a compensation that safeguards Vivendi\u2019s asset(s) against any hypothetical damage it might go through due to a stay of enforcement of the award\" *paragraph 49).*\n\n19.\n\nInsisting on the sufficiency of the guarantees of compliance contained in the Argentina\u2019s legal system, as well as in the Argentina/France BIT and in the ICSID Convention, the conclusions arrived at by the *CMS* annulment committee are deemed \"enough for the purpose of providing the necessary guarantees that the Award will be complied with in case the Request for Annulment is not accepted\" *paragraph 57, with further elaboration in paragraphs 58\u201471).*\n\n20.\n\nArgentina sustains moreover that \"[r]equiring a financial guarantee contradicts the objectives and purpose of the ICSID Convention and the mechanisms created thereby\" *paragraphs 74\u201485),* devoting attention to the cases which adopted a different point of view, starting from *Amco I* to *Repsol,* explaining to what extent they were issues emerging under clearly different circumstances *paragraphs 86\u201491).*\n\n21.\n\nIt may be appropriate to point out that in the closing paragraphs of Argentina\u2019s Observations of 20 June 2008, within the summing up of the main arguments invoked *paragraph 117),* there is the text of the Statement addressed by the *Procurador del Tesoro de la daci\u00f3n* to the *CMS* annulment committee as part of the submissions in the present case.\n\n22.\n\nVivendi\u2019s oral pleadings during the 17-18 July 2008 first session of the Committee with the parties and the Claimants\u2019 post \u2014 hearing submission of 1 August 2008, focused primarily on the eight \"circumstances\" Argentina invoked in support of the continuation of the stay, and on the weaknesses existing in support of Argentina\u2019s assertions about the means through which an ICSID award has to be complied with under domestic legal systems according to Argentina\u2019s understanding of Article 54 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n23.\n\nVivendi dismisses as being of no relevance all the arguments advanced by Argentina that the stay of enforcement should continue without any need to provide any security, whether financial or of any other nature *paragraphs 8 to 20, Claimants\u2019 post-hearing brief.*\n\nFor Vivendi, the Committee has to look \"for reasonable assurances of compliance\", and in the present circumstances \"the only reasonable assurance of Argentina\u2019s compliance is a financial guarantee. This is because Argentina has stated clearly and on the record before this Committee that it will not directly comply with the Award. Argentina has stated that, instead, it intends to put Claimants (and all other ICSID award \u2014 creditors) through the scrutiny of its own legal system, which, according to Argentina\u2019s own lawyers, holds out the possibility of reviewing, nullifying or reducing payment under the Award\" *paragraph 22, Claimants\u2019 post-hearing brief.*\n\n24.\n\nAddressing what is termed Argentina\u2019s \"defective interpretation\" of its obligations under both Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention, Vivendi\u2019s Lawyers ascertain that, \"Argentina is inconsistent and unclear about what it will require for Article 54 enforcement\", particularly in the light of what was said during the first day of the hearing, in comparison to what was stated in the second day about ICSID award holders being only \"subject to an unspecified administrative procedure and not to any judicial procedure for the enforcement of final ICSID awards\" *paragraph 27, and the precisions provided for in the following paragraphs from 28-34, Claimants\u2019 post-hearing brief.*\n\n25.\n\nClaimants\u2019 own understanding of the applicable procedures under Argentina Law *paragraphs 36\u201455, Claimants\u2019 post-hearing brief,* led them to emphasize primarily \"the vast legal and practical divide between Argentina\u2019s proposed system for enforcement under Article 54 on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the immediate, direct obligation to *\"abide by and comply with the terms of the Award \u2018under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention\" paragraph 56, Claimants\u2019 post-hearing brief.*\n\nConsequently, Vivendi concludes that: \"Argentina\u2019s legal system does not provide any assurance of compliance with ICSID awards... [i]t most certainly cannot be substituted for, or constitute a reasonable assurance of, compliance with the direct obligation to abide by and comply with ICSID awards under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention\" *paragraph 57, Claimants\u2019 post-hearing brief.*\n\n26.\n\nAfter providing its own interpretation about the close link and interrelationship between Article 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention *paragraphs 60-69, Claimants\u2019 post-hearing brief,* Vivendi stated clearly that \"accepting Argentina\u2019s interpretation will erode the foundations of the ICSID system. ICSID was designed as a self \u2014 contained system with its own limited review procedures *pe., Article 52 annulment)* and its own enforcement mechanism\" *paragraph 70, Claimants\u2019 post-hearing brief.*\n\n27.\n\nAs for the financial security required by Vivendi as necessary condition for the continuation of the stay of enforcement, at the last page of the Claimants\u2019 post \u2014 hearing submission, the logistics for the issuance of the requested bank guarantee were stated in a manner that calls for a first-tier international bank outside Argentina to provide Claimants an irrevocable promise to pay up to US$196,762,330.50 on demand, upon notification of the Committee\u2019s decision rejecting annulment, in line with the model bank guarantee attached as Exhibit 1186 to the said submission.\n\n28.\n\nArgentina\u2019s post \u2014 hearing submission, submitted equally on 1 August 2008, started by the denial of the accusation that the annulment request is of a dilatory nature. Its main argument to continue the stay was, however, that the Award was manifestly arbitrary and could therefore not sustain enforcement *paragraphs 1\u2014 24, Respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief.*\n\nIn addition Argentina presented arguments to the effect that the \"termination of the stay of enforcement and/or the imposition of a guarantee or the setting up of an Escrow account would result in irreparable harm\" *paragraphs 25\u201430, Respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief.*\n\nIn this respect, Argentina particularly emphasized the *\"cascading effect\u2019* impacting on the country \"not only in this case but also in the other 40 cases which started as a result of the economic crisis which affected all the Argentine population across -the- board. It would mean setting a precedent for the other Committees to require the same procedure, thus multiplying expenses, costs and consequences. We would no longer be speaking about US$171 million, but billions of dollars resulting in an unquestionably irreparable harm\" *paragraph 29, Respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief.*\n\nOn the other hand, Argentina ascertains that the stay of enforcement of the Award does not cause any harm to the Claimants *paragraphs 31 \u201437, Respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief,* in reliance mainly in citations from the *CMS* and *Azurix* decisions on this precise subject.\n\n29.\n\nApart from the non \u2014 dilatory nature of the annulment request and the lessons deriving from both *CMS* and *Azurix* decisions which did not require any security from Argentina, Argentina invoked, *interalia,* the following supplementary arguments:\n\n(1) That the first annulment in the Vivendi case was not requested by Argentina;\n\n(2) The possibility of having a split outcome as what took place in the *CMS* annulment case;\n\n(3) That Argentina\u2019s legal system provides adequate assurances of compliance rendering unnecessary any financial guarantee;\n\n(4) The \"hardships\" to be suffered if required to provide a financial security in order to obtain the stay of enforcement;\n\n(5) The risk of being unable to recover the Award payment from the Claimants in the event annulment is decided;\n\n(6) Argentina\u2019s compliance with all its international obligations under the ICSID Convention, with a record of no failure committed;\n\n(7) Posting a bank guarantee or other financial security could place Claimants in a more advantageous position than they would be if Argentina had not used the right of recourse to annulment, i.e. \"being penalized for exercising a *legitimate right\u2019 page 16, Respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief);* and finally\n\n(8) Claiming that \"the requirement for a guarantee and/or any other type of precautionary measure are not consistent with the ICSID Convention\" *page 17, Respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief.*\n\n30.\n\nParticularly its more elaborate demonstration that the domestic legal system of Argentina \"meets the international obligations in Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention *paragraphs 46\u201462, Respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief,* led Argentina to request \"that the stay of the Award previously requested by Argentina be continued and that the Respondent not be required to grant a guarantee for the amount of the Award\" *page 25, Respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief.*\n\n**C. The** ***ad hoc*** **Committee\u2019s Views:**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nIn deciding the question for a continued stay of the enforcement of the Award, the first task of the Committee is to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the relevant ICSID Convention Articles and Arbitration Rules in the light of their precise language, context, preparatory works, as well as the practice which prevailed particularly in the most recent annulment cases.\n\n32.\n\nThe first text that has to be taken into consideration is Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, which provides in its first paragraph:\n\n\"1. Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\" *(Emphasis added).*\n\nClearly the remedy envisaged in this opening paragraph is a restricted \"annulment\" process applicable equally to the foreign investor and the host State as the case may be, once the losing party invokes one or more of the grounds for annulment provided for in this paragraph.\n\n33.\n\nThen comes paragraph 5 of Article 52 which states that the *ad hoc* Committee, in charge of adjudicating the annulment request:\n\n\"[...] may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request\". *(Emphasis added).*\n\nAccording to the rule stated therein, if the applicant for annulment requests in his application a stay of the enforcement of the attacked award, this has two consequences: (a) there is a provisional stay of enforcement until the Committee once constituted rules on the request, and (b) in the exercise of its discretionary power, as reflected by the word \"may\", the *ad hoc* Committee continues the stay of enforcement only \"if it considers that the circumstances so require\". The continuation of the stay is therefore of an exceptional nature.\n\n34.\n\nThen follows the important Section 6 of the ICSID Convention entitled \"Recognition and Enforcement of the Award\" which contains three articles (53, 54 and 55). The exact meaning of these three articles and their relevance to the issue of staying enforcement need careful scrutiny as will be demonstrated herein after, particularly with regard to the interrelationship between Articles 53 and 54.\n\nArticle 53 reads:\n\n\"1. The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Convention, *(Emphasis added).*\n\n2. For the purposes of this Section, \"award\" shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52.\"\n\nThe basic uncontested rule provided for under the first paragraph of this article confirms an absolute logical premise according to which an award rendered under the ICSID Convention has to be considered *\"binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in the Convention\"*. The only qualification in this respect relates to the *\"extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention\",* which includes evidently the stay of enforcement in case of an annulment request under Article 52.\n\nConsequently, whenever the stay of enforcement comes to an end such as upon the rejection of the annulment request, the *\"binding* inherent character of the *\"award\"* becomes mandatory without any need or requirement for any other action to be undertaken. This rule constitutes a cardinal pivot upon which the entire structure of the ICSID system is based.\n\n35.\n\nOn the other hand, there is the equally vital question of the harmonization between this cardinal rule and the provisions contained in the following two articles (54 and 55) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nAddressed to all States that adhere to the ICSID Convention, and therefore not limited to the parties to the said arbitration dispute which led to the issuance of the *\"award\"* that become finally *\"binding* on them, Article 54 stipulates:\n\n\"1. Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State. A Contracting State with a federal constitution may enforce such as award in or through its federal courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent state. *(Emphasis added).*\n\n2. A party seeking recognition or enforcement in the territories of a Contracting State shall furnish to a competent court or other authority which such State shall have designated for this purpose a copy of the award certified by the Secretary-General. Each Contracting State shall notify the Secretary-General of the designation of the competent court or other authority for this purpose and of any subsequent change in such designation. *(Emphasis added).*\n\n3. Execution of the award shall be governed by the laws concerning the execution of judgments in force in the State in whose territories such execution is sought.\"\n\nIn close association with the rules contained in Article 54 addressed to all States members of the ICSID Convention, Article 55 provides:\n\n\"Nothing in Article 54 shall be construed as derogating from the law in force in any Contracting State relating to immunity of that State or of any foreign State from execution.\"*(Emphasis added).*\n\nUndoubtedly, one of the fundamental issues which the drafters of the ICSID Convention were keen to achieve was a total divorce from the recognition and enforcement system which prevailed under domestic laws or under the 1958 New York Convention governing commercial arbitration in the Member States. The domestic and the New York systems understandably require some recourse to domestic courts in order to obtain what is commonly known as an *\"exequatur\",* after engaging into judicial procedures that could be lengthy. To eliminate state intervention in the field of investment disputes, and as a necessary consequence of creating an international mechanism to adjudicate such investment disputes under the auspices of ICSID, all sort of recourse to domestic courts (in cases other than those provided by the Convention itself) was to be avoided in all States who are Members of the ICSID Convention, including the host State, in respect of the recognition or enforcement of a finally binding ICSID award rendered against a given State.\n\nArticles 54 and 55 were adopted for that precise purpose and were worded in a manner that excludes any possible court intervention in all States that adhered to the ICSID Convention, particularly the judicial organs of the State which was party to the dispute adjudicated under the ICSID rules.\n\nThis basic approach should always be kept in mind in the implementation of the rules provided for under Articles 54 and 55. In other words, the obligation explicitly provided for under the first paragraph of Article 54 according to which: *\"Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligation imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State\",* should be applied in the same manner whether the State in question is the State against which the recognition and enforcement is sought or is another State on whose territory certain assets are present and the pecuniary aspects of the award could be enforced upon.\n\nThe second paragraph of Article 54 merely organizes the logistics of seeking the recognition and enforcement, through the identification of a given judicial or other authority whose function is merely administrative, in the sense of undertaking the operation of receiving the copy of the award *\"certified by the ICSID Secretary-General\"* as required under Article 49, paragraph 1 of the ICSID Convention. This is the substitute for obtaining an *\"exequatur\"* in international commercial arbitrations.\n\n36.\n\nThe only question that could be possibly subject to interpretation relates to paragraph 3 of Article 54 in conjunction with Article 55. In Article 55, the domestic laws in force in the State in whose territories execution is sought is explicitly referred to as possibly being *\"a foreign state\"* with regard to immunity from execution. No such explicit qualification exists, however, in paragraph 3 of Article 54. Nevertheless, the finality of the ICSID awards requires necessarily that they should be protected from any possible court intervention in all Member States, particularly the State against whom the award was rendered.\n\nIn the opinion of the Committee, it would be contrary to the interpretation provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties to pretend that any organ of the host State can extend an administrative certification function to exercise any possible control over the enforcement process of pecuniary obligations under a finally binding ICSID award. Such activity would contradict the declared objectives of the ICSID Convention. Any possible intervention by a judicial authority in the host State is unacceptable under the ICSID Convention, as it would render the awards simply a piece of paper deprived from any legal value and dependent on the will of state organs. In French legal terminology, they would merely be *\"obligations potestatives\"* which are meaningless under all modern legal systems.\n\n37.\n\nThe above-stated essential observations reflecting the Committee\u2019s understanding of the relevant rules contained in Article 52, 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention, form the legal background governing the issues pertaining to the stay of enforcement in the present case. In other words, they have to guide the Committee in the exercise of its discretionary power in the light of the relevant circumstances which should be taken into consideration. The rules contained in Article 53 are of great significance in the exercise of the power to order the stay of enforcement provided for in Article 52, since an *ad hoc* Committee should take into account all the relevant circumstances, and among these circumstances figure in particular the prospects of obtaining the execution of the pecuniary obligations under the Award in case the annulment application fails.\n\nIn this respect, it has to be understood that various options exist: (a) to order maintaining the provisional stay or brining it to an end; (b) to make the stay conditional upon providing an official written statement on behalf of the Argentine Republic assuring its compliance with the present Award in the event it is not annulled; or (c) to make the stay subject to the requirement of posting a security in the form of a bank guarantee.\n\nIn opting for any one among the above-mentioned alternatives, the Committee has to decide in the light of two essential considerations:\n\n**First:** The essence of the arguments of both Parties in their written statements submitted prior to the first session of the Committee with the parties, which took place on 17-18 July 2008 and the oral arguments made during the first session, as well as in their post-hearing briefs of 1 August 2008, and which have been summarized in the previous section (B).\n\n**Second:** The manner in which pervious *ad hoc* committees have dealt with the issues under consideration in more or less similar circumstances, particularly during the last few years, taking into account, however, that previous rulings do not constitute binding precedents, but may be considered indicative of certain tendencies that could lead to contradictory results due to the differences existing in the circumstances prevailing with regard to each particular case.\n\nIn this connection, the Committee will not revisit the question whether the continuation of the stay can be made conditional. There is ample case law that has confirmed this possibility.\n\n38.\n\nAs a starting point, this Committee is of the opinion that solutions based on *prima facie* assumptions in favor of maintaining the initial stay without imposing any condition, or on the other hand requiring posting a bond or providing a bank guarantee as a necessary condition have to be excluded. Such dogmatic positions are not in conformity with the general rule provided for in Article 52, paragraph 5 which makes the granting of the stay of enforcement dependent on the relevant circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the Committee cannot adopt a *prima facie* presumption in favor of maintaining the initial provisional stay of enforcement, leaving only to the Committee the task of deciding whether the stay has to be with or without providing financial security. The Committee has to be convinced first that within the context of the pending case continuation of the stay of enforcement is justified.\n\n39.\n\nIn this vein the Committee cannot accept either any *prima facie* consideration pertaining to the merits of the grounds on which the application for annulment is based. The investigation to be undertaken could not therefore be affected by any considerations related to prospects of whether the annulment request could have a chance of being successful or would be rejected. Such consideration should be totally disregarded as the Committee is not supposed at the present stage to assess even in a preliminary manner, the merits of the annulment request or to decide whether it is dilatory or not.\n\n40.\n\nFocusing on the various considerations and arguments raised by Argentina to sustain its request for the stay of the enforcement, these arguments have been summarized in section 2 herein above (paragraph 29) and there is no need to repeat them or to elaborate within the present text. The Committee does not consider most of them sufficiently convincing with the exception of the one related to the harm that would be brought to the national economy of Argentina if it is faced with immediate financial burdens, not only with regard to the present case, but also when taking into consideration the over 40 other arbitration cases filed with ICSID and other international tribunals, and the *\"cascading effect impacting on Argentina\",* of lifting the stay of enforcement which could effectively lead to *\"an unquestionably irreparable harm\" paragraph 29, Respondent\u2019s post-hearing brief.*\n\nThe Committee is further of the opinion that as to immediate harm, Vivendi is less exposed as the interest accumulating during the annulment procedures constitutes a remedy that could be fairly considered appropriate in the event the annulment request fails.\n\n**In assessing the impact of the immediate harm that would arise to either Party, the Committee unanimously decides that the stay of the enforcement of the Award should continue pending its decision on Argentina\u2019s application for annulment, but that this continuation of the stay would have to be subjected to the steps set out hereinafter.**\n\n41.\n\nIndeed, what remains to be decided relates to the other no less important issue of whether the continuation of the stay should be granted unconditionally or on condition of providing certain assurances that could take various forms. These are not limited to providing a bank guarantee as advocated by certain authors and followed in a number of earlier cases, but could also lead to issuing certain official statements containing assurances, as embodied in recent cases, according to which the State concerned commits itself to proceed in full respect of its international obligations under the ICSID Convention if the request for annulment should fail and the Award becomes enforceable with the necessary result that the pecuniary compensation becomes due for payment in strict compliance with the rules contained in Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention as explained in paragraphs 34-36 herein-above.\n\n42.\n\nThe essential question that has to be considered in the present circumstances as counterpart to maintaining the stay of enforcement throughout the annulment proceeding is precisely how to provide the creditor beneficiary of the challenged Award with reasonable assurances of post-annulment compliance. The classical approach in this respect, taken by various *ad hoc* committees before 2006, was to consider whether or not a bank guarantee would be required.\n\nAs indicated in the *CMS v. Argentina* Committee\u2019s Decision of 1 September 2006 (paragraph 36, pp. 10-12), a review of the attitudes adopted in previous cases from *Amco I* and *II* to *Repsol* case (Decision of 22 December 2005), leads to the conclusion that there was a general pattern in favor of imposing the posting of a bank guarantee as condition for the stay of enforcement. However, this was not the outcome in the *MINE v. Guinea* case in 1988, in the *Patrick Mitchell v. DRC* case in 2004, nor in the *MTD v. Chile* case in 2005.\n\n43.\n\nAs of 2006 a new trend appeared, dispensing with the need for providing a financial guarantee if the State seeking annulment provided other reasonable assurances that the award, if not annulled, would be complied with. The CMS *ad hoc* committee followed that path by requesting a written statement from Argentina with respect to its compliance with the Award rendered under the ICSID Convention in the event that it was not annulled.\n\nThe CMS committee considered that Dr. Guglielmino, *Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina,* duly represents Argentina as provided for in Rule 18 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and that he has the authority to commit Argentina according to what had been decided in many comparable cases by international courts and arbitral tribunals *(references cited at paragraph 49 of the* CMS *Decision, pp. 15-16).* Consequently, the *ad hoc* committee in that case considered as a sufficient reasonable assurance the letter dated 12 June 2006, signed by Dr. Guglielmino, under which Argentina gave an undertaking to CMS Gas Transmission Company that:\n\n*\"in accordance with its obligations under the ICSID Convention, it will recognize the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal as binding and will enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories, in the event that annulment is not granted\" (paragraph 47, CMS Decision, page 15).*\n\n44.\n\nFifteen months later, the *Azurix v. Argentina ad hoc* committee in its Decision 28 December 2007, deemed it unnecessary to obtain a similar written official commitment particular to that case. It merely relied upon Argentina\u2019s undertaking of formal assurances provided under the Argentinean domestic legal system and Argentina\u2019s respect for its international obligations under the ICSID Convention *paragraphs 35-39 of the* Azurix *Decision).*\n\n45.\n\nExercising its own discretionary power to decide what is deemed appropriate in the light of what the present *ad hoc* Committee considers the proper interpretation of the relevant ICSID Convention\u2019s provisions as indicated previously (paragraphs 31 to 37), and the appropriate analysis of Argentina\u2019s legal position in this respect which does not conform entirely with the Committee\u2019s understanding of the interrelationship between Articles 53 and 54 (although the pleadings of Argentina on the second day of the oral hearing and as reflected in the post-hearing submission provided some useful clarifications), the Committee is convinced that the earlier assurances of post-annulment compliance provided by Argentina are no longer sufficient to grant an unconditional stay of enforcement. The official assurance particular to the present case has to contain a specific paragraph ensuring full payment to be made within a fixed period of time deemed reasonable by the Committee, or as an alternative to such a precise payment commitment a bank guarantee covering the entire sum due under the Award should be given.\n\n46.\n\nTherefore, the Committee unanimously decides that:\n\n**A. During the 30 calendar days following the notification by the ICSID Secretariat of the present Decision, the Argentine Republic has to provide the Committee with a more elaborate official letter to be issued by Dr. Guglielmino in his capacity as the** ***Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina*** **and as Agent of Argentina in the present annulment proceeding.

So also in this case. I believe this in general to be outside the Secretariat's remit and undesirable.\n\n3.\n\nThe role of the Secretariat in ICSID is substantially defined in Article 11 of the ICSID Convention and in Chapter V of the Administrative and Financial Regulations. It is a role of administration and support; it is clear that the Secretariat has no original powers in the dispute resolution and decision taking process.\n\n4.\n\nAs a minimum, the Secretariat is keen to do the recitals, but as the recitals in this case also show, by accommodating the Secretariat\u2019s involvement, they are becoming longer and longer. To do it properly, choices need to be made and it is hardly the task of the Secretariat to make them. What are the key facts and relevant arguments and how they should be presented in the final decision or award is for Arbitrators or *ad hoc* Committee Members to select and decide.\n\n5.\n\nAny other approach leads easily to a disjointed expose of arguments, counter-arguments, and decisions, especially in cases like the present one in which virtually everything was contested. Moreover, getting some presentable text out of the Secretariat in these circumstances delayed the final result considerably.\n\n6.\n\nAlthough summarising the arguments may well be helpful, it should ideally be done much earlier in the case before the hearing so that such a summary could be tested by Arbitrators or *ad hoc* Committee Members in the oral proceedings. If preparatory help of this nature is needed, Arbitral Tribunals or *ad hoc* Committees may be wiser to appoint their own assistant subject to their full control and direction. Any text tested in this manner might in appropriate cases then serve as part of the final award or decision.\n\n7.\n\nFor the Secretariat also to draft part or all of the decisions and reasoning would appear wholly inappropriate, even if following basic instructions of Arbitrators or *ad hoc* Committee Members whilst the final version would naturally still be left to them for approval. This would not appear to be sufficient to legitimize the text.\n\n8.\n\nDuring cross-examination it was asked why and questioned  how some arbitrators could do so many cases. One way is to farm out the drafting to others, in the case of ICSID to the Secretariat. There appears to be much appreciation for this by busy arbitrators but it is improper.\n\n9.\n\nIn this case, the ICSID Secretariat even took the view that on its own initiative it could intervene to \"streamline\" the texts earlier agreed by the present *ad hoc* Committee and senior Secretariat members approached *individual* Committee Members informally with a view to amending the text. This naturally caused great stress in the Committee, raising many fundamental issues of propriety, independence, open and direct communication between Committee Members, and confidentiality.\n\n10.\n\nIt is relevant in this connection to note that a practice appears to have developed in ICSID whereby all communications, also those between the Chairman and *ad hoc* Committee Members (or Arbitrators as the case may be) are conducted through the Secretariat, but this is not the system of the Convention, quite apart from the question whether it gives the Secretariat subsequently power to intervene.\n\n11.\n\nUnder Regulation 24(1)(b), the communication between *ad hoc* Committee Members (and Arbitrators as the case may be) is specifically carved out from intermediation through the Secretariat and this is so during the full pendency of the proceedings.\n\n12.\n\nThis ties in with Arbitration Rule 15 which makes the deliberations private and secret. Only Members of the *ad hoc* Committee (or Arbitrators as the case may be) shall take part and no other persons are admitted.\n\n13.\n\nThese rules stand to reason and are mandatory. It may be doubted whether they can be waived, which would at least require the consent of all Committee Members (or Arbitrators). It means that the deliberations and related exchanges cannot properly be conducted through the Secretariat. The role of the Secretariat in record keeping (to the extent records exist) does not distract from these rules; the deliberations are not part of\n\n14.\n\nThe need for this system to be respected is especially clear in a case like the present one where serious reputational issues are at stake. Privacy and secrecy are here of the essence to promote free communication whilst protecting *ad hoc* Committee Members (or as the case may be Arbitrators) but no less the persons whose reputation may be affected. It should be noted in this regard that the Secretariat, whilst receiving any of this information, appears to be under no similar secrecy obligation.\n\n15.\n\nHowever this may be, the ICSID Secretariat is not entitled to this information and can not act on it at will. On the basis of what it sees, it may well be able to take the initiative in alerting the Committee to clear mistakes or oversights but it should do so in writing, to all Members simultaneously, and not otherwise intervene in any way, except if formally asked to do so by the Committee for clearly defined purposes which should never affect the substance of the case, either directly or indirectly.\n\n16.\n\nAnother idea seems to be that the Secretariat is the voice of a *jurisprudence constante* which it is its task to advance and protect and which gives it an autonomous right of intervention. This is also profoundly mistaken and may be seriously prejudicial to the parties. In any event, it is far too early to assume the existence of such a *jurisprudence* and its status as law would be uncertain even if it existed. It may be recalled that in international law, there has never been a rule of binding precedent and this is so for very good reasons.\n\n17.\n\nFor the moment, the formulation of any such *jurisprudence* must be left to academics whilst it should be appreciated that to engage in a form of system creation in this manner or of thinking in academic models is not necessarily objective and free of intellectual prejudice or other bias. It is in any event not the allotted task of the Secretariat to assume the academic mantle and it is not, and could not be staffed for it.\n\n18.\n\nThe Secretariat should not have a policy or view in these matters but respect the authority and independence of the Arbitral Tribunals and *ad* for Committees which must find the law on the basis of the facts as they present themselves to them. This does not, of course, rule out that earlier cases may have persuasive value but it is for the relevant Tribunal or *ad hoc* Committee to decide in each instance, taking into account the submissions of the parties.\n\n19.\n\nSubmissions by the Secretariat, whatever the intention, are here legally irrelevant and no more than unsolicited opinion. Not being subject to examination by the parties, they cannot carry any weight.\n\n20.\n\nDecisions of this nature are also not legal textbooks or preachers\u2019 manuals and *ad hoc* Committees or Tribunals should not make them so in the reasoning. In any event, I do not believe that parties can be asked to pay for such exercises which make the opinions ever longer and more unmanageable or even muddled and do not do the international arbitration practice any favours. We are here primarily to solve a problem for the parties, not for others in the present or the future, and do not operate in this regard as ordinary judges.\n\n21.\n\nIn sum, the Secretariat is not the fourth member of ICSID Tribunals or *ad hoc* Committees and is not an interested party in any other way. It also does not have powers of scrutiny in the manner of the ICC Court. Although in practice it acts as appointing authority - in the case of *ad hoc* Committees of all Members - these Committees do not thereby become the extension of the Secretariat.\n\n22.\n\nThe potentially close interconnection in the present practices of the Secretariat between furthering its own role and its powers of appointment requires scrutiny and these practices themselves greater transparency. It lifts the question of the independence of *ad hoc* Committee Members and Arbitrators appointed by ICSID to the institutional level within ICSID. What is particularly necessary is that any semblance of collusion between the Secretariat and the Arbitrators or Committee Members it effectively appoints is avoided.\n\n23.\n\nIn short, it is urgent that the Secretariat clarifies its own role, which under the Convention, Administrative and Financial Regulations, and Arbitration Rules can be no more than one of support, respects and reinforces the privacy and secrecy of the deliberations of the *ad hoc* Committees or Tribunals, separates itself entirely and meticulously from the substance of the proceedings, appreciates that in legal matters wording is substance, organizes itself accordingly, and seeks financial support for this limited role only.\n\n24.\n\nTo conclude, the key issue in this annulment case was foremost the issue of independence of Arbitrators in the Second Award, but it became also an issue of the independence of the Members of the Second *ad hoc* Committee and, in that context, of the privacy and secrecy of their deliberations and drafts.\n\n25.\n\nWhat hovers over all of this is the potentially pernicious impact of the desire for (re)appointment in many, not least for financial gain, in which not only withholding from the parties relevant information, as was the subject of the decision of this *ad hoc* Committee, but also incurring the favour of the Secretariat, may be important issues in terms of independence. Recently, the world has been rightly dismayed at the complete lack of judgment in grasping senior bankers. Whatever the rights or wrongs in this case, it may serve as a serious warning, also for ICSID arbitrators.\n\n26.\n\nIf the self-cleansing forces in the international arbitration system are no longer sufficiently strong, and if there is thus a need for closer supervision of Arbitrators and *ad hoc* Committee Members, this would not be the task of the ICSID Secretariat, which itself should be properly supervised, but must come from a treaty change probably involving the creation and operation of a specialised *international court* which might also function as ultimate supervisor and referee in international commercial arbitrations (including challenges and recognition issues) where similar needs may increasingly exist."}], "Content": "Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for Annulment of the Award rendered on 20 August 2007\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF DEFINITIONS** | |\n| ***\"ad hoc*** **Committee\"** | The Second *ad hoc* Committee comprised of Dr. Ahmed S.

Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3). |\n\n**I. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 13 December 2007, the Argentine Republic (\"Argentina\" or \"the Respondent\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"Centre\" or \"ICSID\") an application for annulment of the Award dated 20 August 2007 (the \"Award\"). This Award had been rendered by a Tribunal composed of Mr. J. William Rowley (Canadian), Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler (Swiss) and Mr. Carlos Bernal Verea (Mexican), in the arbitration proceeding between Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. (\"the Claimants\") v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3).\n\n2.\n\nThe Application sought annulment of the Award on all five grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention and was made within the time provided by Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"the ICSID Convention\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Application also contained a request under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), for a stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application for Annulment was decided.\n\n4.\n\nThe Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on 19 December 2007 and transmitted a Notice of Registration to the parties on the same date in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The parties were also notified that the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of 22 May 2008, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Parties were notified of the constitution of the *ad hoc* Committee (\"the Committee\") composed of Dr. Ahmed S. El Kosheri (Egyptian), Professor Jan Hendrik Dalhuisen (Dutch) and Ambassador Andreas J. Jacovides (Cypriot).\n\n6.\n\nOn 23 May 2008, Claimants submitted Observations requesting the immediate termination of the provisional stay of enforcement. In the alternative, Claimants requested that the *ad hoc* Committee order Argentina to provide financial security as a condition of any continued stay, in the form of either (i) an escrow deposit of at least US$177,534,408.53 with a first-tier international bank outside Argentina, or (ii) an irrevocable bank guarantee or security bond in the same amount issued by a first-tier international bank outside Argentina and immediately payable to or cashable by the Claimants upon the issuance of a decision denying annulment.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 30 May 2008, the Parties were notified that Dr. Ahmed S. El Kosheri had been designated President of the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 27 June 2008, the Centre sent to the parties copies of the Declaration signed by each Member of the *ad hoc* Committee pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(1) and Arbitration Rule 6(2).\n\n9.\n\nThe first session of the **ad hoc** Committee was held, with the agreement of the parties, on 17-18 July 2008, at the premises of the World Bank in Paris, France. During the session, both Parties addressed the **ad hoc** Committee with their arguments on the question of the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n10.\n\nHaving heard the arguments of both Parties, the **ad hoc** Committee decided to continue the stay of enforcement until a decision was taken by the **ad hoc** Committee, and granted the Parties the opportunity to submit simultaneous post-hearing observations by 1 August 2008.\n\n11.\n\nOn 1 August 2008, both Parties submitted their post-hearing briefs. On 4 November 2008, the *ad hoc* Committee issued its Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award. Pursuant to paragraph 48(C) of such Decision, the stay of enforcement of the Award of 20 August 2007 terminated on February 8, 2009.\n\n12.\n\nThe Argentine Republic submitted its Memorial on the Annulment of the Award on 17 October 2008. The Claimants submitted their Counter-Memorial on Annulment on 15 January 2009. Argentina\u2019s Reply on Annulment was submitted on 6 March 2009 and the Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on 24 April 2009.\n\n13.\n\nThe **ad hoc** Committee held a hearing on annulment on from 15-17 July 2009 in Paris. On the last day of the hearing the President of the **ad hoc** Committee requested that the parties advise whether there was any indication on the record of the arbitration proceedings about UBS shareholdings in Vivendi during the period between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s appointment to the UBS Board on 19 April 2007 and the rendering of the Award on 20 August 2007. The parties submitted their observations in this respect on 24 July 2009, as requested by the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n14.\n\nOn 30 September 2009 the parties filed their statement of costs.\n\n15.\n\nICSID\u2019s Secretariat received from Argentina a communication dated 4 March 2010 containing certain information about events that took place in other instances. As instructed by the Committee, Vivendi was informed about the contents of that communication and was requested to respond thereto by 22 March 2010, which was duly done.\n\n16.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee declared the proceedings closed on 16 April 2010.\n\n**II. The Parties Contention**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. Argentina\u2019s position**\n---------------------------\n\n17.\n\nIn its Memorial on Annulment the Argentine Republic requests the annulment of the Award on the grounds set out in Article 52(1)(a), (b), (d) and (e) of the ICSID Convention, namely: i) that the Tribunal had not been properly constituted; ii) that the Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers; iii) that there had been a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure and; iv) that the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n**1. The Tribunal was not properly constituted**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal was not constituted in compliance with the provisions of the ICSID Convention and as a result of its improper constitution, had violated the general principles of impartiality and due process.\n\n19.\n\nThis claim was based on two main grounds:\n\ni. That Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler lacked the requirements imposed by the ICSID Convention and should have been disqualified during the proceedings, had the relevant information been disclosed (Article 51(1) (a) and (d) of the Convention).\n\nii. That, since the situation that gave rise to the conflict of interest was not disclosed, Argentina was unable to challenge Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. This prevented the proper application of the procedure for selection and challenge of arbitrators. Her ability to serve on the Tribunal was not assessed and the composition of the Tribunal was in breach of the Convention and basic principles of law.\n\n20.\n\nArgentina states that while Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was acting as a Member of the Board of Directors, Chairperson of the Nominating Committee and Member of the Corporate Responsibility Committee of the Swiss bank UBS, one of the largest and most influential institutions in the world, she was simultaneously serving as an arbitrator appointed by CAA and Vivendi in cases against the Argentine Republic. UBS held shares in Vivendi with voting rights valued at approximately \u20ac477,000,000 (2.38% of \u20ac 20,044 billion)1. At that time, UBS was the single largest shareholder in Vivendi2.\n\nSee Vivendi\u2019s 2006 Annual Report.\n\nSee Vivendi\u2019s 2006 Annual Report\n\n21.\n\nArgentina argues that in view of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s positions in UBS, she played a fundamental role in defining the strategy and corporate conduct of the bank as well as in the assessment of risk. Her duties towards UBS concerned the value of the bank\u2019s assets, including shares in other corporations. This interest in UBS\u2019 performance began in 2006 when she was appointed as a member of the Board of Directors. Argentina also argues that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was partially remunerated with UBS shares.\n\n22.\n\nWhile Argentina acknowledges that any issues regarding the ability of an arbitrator should be raised without delay during the arbitration proceeding3, in this case this was not possible because Argentina only learned about the facts and circumstances affecting Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s ability to serve as arbitrator in November 2007, after the Award of 20 August 2007 had been rendered.\n\nArgentina argues that this was the case in other pending arbitration proceedings in which Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was challenged *i.e. Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and InterAguas Servidos Integrales del Agua SA. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17) (hereinafter referred to as *Suez) v. Argentina I)* and *Suez, Vivendi Universal SA. and Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19) (hereinafter referred to as *Suez v. Argentina 2); Anglian Water Limited (AWG) v. Argentine Republic* (UNCITRAL Arbitration) (hereinafter referred to as AWG *v. Argentina); Electricidad Argentina SA. and EDF International SA. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/22) (hereinafter referred to as *EDF v. Argentina I)* and *EDF International SA., SAUR International SA. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas SA. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23) (hereinafter referred to as *EDF v. Argentina 2).*\n\n23.\n\nArgentina argues that any reasonable person confronted with the above facts would \u2014 at least \u2014 have serious doubts as to the appropriateness of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s participation in the proceedings. Argentina further states that no tribunal may be properly constituted if one of its members has failed to inform the parties of the existence of a situation that may jeopardize the result and the transparency of an arbitration proceeding.\n\n**2. The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to consider the applicable law**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Article 8.4 of the BIT*\n----------------------------\n\n24.\n\nArgentina considers that the *ad hoc* Committee must take into account Article 8.4 of the Agreement between the Argentine Republic and France for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the \"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\") which provides that the Argentine law and the provincial law of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n are the law applicable to the dispute.\n\n25.\n\nArgentina submits that the concession agreement was also part of the applicable law and that no violation of that agreement or the local law had been proved. Additionally, Argentina underscores that while the BIT is *lex specialis* with respect to customary international law, the local law is self explanatory and need not be supported by customary international law. Therefore, in order to determine whether there had been a violation of the standards set forth in the BIT, the Tribunal was bound to analyze Argentine law in general, and provincial law in particular, since this was the legal framework of the concession agreement.\n\n*(ii) CAA caused the failure of its own Agreement*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal not only failed to consider that CAA\u2019s fulfillment of its contractual obligations in good faith was a requirement to invoke the BIT, but it failed by also putting exclusive emphasis on the conduct attributed to the Province of Tucum\u00e1n in its role as a sovereign political power and not as a contracting party.\n\n27.\n\nArgentina contends that the Tribunal therefore failed to address CAA\u2019s inability to demand performance of the Concession Agreement when in breach of its own obligations under that same agreement. The Tribunal also failed to consider this breach by CAA, bearing in mind that it was an administrative contract for the concession of a utility that was essential for the population subject to the principles of continuity, regularity and universality.\n\n*(iii) The definitional and regulatory function of local law*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nArgentina asserts that according to the BIT, local law defines the scope, constitution, transfer, and termination of rights of an investor. Once such rights are defined, they may become protected by certain customary and contractual rules of international law. International law therefore does not define what an agreement, an action or property is.\n\n*(iv) The complex statutory system applicable to the dispute*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nArgentina notes that in paragraphs 4.5.1 and paragraphs 4.5.5 through 4.5.7 of the Award, the Tribunal referred to provincial public law as relevant to resolve the dispute, in particular with respect to the CAA agreement4. However, Argentina claims that the Tribunal did the opposite by relying on law that was not applicable to the dispute (*i.e.* paras. 7.3.8, 7.3.9, 7.3.10 & 7.3.11).\n\nAt a prior stage of this case, CAA stated that: \"The failure of the Tribunal to take the Concession Contract into account as part of the agreed applicable law amounted to a manifest failure to apply the proper law (...) under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention\". Exhibit 1094 *\" Opinion on the Application for Annulment in Compania de Aguas del Aconquija, SA. & Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Opinion of Professor Christoph H. Schreuer, August 20, 2001, para. 46.\n\n*(v) The concession agreement was the law applicable to the investment*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the Convention and Articles 2, 8.4 and 10 of the BIT refer to the law and principles of law applicable to the dispute and therefore establish the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Pursuant to these Articles, Argentina contends that the Tribunal should have examined and applied the Concession Agreement, which defines \"the terms of possible specific agreements concluded in relation to the investment.\"\n\n31.\n\nIndeed, according to Argentina, the Award should have applied local law to the concession Agreement since both parties alleged the other party\u2019s breach of the Agreement. The performance or breach by both contracting parties was therefore relevant to decide the case. The Argentine Republic especially requested that the Tribunal consider the circumstances, under which the concession had operated, an issue which, according to Argentina, was not addressed in the Award. For Argentina, this failure to consider a question presented by one of the parties constituted a ground for annulment of the Award, as it implied a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n32.\n\nArgentina alleges that without providing reasons for so doing, the Tribunal accepted as true particular events alleged by CAA and that it relied on these events to draw its conclusions. Instead, the investor\u2019s behavior should have been examined by the Tribunal, particularly pursuant to Article 4 of the BIT, as it only protects investors which have complied with the general local legislation and have fulfilled their obligations. According to Argentina, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to evaluate the investor\u2019s behavior under: i) local law; ii) Articles 2 and 8.4. of the BIT; and iii) under the *pacta sunt servanda* principle of public international law.\n\n**b) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the law applicable to the dispute**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nArgentina argues that the Tribunal failed to consider the local law applicable to the dispute and that this failure is evidenced by the Tribunal\u2019s incorrect interpretation and conclusion regarding CAA\u2019s unilateral termination of the agreement. The Tribunal failed to consider that CAA did not have the unilateral right to terminate the agreement due to the non-compliance by the conceding authority. On the contrary, Argentina argues that CAA breached the contractual provisions of the Agreement and as result, CAA could not act as if that type of termination had taken place. Both under the Agreement and under the laws of Tucum\u00e1n, such unilateral termination did not exist either in substance or form.\n\n**c) The Tribunal manifesdy exceeded its powers by failing to incorporate any fundamental evidence of CAA\u2019s and Vivendi\u2019s stockholding**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) The series of determinations on the issue of nationality*\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nPursuant to Article 1 (2) (c) of the France-Argentina BIT, the French nationality of the Claimants is an essential condition for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n*(ii) The First Tribunal\u2019s determination*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nAccording to Argentina, at the time the Concession Contract was entered into between Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. (\"CAA\") and the Tucum\u00e1n Province, the shares in CAA were divided between Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux (\"CGE\" \u2014 subsequently Vivendi Universal S.A.\u2014 both French companies), Dragados y Construcciones (DYCASA, a Spanish company), and Benito Roggio e Hijos S.A. (Roggio, an Argentine company).\n\n36.\n\nAfter the dispute had arisen, CGE acquired the shares of Dycasa and Roggio and then obtained effective control of CAA. During the first arbitration proceeding, Argentina raised objections *ratione personae* arguing that CAA should not be considered as a French investor5. The Tribunal decided that for purposes of resolving the case, and in view of the fact that CGE controlled CAA, CAA should be considered as a French investor from the effective date of the Concession Contract.\n\nCGE\u2019s position was that the critical date for purposes of determining control under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention (and under precedents interpreting the ICSID Convention) is the date for consent to arbitration which was the date in late 1996 when CGE submitted the dispute to arbitration\n\n37.\n\nFor Argentina, the First Tribunal\u2019s decision on this point was open to criticism for two reasons:\n\n(i) the election of two dates: the critical date for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention (which refers to the date on which the arbitration is commenced), and the critical date for Article 1 (2) (c) of the BIT (which refers to the time of the alleged breach of the obligation);\n\n(ii) there was no reference to the relevant test in Article l(2)(c) of the BIT or indeed to any other legal materials to support the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that CGE\u2019s control over CAA should be backdated to the effective date of the Concession Contract.6\n\nArgentina therefore considers this an unreasoned finding.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, para. 173.\n\n*(iii) The Decision on Annulment*\n---------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nAccording to Argentina the First **ad hoc** Committee appropriately characterized Article l(2)(c) of the BIT as relevant to the scope of operation of the BIT and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. However, Argentina argues that while the First **ad hoc** Committee considered that the First Tribunal arguably failed to state reasons for considering CAA as a French investor, it is difficult to follow how the Tribunal\u2019s finding could have \"played no further part in [its] subsequent reasoning\"7, because that finding was essential to upholding its jurisdiction over CAA. CAA was an Argentine company and, as such, could only have standing as a claimant against Argentina based upon the France-Argentina BIT if it satisfied the requirements of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article l(2)(c) of the BIT. Hence, in order to uphold the *ratione personae* jurisdiction, the Tribunal must have concluded that it was under the foreign control of CGE at the time arbitration proceedings were commenced, and was effectively controlled directly or indirectly by CGE at the time of the alleged breach of obligation forming the basis of the claim.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, para. 175.\n\n39.\n\nThe First *ad hoc* Committee then further elaborated upon its finding, asserting that:\n\n*\"[A]t the time of commencement of the arbitration CGE directly or indirectly controlled CAA, and for the purposes of ICSID jurisdiction that is enough. The Committee made it quite clear that in partially annulling the Tribunal\u2019s decision, including its finding that CAA was controlled by CGE from the effective date of the Concession Contract, it made no decision for itself on any aspect of the merits of the Tucum\u00e1n claim\"8.*\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA. and Vivendi Universal SA. (formerly Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux) v. Argentine Eepublic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3) (hereinafter referred to as *Vivendi v. Argentine),* (Supplementary Decision and Rectification Proceeding), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Request for Supplementation and Rectification of its Decision Concerning Annulment of the Award of 28 May 2003, para. 21.\n\n40.\n\nArgentina considers that the first sentence of this statement is correct in relation to the requirement of control in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, while the second sentence annulled the Tribunal\u2019s ruling that CGE\u2019s control of CAA applied retrospectively from the date of the Concession Contract.\n\n*(iv) The Second Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion on Jurisdiction*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nDuring the second arbitration proceeding, Argentina again contested the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on a number of grounds, including the issue of nationality. However, in its decision on jurisdiction the Second Tribunal, quoting the First Tribunal\u2019s decision on this point, stated that \"\u2019[t]he **ad hoc** Committee on Annulment did not annul this positive finding; it expressly endorsed it.\"9 In support of this conclusion, the Second Tribunal referred to the **ad hoc** Committee\u2019s decision on annulment, but not to the clarification and its supplementary reasons that it had annulled the positive finding in question. The Second Tribunal went on to reiterate this conclusion, verbatim, in the Award10.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (Resubmission Proceeding) Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November, 2005, para. 69.\n\n*Ibid,* Award of 20 August 2007, para. 2.6.5.\n\n42.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Second Tribunal relied on the doctrine of *res judicata* (see paragraphs 87 and 97) in holding that \"this Tribunal is precluded from reconsidering the jurisdictional determination of the First Tribunal pursuant to which the requirements for jurisdiction were fulfilled\". Argentina argued that the Tribunal offered no independent analysis or reasoning in support of its conclusions on the issues claimed by Argentina.\n\n*(v) Manifest Excess of Juris diction*\n--------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nArgentina argues that the Second Tribunal had jurisdiction over the dispute only if the requirements of Article l(2)(c) of the BIT had been met. The Second Tribunal\u2019s application of the doctrine of **res judicata** clearly required that the relevant parts of the decision of the First Tribunal still remained after the annulment decision issued by the First **ad hoc** Committee. The Second Tribunal erred in applying parts of the decision of the First Tribunal as **res judicata** when the First **ad hoc** Committee had annulled that portion of the First Tribunal\u2019s findings. In doing so, Argentina submits that the Second Tribunal manifestly exceeded its jurisdiction.\n\n*(vi) Failure to state reasons*\n-------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nAs provided by the *ad hoc* committee in *MINE v. Guinea,* \"the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B, and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or law.\"11\n\n*Mantime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic op Guinea* (hereinafter referred to as *MINE v Guinea),* Decision on the Application by Guinea for Partial Annulment of the Arbitral Award rendered on 6 January, 1988, 14 December 1989, para.5.09.\n\n45.\n\nArgentina argues that, by relying on *res judicata* and on grounds of the First Tribunal\u2019s decision which had been annulled, the Second Tribunal failed to provide a valid chain of reasoning to its conclusion. A reader of the Second Decision on Jurisdiction and the Second Award therefore provided with no valid reasons to guide it \"from points A to B\". It appears that the Second Tribunal\u2019s reasoning was based on the mistaken belief that the *ad hoc* Committee had endorsed, rather than annulled, the relevant parts of the First Tribunal\u2019s Award.\n\n**d) The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by deciding on issues that were outside its jurisdiction since they were** ***res judicata***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nArgentina argues that the First Tribunal\u2019s decision should be considered *res judicata,* in so far as it was not annulled by the First ***ad hoc*** Committee. The First ***ad hoc*** Committee concluded that: \"the Tribunal exceeded its powers in the sense of Article 52 (1)(b), in that the Tribunal, having jurisdiction over the Tucum\u00e1n claims, failed to decide those claims.\" In analyzing how the First Tribunal failed to decide on certain claims, the First ***ad hoc*** Committee stated that:\n\n*\"[t]he Tribunal, in dismissing the Tucum\u00e1n claims as it did, actually failed to decide whether or not the conduct in question amounted to a breach of the BIT In particular, the Tribunal repeatedly referred to allegations and issues which, it held, it could not decide given the terms of Article 16 (4) of the Concession Contract, even though these were adduced by Claimants specifically in support of their BIT claim. \"12*\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (First Annulment Proceeding) Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, para. 111.\n\n47.\n\nThe First *ad hoc* Committee added a footnote specifically indicating the paragraphs of the First Award to which it referred. These are paragraphs 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81. However, according to Argentina, paragraph 91 of the First Award was not annulled by the *ad hoc* Committee. That paragraph referred to the fact that:\n\n*\"[T]he Tribunal specifically asked the parties to address whether there was evidence in the record that actions of the legislators of Tucum\u00e1n that adversely affected the operations of Claimants (eg., demonstrations and encouragement of nonpayment of invoices') were, in fact, directed or coordinated by the Governor of Tucum\u00e1n or his cabinet\"13*\n\nIn addition, the First Tribunal concluded that:\n\n*\"[A]fter carefully reviewing the extensive memorials and testimony, the Tribunal finds that the record in these proceedings regarding these allegations does not establish a factual basis for* *attributing liability to the Argentine Republic under the BIT for the alleged actions of officials of Tucum\u00e1n\".14*\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (Original Arbitration Proceeding), Award of 21 November 2000, para. 91.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (Original Arbitration Proceeding), Award of 21 November 2000, para. 91.\n\n48.\n\nTherefore, Argentina argues that the First Tribunal\u2019s decision is *res judicata* in this respect and it could not be decided again by the Second Tribunal\u2019s Award. According to Argentina, this did not imply that the Second Tribunal could not decide on the issue of whether the actions by the Tucum\u00e1n Legislators which adversely affected the operations of the claimants \"were, in fact, directed or coordinated by the Governor of Tucum\u00e1n or his cabinet.\"15\n\n*Ibid,* para. 91.\n\n49.\n\nArgentina submits that the Second Tribunal did not observe these limits and mentioned these issues in its conclusions. In view of the First **ad hoc** Committee\u2019s Decision, the Second Tribunal could not rely on \"a coordinated effort by the Governor of Tucum\u00e1n or its cabinet against the Concession Agreement\"16. This allegation had already been decided by the First Tribunal and it was not annulled by the First **ad hoc** Committee.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, para. 203.\n\n50.\n\nAccording to Argentina, CAA took advantage of this new opportunity to reargue the issue and file new evidence on this matter and the Second Tribunal examined these acts and determined that they violated the fair and equitable treatment standard of the BIT.\n\n**3. The Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based and the Tribunal departed from a fundamental rule of procedure - Article 52(1)(d) and (e)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Second Tribunal seriously failed to establish the relevant facts of the case by: (1) considering events that had not been established as proven; (2) failing to consider questions presented by the parties; (3) basing its decision on evidence not incorporated into the proceedings; (4) partially considering some evidence and disregarding other evidence, thus using evidence selectively and arbitrarily; (5) selectively taking apart fundamental evidence; (6) using contradictory criteria; and (7) reversing the burden of proof.\n\n52.\n\nA fundamental issue for Argentina is that the Tribunal specifically determined that the BIT had been violated through the existence of a campaign to deprive CAA of its investment by the government. According to Argentina, the Second Tribunal\u2019s conclusion about a campaign has many failings. These failings include the fact that the issue was *res judicata* and that the Second Tribunal failed to provide its reasoning or the evidence on which it based its findings.\n\n**a) Abusive use of testimonial evidence**\n------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nArgentina argues that the Tribunal preferred to use testimony of the Claimants\u2019 officials instead of documentary evidence on the record. In so doing, the Tribunal contradicted its own criterion, having itself asserted that \"more was required than\" statements or brief testimonial references in order to prove a given fact17.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (Resubmission Proceeding), Award of 20 August 2007, para. 8.3.9.\n\n**b) The Tribunal failed to consider questions presented by the parties**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal violated a fundamental rule of procedure by failing to examine the allegations made by the parties, contrary to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(h). Argentina contends that failure to address a question presented by a party or to decide such a question is a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\n*(i) The Rais Report should have been considered in full as requested by Argentina*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal failed to address a request by Argentina to fully consider the \"Rais Report\", this being an essential piece of \"balanced and very accurate\" evidence attributed to an impartial third party hired to scrutinize the situation in Tucum\u00e1n. According to Argentina, had the Tribunal adopted the conclusions of the Rais Report in their entirety, the result of this dispute would have been different as the report dismissed the existence of a conspiracy and/or coordinated effort by the Tucum\u00e1n authorities to frustrate the Concession Agreement.\n\n*(ii) The Tribunal reduced the dispute to four controversial issues thus leading to annulment under Article 52(1)b, (d) and (e) of the ICSID Convention*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Second Tribunal reduced the disputed issues to four controversial issues:\n\n*\"(i) First: the causes and foreseeability of the black water issue; (ii) Second: the renegotiation of the Concession Agreement; (iii) Third: whether ERSACT acted correctly or not in its capacity as regulator; (iv) Fourth: the seventy changes to the 6 june 1997 bill18*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, para. 227.\n\n57.\n\nTherefore, according to Argentina, the Tribunal disregarded fundamental issues related to the dispute between the parties, *inter alia,* (a) the social conditions existing in the Province of Tucum\u00e1n at the time of the investment and, consequently, the feasibility of the Concession Agreement; (b) the dispute between the parties related to the right to water as an essential human right; (c) the failure to fulfill the investment obligations in connection with the *non adimplimenti contractus* principle; (d) the nature of the concession contract under Argentine administrative law and the applicable public law of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n; and (e) the scope of responsibility of provincial government officials according to the applicable law.\n\n**c) The Tribunal based its decision on evidence not incorporated into the proceedings**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) The Tribunal based its decision on the existence of a conspiracy by the Tucum\u00e1n agencies to make the concession agreement unsuccessful. Such conspiracy never existed or was never proven.*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Second Tribunal\u2019s decision was based on the idea that the Government of Tucum\u00e1n organised a conspiracy in order to harm the concessionaire or -in the best of cases- to renegotiate the Concession Agreement and obtain an adjustment of the concession\u2019s service tariffs. Argentina contends that by adopting this criterion, the Tribunal breached Articles 52(1)(d) and (e) since, as stated above, the First *ad hoc* Committee did not annul paragraph 91 of the Award. According to Argentina, the First Tribunal in fact had determined that no evidence was submitted to establish the existence of such a campaign.\n\n*(ii) The argument of a campaign (or conspiracy) has no support in the evidence and has serious contradictions*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe First Tribunal determined that there was no evidence in the record showing the existence of a conspiracy, a fact that required proof of the intent of the Governor of Tucum\u00e1n or his cabinet to coordinate a campaign designed to make the concession fail. According to Argentina by basing its decision on the theory of the campaign, the Second Tribunal breached not only article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention but also breached Article 52(1)(b) and (d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n60.\n\nThe Award is based merely on inferences because the Tribunal did not include any evidence in the decision and does not provide reasoning that easily leads to a conclusion.\n\n61.\n\nAccording to Argentina, two paragraphs of the Tribunal\u2019s Award should be highlighted because they show that the conspiracy is the thread on which the Award\u2019s conclusion is based:\n\n*\"On the facts before us, it is only possible to conclude that the Bussi government, improperly and without justification, mounted an illegitimate \"campaign\" against the concession, the Concession Agreement, and the \"foreign\" concessionaire from the moment it took office, aimed either at reversing the privatisation or forcing the concessionaire to renegotiate (and lower)* *CAA\u2019s tariffs\"19*\n\n*\"Here, the Province\u2019s actions \u2014 from the very opening months of the concession, continuing through its wrongful regulatory action and culminating in the unilateral amendments to the 8 April Agreement \u2014 had the necessary consequence of forcing CAA to terminate the Concession Agreement\"20*\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (Resubmission Proceeding), Award of 20 August 2007, para. 7.4.19.\n\nId., para. 7.5.33\n\n62.\n\nFor Argentina, CAA did not establish, and consequently the Tribunal had no evidence to prove, that there had been reasons for a coordinated effort against the company. The Argentine Republic claims that the Tribunal deemed that certain issues had been proved when they had not, and granted evidentiary value to issues with no such value, both with respect to specific events and the existence of a campaign. According to Argentina, these are not errors in the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation but an obvious violation of a fundamental rule of procedure, since issues with no supporting evidence were deemed proven. Furthermore, the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning does not lead \"from points A to B\" since there is evidence missing to arrive at its conclusions and hence there are grounds for annulment under Articles 52(1)(d) and (e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n63.\n\nArgentina submits that a rule of procedure has been seriously breached, and that in reaching this conclusion the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers. Therefore Argentina requests that annulment of this conclusion and of the Award as a whole.\n\n*(iii) With respect to the campaign, the Tribunal resolved extra petita*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal stated in paragraph 7.5.3.1. that the existence of the campaign had been alleged by the Claimants, while according to Argentina they had expressly abandoned the existence of a campaign as an argument in this dispute.\n\n*(iv) There is no evidence in the record to show a campaign by Bussi against CAA*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal does not have evidence to support the following statement: \"By contrast, contrary statements and conduct were well documented. In the 1995 election campaign, General Bussi\u2019s party told the people that the tariff was too high and that, if elected, it would fix it.\"21 There is no evidence in the Award to prove this. This statement is unfounded and, due to its implications, provides grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) and (e).\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (Resubmission Proceeding), Award of 20 August 2007, para. 7.4.4.2.\n\n**d) Other issues not supported by evidence**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the following other issues included in the Award were not supported by evidence:\n\n(a) There was no document in the record to support Paragraph 4.3.6. that \"The Ministry of the Economy [...] requested the Consortium to [...] provide a reduced tariff adjustment coefficient and an increased projected recovery rate.\"22\n\n(b) There was no evidence to support the statement in paragraph 4.10.2 of the Award, where the Tribunal accepts that CAA submitted a model invoice to ERSACT before it began billing users. According to Argentina, this document never formed part of the evidence in the record23 and therefore it was impossible to challenge the accuracy and content of it. Although the Tribunal never saw this document, the following statement was included in the Award: \"(T)he invoices corresponded precisely to the model previously submitted to ERSACT and, as with the model, also contained an additional charge for taxes, which included provincial taxes, municipal levies and federal taxes.\"24\n\n(c) The Tribunal based part of its decision on evidence dismissed by the Tribunal itself. In section 8 of the Award, concerning damages (paragraph 8.3.7. and footnote 414), the Tribunal relied on a document submitted by the Claimants that it had expressly rejected. This is the case of Exhibit No. 1069. Valid evidentiary exhibits end at Exhibit No. 106525.\n\n(d) No evidence supported the award of damages. There was no valid document in the record allowing the Tribunal to conclude: \"CAA\u2019s accounts at the end of 2005 showed a debt owing from CAA to Vivendi of approximately US$75 million.\"26\n\n(e) Despite the lack of evidence, the Tribunal concluded that the government of Tucum\u00e1n caused the failure of the concession agreement by the unilateral incorporation of \"70 changes\" into the 22 April 1997 Bill.\n\n(f) The Tribunal did not provide any support to find the negative effect of the \"70 changes\" to the Concession Agreement.\n\n(g) Key decisions by the Tribunal were based on a document whose authenticity was challenged: Argentina refers to sections of the Award dealing with water turbidity from December 1995 through March 1996. Argentina argued that the Tribunal based its conclusion almost exclusively on the ERSACT / CAA Sub-Committee on Water Quality, Final Report27, a document which Argentina had challenged and requested its exclusion28. Argentina argues that Exhibit 870 was not submitted with the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, since it is obvious that it was prepared after November 2004 and before the Claimants\u2019 Reply of 15 February 2006. Thus, according to Argentina, a new (and false) report containing 26 pages was written and compiled with other documents to fabricate Exhibit 870. Argentina alleged that the Claimants did not prove that Exhibit 870 had any validity as evidence.\n\nAccording to Argentina, Exhibit 123, referred to by the Tribunal (and its translation into English, Exhibit 939) shows that this is untrue. See Argentina\u2019s Memorial paragraph 261.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Memorial footnote 50 and paras. 136 and 262-263.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (Resubmission Proceeding), Award of 20 August 2007, para. 4.10.3.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Memorial at para. 265.\n\n*Vivendi c. Argentina,* (Resubmission Proceeding), Award of 20 August 2007, para. 8.3.17\n\nExhibit 870: \"ERSACT / CAA Sub-Committee on Water Quality, Final Report \u2019.\n\nSee Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder at paragraphs 104-106.\n\n**e) Independence and impartiality of arbitrators**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nArgentina asserts that the independence of arbitrators and the equality between the parties are essential rules of procedure. Also essential \u2014and acknowledged as such by the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules\u2014 is the arbitrators\u2019 obligation to declare their own independence and impartiality and to maintain such attributes throughout the arbitration proceedings by informing the parties of any situation that might cause a variation in such qualities.\n\n68.\n\nArgentina argues that for a dispute resolution system to function properly, the parties must believe that their dispute will be decided by a fair tribunal that will observe the basic principles of due process. Argentina referes to Article 12 of the UNCITRAL Model Law, which states that circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to the impartiality of the arbitrators must be disclosed.\n\n69.\n\nAn arbitrator\u2019s independence is normally questioned if there is, or there has been in the past, a relationship between the parties to the dispute and the arbitrator. Under ICC practice, there is no need for a direct relationship between the arbitrator and one of the parties for it to affect the ability of an arbitrator to serve in a given case.\n\n70.\n\nArgentina stresses that the ICC Court case law is unanimous in holding that challenges should be upheld if there is a connection between the arbitrator and an affiliate of one of the parties. The necessary corollary to the arbitrator\u2019s duty of independence and the parties\u2019 right to a fair process is the obligation of the arbitrators to disclose each and every fact or circumstance that may affect the perception of the parties as to the impartiality and independence of the arbitral tribunal and its members.\n\n*(i) The IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nArgentina mentions that the International Bar Association\u2019s Committee on Arbitration and ADR appointed a Working Group of 19 experts in international arbitration to study the issue of independence and impartiality in international arbitration. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was among the 19 experts selected to participate in the Working Group.\n\n72.\n\nThe Working Group prepared the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration, issued in 2004. The Working Group also drafted lists of specific situations that, in its view, should or should not lead to an obligation of disclosure or disqualification of an arbitrator.\n\n73.\n\nAs clarified in the official explanation to General Standard 2, the Working Group believed that the broad standard of \"any doubts as to an ability to be impartial and independent should lead to the arbitrator declining the appointment\". In order for standards to be applied as consistently as possible, it established that the test for disqualification should be an objective one (described under point 2.3.1. of the waivable Red Tist) which deals with situations where \"The arbitrator currently represents or advises one of the parties or an affiliate of one of the parties\".\n\n74.\n\nAccording to Argentina, taking a more lenient approach, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler would be in the situation described under the Orange Tist at 3.5.4 where \"The arbitrator is a manager, director or member of the supervisory board, or has a similar controlling influence, in an affiliate of one of the parties, where the affiliate is not directly involved in the matters in dispute in the arbitration.\"\n\n75.\n\nArgentina argues that, irrespective of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s situation, it was irrefutable that she should have disclosed her affiliation to UBS and Argentina should have been given an opportunity to challenge her continuation as a member of the Tribunal. Argentina argues that this position is supported by the IBA Working Group, which stated that in case of doubt, an arbitrator must always disclose a certain situation.\n\n*(ii) Independence and impartiality are even more important in ICSID Arbitration*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nArgentina relies on Article 1429, Article 4030 and Article 5731 of the Convention to emphasize the importance of the quality of arbitrators, and of their independence and impartiality in investment arbitration and particularly due to its bearing on public issues and in civil society.\n\n\"Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.\"\n\n\"Arbitrators may be appointed from outside the Panel of Arbitrators, [...] Arbitrators appointed from outside the Panel of Arbitrators shall possess the qualities stated in paragraph (1) of Article 14.\"\n\n\"A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.\"\n\n77.\n\nArgentina notes that absolute impartiality refers not only to the subjective impartiality of an arbitrator\u2019s judgment, but also to the objective appearance of impartiality on the part of the arbitrator before third parties. Accordingly, Argentina submits that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s position in UBS created, objectively viewed, a conflict of interest which was incompatible with the necessary appearance of impartiality required of an ICSID arbitrator. The conflict of interest remained throughout the arbitration proceeding which clearly justifies the annulment of the Award in its entirety.\n\n78.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Award should be annulled because of the two main grounds for annulment presented Articles 52(1) (a) and (d)\u2014 given not only that the decision was rendered by a tribunal with the participation of an arbitrator who lacked the qualities required by the ICSID Convention and by general principles of law, but also because Argentina \u2014due to the unjustifiable lack of disclosure by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2014 was deprived of the right to challenge her position on the Tribunal. This amounts both to a procedural breach and to an issue of irregular composition of the Tribunal.\n\n**4. The award of damages**\n---------------------------\n\n79.\n\nArgentina submits that the Tribunal correctly understood that almost 95% of CAA\u2019s claim *[i.e.* US$ 300,532,000] was related to lost profits, and was exclusively dependent upon expected profits that the Concession Agreement had never guaranteed. According to Argentina, CAA relied exclusively on a discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology to value damages, which required the likelihood of profits to be established with a degree of certainty (Para. 8.3.4 of the Award).\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal did not accept the valuation methods proposed by the parties32. Instead it used a third method of its choice, the investment value of the concession, which, according to the Tribunal, seemed to offer the closest proxy of the compensation it wished to award33.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (Resubmission Proceeding), Award of 20 August 2007, paras. 8.3.11 and 8.3.14.\n\n*Ibid.,* at paragraph 8.3.13.\n\n81.\n\nSince none of the parties had submitted a valuation based on such criteria, Argentina argues that the Tribunal received no evidence to support the amount of compensation calculated according to such approach.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal relied on this approach despite the lack of evidence, openly breaching the Convention and the Rules by manifestly exceeding its powers. By doing so, Argentina claims that the Tribunal distorted the evidence in the record regarding Vivendi\u2019s investment in CAA and it incorporated evidence which had been expressly excluded from the process by agreement of the parties and by the resolution of the Tribunal itself, as the sole basis for its decision. This constituted a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. In addition, the Tribunal\u2019s decision lacked any reasoning, thus supporting annulment under Articles 52(1)(b), (d) and (e) of the Convention.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal based its calculation of Vivendi\u2019s investment in CAA and, consequently, of the compensation granted, on the addition of three items: (i) a US$ 30-million capital contribution; (ii) further debt investments amounting to US$ 21 million; and (iii) additional debt investments in CAA by CGE/Vivendi totaling US$ 54 million.\n\n84.\n\nAccording to Argentina, by using this method of calculation, the Second Tribunal committed an error that provide for the annulment of the Award pursuant to Articles 52(1)(b), (d) and (e), given that, in the context of arbitration proceedings with over one thousand pieces of evidence filed and no less than five different valuation reports, the Tribunal showed an alarming disregard for the evidence provided, leaving aside documentary evidence submitted by the parties.\n\n**a) Detailed explanation of the grounds for annulment related to damages**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nAccording to Argentina, in spite of clear instructions from the Tribunal and the parties\u2019 agreement of 1 July 200434, CAA attempted to file new evidence on 23 August 2006, supposedly for the purpose of supporting a valuation based on the investment.\n\nAlso recorded in an attachment to the minutes of the Second Tribunal\u2019s session of July 7, 2004. The agreement states that \"[t]he Tribunal shall not receive any testimony or other evidence that has not been introduced by writing, unless the Tribunal determines that exceptional circumstances exist.\"\n\n86.\n\nIn view of the above-referenced agreement, the Tribunal could not consider testimony or any other evidence that had not been introduced in writing. Nonetheless, according to Argentina, the Tribunal did so by validating a statement given by Mr. R\u00e9gis Hahn during his oral testimony which was used by in the Award to justify investments made in the amount of US$ 75 million35.\n\nTranscript, Day 5, P:1322, D12-14.\n\n87.\n\nA similar situation occurred with Ms. Dominique Perrier\u2019s testimony, which the Tribunal also took into consideration to justify its Award. The witness herself had specifically represented that her testimony was exclusively of a methodological nature, and that she had not had access to the company\u2019s accounting books. The Tribunal supported Mr. Hahn\u2019s testimony with Ms. Perrier\u2019s testimony, both of them lacking any evidentiary value and in contradiction with the testimony given by Mr. Fran\u00e7ois de Rochambeau.\n\n88.\n\nAdditionally Ms. Perrier\u2019s testimony contradicts her own source (Mr. de Rochambeau\u2019s affidavit). In paragraph 129 of Mr. Rochambeau\u2019s affidavit, he stated that Vivendi/CGE\u2019s total investment in CAA as of August 1998 was approximately $69 million, while on page 10 of Ms. Perrier\u2019s report (citing Mr. Rochambeau) she stated that the $69 million figure referred to Vivendi/CGE\u2019s debt investment (excluding equity).\n\n89.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Second Tribunal granted double compensation by relying both on the capital contributions to CAA and Ms. Perrier\u2019s reference to the US$ 69 million36.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (Resubmission Proceeding), Award of 20 August 2007, footnote 424.\n\n90.\n\nArgentina further mentions that when CAA and Vivendi were asked to identify any indication of the US$75 million investment made by Vivendi in CAA in addition to the capital contributions mentioned in the record,37 the Claimants were only able to point out the three brief transcription lines where, during his direct examination, Mr. Hahn made such a statement.\n\nTranscript, Day 11, P: 2815, L:6-13.\n\n91.\n\nArgentina contends that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in the Award by validating and accepting Mr. Hahn\u2019s testimony as a ground for its decision on compensation, as the documentary evidence to support it was not properly made part of the record in accordance with the agreed procedures and testimony had not been introduced in writing prior to the hearing on the merits, thus seriously affecting due process, the equality of the parties and the agreement between the parties, and providing clear grounds to annul the Award pursuant to Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention.\n\n**b) The award of damages is not based on available evidence and failed to state the reasons on which it is based**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nArgentina contends that the Second Tribunal provided no justification, based on the documentary evidence in the record, for its compensation award of US$105 million, and this decision was made in breach of the Second Tribunal\u2019s duties. The compensation granted totals US$27.5 million, 35% more than the maximum amount that can be derived strictly from the evidence produced by the Claimants. Further, in no way did the compensation awarded reflect the documented and verifiable amounts of Vivendi\u2019s actual investment in CAA, as evidenced by the record.\n\n93.\n\nWhen calculating the compensation claimed by CAA and Vivendi, the Second Award does not attempt to explain how or why, the Tribunal only based its decision on: (i) the alleged capital contributions made by Vivendi and third parties in CAA; and (ii) the alleged financial -and other-contributions made by Vivendi. Assuming, that the Tribunal was entitled to calculate the compensation for the Claimants using the verifiable amounts invested as an approximation, according to Argentina, this does not explain why the Tribunal changed its criterion halfway through its analysis.\n\n94.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal provided no reasons whatsoever for its calculation of the compensation owed to the Claimants and, therefore, the Award should also be annulled under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n**c) Calculation of Interest**\n------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the Tribunal\u2019s decision regarding interest also justified annulment of the Award. The Tribunal, without providing any reason whatsoever and exceeding its powers, awarded interest to Claimants in relation to the compensation imposed in an amount exceeding their claim.\n\n96.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the Award state as follows:\n\n*\"(vi) Respondent, the Argentine Republic, shall also pay interest, compounded annually, at the rate of 6.00%, (a) on the amount of US$51,000,000.00 as from 28 August 1997 until the date of payment, and (b) on the further amount of US$54,000,000 as from 5 September 2002 until the date of payment.\"38*\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (Resubmission Proceeding), Award of 20 August 2007, para. 11.1.\n\n97.\n\nThe two dates mentioned in the Award as the starting date for accruing interest, according to Argentina, lacked any sense or explanation:\n\n*(i) 28 August 1997:* The Award acknowledges that the Claimants considered that the interest on any compensation should be paid as from 27 November 1997. However, without attempting to provide an explanation, the Tribunal decided that the interest on the amount of US$ 51 million should be paid as from 28 August 1997. The Award included no reasons for granting interest from a date preceding the date proposed by Claimants and thus constituted an *ultra petita* excess of power. According to Argentina, this also constituted a manifest excess of the Tribunal\u2019s powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and a serious omission of the grounds on which the Award is based, contemplated by the provisions in Article 52(1)(e).\n\n*(ii) 5 September 2002:* According to Argentina, there is no indication in the Award, nor anywhere else in the record, as to why 5 September 2002 should be considered a date relevant to any loss by CAA or Vivendi in the amount of US$ 54 million. This, at the very least, constituted a serious omission by the Tribunal is stating the grounds for its decision. Therefore, the Award should be annulled pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\n**B. Claimants\u2019 position**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Independence of Arbitrator Kaufmann-Kohler**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Claimants submits that the alleged lack of independence of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler has already been rejected by another tribunal in another case specifically involving her, Argentina, and Vivendi. In any event, the Claimants considered that this claim is untimely, procedurally barred, and had no substantive basis and should therefore be dismissed.\n\n**a) Factual Background**\n-------------------------\n\n99.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, at the end of 2006, UBS held 1.97% of the shares in Vivendi, while that shareholding had declined to 1.58% by the end of 2007. Many \u2014 if not all \u2014 of those shares were held by UBS on behalf of third parties.\n\n100.\n\nOn 19 April 2006, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was elected as a member of the UBS Board of Directors for a three year term. According to the Claimants, the Swiss Banking Taw and the UBS Articles of Association provide that the Board of Directors is responsible for the \"supervision and control\" of UBS management and has \"ultimate responsibility for management\"39. Furthermore, the Board of Directors is distinct from the Group Executive Board, which is responsible for implementing the Board of Directors\u2019 strategic decisions and plays a more direct executive role in the company.\n\nSee *Suez\\* v. Argentina I,* Decision on the Second Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of an Arbitral Tribunal, 12 May 2008, para. 38.\n\n101.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, as a member of the Board of Directors, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was required to be fully independent of management40 and she took steps to ensure that her Board position at UBS would not raise any concerns regarding her impartiality or independence as arbitrator, including the submission to UBS of a list of all her arbitrations. UBS advised her that, with the exception of a single matter (from which she recused herself), her role on the UBS Board presented no conflicts of interest41. Moreover, according to the Claimants, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was not generally kept informed of individual UBS securities holdings and received no information regarding Vivendi.\n\n*Ibid* at paragraph 38; Swiss Implementing Ordinance on Banks and Savings Banks, 17 May 1972, Art. 8(2) (Exhibit 1192) (09691).\n\nProfessor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s Letter at 2 (Exhibit 1194) (09739); *Suez v. Argentina I,* Decision on the Second Proposal for Disqualification, paras. 14, 47; *EDF v. Argentina 2,* Challenge Decision Regarding Professor Gabrielle Kaufman-Kohler, 25 June 2008, para. 59(iv).\n\n102.\n\nAs a result, according to the Claimants, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was unaware of UBS\u2019s shareholding in Vivendi until 29 November 2007, when Respondent raised the issue in the *Suez v. Argentina42* case, while the Second Tribunal had already issued its Award on 20 August 2007.\n\n*Suez v. Argentina I; Suez v. Argentina* 2; *AWG v. Argentina,* Decision on a Second Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal dated 12 May 2008.\n\n**b) The Second Tribunal Was Properly Constituted**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Respondent\u2019s assertion that the Second Tribunal was not properly constituted should be disposed of since the Second Tribunal was constituted on 14 April 2004 and Professor Kaufmann-Kohler did not join the UBS board until more than two years later, on 19 April 2006. Thus, there could not possibly have been any conflict or any question regarding Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s independence at the time the Second Tribunal was constituted.\n\n**c) Respondent\u2019s Challenge to Arbitrator Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s Independence Is Procedurally Barred and Groundless**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Respondent\u2019s alternative challenge based on the assertion of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is meritless. Respondent claimed that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was or could have been motivated by the prospect of a financial benefit were Vivendi to prevail on its claims. Further, Respondent asserted that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler knew or should have known that such a conflict of interest existed, and that she failed to disclose such conflict.\n\n105.\n\nClaimants refer to two other cases, *Suez et al. v. Argentina* and *EDF International SA. et al. v. Argentina,* in which Respondent raised identical challenges. In **Suez** \u2014 which also features Vivendi as a claimant \u2014 Respondent\u2019s challenge concerned the very same set of factual allegations regarding the same parties: namely, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s relationship with UBS and UBS\u2019s connection to Vivendi. In *EDF,* the issue was extraordinarily similar, and involved UBS\u2019s connections to certain of the corporate claimants in that case. The tribunals in both **Suez** and *EDF* rejected Respondent\u2019s challenges.\n\n*(i) The Standard for an Arbitrator Challenge on Annulment*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nClaimants argue that the Respondent cannot demonstrate any departure whatsoever from the provisions of ICSID Convention Articles 14(1) and 57, let alone a serious departure. According to the Claimants, the standard for annulling an award on the basis of a lack of independence or impartiality is more exacting than the requirements for a challenge of an arbitrator.\n\n107.\n\nAnnulment is an extraordinary remedy, the application of which, according to the Claimants, must be weighed against the critical importance of finality in arbitration. The grounds that Respondent has invoked require the demonstration of a serious departure from the applicable rule. That element, in turn, is only established if the particular problem raised by the challenge is \"such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide\"43.\n\n*MINE v. Guinea,* para. 5.05.\n\n*(ii) Respondent\u2019s Challenge to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler Is Procedurally Barred*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimants states that in the **Suez** case, the Respondent raised the very same challenge against Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. The remaining members of the **Suez** tribunal rejected Respondent\u2019s arguments in full, determining that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler does not manifestly lack the independent judgment required by Article 14(1).\n\n109.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants argue that Respondent is barred by the principle of *res judicata* from raising the same issue in these proceedings, since the requisite elements of *resjudicata \u2014* identity of the parties, identity of the object, and identity of the cause \u2014 are satisfied given that the challenge in *Suey* dealt with the very same facts, arguments, and ICSID Convention standards, against the very same arbitrator, with respect to the very same claimant \u2014 Vivendi.\n\n*(iii) There Is No Material Connection Between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and Vivendi*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent\u2019s challenge would also fail on the merits, since the connections between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and Vivendi are too minor and remote to give rise to reasonable or manifest doubts as to her impartiality and independence.\n\n111.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, a party challenging an arbitrator\u2019s independence may not rely on the existence of any kind of connection between the arbitrator and a party. Rather, the connection \"must be evaluated *qualitatively* in order to decide whether it constitutes a fact indicating a manifest lack of the quality of independence of judgment and impartiality required of an ICSID arbitrator.\"44\n\n*Suez v. Argentina I,* Decision on the Second Proposal for Disqualification, para. 33, (emphasis in original).\n\n112.\n\nGeneral Standard 2 of the International Bar Association Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration, which Respondent has cited, provides that \"justifiable doubts\" may exist regarding an arbitrator\u2019s independence if the arbitrator has a \"significant financial or personal interest in the matter at stake,\" such that a \"reasonable and informed third party\" would find a \"likelihood that the arbitrator may be influenced by factors other than the merits of the case.\"45 Thus, in order to demonstrate a manifest lack of independent judgment, an arbitrator\u2019s connection to a party must be \"material,\" and much more than *de minimis.*\n\nInternational Bar Association Guidelines on Conflicts of Interests in International Arbitrations, General Standard 2, 22 May 2004, *available at* www.ibanet.org; see also *EDF v. Argentina* at para. 114.\n\n113.\n\nClaimants argue that the connection between UBS and Vivendi was *de minimis* by any definition. UBS\u2019s holdings in Vivendi constituted less than 0,046% of UBS\u2019s total assets. Additionally, as mentioned above, many of these limited UBS holdings in Vivendi were held *not* for UBS\u2019s own account, but rather on behalf of customers to whom it provides asset management or brokerage services, with respect to which UBS itself did not stand to benefit from Vivendi\u2019s financial performance.\n\n114.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, if the role that UBS\u2019s shareholdings in Vivendi could play in UBS\u2019s overall business was miniscule, the potential impact of the ICSID arbitration proceedings on these holdings was positively microscopic.\n\n115.\n\nClaimants argue that even if Professor Kaufmann-Kohler held shares or share options in UBS, and even though she had a role on UBS\u2019s board, she could not have had any plausible motive, much less a \"significant interest\" to favor Vivendi. According to the *Suez* tribunal, \"Professor Kaufmann-Kohler derives no benefits or advantages from and is in no way dependent on [Vivendi] as a result of the alleged connection,\" while \"UBS shareholdings in [Vivendi] are not material to UBS financial performance, profitability, or share price and in no way affect the compensation that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler earns as a director of UBS.\"46\n\n*Suez v. Argentina I,* Decision on the Second Proposal for Disqualification, para. 40.\n\n*(iv) Professor Kaufmann-Kohler Did Not Know, and Had No Reason To Know, of Any Connection to Vivendi*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nClaimants allege that even if Professor Kaufman-Kohler had a material connection to Vivendi, her independence and impartiality were necessarily unaffected for the simple reason that she *did not* know of any such connection. As Professor Kaufmann-Kohler has expressly stated in writing to an ICSID tribunal, she did not become aware of any UBS shareholdings in Vivendi until 29 November 2007, well after the Award was rendered and the case concluded.\n\n*(v) Unanimity of the Award*\n----------------------------\n\n117.\n\nFinally, Claimants argued that any concerns regarding Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s independence and impartiality are further mitigated by the fact that the Award was rendered unanimously.\n\n**2. Applicable Law (Manifest Excess Of Powers)**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) The Second Tribunal Properly Applied the BIT and Other Applicable Sources of Law**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Second Tribunal properly applied the BIT and other sources of law, ascertained the facts (including the content of the Concession Agreement and the parties\u2019 conduct under its terms), identified the legal requirements imposed by the Treaty, and applied those legal standards to the facts.\n\n**b) Respondent\u2019s Invocation of Domestic Law Is Misplaced and Inconsistent with Its Prior Position**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Respondent Misconstrues the Roles of the BIT and Domestic Taw*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Respondent\u2019s assertion that the dispute is primarily governed by domestic law is unsupportable. According to the Claimants, the First Tribunal found that it was not entitled to decide claims under the Concession Agreement. The First *ad hoc* Committee agreed, adding that Claimants\u2019 BIT claims were governed by the ICSID Convention, the BIT, and international law. The Second Tribunal therefore merely followed the First *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s approach and this cannot ground a request for annulment.\n\n120.\n\nSecond, the Claimants argue that the Respondent waived any argument that the Second Tribunal was obligated to apply domestic law or the terms of the Concession Agreement since it forcefully rejected the application of domestic law, particularly Argentine and Tucum\u00e1n contract law, to decide the treaty claims.\n\n121.\n\nThird, the decisions of the First Tribunal and the First *ad hoc* Committee, as well as Respondent\u2019s own prior focus on international law, are well supported by relevant authority. The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility make it clear that the propriety of an act under domestic law does not determine whether that act violates international law. ILC Article 3, entitled \"Characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful,\" provides that:\n\n*\u2018The characterisation of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed ly international law. Such characterization is not affected ly the characterization of the same act as lawful ly internal law\"*\n\n122.\n\nThe Claimants also rely on the decisions issued by other *ad hoc* annulment committees and Tribunals in ICSID merits proceedings which have adopted this line of analysis, *i.e. Wena Hotels v. Egypt47, Agurix v. Argentina48* and *MTD Equity v. Chile49.* Claimants also referred to Article 8(4) of the BIT, which addresses applicable law, refers to the BIT, host state law, international law, and the terms of any agreements between the parties (e.g., the Concession Agreement).\n\nSee *Wena Motels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4) (hereinafter referred to as *Wena v. Egypt),* Decision on Annulment, 5 February 2002, para. 23.\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01 /12) (hereinafter referred to as *Azurix v. Argentine!).*\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile SA. v. Eepublic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7) (hereinafter referred to as *MTD v. Chile).*\n\n123.\n\nFourth, the Claimants consider that the issue may well be moot for purposes of Argentine law since international law and treaties are incorporated into the body of Argentine law, and indeed prevail over other inconsistent provisions of domestic law. Additionally, Article 10 of the BIT provides that any \"special agreement\" shall govern the investment only to the extent that the terms of the agreement are \"more favorable\" than those of the BIT.\n\n124.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Argentina misinterpreted the function of the BITs by asserting that any issues relating to concession agreements for utilities in Argentina must be governed by domestic law rather than by international law, since the BIT does not address substantive provisions in this area. Claimants state that BITs are not designed to govern specific types of investments in particular sectors and instead mandate general standards of treatment (*eg.,* fair and equitable treatment) which tribunals are authorized to apply, taking into account the particular circumstances of each case, as well as general principles of international law and decisions of prior tribunals.\n\n*(ii) The Second Tribunal Properly Dealt with the Concession Agreement*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nWith respect to Respondent\u2019s claims that the Second Tribunal \"failed to consider\" that CAA\u2019s alleged breaches of contract caused a failure of the concession, the Claimants argue that the Respondent, once again, contradicted its own previous position since it had insisted that the Second Tribunal was *not* permitted to interpret the contract or decide whether the parties had breached the contract.\n\n126.\n\nRespondent invoked the principle of *except\u00fao non adimpleti contractus* arguing that in breaching the Concession Agreement, Claimants forfeited any right to claim against Respondent for undermining that same contract. Claimants refer to the First *ad hoc* Committee\u2019s decision that the Second Tribunal was permitted to take the terms of the Concession Agreement into account as part of the factual background against which Claimants\u2019 treaty claims were to be considered.\n\n127.\n\nClaimants argue that the Second Tribunal did not ignore the contractual issues; instead, it simply concluded that the actions of Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s officials were not taken due to any alleged contractual breaches by CAA, but rather taken for improper political ends, and for the purpose of forcing Claimants to renegotiate the concession. For the Claimants this is a factual finding that is not subject to review in an annulment proceeding.\n\n*(iii) The Second Tribunal Properly Considered the Conduct of Tucum\u00e1n Officials*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nClaimants consider that it is incorrect to argue that the Second Tribunal should have applied Argentine law to determine whether certain conduct could be attributed to the government of Tucum\u00e1n, and ultimately to Respondent. As the First *ad hoc* Committee explained, the issue of attribution in this context is governed by international law.\n\n129.\n\nClaimants also address Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Second Tribunal improperly failed to apply domestic law to determine whether certain authorities\u2019 actions demonstrated Tucum\u00e1n\u2019s \"official\" position regarding certain matters *(i.e.* dispute between CAA and the Province regarding whether certain taxes were to be absorbed by CAA or instead charged to customers separately from the basic tariff). In this respect, Claimants argue that these are factual findings not subject to review on annulment.\n\n130.\n\nThird, Respondent argued that the Second Tribunal disregarded applicable provincial law *(i.e.,* Tucum\u00e1n law) in determining that various Tucum\u00e1n authorities acted for political purposes rather than in proper exercise of their duties. According to the Claimants, this represents an attempt to re-argue the merits of the case. Claimants highlight that the claims were brought under the BIT, and not under the Concession Agreement or domestic law. Those claims are to be judged under standards of international law.\n\n*(iv) The Second Tribunal Properly Addressed the Termination of the Concession Agreement*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nRespondent argued that the Second Tribunal wrongfully failed to apply domestic law to the issue of the termination of the Concession Agreement. According to the Claimants, by the time CAA gave formal notice of termination on 27 August 1997, the Tucum\u00e1n authorities had already committed numerous breaches of the BIT. Thus, it was unnecessary for the Second Tribunal to decide whether there were contractual grounds for CAA to rescind.\n\n**3. Nationality Of CAA (Manifest Excess Of Powers / Failure To State Reasons)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) The Second Tribunal Properly Found that the Issue of CAA\u2019s Nationality Was** ***Res Judicata***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent\u2019s argument contesting CAA\u2019s nationality for purposes of the BIT, the Claimants rely on the Second Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction, which found that the issue of CAA\u2019s nationality for jurisdictional purposes was *res judicata,* and thus was not subject to further review.\n\n133.\n\nArticle l(2)(c) of the BIT defines the term \"investors\" to include \"legal persons effectively controlled directly or indirectly by a national of one of the contracting Parties.\" As with other jurisdictional issues, the facts relevant to determining whether this definition has been satisfied are those that were in existence at the time arbitral proceedings were commenced. Thus, in determining whether CAA was an \"investor\" and a proper claimant in this case, the critical question was whether CGE, a French company, effectively controlled CAA on the date arbitral proceedings were commenced.\n\n134.\n\nClaimants argue that the First Tribunal, First **ad hoc** Committee, and Second Tribunal answered this question in the affirmative. The First Tribunal observed that as of June 1996, CGE owned 68.33% of CAA\u2019s equity capital and had beneficial ownership of another 16.67%. The parties agreed that as of late 1996 \u2014 when arbitral proceedings commenced \u2014 CGE had acquired the shares of DYCASA, one of the original investors in CAA. The First Tribunal found that CGE also controlled CAA much earlier \u2014 as of the effective date of the concession contract (18 May 1995). Together with its findings that CGE continued to increase its shares in CAA after that date, necessarily implied that CGE controlled CAA at the time the proceedings were commenced (on 26 December 1996). Thus, the First Tribunal found that CAA had French nationality at the relevant time (commencement of the arbitration), as well as at earlier times, and was a proper claimant. The First **ad hoc** Committee affirmed this finding.\n\n135.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Second Tribunal properly determined that the question of CAA\u2019s nationality had been conclusively addressed by both the First Tribunal and the First *ad hoc* Committee and concluded that the issue was *res judicata,* and could not be reconsidered.\n\n**b) Respondent\u2019s Arguments Regarding CAA\u2019s Nationality Are Based on a Misrepresentation of the Record**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nRespondent asserted that the First Tribunal\u2019s key finding regarding CAA\u2019s nationality and its status as a proper claimant was annulled by the First ***ad hoc*** Committee, and that the Second Tribunal was wrong to treat it as *res judicata.* To support this claim, Respondent pointed to a passage of the First ***ad hoc*** Committee\u2019s decision on Respondent\u2019s request for supplementation and rectification of the first annulment decision, in which the First ***ad hoc*** Committee stated that it had annulled the First Tribunal\u2019s finding that CGE controlled CAA as of the effective date of the concession contract. According to Respondent, it was that specific (annulled) finding of the First Tribunal on which the Second Tribunal based its determination that the issue was *res judicata.* Thus, Respondent claimed, the Second Tribunal \"manifestly exceeded its powers\" and \"failed to state reasons\" by declining to re-consider the issue of CAA\u2019s nationality and status as a proper claimant.\n\n137.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Respondent\u2019s argument is not only wrong, but frivolous since the First Tribunal\u2019s finding that CGE controlled CAA as of the effective date of the concession contract (as opposed to the date of the filing) \"played no part in the subsequent reasoning of the [First] Tribunal\"50 on the nationality issue. Indeed, even if the First Tribunal and First *ad hoc* Committee had expressly determined that CGE did *not* control CAA at the beginning of the concession contract, such a fact would have been irrelevant to the issue of jurisdiction.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (First Annulment Proceeding), Decision on Annulment of July 3, 2002, para. 50.\n\n138.\n\nThe critical finding for jurisdictional purposes is the fact that CGE controlled CAA at the time arbitral proceedings were commenced. Accordingly, Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s criticism of the Second Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n\n**4. The Second Tribunal\u2019s Findings of Fact (Failure to State Reasons / Departure From a Fundamental Rule of Procedure)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nRespondent alleged that the Second Tribunal misinterpreted the factual record, gave improper weight to certain evidence, or failed to provide a sufficiently thorough explanation for its factual findings. Claimants replied that each of Respondent\u2019s claims is substantively baseless and should be rejected as inadmissible.\n\n**a) Respondent\u2019s Attempt To Re-Litigate the Issue of the Tucum\u00e1n Authorities\u2019 Actions Against CAA Is Misleading and Improper**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nClaimants consider baseless each of the Respondent\u2019s arguments concerning the Second Tribunal\u2019s basic conclusion that various Tucum\u00e1n authorities took hostile and improper actions against CAA.\n\n*(i) The Second Tribunal Properly Found that Tucum\u00e1n Authorities Acted To Undermine Claimants\u2019 Investment*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nClaimants argue that the Award was thorough and accurate in documenting the many actions through which Tucum\u00e1n officials destroyed CAA\u2019s concession and Claimants\u2019 investments therein.\n\n*(ii) Repondent\u2019s Invocation of Res Judicata Is Based on a Misrepresentation of the Record*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nClaimants assert that Respondent\u2019s claim that paragraph 91 of the First Award continues in force is incorrect. According to the Respondent this paragraph (which discussed certain actions of Tucum\u00e1n officials), precludes the Second Tribunal\u2019s determination that the executive and legislative branches of the Tucum\u00e1n government took action that undermined Claimants\u2019 investment. Claimants consider the Respondent\u2019s arguments unfounded in this respect.\n\n143.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Respondent misrepresents the record since paragraph 91 \u2014 along with all of the First Tribunal\u2019s other findings regarding Tucum\u00e1n officials\u2019 actions \u2014 was in fact annulled by the First *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n144.\n\nClaimants contend that all of the First Tribunal\u2019s findings regarding the actions of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities \u2014 including those concerning the collective effect of \"concerted action\" by the executive and legislative branches \u2014 were annulled. Indeed, it is clear that paragraph 91 of the First Award, which the First **ad hoc** Committee identified as relating to the \"Tucum\u00e1n claims51\", was among the annulled portions of that First Award. It is simply impossible to reconcile the text of the First **ad hoc** Committee\u2019s decision annulling \"the entirety of the Tucum\u00e1n claims\"52 with Respondent\u2019s theory that paragraph 91, or indeed any findings by the First Tribunal regarding the actions of Tucum\u00e1n officials, survived annulment. Respondent\u2019s theory of annulment would lead to a self-contradictory and absurd result.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (First Annulment Proceeding), Decision on Annulment of July 3, 2002, para. 107.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 115.\n\n*(iii) Actions of Individual legislators*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nClaimants also refer to Respondent\u2019s challenge of the Second Tribunal\u2019s findings regarding the attribution of provincial legislators\u2019 conduct to Argentina. According to Respondent, in paragraph 91, the First Tribunal concluded that the acts of legislators could not give rise to the responsibility of Argentina under the BIT, and thus the issue was *res judicata.* Respondent contended that the Second Tribunal improperly decided this issue, thereby manifestly exceeding its powers.\n\n146.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, nothing that the First Tribunal stated in paragraph 91 is *res judicata* since that paragraph was expressly annulled by the First *ad hoc* Committee. Additionally, the Second Tribunal expressly declined to determine whether acts of individual legislators were attributable to Respondent since it was unnecessary to decide this issue, because the acts of other officials were sufficient to hold Respondent liable.\n\n147.\n\nFinally, Respondent did not raise the *res judicata* argument with regard to the Tucum\u00e1n claims before the Second Tribunal and therefore it had no opportunity to address it.\n\n*(iv) Respondent\u2019s Challenges to the Second Tribunal\u2019s Findings on the Tucum\u00e1n Authorities\u2019 Actions Are Groundless and Improper at the Annulment Stage*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nClaimants contend that the Respondent sought to re-litigate on the merits the propriety of the Tucum\u00e1n officials\u2019 actions. Respondent argued that the Second Tribunal found that various provincial authorities had engaged in a conspiracy against CAA, and that such a finding had no support in the evidence. Claimants state that such challenges are beyond the scope of an annulment proceeding and rely on a mischaracterization of Claimants\u2019 case and the Second Tribunal\u2019s findings.\n\n149.\n\nClaimants argue that the Second Tribunal did not find that a conspiracy existed. Although the Second Tribunal found that certain conduct involved a degree of coordination among separate persons or entities, it did not suggest that each example of state action was conducted as part of a single master plan.\n\n150.\n\nClaimants suggest that by raising this argument the Respondent simply seeks a comprehensive reconsideration of the evidence and the merits of the dispute, including a *de novo* review of the Second Tribunal\u2019s findings of fact.\n\n**b) Respondent\u2019s Challenges to the Second Tribunal\u2019s Other Findings of Fact Are Improper, Groundless and Immaterial**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent raised a number of challenges to various specific factual findings of the Second Tribunal. Each of these factual arguments, briefly described below, are beyond the scope of an annulment proceeding, and the *ad hoc* Committee thus need not and should not address them on the merits.\n\n*(i) ERSACT/ CAA Sub-Committee Report*\n--------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Respondent made a particularly objectionable series of misrepresentations concerning the Second Tribunal\u2019s reliance on Exhibit 870, which contains the May 1996 Final Report of the joint ERSACT/CAA Sub-Committee on Water Quality. Respondent asserts that the Second Tribunal based its conclusions regarding the incidents of water turbidity \"almost exclusively\" on the Sub-Committee Final Report.\n\n153.\n\nClaimants argue that contrary to the Respondent\u2019s assertion, the Second Tribunal did not rely \"almost exclusively\" on this Report in reaching its conclusions. Rather, in the portion of its decision addressing the turbidity incidents, the Second Tribunal cited written and oral testimony from at least five different witnesses as well as additional documentary evidence. Thus, even if the Final Report could be excluded in an annulment proceeding, the Second Tribunal\u2019s factual findings on the water quality issues were amply supported by other evidence, and there is no indication of any failure to state reasons or any serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n*(ii) Governor Bussi\u2019s Campaign Position*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nRespondent also took issue with the Second Tribunal\u2019s factual findings regarding the position that Fuerza Republicana, the political party of Governor Bussi and Vice-Governor Topa, took during its 1995 election campaign. Claimants argue that the Respondent has not explained why it would be appropriate for an annulment committee to review such a finding of fact. An annulment does not provide an opportunity for *de novo* review of the factual record, the weight given by a tribunal to certain evidence, or the conclusions that a tribunal draws from that record.\n\n*(iii) The 70 Changes*\n----------------------\n\n155.\n\nClaimants also address the Respondent\u2019s claims against the Second Tribunal\u2019s factual findings regarding the 70 unilateral changes that Tucum\u00e1n officials made to a revised concession contract that CAA and representatives of the Tucum\u00e1n government negotiated and agreed to in April 1997.\n\n156.\n\nClaimants reiterated, however, that such complaints cannot ground a request for annulment, and, as such, need not and should not be addressed by this *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n157.\n\nClaimants consider that the annulment phase is not a permissible time or place to reassess whether either party sufficiently \"proved\" anything; it was the Second Tribunal\u2019s responsibility to judge the sufficiency of the evidence, and that judgment is not open to challenge an annulment proceeding.\n\n*(iv) Exhibit 1069*\n-------------------\n\n158.\n\nClaimants referred to Respondent\u2019s argument that in paragraph 8.3.7 of its Award, the Second Tribunal cited data from a document (Exhibit 1069, a CAA financial statement for the period ending December 31, 1997), that Respondent claimed was excluded from the record as untimely filed.\n\n159.\n\nClaimants argue that Exhibit 1069 was not excluded from the record, and it was the same document that was submitted to the First Tribunal during the initial proceedings in 1998 as Exhibit 287. By agreement of the parties, as endorsed by the Second Tribunal, such previously-submitted exhibits automatically remained part of the record in the resubmitted case. Claimants simply re-numbered \"Old Exhibit 287\" as \"Exhibit 1069\" for purposes of the resubmitted proceedings. In its 15 September 2006 procedural order, the Second Tribunal excluded from the record only those documents that were submitted for the first time with Claimants\u2019 23 August 2006 letter.\n\n160.\n\nIn any event, Claimants assert that the reference to the document prejudiced its position, given that the Second Tribunal cited the document as a basis for rejecting Claimants\u2019 arguments regarding the calculation of damages and supporting Respondent\u2019s position on that issue.\n\n*(v) Projected Recovery Rate*\n-----------------------------\n\n161.\n\nRespondent argued that there is no documentary evidence to support the Second Tribunal\u2019s finding of fact that the Tucum\u00e1n Minister of Economy asked the Consortium to \"consider revisions to the economic offer to provide a reduced tariff adjustment coefficient and an increased projected recovery rate.\"53\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial at para. 261 (discussing *Vivendi v. Argentina 2,* Award at para. 4.3.6).\n\n162.\n\nClaimants contend that once again, Respondent is complaining about factual findings of the Second Tribunal and the sufficiency of the evidence supporting those findings, which is not a proper subject of an annulment application. In any event, Claimants allege that Respondent\u2019s complaint is substantively unfounded and that the Second Tribunal\u2019s finding is well supported.\n\n*(vi) CAA Model Invoice*\n------------------------\n\n163.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent sought to reargue the facts of the case and that such improper effort is without merit. First, while the model invoice itself is not on the record, the Second Tribunal was fully entitled to find as it did \u2014 based on substantial relevant evidence \u2014 that the model invoice existed. Claimants argued that as noted by the Second Tribunal, the Tucum\u00e1n regulator published a newspaper advertisement discussing the charges listed in the model and actual invoices, and stating that such charges were in accord with the Concession Agreement. Thus, the regulator was familiar with the content of CAA\u2019s model (and actual) invoices, and approved of that content, and the Tucum\u00e1n authorities\u2019 subsequent criticism of the invoices was questionable at best.\n\n164.\n\nlaimants consider that this issue provides no basis for objecting to the Second Tribunal\u2019s finding of fact, much less a basis for annulment.\n\n**c) The Second Tribunal Properly Considered the Parties\u2019 Claims**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimants note that although a tribunal is required to respond to every \"question\" raised by the parties, this requirement refers to dispositive substantive claims or defenses that the parties raise during the proceedings. According to the Claimants, Respondent erred in claiming that the Award should be annulled because it declined to adopt certain factual assertions made by one of Respondent\u2019s witnesses, and further that the Second Tribunal allegedly failed to address certain points raised by Respondent or certain pieces of Respondent\u2019s evidence. For the Claimants, none of these alleged omissions is a ground for annulment.\n\n166.\n\nFinally, Claimants argue that the Respondent has not identified any genuine omission of a dispositive claim or defense from the Award. Therefore, the Claimants request that Respondent\u2019s application for *de novo* review and reversal of the following facts must be denied.\n\n*(i) The Second Tribunal\u2019s Findings Regarding the Rais Report Were Proper*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nWith respect to Respondent\u2019s argument that the Second Tribunal did not adopt certain statements in the Rais Report that were favorable to Respondent\u2019s position, the Claimants note that Dr. Rais cannot be described as an \"impartial third party.\" Claimants further note that contrary to Respondent\u2019s assertion, the Rais Report did not dismiss the existence of a conspiracy of the Tucum\u00e1n authorities to frustrate the Concession Agreement. Rather, as the Second Tribunal noted, the Rais Report stated just the opposite. Third, again contrary to Respondent\u2019s argument, the Second Tribunal did rely on another portion of the Rais Report that favored Respondent. In any event, according to the Claimants, even if true, this argument does not provide a basis for annulment. The Second Tribunal, as the finder of fact, had full discretion in weighing evidence, determining the credibility of various statements, and reaching other decisions concerning the factual points in dispute.\n\n*(ii) The Second Tribunal\u2019s Summary of the Issues in Dipute Was Appropriate*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the summary of issues made by the Second Tribunal identifying four general groups of the factual issues in dispute between the parties54 was appropriate and it did not omit \"fundamental\" issues. Claimants argue that the Respondent ignored various portions of the Award that indeed address directly the very issues that it claims were omitted by the Second Tribunal. According to the Claimants, the Second Tribunal was not required to consider the arguments in question, and, in any event, it *did* consider them. Accordingly, Respondent\u2019s criticism does not provide grounds for annulment.\n\nThese four groups are: 1) the causes and foreseeability of the turbidity incidents; (2) the renegotiation of the Concession Agreement; (3) the reason for ERSACT\u2019s various regulatory actions against CAA; and (4) the 70 changes to the revised contract proposed in 1997.\n\n**d) The Second Tribunal Properly Considered Testimonial Evidence**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nClaimants argue that it is entirely appropriate for international arbitral tribunals to consider and rely upon oral testimony from party witnesses. Claimants referred to the ICSID Arbitration Rules which neither restrict the testimony of party witnesses, nor impute a lowered evidentiary value to such testimony. Arbitration Rule 34 gives the tribunal complete discretion in weighing the probative value of all testimony.\n\n170.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Respondent has not shown that the Second Tribunal\u2019s references to testimonial evidence materially affected the outcome of the dispute, and in any event the Second Tribunal referred extensively to the evidence before it in reaching its findings of fact and law. Claimants argue that the vast majority of the witness testimony cited in the Award is supported by statements contained in the documentary evidence in the file. Claimants contend that the Respondent cannot allege that the outcome of the Award hinged on references to witness testimony, without any documentary support. In any event, according to the Claimants, there would be nothing improper about such references, and they certainly could not constitute grounds for annulment.\n\n**e) The Second Tribunal\u2019s Findings Regarding Damages Were Appropriate**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nClaimants allege that none of the challenges raised by the Respondent regarding damages took into account the broad discretion afforded tribunals in weighing facts and determining damages. According to the Claimants, each of the arguments seeks to review of the Second Tribunal\u2019s findings of fact underlying its damages award, and is therefore inadmissible as a ground for annulment.\n\n*(i) The Second Tribunal\u2019s Damages Analysis*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nClaimants note that the starting point of the Second Tribunal\u2019s analysis was Article 5(2) of the BIT, which requires that expropriation be met with compensation equal to the \"actual value\" of the investment. The Second Tribunal also based its damages analysis on the principle that an award of damages must re-establish the situation which would have existed if the illegal act had not been committed55. The Second Tribunal added that under these principles, its task was primarily to determine the \"fair market value\" of Claimants\u2019 investment. According to the Claimants, Respondent did not contest this approach.\n\nSee *Vivendi v. Argentina,* (Resubmission Proceeding), Award 20 August 2007, para. 8.2.4 \u2014 8.2.7 (citing *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorspow,* Judgment No. 13, 13 September 1928, Merits, 1928 P.C.I.J. Series A. No. 17, at p.47).\n\n173.\n\nClaimants had argued that the fair market value should be based on the profits that CAA would have obtained if the concession had not been undermined by the Tucum\u00e1n government. Claimants sought an award equivalent to the discounted net cash flow (DCF) that the concession would have generated but for the Tucum\u00e1n officials\u2019 alleged actions. At Respondent\u2019s request, the Second Tribunal declined to adopt this approach, finding that the record of the concession\u2019s operations failed to demonstrate with sufficient certainty that it would have been profitable.\n\n174.\n\nClaimants thereafter proposed that damages could be based on the amounts that Vivendi/CGE had invested in CAA. As support for this alternative basis, Claimants cited to the written and oral testimony of Mr. R\u00e9gis Hahn, CAA\u2019s Administrative and Financial Director as of 1997 (and later its Vice Chairman), and to certain CAA financial statements. This information was supported by testimony from Mr. Fran\u00e7ois de Rochambeau, CAA\u2019s Vice President and former General Manager, and by the written expert report of Mr. Dominique Perrier of PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n175.\n\nClaimants submitted that the record demonstrates that Vivendi continued to invest funds in CAA after August 1998. Mr. Rochambeau and Mr. Charles-Touis de Maud\u2019huy (CAA\u2019s Chairman) stated that Vivendi/CGE had to extend $2.5 million per month in loans to CAA to cover the cash flow deficit during the \"hostage\" period that ended in October 1998. CAA\u2019s expenditures continued beyond the filing of Claimants\u2019 Memorial in late 2005, by which time, as Mr. Hahn testified, Vivendi/CGE had extended a total of $75 million in debt financing to CAA. Thus, as of late 2005, the total amount of equity and debt invested in CAA was $105 million: $30 million in capital contributions and $75 million in loans from Vivendi/CGE.\n\n176.\n\nThe Second Tribunal adopted this alternative basis for calculating damages. After citing the testimony of Mr. Hahn and Ms. Perrier, the Second Tribunal combined the accrued debt and equity figures as of late 2005 to reach a total of $105 million, which it awarded to Claimants as the amount invested. Further, it divided these amounts into two temporal categories: those investments made as of the date of the expropriation, and those made afterward. Based on the testimony of Mr. Hahn and Ms. Perrier, the Second Tribunal found that $51 million ($30 million in equity and $21 million in debt) fell into the first category, while the remaining $54 million (the $75 million in total debt as of late 2005, less the $21 million already counted) fell into the second category.\n\n177.\n\nThe Second Tribunal awarded interest to Claimants on these amounts, compounded at a rate of 6%. The starting dates for the calculation of interest were based on the two temporal categories noted above \u2014 damages incurred as of the time of the expropriation, and damages incurred afterward. Thus, interest was set to run on the first category of damages \u2014 the $51 million noted above \u2014 beginning on 28 August 1997, the day after CAA notified the Province of its rescission of the Concession Agreement, at which point the Second Tribunal deemed the expropriation to have taken place. Interest was set to run on the second category \u2014 the remaining $54 million \u2014 beginning on 5 September 2002, the date on which Tucum\u00e1n enacted Taw 7234 (barring CAA from enforcing judgments in local debt collection cases), which was a specific act by the Province that the Second Tribunal identified as contributing to the finding of an additional treaty breach.\n\n*(ii) The Second Tribunal\u2019s Evidentiary Findings Regarding Damages* Were *Proper*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nRespondent did not directly challenge the Second Tribunal\u2019s basic methodology for calculating damages. Rather, Respondent argued that the Second Tribunal based its damages conclusions on evidence that was, in Respondent\u2019s view, illegitimate, inadequate, or inconsistent with other portions of the record. According to Respondent, these allegedly flawed evidentiary determinations amounted to a manifest excess of powers, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and a failure to state reasons, thereby justifying annulment under ICSID Convention Article 52(b), (d) and (e). Respondent\u2019s theory fails on every count, principally because it seeks review of the Second Tribunal\u2019s weighing of certain factual evidence \u2014 an exercise that is the exclusive province of the Second Tribunal under ICSID Arbitration Rule 34 and that is not properly subject to annulment.\n\n*(iii) Tribunal\u2019s Discretion Regarding Damages*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nClaimants submit that the Respondent\u2019s challenges to the Second Tribunal\u2019s damages calculations inappropriately assume that the *ad hoc* Committee is entitled to engage in plenary review of the Second Tribunal\u2019s factual findings.\n\n180.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Respondent ignored the discretion afforded to arbitral tribunals not only in making factual findings, but also in calculating damages. Moreover, as discussed above, ICSID Arbitration Rule 34 expressly provides that the tribunal is the judge of the admissibility and probative value of all evidence \u2014 necessarily including evidence on damages.\n\n181.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent\u2019s claims do not prove that the Second Tribunal committed any error that could properly provide grounds for annulment.\n\n*(iv) Testimony of Mr. Regis Hahn*\n----------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nRespondent raised a number of arguments concerning the testimony of Mr. Hahn, including that such testimony was invalid due to the parties\u2019 procedural agreement, adopted by the Second Tribunal. According to the Claimants, Respondent apparently reads that agreement to provide that the parties were not permitted to introduce oral testimony, or that the Second Tribunal was not permitted to treat such testimony as evidence of the facts of this case.\n\n183.\n\nClaimants note that the parties\u2019 agreement cited by the Respondent was meant to restrict the introduction of new witnesses, new written witness testimony, or new documentary evidence at or after the hearing. However, it was not intended to prohibit witnesses for either party who had already submitted written testimony from providing oral testimony at the hearing, nor to preclude the Second Tribunal from considering and relying on such testimony.\n\n184.\n\nClaimants argue that Mr. Hahn\u2019s testimony was supported by consistent information contained in written testimony and documents submitted prior to the hearing regarding the investments made in CAA as of October 1998. Mr. Hahn\u2019s testimony thus merely elaborated upon that evidence to confirm that CAA\u2019s activities were financed by Vivendi, and to update the information regarding the total amount of Vivendi\u2019s debt financing to CAA as of late 2005.\n\n185.\n\nIn addition, Claimants note that Respondent has not attempted to explain how the cited provision in the Order could constitute a \"fundamental rule of procedure\" for purposes of ICSID Convention Article 52(d). Claimants maintained that a prohibition on oral witness testimony would potentially violate, rather than uphold, fundamental procedural mies.\n\n186.\n\nSecond, Respondent asserted that Mr. Hahn\u2019s testimony was invalid because it was based on evidence that was part of the file. Claimants assumed that Respondent\u2019s contention is that Mr. Hahn based his testimony on the Vivendi financial and accounting records that the Second Tribunal determined were inadmissible as late-filed. Claimants consider that this argument is both unfounded and irrelevant since such documents merely offered additional support for Mr. Hahn\u2019s statements. The fact that the financial records themselves were not admitted into evidence in no way affects Mr. Hahn\u2019s knowledge as CAA\u2019s Administrative and Financial Director, nor the legitimacy of his testimony.\n\n187.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants observe that Respondent elected not to cross-examine Mr. Hahn regarding his discussion of the $75 million in loans that Vivendi/CGE extended to CAA. Nor did Respondent act at any point, at the hearing or in its post-hearing submission, to demonstrate that Mr. Hahn\u2019s testimony was in any way inaccurate. Respondent merely objected to the admissibility of certain documents offered by Claimants after the hearing, based solely on the timing of their submission.\n\n188.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Respondent\u2019s argument is once again an attempt to re-open factual issues conclusively resolved by the Second Tribunal. Nothing in this argument amounts to a ground for annulment.\n\n189.\n\nRespondent also criticized the Second Tribunal\u2019s reliance on Ms. Perrier\u2019s testimony by asserting that Ms. Perrier was uninformed regarding CAA\u2019s accounting matters, and thus that her testimony regarding Vivendi/CGE\u2019s amounts invested had no evidentiary value. Claimants noted that Ms. Perrier\u2019s expert report attached as an appendix an excerpt from CAA\u2019s financial statements, demonstrating that she did in fact have access to the relevant aspects of CAA\u2019s financial information. Still further, other information discussed in Ms. Perrier\u2019s report was by her own account based on the witness statement of Mr. Rochambeau, who undisputedly had direct knowledge of CAA\u2019s financial information.\n\n190.\n\nWith respect to the inconsistency alleged by the Respondent between Ms. Perrier\u2019s expert report and the testimony of Mr. Rochambeau, the Claimants argued that once again, Respondent\u2019s charge is misplaced. The reference in the Award challenged by the Respondent in fact refers to Ms. Perrier\u2019s report as stating that \"Vivendi\u2019s shareholders account in CAA\u2019s books, reflecting its investment in CAA, had increased to US$69 million at the end of August 1998.\"56, according to the Claimants this language makes it clear that the Second Tribunal correctly understood that the $69 million figure referred to Vivendi\u2019s total investment in CAA (debt and equity) as of late 1998. Claimants argue that given that CGE was required to continue funding CAA after 1998, that figure was entirely consistent with Mr. Hahn\u2019s testimony that Vivendi/CGE had invested $75 million in debt (and $105 million total) in CAA as of late 2005, as the Second Tribunal correctly stated.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina,* (Resubmission Proceeding), Award 20 August 2007, footnote 424.\n\n191.\n\nThus, the Second Tribunal correctly understood the testimony of both Mr. Rochambeau and Ms. Perrier, and made no error whatsoever, let alone an annullable error. Once again, Respondent\u2019s criticisms with respect to the above referenced testimony are unfounded, and in any event would not present errors that could provide grounds for annulment.\n\n*(v) Equity Investment in CAA*\n------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Second Tribunal awarded $30 million based on the total equity invested in CAA (by Vivendi/CGE and other shareholders) and the additional $75 million in debt invested by Vivendi/CGE alone. Respondent considers it inappropriate for the Second Tribunal to have included in the former amount the portion of the equity that was not invested by Vivendi/CGE itself.\n\n193.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent\u2019s complaint is inapposite since Vivendi is not the only claimant in this case; CAA also received the entire $30 million as a capital contribution, and invested it in the concession. CAA then incurred losses that far outstripped that capital, for which CAA then turned to Vivendi/CGE for loans. Respondent has mischaracterized the Award, or, at a minimum, misunderstood the Second Tribunal\u2019s analysis. In any event, this unfounded challenge offers no ground for annulment.\n\n*(vi) The Second Tribunal\u2019s Approach to Calculating lnterest Was Justified*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nFinally, the Respondent criticized the Second Tribunal\u2019s calculation of interest, specifically its choice of the starting dates for interest accrual. As to the first starting date, Respondent argued that Claimants had asked for interest to run only from 27 November 1997, while the Second Tribunal adopted the earlier date of 28 August 1997, giving Claimants more interest than they had sought.\n\n195.\n\nClaimants argue that they had suggested the 27 November 1997 date as part of a broader damages request that included lost profits. The November date was used in the request for interest only because that was the date back to which Claimants had discounted the cash flows in their lost profits calculations. Claimants could just as well have discounted cash flows back to, and requested interest running from, 28 August 1997. In any event, the Second Tribunal rejected that request, and awarded damages at a lower level and with a lower interest rate, and thus a lower total interest amount than Claimants had requested. In setting the first accrual date, the Second Tribunal used the date on which, in its view, Claimants\u2019 investment had been expropriated \u2014 a point that Respondent does not dispute and a decision that was well within the Second Tribunal\u2019s discretion.\n\n196.\n\nAs to the second starting date, as explained above, the date in question \u2014 5 September 2002 \u2014 is the date on which Respondent enacted Taw 7234, the first of a series of laws blocking CAA\u2019s attempts to enforce judgments regarding unpaid invoices. The Second Tribunal had found that the enactment of such laws constituted an additional violation of the BIT. Thus, according to the Claimants it was quite appropriate to provide that interest on the damages incurred subsequent to the expropriation would begin to run on that date.\n\n197.\n\nOnce again, Claimants consider that Respondent\u2019s argument constitutes an attempt to re \u2014 argue the facts, and disregards the great discretion afforded to tribunals in evaluating evidence and calculating damages. Respondent\u2019s challenge thus does not articulate any legitimate ground for annulment.\n\n**5. Claimants\u2019 Conclusion**\n----------------------------\n\n198.\n\nClaimants request that the *ad hoc* Committee dismiss Respondent\u2019s request for annulment in its entirety, and issue an award of costs, including counsel fees, in favor of Claimants.\n\n199.\n\nClaimants argue that the Respondent is attempting to turn these annulment proceedings into a third merits phase, and to induce both Claimants and the *ad hoc* Committee to focus their efforts on an item-by-item reconsideration of the factual and legal arguments raised before the Second Tribunal. Claimants consider that the re-argument of the facts of the case does not provide a basis for annulment of the Award, as the applicable standards for annulment are found in ICSID Convention Article 52. Nothing in Respondent\u2019s submission comes close to satisfying that standard.\n\n**III. The** ***ad hoc*** **Committee\u2019s Views**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Part One: The Proper or Improper Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe Argentine Republic observes that the role of the **ad hoc** Committee is to \"protect the integrity of the system\"57. The **ad hoc** Committee concurs with this view. This fundamental premise is therefore uncontested, and all grounds invoked for annulment in the present case have to be addressed in the light of this paramount policy consideration.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial of 17 October 2008, para. 34, page 9.\n\n201.\n\nThe controversies between the parties in the written and oral phases of the present proceedings arise foremost from Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s appointment to the Board of UBS on 19 April 2006, either as a ground for the assertion that the Second Tribunal was \"not properly constituted\" under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention or based on the assertion of \"a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" under Article 52(1)(d). A further ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(c) was withdrawn.\n\n202.\n\nIt is undisputed that the facts and circumstances affecting Professor Kaufmann- Kohler\u2019s ability to serve as arbitrator were \"only discovered\" after the Second Award had already been rendered.58 None of the parties involved in the arbitrations in which Professor Kaufmann-Kohler acted as arbitrator at the time of her UBS board appointment were advised by her of this fact, which could not be considered public knowledge.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, para. 68, page 18.\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent sees here an important failure and ground for annulment. It has supported its view by the expert testimony of Professor Toukas Mistelis, who was cross-examined, and by an earlier opinion of Professor Charles W. Wolfram in the *EDF v. Argentina59* case, which is also part of the record. Claimants have contested this view but have not presented an expert witness statement of their own.\n\n*EDF v. Argentina 2.*\n\n204.\n\nA basic issue is the compatibility of a directorship in a major international bank with the function of international arbitrator. It concerns here the conflicts of interest that result or may result when the positions are combined and the way in which, in such situations, these present or prospective conflicts must be handled and managed by the arbitrator, notably in terms of (a) investigation of any connections between the bank and the parties in the pending arbitrations; (b) disclosure of any such connections to the parties in such arbitrations if the arbitrator wishes to continue; and (c) notice to the parties of the appointment regardless of any connections so found so that they may be properly informed.\n\n205.\n\nThe further question is what the consequences are in terms of annulment if there was a basic failure to investigate, disclose, or inform.\n\n206.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee is aware of its grave responsibility in matters of this nature. They concern not only the continued validity of the Second Award but, as already mentioned, more particularly the integrity of the ICSID process as a whole, which is the clear and undisputed underlying concern of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n207.\n\nIn annulment cases, members of ICSID *ad hoc* committees are chosen exclusively from the Panel of Arbitrators, and serve at the invitation of ICSID to address this concern. Their position is therefore different from that of arbitrators.\n\n208.\n\nIn this connection, the *ad hoc* Committee noted the claim contained in Professor Mistelis\u2019 Report that there has been a demonstrable inclination of international arbitrators to raise the threshold for a challenge of their fellow arbitrators. This was not contested in cross-examination or commented upon by the parties after they were invited to do so.\n\n209.\n\nIt may be that such an attitude more easily results amongst arbitrators who are called upon to determine a challenge in respect of an arbitrator with whom they sit. This is the procedure under Article 58 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n210.\n\n*Ad hoc* Committees are not in a similar position.\n\n211.\n\nIn this case, the difference in roles may also have a bearing on the discussion concerning the effect of the decisions in the earlier *EDF v. Argentine60* and *Suez v. Argentine61* cases and particularly on any *res judicata* effect of any conclusions reached therein on the present issue.\n\n*EDF v. Argentina 2,* Challenge Decision regarding Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler dated 25 June 2008.\n\n*Suez v. Argentina 2,* Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal dated 22 October 2007.\n\n212.\n\nRegardless of this difference and the question whether an *ad hoc* Committee is ever bound by a finding in a prior case, the important equitable principle of estoppel still needs to be considered further.\n\n213.\n\nIt should be pointed out in this connection that both the *EDF v. Argentina* and *Suez v. Argentina* cases are still subject to ICSID annulment proceedings and are therefore not yet final.\n\n214.\n\nFurthermore, they concerned the question of independence in the relationships respectively between UBS and EDF, or UBS and Suez (even though Vivendi was also a party in the latter case but CAA was not). Each relationship was different and must, like the relationship between UBS and Vivendi, be considered individually. Notably, a larger or smaller participation of UBS in the one or in the other company may have relevance in this connection.\n\n215.\n\nFinally, the ICSID Convention being silent on the issue, it may also be relevant that parties in submitting to an ICSID arbitration could hardly have meant to accept any *res judicata* effect in a situation like the present one.\n\n216.\n\nFor these reasons, the *res judicata* argument is rejected.\n\n217.\n\nAs to the basic issue of the compatibility of a directorship in a major international bank and the function of international arbitrator, Professor Wolfram, strongly supported by Professor Mistelis during the hearing, makes the obvious point that a director in the exercise of his or her function is under a fiduciary duty *vis-\u00e0-vis* the shareholders of the bank to further the interests of the bank and therefore postpone conflicting interests.\n\n218.\n\nThat is fundamentally at variance with his or her duty as independent arbitrator in an arbitration involving a party in which the bank has a shareholding or other interest, however small it may be.62 Since a major international bank has connections with or an interest in virtually any major international company (which companies are also the most likely to end up in international arbitrations), this suggests that the positions of a director of such a bank, and that of an international arbitrator, may not be compatible and should not be, or in a modern international arbitration environment, should no longer be combined.\n\nThe issue was raised in the course of the oral hearing whether *\"the position op a director, even a non-executive director op a major international bank, is inconsistent and irreconcilable with the position op an international arbitrator.* (Transcript of the Hearing in English, page 354 paras. 7-11). Professor Mistelis answered *\"absolutely* (Transcript of the Hearing in English page 354 paras. 7-11) to the question *\"do you think there is an irreconcilable conplict op interest?\u2019* (Transcript of the Hearing in English page 359 paras. 7-8) and he later added that *\"the non-disclosure affects the constitution op the Tribunal and therepore this arbitration is tainted'* (Transcript of the Hearing in English page 362 paras. 9-12).\n\n219.\n\nAs a minimum, the *ad hoc* Committee sees here reason for extreme caution, especially in ICSID cases where the public interest is often strongly engaged.\n\n220.\n\nIt means foremost that anyone aspiring to a position as director in a major international bank should understand the likely extent of such a bank\u2019s interests, and the possibility of conflict should be clear in particular to all senior and experienced international arbitrators accepting such a position.\n\n221.\n\nAny arbitrator who still seeks to combine both functions must therefore make a special effort that the conflicts that may so arise are managed properly and handled with the greatest care63.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules give no clear guidance but the making of a declaration under Arbitration Rule 6, which refers to the reasons why an arbitrator should not serve and to its best knowledge in this connection, requires proper and adequate investigation. This is an objective requirement, the scope of which is only in first instance left to the arbitrator and may be tested in a challenge or annulment procedure.\n\n222.\n\nIn the view of the *ad hoc* Committee, this does not only require any arbitrator becoming or having become a member of the board of a major international bank first to specifically investigate whether the bank has any connection with or interest in any of the parties in its pending arbitrations but, if such an arbitrator decides in principle to continue, also to notify the parties in each arbitration of such a connection or interest. This imposes a continuous duty of investigation.\n\n223.\n\nThis obligation cannot be considered fulfilled by simply providing the bank at the time of the appointment with a list of current arbitrations accompanied by a request to see whether there may be any conflicts of interests, as was apparently done in this case. Rather, the foremost issue is whether the bank has any connection with or interest in any of the parties to the arbitrations and what the nature of that connection is.\n\n224.\n\nThat needs to be established first and any list of arbitrations provided by an arbitrator to the bank can only serve that primary purpose.64 It is clear that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler did not ask the bank to investigate any such connections and to inform her of them.\n\nThis should be considered quite apart from any regulatory requirement that may require prospective board members of public companies to disclose any competing or adverse interests.\n\n225.\n\nWhether there were any conflicts for the bank\u2019s own purposes was for the bank to decide. Naturally, the bank could subsequently also decide whether to continue with the board appointment or not, but the bank could not decide these issues for others, particularly parties to an arbitration, who from the perspective of their arbitration may have a very different view of conflicts that result or could result for them from the involvement of their arbitrator with the bank.\n\n226.\n\nRather, having properly and adequately investigated and established any relationship between the bank and any of the parties to the arbitrations, it is for the arbitrator personally first to consider such a connection in terms of a voluntary resignation as arbitrator. Such connection must otherwise be properly disclosed to the parties through an adequate amendment of earlier declarations under Rule 6.\n\n227.\n\nThe arbitrator/board-member\u2019s duties are not fully exhausted even by such action. Since the bank might not be able easily to track the multiple types of contacts it may have with any of the parties to the arbitrations65, it is also proper that at least an updated *curriculum vitae* be circulated to all parties to the arbitrations so that each party can decide for itself whether there are reasons why the arbitrator/board-member should no longer serve, even if any subsequent challenge is ill-founded.\n\nProper due diligence could also have led to reading the Annual Reports of the parties in arbitration which in the case of Vivendi disclosed the UBS shareholding.\n\n228.\n\nIn the view of the *ad hoc* Committee, such is the risk taken by any international arbitrator who wants to become a board member of a major international bank.\n\n229.\n\nIn other words, not only may the bank wish to have an opportunity to review the position in respect of the (impending) board appointment after disclosure of the (prospective) board member\u2019s pending arbitrations, but also the potentially affected arbitrating parties. It is, in any event, difficult to understand why the bank was notified by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler of her existing arbitrations but not the arbitrating parties of her (impending) directorship of the bank at the same time.\n\n230.\n\nThe complications that have subsequently arisen in terms of agony, ICSID credibility, and cost, not only in this case, provide a vivid and abject example of the consequences when an arbitrator accepts a board position in a major international bank without properly investigating and disclosing any connections between the bank and parties to its arbitrations and also neglects its information duties.\n\n231.\n\nIt may have been possible at first to consider Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s attitude in these matters as a one-off serious lapse of judgment but her removal by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Yukos cases66 after her refusal voluntarily to withdraw appears to confirm that she has more broadly a view of her independence and of the relevant criteria in this connection which do not or do no longer accord with the minimum standards that now prevail in these matters.\n\n*Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) v. The Russian Federation,* PCA Case No. AA 227, Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 November 2009, para. 15 and *Veteran Petroleum Limited (Cyprus) v. The Russian Federation,* PCA Case No. AA 228, Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 November 2009, para.15.\n\n232.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee thus understands the argument that the Second Tribunal was no longer properly constituted after the board appointment of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, and that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and considers that this could lead to annulment whenever justified within the context of the case under consideration.\n\n233.\n\nNevertheless, the **ad hoc** Committee must establish whether in this particular case the conduct and attitudes of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler constitute a sufficient ground under Article 52 effectively to annul the Second Award. It is well understood and established that under Article 52(3) an **ad hoc** Committee has here a measure of discretion and may consider other factors.\n\n234.\n\nThe Claimants have placed great stress on the fact that according to her own declarations, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had no actual knowledge of the connection between UBS and the Claimants until after the Award was rendered. Even though the Respondent has not accepted this declaration at face value, there is no sufficient reason for the *ad hoc* Committee not to believe her.\n\n235.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee consequently accepts that the relationship between UBS and the Claimants had no material effect on the final decision of the Tribunal, which was in any event unanimous.\n\n236.\n\nThe Respondent has raised the important point that, if this is the decisive element, failure to adequately investigate, disclose and inform is encouraged in this manner, and that as a consequence a nonsense is being made of all duties in this respect, thus undermining the credibility of the entire ICSID process, which the Committee has already stated to underly all of Article 52. The Respondent cites the revision of the *Pinochet* case in the House of Tords67 as powerful support.\n\nIn *re Pinochet* [1999] UKHL, available at http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ldl99899/ldjudgmt/jd990115/pmo01.htm\n\n237.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee accepts without reservation that Argentina is entitled to the highest standards in this regard being observed and respected by all arbitrators in its ICSID cases. So are all parties.\n\n238.\n\nIn this case, the fact remains, however, that despite most serious shortcomings, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s exercise of independent judgment under Article 14 of the ICSID Convention was in the circumstances not impaired. The Tribunal was thus functional and operated properly in respect of both parties.\n\n239.\n\nHaving extensively considered all the arguments, the *ad hoc* Committee, after long deliberations, has come to the conclusion that there is no sufficient ground to annul the Second Award.\n\n240.\n\nIn so finding, the *ad hoc* Committee was forced also to take into account that it would be unjust to deny the Claimants the benefit of the Award now that there is no demonstrable difference in outcome. Even though the Claimants originally appointed Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and may have felt that it was their duty to defend her in the annulment proceedings, they bear no responsibility for her actions or inaction.\n\n241.\n\nFinally, the **ad hoc** Committee also considered the extraordinary length of the present case. The Respondent rightly says that this is not a conclusive argument in itself. In any event, both parties have contributed to it, and the prospect of yet another Tribunal operating in this case is not in itself a valid argument either but only the consequence of the annulment facility in the Treaty itself which **ad hoc** Committees are not called upon to question. Yet, it is an overriding principle that all litigation must come to an end unless there are strong reasons for it to continue.\n\n242.\n\nUnder the circumstances, the **ad hoc** Committee can do no more than clearly express its opinion on conflicts of interest and how they should have been handled. The **ad hoc** Committee will state later in this decision its holdings on the division of costs incurred by the parties in connection with this challenge.\n\n**B. Part Two: The Other Grounds for Annulment**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe Argentine Republic as Respondent further claims that the Second Award \"disregarded fundamental issues related to the dispute between the parties as included in Article 52(1)(b), (d) and (e) of the Convention\" *inter alia* \"(a) the social conditions existing in the Province of Tucum\u00e1n at the time of the investment, and, consequently the feasibility of the Concession Agreement; (b) the dispute between the parties related to the right to water as essential human rights; (c) the failure to fulfill the investment obligations in connection with the *non-adimpleti contractus* principle; (d) the nature of the concession contract under Argentine administrative law (and even the applicable public law of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n); (e) the scope of responsibility of provincial government officials in the light of the applicable law\"68.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial para. 228, p. 66.\n\n244.\n\nAlso, the Argentine Republic denounced what it considered the Second Tribunal\u2019s *\"vector through which the Treaty was breached\", i.e.* not individual acts, but the alleged existence of a \u2018conspiracy\u2019 mounted by the authorities of the Tucum\u00e1n Province69 or in other terms a *\"campaign to destroy the Concession Agreement\"'70.*\n\n*Ibid.* para. 240, p. 70.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 253, p. 73.\n\n245.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee does not need to engage in theoretical debates on the exact meaning of the invoked annulment grounds since it has been rightly acknowledged by Respondent that the term \"manifest\" in the context of Article 52(1)(b) means that the excess of powers must be \"evident\"71, and that for a possible annulment under Article 52(1)(d), the departure must be a serious one and that the relevant rule of procedure be fundamental72.\n\nMemorial, para. 43, p. 12.\n\n*Ibid.,* para 44, p.12.\n\n246.\n\nIn essence, the *ad hoc* Committee has to focus directly on:\n\n(i) The first argument of Respondent that under Article 52(1)(b) the Second Tribunal in various instances manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n(ii) The second argument of Respondent that under Article 52(1)(d) the Second Tribunal based its award in multiple instances on inadequate evidence.\n\n(iii) The third argument of Respondent that under Article 52(1)(e) the Second Tribunal failed properly to answer relevant questions and adequately to give reasons.\n\n247.\n\nAs to these three grounds for annulment, the *ad hoc* Committee wishes to make the following observations.\n\n(i) It is agreed by all that Article 52 does not introduce an appeal facility but only a facility meant to uphold and strengthen the integrity of the ICSID process. In the Treaty, the possibility of annulment is in this connection based on specific and limited grounds.\n\n(ii) The **ad hoc** Committee understands this to mean that under Article 52(1)(b) and (d), there must be a **prima facie** case for annulment as is signaled by the use of the words \u2018manifestly\u2019 and \u2018serious departure\u2019.73 In particular, these sections cannot be used effectively to recommence the entire case before the **ad hoc** Committee. Rather, Respondent must be precise and identify specifically each instance of which it complains under these subparagraphs in terms of a **prima facie** case for annulment.\n\n(iii) Article 52(1)(e) is cast more in terms similar to an ordinary appeal, but, in the view of the **ad hoc** Committee, the standard is that the reasoning used by the Tribunal must have been plausible, that means adequate to understand how the Tribunal reached its decisions, it being given the benefit of the doubt if there is room for a difference of opinion in the matter. Only in this manner is, in the view of the **ad hoc** Committee, the nature and role of Article 52(1)(e) properly understood and safeguarded.\n\nIt is often believed that under Article 52(1)(b) only arbitrary or clearly unreasonable decisions are to be rejected, see *MCI v. Ecuador,* Decision of 19 October 2009, para. 49, where references are made to *MINE ad hoc* Committee, para. 4.06; to *Wena v. Egypt,* para. 2; to *CDC v. Seychelles,* para. 41. Under Artcile 52(1)(d) the attention shifts to due process and fundamental procedural protections, no more.\n\n248.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee also restates in this connection what was agreed by Respondent during the hearing and has a bearing on the interpretation of Artcile 48(3): not all arguments need to be addressed but only the fundamental ones. Only in respect of these, there has to be a sufficiently relevant reasoning. It is also understood that in the matter of adequate reasoning, upon a hearing, an ICSID *ad hoc* Committee may, if it deems it necessary, further explain, clarify, or supplement the reasoning given by the Tribunal rather than annul the decision.\n\n249.\n\nIn the view of the *ad hoc* Committee, a Tribunal may rely in this connection on expert and other testimony with which it agrees and may disregard other testimony. That is one of its principal tasks, cf. also Rule 34. It is generally accepted that a Tribunal has in these matters substantial discretion and does not need to explain expert views.\n\n250.\n\nTo further clarify its position, the *ad hoc* Committee also accepts that where a Tribunal agrees with one of the parties or with experts, it is not improper or unexpected for it to adopt the language used by them in the pleadings or in written testimony.\n\n251.\n\nThe **ad hoc** Committee also heard argument on whether erroneous findings of law and fact can be considered grounds for annulment. In the view of the **ad hoc** Committee, they can but only if they rise to the exacting standards for annulment as expressed in Article 52(1). The same applies to procedural incidents.\n\n252.\n\nIt was already said that even in the case of annullable error, the *ad hoc* Committee still has a measure of discretion under Article 52(3) in ordering annulment or in refusing to do so.\n\n253.\n\nInterpreting Article 52(1)(b) (d) and (e) in the above manner and having considered all the arguments before it, the *ad hoc* Committee believes that in the present case, other than discussed under A above, there are no findings in or aspects of the Second Award that rise to the level of the grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(b), (d), and (e).\n\n254.\n\nFirst, the *ad hoc* Committee wishes to deal with the argument that the methodology and the details of the damage calculation were flawed, in which connection each of Article 52(1)(b), (d), and (e) were invoked by Respondent.\n\n255.\n\nIn the view of the *ad hoc* Committee, the \u2018amounts invested\u2019 approach adopted by the Tribunal was well within the margin of appreciation of the Tribunal. It was originally the method proposed by Respondent and reduced the claim for damages considerably. As to the final calculation, the Tribunal relied on the testimony of Mr. R\u00e9gis Hahn supported by expert testimony which found that CAA\u2019s debt to Vivendi was US$75 million in 2005 (besides an equity investment of US$30 million). The Tribunal stated within its authority when it prefered that testimony to that of others. The expert evidence given was not inadequate and the reasons given were not insufficient.\n\n256.\n\nIn the matter of interest and its calculation, the *ad hoc* Committee considers that no *ultra petita* exists, even with regard to the issue of determining the starting date for the calculation of the interest due to the Claimants, since the allocation of interest, like the evaluation of damages, falls within the discretionary power of the Tribunal in the light of all relevant circumstances of the case. There is no indication whatever, that this discretion was abused\n\n257.\n\nAccordingly, the failure to express specific reasons in this respect cannot be considered a sufficient ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e), as the reasons stated within the context of the Tribunal's approach to the evaluation of the damages to be compensated may be understood to cover also the issue of interest.\n\n258.\n\nAs to the issue of the nationality of CAA raised by Respondent under Article 52(1) (b), this issue was already considered by the first Tribunal and the first *ad hoc* Committee. They were unanimous in finding that CAA was an investor under Article 1 (2) (c) of the Argentine-French BIT. The partial annulment by the First Annulment Committee related to other matters. This being the case, it cannot be accepted that the Second Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers whilst confirming this view.\n\n259.\n\nAs to the issue of the applicable law, also raised by Respondent under Article 52(1)(b), there is here well known confusion as to the meaning of Article 42 of the ICSID Convention. The law applicable to the BIT was under its Article 8(4) the law of Argentina. Respondent considers not applying this law a manifest excess of power by the Second Tribunal.\n\n260.\n\nAlthough an improper application of the applicable law is not directly mentioned as ground for annulment under Article 52(1) (b), it is generally accepted that it may amount to an annulment ground under that Article and this issue needs therefore further consideration.\n\n261.\n\nTo understand the applicable law clause in Article 42 properly, it must be realised that at the time the ICSID Convention was concluded the normal dispute resolution facility was based on a contractual arbitration clause. In cases based on BITs, the emphasis is essentially on international law violation in the sense that the host state is alleged to have breached the standards of treatment provided for the foreign investor under the BIT in question\n\n262.\n\nThe result was a distinction between contract claims and treaty claims. As to the latter, international law applies. It may be that issues of other laws still arise in considering parties\u2019 actions, e.g. in the matter of faithful compliance with concessions agreements, but nothing in the Second Award suggests that in these matters the Second Tribunal, which in paragraphs 7.3.9ff made similar distinctions following the First *ad hoc* Committee which also did so, went beyond its powers in the application of what it viewed as relevant laws, let alone manifestly so.\n\n263.\n\nAs for the jurisdictional issue, raised under Article 52(1)(b) and (e), the Second Tribunal considered the jurisdiction issues *res judicata* (except for the argument of absence of proper powers of attorney for certain of Claimants' counsel, which argument was rejected). These issues also cannot be revisited in annulment proceedings unless rising to the level of the criteria for annulment contained in Article 52(1). The *ad hoc* Committee finds that also here, there was neither manifest excess of power nor insufficient reasoning.\n\n264.\n\nAs for the issue of whether Respondent\u2019 arguments in respect of the actions of the Province of Tucum\u00e1n were properly considered, raised under Article 52(1)(b),(d) and (e), the basic finding of the Second Tribunal was that these actions were in essence an election issue and therefore political, not merely a measured response to alleged shortcomings of CAA. The question is not whether the *ad hoc* Committee agrees with this or not, but whether the Second Tribunal had the power to reach that conclusion.\n\n265.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee considers that also in this aspect, the Second Tribunal acted within its powers and that there was neither procedural impropriety in the manner in which the Tribunal narrowed the issues and chose to explain its findings nor insufficiency in its reasoning.\n\n266.\n\nOther matters of which Respondent complains in this connection are the Second Tribunal\u2019s dealing with the Projected Recovery Rate, with CAA's Model Invoice, with Exhibit 1069, with the Report of the CAA-ERSACT Sub-committee on Water Quality, with Governor Bussi\u2019s attitudes during the election of 1995, with the 70 changes made by the Province to the revised version of the Concession Agreement in 1997, with the action of individual legislators, and with multiple testimonial and other evidence issues74.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, paras. 207-276.\n\n267.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee has considered all these matters but finds that none of the complaints rise to the level of a ground for annulment under Article 52(1).\n\n**C. Costs**\n------------\n\n268.\n\nIn the matter of liability for the litigation cost, the *ad hoc* Committee finds that each Party should bear its own costs, both in respect of the stay proceedings and the proceedings on the merits.\n\n269.\n\nAs for the costs of the **ad hoc** Committee and of ICSID, in connection with the annulment proceeding, including the stay proceedings, the **ad hoc** Committee considers that parties should share these costs equally.\n\n**D. Decision**\n---------------\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the *ad hoc* Committee decides to reject Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment of the Second Award rendered by the Second Tribunal on 20 August 2007.\n\n**Additional Opinion of Professor JH Dalhuisen under Article 48(4) of the ICSID Convention**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nBefore ending the discussion, I should like to deal with the role of the ICSID Secretariat in this matter which has led to multiple complications and has delayed the final decision by many months.\n\n2.\n\nIt is clear that the Secretariat wants to obtain for itself a greater role in the conduct of ICSID cases and in the process also wants to involve itself in the drafting of the decisions. So also in this case. I believe this in general to be outside the Secretariat's remit and undesirable.\n\n3.\n\nThe role of the Secretariat in ICSID is substantially defined in Article 11 of the ICSID Convention and in Chapter V of the Administrative and Financial Regulations. It is a role of administration and support; it is clear that the Secretariat has no original powers in the dispute resolution and decision taking process.\n\n4.\n\nAs a minimum, the Secretariat is keen to do the recitals, but as the recitals in this case also show, by accommodating the Secretariat\u2019s involvement, they are becoming longer and longer. To do it properly, choices need to be made and it is hardly the task of the Secretariat to make them. What are the key facts and relevant arguments and how they should be presented in the final decision or award is for Arbitrators or *ad hoc* Committee Members to select and decide.\n\n5.\n\nAny other approach leads easily to a disjointed expose of arguments, counter-arguments, and decisions, especially in cases like the present one in which virtually everything was contested. Moreover, getting some presentable text out of the Secretariat in these circumstances delayed the final result considerably.\n\n6.\n\nAlthough summarising the arguments may well be helpful, it should ideally be done much earlier in the case before the hearing so that such a summary could be tested by Arbitrators or **ad hoc** Committee Members in the oral proceedings. If preparatory help of this nature is needed, Arbitral Tribunals or **ad hoc** Committees may be wiser to appoint their own assistant subject to their full control and direction. Any text tested in this manner might in appropriate cases then serve as part of the final award or decision.\n\n7.\n\nFor the Secretariat also to draft part or all of the decisions and reasoning would appear wholly inappropriate, even if following basic instructions of Arbitrators or *ad hoc* Committee Members whilst the final version would naturally still be left to them for approval. This would not appear to be sufficient to legitimize the text.\n\n8.\n\nDuring cross-examination it was asked why and questioned how some arbitrators could do so many cases. One way is to farm out the drafting to others, in the case of ICSID to the Secretariat. There appears to be much appreciation for this by busy arbitrators but it is improper.\n\n9.\n\nIn this case, the ICSID Secretariat even took the view that on its own initiative it could intervene to \"streamline\" the texts earlier agreed by the present *ad hoc* Committee and senior Secretariat members approached *individual* Committee Members informally with a view to amending the text. This naturally caused great stress in the Committee, raising many fundamental issues of propriety, independence, open and direct communication between Committee Members, and confidentiality.\n\n10.\n\nIt is relevant in this connection to note that a practice appears to have developed in ICSID whereby all communications, also those between the Chairman and *ad hoc* Committee Members (or Arbitrators as the case may be) are conducted through the Secretariat, but this is not the system of the Convention, quite apart from the question whether it gives the Secretariat subsequently power to intervene.\n\n11.\n\nUnder Regulation 24(1)(b), the communication between *ad hoc* Committee Members (and Arbitrators as the case may be) is specifically carved out from intermediation through the Secretariat and this is so during the full pendency of the proceedings.\n\n12.\n\nThis ties in with Arbitration Rule 15 which makes the deliberations private and secret. Only Members of the *ad hoc* Committee (or Arbitrators as the case may be) shall take part and no other persons are admitted.\n\n13.\n\nThese rules stand to reason and are mandatory. It may be doubted whether they can be waived, which would at least require the consent of all Committee Members (or Arbitrators). It means that the deliberations and related exchanges cannot properly be conducted through the Secretariat. The role of the Secretariat in record keeping (to the extent records exist) does not distract from these rules; the deliberations are not part of\n\n14.\n\nThe need for this system to be respected is especially clear in a case like the present one where serious reputational issues are at stake. Privacy and secrecy are here of the essence to promote free communication whilst protecting *ad hoc* Committee Members (or as the case may be Arbitrators) but no less the persons whose reputation may be affected. It should be noted in this regard that the Secretariat, whilst receiving any of this information, appears to be under no similar secrecy obligation.\n\n15.\n\nHowever this may be, the ICSID Secretariat is not entitled to this information and can not act on it at will. On the basis of what it sees, it may well be able to take the initiative in alerting the Committee to clear mistakes or oversights but it should do so in writing, to all Members simultaneously, and not otherwise intervene in any way, except if formally asked to do so by the Committee for clearly defined purposes which should never affect the substance of the case, either directly or indirectly.\n\n16.\n\nAnother idea seems to be that the Secretariat is the voice of a *jurisprudence constante* which it is its task to advance and protect and which gives it an autonomous right of intervention. This is also profoundly mistaken and may be seriously prejudicial to the parties. In any event, it is far too early to assume the existence of such a *jurisprudence* and its status as law would be uncertain even if it existed. It may be recalled that in international law, there has never been a rule of binding precedent and this is so for very good reasons.\n\n17.\n\nFor the moment, the formulation of any such *jurisprudence* must be left to academics whilst it should be appreciated that to engage in a form of system creation in this manner or of thinking in academic models is not necessarily objective and free of intellectual prejudice or other bias. It is in any event not the allotted task of the Secretariat to assume the academic mantle and it is not, and could not be staffed for it.\n\n18.\n\nThe Secretariat should not have a policy or view in these matters but respect the authority and independence of the Arbitral Tribunals and *ad* for Committees which must find the law on the basis of the facts as they present themselves to them. This does not, of course, rule out that earlier cases may have persuasive value but it is for the relevant Tribunal or *ad hoc* Committee to decide in each instance, taking into account the submissions of the parties.\n\n19.\n\nSubmissions by the Secretariat, whatever the intention, are here legally irrelevant and no more than unsolicited opinion. Not being subject to examination by the parties, they cannot carry any weight.\n\n20.\n\nDecisions of this nature are also not legal textbooks or preachers\u2019 manuals and *ad hoc* Committees or Tribunals should not make them so in the reasoning. In any event, I do not believe that parties can be asked to pay for such exercises which make the opinions ever longer and more unmanageable or even muddled and do not do the international arbitration practice any favours. We are here primarily to solve a problem for the parties, not for others in the present or the future, and do not operate in this regard as ordinary judges.\n\n21.\n\nIn sum, the Secretariat is not the fourth member of ICSID Tribunals or *ad hoc* Committees and is not an interested party in any other way. It also does not have powers of scrutiny in the manner of the ICC Court. Although in practice it acts as appointing authority - in the case of *ad hoc* Committees of all Members - these Committees do not thereby become the extension of the Secretariat.\n\n22.\n\nThe potentially close interconnection in the present practices of the Secretariat between furthering its own role and its powers of appointment requires scrutiny and these practices themselves greater transparency. It lifts the question of the independence of *ad hoc* Committee Members and Arbitrators appointed by ICSID to the institutional level within ICSID. What is particularly necessary is that any semblance of collusion between the Secretariat and the Arbitrators or Committee Members it effectively appoints is avoided.\n\n23.\n\nIn short, it is urgent that the Secretariat clarifies its own role, which under the Convention, Administrative and Financial Regulations, and Arbitration Rules can be no more than one of support, respects and reinforces the privacy and secrecy of the deliberations of the *ad hoc* Committees or Tribunals, separates itself entirely and meticulously from the substance of the proceedings, appreciates that in legal matters wording is substance, organizes itself accordingly, and seeks financial support for this limited role only.\n\n24.\n\nTo conclude, the key issue in this annulment case was foremost the issue of independence of Arbitrators in the Second Award, but it became also an issue of the independence of the Members of the Second *ad hoc* Committee and, in that context, of the privacy and secrecy of their deliberations and drafts.\n\n25.\n\nWhat hovers over all of this is the potentially pernicious impact of the desire for (re)appointment in many, not least for financial gain, in which not only withholding from the parties relevant information, as was the subject of the decision of this *ad hoc* Committee, but also incurring the favour of the Secretariat, may be important issues in terms of independence. Recently, the world has been rightly dismayed at the complete lack of judgment in grasping senior bankers. Whatever the rights or wrongs in this case, it may serve as a serious warning, also for ICSID arbitrators.\n\n26.\n\nIf the self-cleansing forces in the international arbitration system are no longer sufficiently strong, and if there is thus a need for closer supervision of Arbitrators and *ad hoc* Committee Members, this would not be the task of the ICSID Secretariat, which itself should be properly supervised, but must come from a treaty change probably involving the creation and operation of a specialised *international court* which might also function as ultimate supervisor and referee in international commercial arbitrations (including challenges and recognition issues) where similar needs may increasingly exist."}]}
