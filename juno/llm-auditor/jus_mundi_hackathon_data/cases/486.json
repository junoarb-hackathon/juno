I am, therefore, setting out below reasons for my Separate Opinion.\n\n**I. FACTS RELEVANT TO JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**a. Parties**\n--------------\n\n1.\n\nThe statement in paragraph 1 of the Decision that Claimants are members of a group of companies known collectively as the Grupo Marsans does not substantiate or clarify the averments in paragraph 2 of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on Merits dated 29.9.2012 (\"CMM\") to the effect that the Claimants purchased Argentine Airlines in 2001 and owned and operated them until the Argentine Government nationalized them in 2008. These averments remain unproven assertions and would have to be proved by production of evidence. The rejection of Objections to Jurisdiction, therefore, is subject to the power reserved by the Tribunal to conclusively determine the objections after consideration of the evidence presented at the merits stage.\n\n**b. Dispute**\n--------------\n\n**(i) Acquisition of the Argentine Airlines**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nFrom the evidence thus far produced at the jurisdiction stage it is clear that it was a Spanish Company, Air Comet, which acquired the shares held by Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (\"SEPI\"), a Spanish Government entity for one dollar under the Share Purchase Agreement dated 20 October, 2001 (\"SPA\"). As noted above in paragraph 1, the Claimants\u2019 assertion in the CMM that the Claimants purchased Argentine Airlines in 2001 and owned and operated them until 2008 remains an unproven assertion. Footnote 8 in the Decision starts with the assertion that Teinver\u2019s initial share purchase (was) in 2006, which is clearly inconsistent with the statement in paragraph 2 of the Claimants CMM that \"Claimants purchased the Argentine Airlines in 2001\". In that footnote, the ownership structure in place at the time that Claimants instituted this arbitration on December 11, 2008 is described, and it concludes with the following statement: \"During this time, Air Comet has kept its shareholdings in Interinvest, which in turn has kept its shareholdings in ARSA and AUSA.\" What is meant by \"during this time\" in this statement needs to be clarified.\n\n3.\n\nWithout these clarifications, and consideration of evidence, the following statements in paragraph 8 of the Decision raise certain questions:\n\n\"[A]cording to Claimants, the dispute centers on two preliminary issues:\n\n(i) a disagreement between the Parties as to the Argentine regulatory framework\u2014regarding airfare caps in particular\u2014within which the Argentine Airlines were required to operate between 2002 and 2008, and\n\n(ii) disagreement between the Parties as to the remedy due to Claimants for the expropriation of their shares in those airlines\".\n\nThe questions raised are as follows: Who are \"the Parties\" referred to in sub-paragraph (i) above, which shares can be described as \"their (Claimants\u2019) shares\" and on what basis can the Claimants assert ownership of shares which are described in sub-paragraph (ii) above as **\"their** shares\" in the airlines ?\n\nThe answer to these questions will have to be taken into account in order to arrive at definitive findings at the merits stage on key questions such as Claimants\u2019 investments. The statement in paragraph 2 of the CMM that: \"This is a straightforward case of formal expropriation without compensation by the Government of Argentina... the GOA has paid no compensation to the **Claimants** for taking of **their investments\"** requires consideration of evidence to determine what is meant by **Claimants\u2019 investments** and whether **their** investments have been the subject-matter of expropriation.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n**a. Request for Arbitration and its Registration by ICSID**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Separate Opinion relies on the Procedural History set out in Part II of the Decision.\n\n**III. POSITION OF THE PARTIES ON JURISDICTION**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nRespondent\u2019 submissions are summarized in paragraph 72 of the Decision as follows:\n\ni. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimants failed to meet the requirements set forth in Article **X** of the Treaty;\n\nii. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimants have no legal standing to claim for legal rights that belong to another legal person;\n\niii. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate certain of Claimants\u2019 allegations that concern the acts of non-state entities, which cannot be attributed to Respondent; and\n\niv. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the investment invoked by Claimants is not an investment protected by the Treaty.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 Submissions on Jurisdiction are summarized in paragraph 73 of the Decision as follows:\n\ni. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 claims because Claimants have satisfied the procedural provisions of the Australia-Argentina BIT, which they may rely on through the application of the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause;\n\nii. The Tribunal has jurisdiction, in the alternative, because Claimants have satisfied and/or are excused for reasons of futility from the requirements set forth in Article X of the Treaty;\n\niii. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 claims because Claimants are legitimate parties to this arbitration;\n\niv. The Tribunal should defer questions of state attribution for acts of nonstate entities to the merits phase of this arbitration or, in the alternative, determine that the acts alleged are attributable to Respondent; and\n\nv. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 claims because Claimants\u2019 investment was acquired and effected in accordance with the legislation of Argentina and in good faith.\n\n**IV. JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS**\n---------------------------------\n\n**a. First Jurisdictional Objection: Claimants\u2019 fulfillment of the procedural requirements of Article X of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants failed to meet the requirements of Article 10. Specifically, Respondent alleges that Claimants have not attempted to amicably settle their dispute in accordance with Article X(l) and (2) of the Treaty and further that Claimants have not subjected their dispute to the Argentine courts for a period of eighteen months before seeking this arbitration, in accordance with Article X(3). (Paragraphs 2 to 25 - Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Objection to Jurisdiction -\"RMOJ\").\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants have made two responses to this objection. First, Claimants assert that they are entitled to invoke the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause in Article IV(2) in order to benefit from the more favorable dispute settlement provisions of other BITs negotiated by Argentina. Second, Claimants assert that even if the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause does not permit them to borrow the dispute settlement provisions from other Argentine BITs, they have satisfied the requirements of Article X of the Treaty, or, in the alternative, that they should be excused from Article X\u2019s requirements for reasons of futility. (Paragraphs 7 to 10 - Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction \"(MJ\").\n\n**i. Compliance with the requirements of Article X**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal first addressed the issue of Claimants\u2019 Compliance with the requirements of Article X of the Treaty. After a careful and exhaustive consideration of the submissions and the evidence presented and the reasons articulated in paragraphs 107 to 136 the Tribunal found that the Claimants have satisfied the requirements of Article X(l-3) of the Treaty (paragraph 116 of the Decision).\n\n10.\n\nIn my view, therefore, since the Tribunal has arrived at an agreed finding that the Claimants have satisfied the procedural requirements of Article X of the BIT, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to embark upon consideration of the alternative submission invoking the MFN clause. In my view when an issue can be resolved, as in this case, by relying on an express provision (Article X) and a clear finding can be, and has been, arrived at that its requirements have been fulfilled, recourse to the MFN clause is not justified. That would involve reaching out to other agreements and consideration of contested issues on which an agreed interpretation would be difficult and may even prove to be impossible. This is why recourse in these circumstances to the MFN clause may well be avoided. The more so, since jurisprudence on the issue of whether an MFN clause can be applied to jurisdictional issues reveals considerable divergence of juristic views and is the subject of continuing controversy.\n\n11.\n\nThe parties had pointed to a significant body of jurisprudence on the issue of whether MFN clauses can be applied to jurisdictional issues. Both parties had acknowledged that this body of case law is not consistent, and that there remains a great deal of controversy on this issue.\"1. The divergence of opinions by tribunals on MFN clauses is not only with regard to the interpretation of ordinary meaning.\n\nCases relating to MFN include: *Maffezini v Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No.ARB/97/7, 2000  \n*Salini Construttori e Italstrade S. atA. V. Jordan,* ICSID Case No.ARB/02/13, 2004 *Plama Consortium Limited v.

The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31, Award, 7 October, 2011.\n\n12.\n\nInvestment arbitration jurisprudence on the ordinary meaning of MFN provisions has not been entirely consistent, even when the same BIT is concerned. Notably, each of the cases that has addressed Article IV(2) of the Spain-Argentina BIT has concluded that the broad language of the MFN clause applies to the Article X dispute resolution provisions. However, other tribunals have disagreed. The Belgium/Luxembourg-Soviet Union BIT applied by the tribunal in *Berschader* contained \"all matters\" language similar to that of the Spain-Argentina BIT. Nonetheless, the *Berschader* tribunal rejected the claimant\u2019s attempt to use the MFN clause. In contrast with the tribunals in *Maffezini, Gas Natural* and the *Suez* cases, the tribunal in *Berschader* noted that \"all matters covered by the present treaty\" cannot be interpreted \"literally,\" because the MFN clause is not capable of being applied at all to several of the matters covered by the BIT.\n\n13.\n\nI would like to express my reservation with regard to the analysis and observations set out in paragraphs 137 to 186 of the Decision and to express my disagreement with the conclusion expressed in paragraph 186 which commences with statement that: \"the Tribunal finds that Claimants may equally rely on the Article IV(2) MFN clause of the Treaty to make use of the dispute resolution provisions contained in Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina BIT.\"\n\n14.\n\nI find support for my view in recent juristic writing, in which the cases have been critically analyzed. Newcombe and Paradell2 after reviewing the jurisprudence observe that: \"... the overview of the jurisprudence... highlights (that) tribunals have adopted conflicting approaches to the application of MFN clauses to investor-state arbitration provisions\" and that \"(t)he use of MFN treatment to obtain the more favourable procedural treatment in other investor-state arbitration provisions has been criticized on the basis that it amounts to cherry picking\", and conclude that: \"At present, the more persuasive view is that MFN treatment obligations with respect to foreign investment and investors arise only on the basis of an express treaty obligation.\"\n\n*Law and Practice of Investment Treaties, Standards of Treatment,* Chapter 5, \"Most Favoured Nation Treatment\", pages: 194 to 232, Wolters Kluwer, 2009\n\n15.\n\nCampbell McLachlan QC *et al.* have expressed their views in the following terms:3 \"This analysis led the Tribunal to substitute instead a  simple rule of construction to the effect that an MFN provision would not apply to dispute settlement provisions unless the parties expressly provided that it did. It is submitted that the reasoning of the Tribunal in *Plama* is to be strongly preferred over that in Maffezini... The result, if, as is suggested, the approach in Plama is preferred, will be that the MFN clause will not apply to investment treaties\u2019 dispute settlement provisions, save where the States expressly so provide.\"\n\nCampbell McLachlan, Laurence Shore and Matthew Weiniger, *International Investment Arbitration, Substantive Principles,* Oxford, 2008, p.75.)\n\n16.\n\nA critical review which covers some of the most recent cases by Paparinskis concludes that:4\n\n\"The cases after 2007 are less easily read as reflecting an even implicit consensus. Some recent decisions follow the earlier approaches. The 2009 decision in *Tza Yap Shum* and the majority decision in *Austrian Airlines* rejected the investors\u2019 argument for the extension of its jurisdiction. The former tribunal explained itself as following both *Plama* and *Maffezini* and the majority of the latter tribunal also relied on the distinction between substantive and procedural rules attracted by the MFN clause. In 2011, a majority of the Impregilo tribunal explicitly situated itself within the *Maffezini* line of decisions. However, the recent general trend rejects earlier practices and explanations.\"\n\nICSID Review, Fall 2011, \"MFN Clauses and International Dispute Settlement: Moving beyond *Maffezini and Plama\",* pp. 14-35\n\n17.\n\nI find the analysis in the Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of Professor Brigitte Stern in the *Impregilo* case persuasive. The following extracts from that Opinion are set out below:5\n\n\"78. Just as an MFN clause cannot change the conditions *ratione personae, ratione materiae,* and *ratione temporis,* as has just been demonstrated, it must be equally true that an MFN clause cannot change the condition *ratione voluntatis,* which is a qualifying condition for the enjoyment of the jurisdictional rights open for the protection of substantial rights.\n\n79. In other words, before a provision relating to the dispute settlement mechanism can be imported into the basic treaty, the right to international arbitration - here ICSID arbitration - has to be capable of coming into existence for the foreign investor under the basic treaty, in other words the existence of this right is conditioned on the fulfillment of all the necessary conditions for such jurisdiction, the conditions *ratione personae, ratione materiae,* and *ratione temporis* as well as a supplementary condition relating to the scope of the State\u2019s consent to such jurisdiction, the condition *ratione voluntatis.*\n\n80. As long as the qualifying conditions expressed by the State in order to give its consent are not fulfilled, there is no consent, in other words no access of the foreign investor to the jurisdictional treatment granted by ICSID arbitration. An MFN clause cannot enlarge the scope of the basic treaty\u2019s right to international arbitration, it cannot be used to grant access to international arbitration when this is not possible under the conditions provided for in the basic treaty.\n\n\u2026\n\n83. There appears to be no legal reason to treat differently these two types of requirements that condition the State\u2019s consent. On this issue, I am in agreement with my co-arbitrator Charles Brower, who explained in his Separate opinion in *Renta 4,* that \"... there is no reason to differentiate between admissibility-related aspects of accessing investor-State arbitration and matters of jurisdiction...\"\n\n\u2026\n\n93. The importance of consent has always been stressed in international arbitration cases and especially in ICSID cases. *Plama,* of course, has laid a great emphasis on the necessity of a clear an unambiguous consent:\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the following consideration is equally, if not more, important.... Nowadays, arbitration is the generally accepted avenue for resolving disputes between investors and states. Yet, that phenomenon does not take away *the basic prerequisite for arbitration: an agreement of the parties to arbitrate.* It is a well-established principle, both in domestic and international law, that *such an agreement should be clear and unambiguous.* In the framework of a BIT, the agreement to arbitrate is arrived at by the consent to arbitration that a state gives in advance in respect of investment disputes falling under the BIT, and the acceptance thereof by an investor if the latter so desires.\n\nDoubts as to the parties\u2019 clear and unambiguous intention can arise if the agreement to arbitrate is to be reached by incorporation by reference\".\n\n96. The decision in *Wintershall* has insisted again on the idea that the State must have given its consent and that this consent is a condition for the access to international arbitration:\n\nIn the present case, therefore the BIT between Argentina/and Germany is a treaty undoubtedly providing for a right of access to international arbitration (ICSID) for foreign investors, who are German nationals -but this right of access to ICSID arbitration is not provided for unreservedly, but upon condition of first approaching competent Courts in Argentina... a local-remedies rule may be lawfully provided for in the BIT - under the first part of Article 26; once so provided, as in Article 10(2), *it becomes a condition of Argentina\u2019s \"consent\" -which is, in effect, Argentina\u2019s \"offer \" to arbitrate disputes under the BIT, but only upon acceptance and compliance by an investor of the provisions inter alia of Article 10(2);* an investor (like the Claimant) can accept the \"offer\" only as so conditioned.\"\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/07/17 references are to paragraphs in the *Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of* Professor Brigitte Stern.\n\n18.\n\nI am, therefore, of the view that recourse to the MFN clause in the present case is neither necessary nor justified.\n\n**b. Second Jurisdictional Objection: Claimants\u2019 Standing**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Claimants\u2019 Investment in Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position as elaborated in paragraphs 85 to 215 of the Memorial on\n\nObjections to the Jurisdiction dated 6 December, 2010 (\"MOJ\"), at pages 41 to 79 may be summarized as follows:\n\n(a) Argentina-Spain BIT does not afford any protection to \"indirect shareholders\"\n\n(b) No \"investment\" **recognized** by **Argentine** law was expropriated.\n\n(c) The definition of \"investment\" under the Argentine-Spain BIT is clearly narrower than that under the US-Argentina BIT. The following submission is made in paragraph 164 of the MOJ, page 64:\n\n\"164. The concept of investment under the US-Argentina BIT is clearly broader than that of the Argentina-Spain BIT. For these reasons, the material scope of the Argentina-Spain BIT should not be extended, as Claimants wrongly expect, to include their mere interests in the indirect shareholdings they currently have (in the case of Teinver S.A.) or previously had (in the case of Transportes de Cercanias S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A.) in Interinvest S.A., Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. and Austral-Cielos del Sur. Claimants cannot interpret the applicable BIT in an extensive manner, distorting its content and invoking a scope of protection that simply does not exist.\"\n\n20.\n\nI find that the Decision has not addressed the reasoning underlying the above arguments but tends to follow, what in my view, are questionable assertions in some earlier ICSID cases. The facts of this case do not justify simply adopting the interpretations which found favour in earlier cases, in particular in cases such as *Siemens v. Argentine Republic or Mobil Corporation v. Venezuela.*\n\n21.\n\nI find it difficult to accept the reasoning in the *Siemens* case which is set out in the following terms (emphasis added):\n\n\"The Tribunal has conducted a detailed analysis of the reference in the Treaty to \"investment\" and \"investor\". **The Tribunal observes that there is no explicit reference to direct or indirect investment as such in the Treaty.\"**\n\n\u2026\n\n**\"The Treaty does not require that there be no interposed companies between the investment and the ultimate owner of the company.**\n\nTherefore, a literal reading of the Treaty does not support the allegation that the definition of investment **excludes** indirect investments.\" (paragraph No. 137 of the Decision on Jurisdiction dated 03.08.2004 in *Siemens Ag v. Argentine Republic I)*\n\n**\"The tribunal notes that there is no explicit reference to direct or indirect investments in the BIT. The definition of investment given in Article 1 is very broad. It includes \"every kind of assets\" and enumerates specific categories of investments as examples. One of those categories consists of \"shares, bonds or other kinds of interests in companies and joint ventures\".**\n\n\u2026\n\n**\"The BIT does not require that there be no interposed companies between the ultimate owner of the company or of the joint venture and the investment. Therefore, a literal reading of the BIT does not support the allegation that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments.\"**\n\nI find equally unacceptable the reasoning in the Mobil case referred to which is stated in the following terms: \"Investment as defined in Article 1 could be direct or indirect as recognized in similar cases\". (Paragraph No. 165 of the Decision on Jurisdiction dated 10.06.2010 in *Mobil Corporation, Venezuela and others vs. Venezuela.)*\n\n22.\n\nIn Article 1(2) of the BIT: (emphasis added in dark bold letters):\n\n\"The term **\"investments\" shall mean any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind, acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment** and in particular, but not exclusively, the following:\n\n- Shares and other terms of participation in companies;\n\n\u2026\n\n**The content and scope of the rights** corresponding to the **various categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Party in whose territory the investment is situated.\"**\n\n\u2026\n\nThe words **\"in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving investments\"** in Article 1(2) must be given due weight.\n\n23.\n\nIn my view on a plain reading of the words in Article 1(2) of the BIT shares **held** in a company means shares **directly** held, unless **indirectly held** shares **are expressly included.** An interpretation, which would **expand** the meaning to include shares \"indirectly held\" cannot be understood to be the plain meaning of the word \"held\" since \"indirectly held\" widens the scope without limit, and enlarges the obligation imposed (also without limit). It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that to include \"shares indirectly held\" this must be done expressly as in the US BITs.\n\n24.\n\nI think we need to heed the caution counseled by Campbell McLachlan and his coauthors in the following terms:\n\n\"Those involved in investment treaty arbitrations should take care not to allow the use of other awards to transgress the appropriate boundaries. Their citation should not overwhelm a tribunal\u2019s consideration of the case before it.\"6\n\nCampbell McLachlan *at el.,* op. cit. p. 75\n\n25.\n\nIn my view the following submissions merit serious consideration:\n\n(a) The interpretative principle of *in dubio mitius,* requires that in interpreting treaties, if the meaning of a term is ambiguous, that meaning is to be preferred which is less onerous to the party assuming an obligation, or which interferes less with the territorial and personal supremacy of a party, or involves less general restrictions upon the parties.7\n\n(b) The Respondent in its Memorial on Objections to the Jurisdiction dated 6 December 2010 submits that: \"Under international law, indirect or derivative claims cannot be filed. Nonetheless, some treaties have expressly provided for indirect or derivative actions under extraordinary circumstances. This constitutes an exception to the general principle that no person may bring a claim on behalf of another\" (p. 56, para 141). In support of its argument the Respondent cites the *Case Concerning Ahmadou Sadio Diallo8* and *International Thunderbird Gaming Corp and the United Mexican States,* UNCITRAL case under the NAFTA rules (Submission of the United States of America, paras 4-9.)\n\nJennings, R.

Democratic Republic of Congo,* 2007 I.C. J. 1 (May 24), 88.\n\n26.\n\nIn a recent survey of awards by M. Valasek and P. Dumberry, the following views are expressed:9\n\n\"... arbitral tribunals have also recognized the right of intermediate (\"shell\") corporations to submit their own claims to arbitration. These developments have even led some authors to suggest the existence of a new \"rule\" of customary international law providing shareholders with a procedural \"right\" to bring arbitration claims against the State where they make the investment. These are undoubtedly overall positive developments for the protection of foreign investors. This evolution nevertheless gives rise to several legitimate concerns from the perspective of capital-importing States that have entered into numerous BITs.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe first area of concern relates to the fact that BITs typically do not distinguish between minority and majority shareholders which can submit separate claims from that of the corporation. As a matter of principle, all shareholders big and small, should receive legal protection under a BIT that does not expressly distinguish between them. This situation nevertheless raises some concerns where a corporation\u2019s share capital is divided between numerous shareholders each holding a very small percentage of the total number of shares (imagine, for instance, 100 different shareholders each owning a mere 1% of the corporation\u2019s share). Nothing (apart, of course, from the high costs of pursuing international arbitration) would prevent all these different shareholders from filing their own separate claims against the host State for the same treaty breach. Another area of concern is related to the protection offered to indirect investments made through multiple layers of intermediate corporations. Again, under a typical BIT, each holding company in a long chain of ownership could file its own separate claim against the host State for the same treaty breach.\n\nAs a result, capital-importing countries having entered into a significant number of BIT\u2019s will increasingly run the risk of being respondents in multiple (and often simultaneous) arbitration claims filed by different entities included in the increasingly sophisticated and complex corporate structure of foreign investors. Such multiple claims will clearly result in very high legal costs for respondent States. They will also increase the likelihood of inconsistent arbitral decisions.\n\nThis possibility is not merely theoretical, as shown by the Lauder saga. Mr. Lauder, a U.S. national, was the ultimate beneficiary of an investment he made in the Czech Republic through an intermediate corporation (CME, a Dutch corporation). Mr. Lauder commenced an arbitration claim under the U.S. -Czech Republic BIT, while CME, 6 months later, started its own proceeding before a different arbitral tribunal under the Netherlands -Czech Republic BIT. Both claims arose from the *same facts.* It should be noted that the Czech Republic refused to consolidate the proceedings as requested by the Claimants. The disturbing aspect of these two parallel arbitration cases is that one Tribunal concluded that the Czech Republic had expropriated the investment and awarded $360 million in damages to the Claimant, while the other Tribunal rejected the claim.\n\nThe scenarios envisaged above also raise the issue of *remoteness* between a shareholder and the actual investment... This issue was addressed by the *Enron* Tribunal, which summarized a concern raised by Argentina as follows:\n\nThe *Enron* Tribunal concluded that such concern raises the \"need to establish a cut-off point beyond which claims would not be permissible as they would have only a remote connection to the affected company. For the *Enron* Tribunal, the establishment of a \"cut-off point\" beyond which claims by indirect shareholders would not be allowed should be based on \"the extent of the consent to arbitration of the host State:\"\n\nIf consent has been given in respect of an investor and an investment, it can be reasonably concluded that the claims brought by such investor are admissible under the treaty. If the consent cannot be considered as extending to another investor or investment, these other claims should then be considered inadmissible as being only remotely connected with the affected company and the scope of the legal system protecting that investment.\n\nThe issue of remoteness of claims is likely to be one of the most contentious in the future. While some authors have criticized the *Enron* Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on the \"cut-off point\" as lacking any \"legal foundation\", recent awards have acknowledged the seriousness of the issue. As explained by the *Phoenix* Tribunal, some concern has indeed been voiced by international tribunals, *and is shared by this Tribunal,* that not any minor portion of indirectly owned shares should necessarily be considered as an investment. For good reasons, tribunals will, however, be reluctant to establish in each case where exactly should be the cut-off point. Indeed, no consensus exists on what \"too remote\" really means in practical terms.\"\n\n\"Developments in the Legal Standing of Shareholders and Holding Corporations in Investor-State Dispute\", ICSID Review, Spring 2011, p. 73 et seq.\n\n27.\n\nThe Argentine Republic has rightly raised a concern about the fact that if minority shareholders can claim independently from the affected corporation, this could trigger an endless chain of claims, as any shareholder making an investment in a company that makes an investment in another company, and so on, could invoke a direct right of action for measures affecting a corporation at the end of the chain.\n\n28.\n\nIn the instant case, there is no evidence at this stage that participation of the Claimants\u2019 investments was specifically sought by the host state so that they may be treated as included within the consent to arbitration given by the Argentine Republic.\n\n29.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence thus far presented it is not possible to arrive at a finding that the Claimants have established that they have \"indirect investment\" through multiple-layers of corporate entities which can qualify as \"protected investment\" under Article 1(2) of the BIT. In the article cited above, in paragraph 26, it is stated that some authors suggest the existence of a **new rule** of customary international law providing shareholders with a procedural **right** to bring arbitration claims against the state where they make the investment. It is noteworthy that both the words \"rule\" and the word \"right\" in the passage quoted are advisedly placed within inverted commas indicating that the new rule has yet to be recognized as an established rule on which there is general consensus. Indeed the circumstances in which shareholders may exercise a \"right\" against the host state of a company located within the state would depend upon the specific facts and circumstances and the terms of the relevant treaty and contractual arrangements.\n\n30.\n\nWhen a Treaty provision, Article 1(2), defines terms which necessarily require consideration of Argentine law, such as whether an investment has been made in accordance with Argentina law, and where it expressly provides that the scope and content of the rights corresponding to the various categories of assets shall be determined by Argentine law, it is necessary to consider whether the \"rights\" or \"assets\" are recognized as such by Argentine law.\n\n31.\n\nIn paragraph 233 of the Decision Respondent\u2019s policy arguments against the Claimants asserting claims on the basis of indirect shareholding are noted. I agree with the observation in paragraphs 234 of the Decision that Respondent\u2019s assertion could have relevance in the merits stage proceeding of this case, but are not relevant at the jurisdictional stage. I, however, disagree with the views expressed in paragraph 235, in particular, with the concluding sentence to the effect that the Claimants have standing **to recover for damages** that were inflicted upon the companies and that ordinary language of Article 1(2) **is designed to protect \"all assets\" including indirect shareholdings** and the finding \"the Tribunal also finds that Claimants are not deprived of standing by the fact that their investments were made through their subsidiary, Air Comet.\" This should not preclude consideration by the Tribunal at the merits stage of the issue whether reliefs sought on the basis of \"rights\" asserted in respect of \"investments\" made through Air Comet can be granted. These \"findings\" while they may be seen as rejecting the jurisdictional objection to standing cannot definitively determine the question without consideration of the evidence to be presented at the merits stage together with provisions of Argentine law which are relevant to determine whether the Claimants\u2019 rights may be enforced and the reliefs claimed may be granted.\n\n32.\n\nThe relevant provisions of Argentine corporate law would need to be considered and interpreted before such findings can be arrived at.\n\n**ii. Claimants\u2019 other investments**\n------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nI agree with the first sentence of paragraph 238 that the Decision to the effect that the Tribunal will not address Claimants\u2019 other alleged investments at this time, but cannot agree with the definitive finding expressed in the second sentence that the Tribunal find that Claimants\u2019 indirect shareholdings constitute an \"investment\" under the Treaty. While for the purpose of determining standing such evidence as has been placed at the jurisdiction stage may be sufficient to justify that finding, this cannot be definitive when other issues are concerned, such as the effect of illegality or fraud committed in the course of performance as well as the effect of an assignment agreement and a funding agreement entered into after the initiation of the arbitration which could materially affect rights relating to that investment and their enforceability in the sense of grant of reliefs claimed in respect of those rights.\n\n**iii. Claimants\u2019 third-party funding agreement and assignment of award proceeds**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nDuring the hearing on jurisdiction, Respondent raised its concern that Claimants\u2019 and Air Comet\u2019s recent reorganization proceedings in Spain could affect Claimants\u2019 authorization to bring this case. In its post-hearing submissions, Respondent has also questioned two agreements entered into by Claimants subsequent to commencing this arbitration. One of these, a Credit Assignment Agreement among Teinver, Transportes Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos as the assignors and Air Comet as the assignee (the \"Assignment Agreement\"), dated January 18, 2010, concerned the assignment to Air Comet of the proceeds of a potential award in this arbitration. The other, a Funding Agreement made between Claimants and Burford Capital Limited, an investment company headquartered in Guernsey, and effective as of April 14, 2010 (the \"Funding Agreement\"), concerned the financing of Claimants\u2019 litigation expenses in this arbitration.\n\n35.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that Air Comet commenced voluntary reorganization proceedings on April 20, 2010. Nor do they dispute that the Claimants each commenced voluntary reorganization roughly a year later, with Teinver on December 23, 2010, Autobuses Urbanos on January 28, 2011, and Transportes de Cercanias on February 16, 2011.\n\n36.\n\nThe Parties also acknowledge that Claimants concluded the Assignment Agreement, by which Claimants agreed to assign to Air Comet proceeds of an eventual award in this case. In addition, the Parties acknowledge that Claimants executed the Funding Agreement with Burford. However, the Parties disagree as to the effects of these agreements on Claimants\u2019 standing in this case.\n\n37.\n\nI agree with the statement in paragraph 255 of the Decision that international case law has consistently determined that jurisdiction is generally to be assessed as of the date the case is filed. I, therefore, agree with the conclusion of the Tribunal that Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection may be rejected to the extent that the allegations concern events that post-date the filing of the arbitration. I also agree with the view of the Tribunal expressed in paragraph 259 that it will not address Respondent\u2019s allegations regarding Claimants\u2019 reorganization, assignment agreement and the funding agreement which post-date the filing of the arbitration, but that these will receive due consideration at the merits stage.\n\n**c. Third Jurisdictional Objection: Issues of State Attribution**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nI agree with the view of the Tribunal 274 of the Decision that: \"... Given the factintensive nature of Claimants\u2019 allegations, the Tribunal must postpone adjudication of this issue until the merits phase.\"\n\n**d. Fourth Jurisdictional Objection: The Legality of Claimants\u2019 Investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Position of Respondent**\n-----------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent asserted that the Claimants have violated Spanish and Argentine law, and committed other misdeeds and, therefore, they cannot assert any rights claimed under the Claimants\u2019 alleged investments or seek to enforce them or obtain any relief with respect to those \"rights\". The violations of Spanish law are summarized in paragraph 278 to 289 and the violations of Argentine law are summarized in paragraphs 290 to 292. Other misdeeds are referred to in paragraphs 293.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent by is letter dated May 24, 2012 notified the Tribunal as follows:\n\n\"... the Commercial matter No. 9 of Madrid found Gerardo Diaz Ferran and Gonzalo Pascual Arias - holders of a controlling interest in Claimants and witnesses in this arbitration - guilty of the bankruptcy of Seguros Mercurio, S.A. Furthermore, the court found Teinver S.L., one of the Claimants in this arbitration proceeding, and other companies of the Marsans Group, such as Viajes Marsans S.A. and Hotetur Club S.L, liable as accomplices to the bankruptcy\" and than \"... fraudulent acts were carried out by means of complex legal and accounting operations. In the opinion of the court, \"all of them are part of a coordinated action aimed at removing the assets of the reorganized company in favour of other companies of the group.\n\nIn this sense, for instance, the court established that \"by virtue of a private agreement entered into with a company in which Teinver has a 100% interest, related to Seguros Mercurio and also owned by Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias through other companies, Seguros Mercurio proceeded to make payments in the amount of 5,847,039.84 euro in favour of other companies of the group other than the purchaser company.\" In light of the explanations afforded by the accused parties with respect to the terms of such operation, the court concluded that \"the explanations provided by Mr. Diaz Ferran at the hearing were devoid of any logic.\n\nAnother questionable operation took place on October 30, 2009 and involves the sale of real property by Teinver to Seguros Mercurio. Oddly enough, it was found that at the time of the sale the property was about to be foreclosed at the request of the mortgagee. In this respect, the court held that \"the operation is censurable from the legal point of view since it can be affirmed that, through it, a sham has been attempted in order to convey a property image different from the actual one.\n\nSpecially in relation to Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias, the judge concluded that they should be reached by the declaration of guilt as \"as they acknowledged in the act of the trial, they designed the operations described, controlling and deciding on the management not only of Seguros Mercurio, but of the entire Group, of which they were practically the sole shareholders.\"\n\nThe Respondent submits that the above facts provide a ground to the Tribunal for rejection on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.\n\n41.\n\nI agree with the general observation in the Decision that for the purpose of jurisdiction timing is relevant, and that the Tribunal should focus on illegality at the initiation of the investment. Matters which arise during performance of the investment or which are subsequently found to have occurred would not sustain a jurisdictional objection. I, however, agree with the view elaborated in the *Hamester* case cited in paragraph 320 of the Decision, as follows:\n\n\"... Legality in the subsequent life or performance of the investment is not addressed in Article 10. It follows that this does not bear upon the scope of application of the BIT (and hence this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction) - albeit that it may well be relevant in the context of the substantive merits of a claim brought under the BIT. Thus, on the wording of this BIT, the legality of the creation of the investment is a jurisdictional issue; the legality of the investor\u2019s conduct during the life of the investment is a merits issue.\"\n\n42.\n\nI am, therefore, of the view that observation in the Decision on issues which are postcommencement would not prejudice the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of those matters in the light of evidence and submissions presented at the merits stage.\n\n43.\n\nI, therefore, agree with the conclusions in paragraph 331 of the Decision that \"The Tribunal notes that certain of the allegations raised may affect the merits of the claim and that it will be open to the parties to make further submissions in respect of these allegations as appropriate during the merits stage of the arbitration.\"\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n44.\n\nI agree with the Tribunal\u2019s view in paragraph 332 reserving this question for subsequent adjudication.\n\n**VI. DECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n--------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nI agree (subject to the observations and reservations set out above in my Separate Opinion) with the Decision of the Tribunal set out in paragraph 333 as follows:\n\n(1) The Objections to Jurisdiction are rejected;\n\n(2) It joins to the merits the determination of Respondent\u2019s responsibility for the acts of non-state entities."}], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction\n------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS** | |\n| The Treaty | Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments of October 3, 1991 |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, Washington D.C., 1965 |\n| MFN clause | Most-Favored Nation clause |\n| VCLT | Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969 |\n| Assignment Agreement | Credit Assignment Agreement among Teinver, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos as the assignors and Air Comet as the assignee, dated January 18, 2010 |\n| Funding Agreement | Funding Agreement made between Claimants and Burford Capital Limited, effective as of April 14, 2010 |\n| RFA | Claimants\u2019 Request of Arbitration, filed on December 11, 2008 |\n| Merits | Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, filed on September 29, 2010 |\n| Mem. | Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdictional Objections, filed on December 6, 2010 |\n| CM | Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, filed on January 24, 2011 |\n| Rep. | Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdictional Objections, filed on March 10, 2011 |\n| Rej. | Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, filed on April 27, 2011 |\n| Exh.

Facts Relevant to Jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**a. Parties**\n--------------\n\n1.\n\nThis claim is brought by Teinver S.A. (\"Teinver\"), Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. (\"Transportes de Cercan\u00edas\") and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. (\"Autobuses Urbanos\") (collectively, \"Claimants\"), all companies incorporated in the Kingdom of Spain, against the Argentine Republic (\"Respondent\"), under the Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain on the Promotion and Protection of Investments of October 3, 1991 (the \"Treaty\").1 Claimants are members of a group of companies known collectively as the Grupo Marsans.\n\nThe authentic language of the Treaty is the Spanish text. This Decision will generally refer to the English-language translation (Ex. C-l(ENG)), although it will revert to the authentic Spanish text where the translation is ambiguous or otherwise unsatisfactory.\n\n**b. Dispute**\n--------------\n\n2.\n\nThis dispute concerns Claimants\u2019 allegations that Respondent has violated the Treaty, international law, and Argentine law, as well as commitments and representations made by the Respondent to Claimants, by unlawfully re-nationalizing and taking other measures regarding Claimants\u2019 investments in two Argentine airlines: Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. (\"ARSA\") and Austral-Cielos del Sur S.A. (\"AUSA\") (collectively, \"the Argentine Airlines\").2\n\nRFA \u00b6\u00b6 2, 11.\n\n**i. Acquisition of the Argentine Airlines**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nBy 1991, the Spanish government, through asset purchases made by the state-owned airline Iberia L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas de Espa\u00f1a, S.A. (\"Iberia\"), was a significant shareholder in both of the Argentine Airlines. In 1994, Iberia incorporated a fully-owned Argentine subsidiary, Interinvest S.A. (\"Interinvest\"), to serve as the holding company for the Spanish investments in the Argentine airline industry.3 In 1995, the Spanish government created the Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (\"SEPI\") to operate as the holding company for all companies fully or partially owned by the Spanish government.4 As such, SEPI acquired Iberia\u2019s shareholdings in Interinvest at that time.\n\nInterinvest was incorporated in order to comply with Argentine law, which requires companies in the aeronautic sector to be held directly by an Argentine company or national. *See* Merits \u00b6 25, fn. 16.\n\nMerits \u00b6 26.\n\n4.\n\nBy mid-2001, the Argentine Airlines were experiencing financial difficulties, and ARSA filed for bankruptcy reorganization.5 In June 2001, SEPI announced that it would sell its participation in Interinvest through a bidding process. At the time, SEPI owned 99.2% of Interinvest, and in turn Interinvest held 92.1% of ARSA\u2019s shares and 90% of AUSA\u2019s shares.6 Air Comet S.A. (\"Air Comet\"), a Spanish subsidiary of Grupo Marsans, bid on Interinvest and won. At this time, Air Comet was owned by two of the three Claimants, Autobuses Urbanos (35%) and Transportes de Cercanias (35%), as well as by two other Spanish companies, Proturin SA. (29.8%) and Segetur S.A. (0.2%).7 (Claimant Teinver became a shareholder of Air Comet later, that is, on July 20, 2006, when it purchased Proturin\u2019s and Segetur\u2019s entire shareholdings.8)\n\nMerits \u00b6 28, Arias Wit. \u00b6 13.\n\nEx. C-II.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of June 16, 2011, 5; RFA Ex. C-5.\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 letter of June 16, 2011 at 5. Since Teinver\u2019s initial share purchase in 2006, the shareholding structure of Air Comet has changed several times. On October 2, 2007, Teinver became Air Comet\u2019s majority shareholder, with the following distribution of shares: Teinver (56%), Autobuses Urbanos (22%) and Transportes de Cercanias (22%). *Id.* Teinver purchased additional shares from Transportes de Cercanias on December 31, 2007, with the following distribution of shares: Teinver (66.67%), Autobuses Urbanos (22%) and Transportes de Cercanias (11.33%). *Id.* at 6. On February 8, 2008, Claimants\u2019 respective participations shifted substantially: Teinver (96.77%), Autobuses Urbanos (2.13%) and Transportes de Cercanias (1.1%). *Id.* at 6. This was the ownership structure in place at the time that Claimants instituted this arbitration on December 11, 2008. During this time, Air Comet has kept its shareholdings in Interinvest, which in turn has kept its shareholdings in ARSA and AUSA. *Id.* at 5. On December 10, 2009, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos sold their remaining shareholdings in Air Comet to Teinver, leaving Teinver as the sole shareholder of Air Comet. *Id.* at 6.\n\n5.\n\nOn October 2, 2001, Air Comet and SEPI entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), through which Air Comet acquired SEPI\u2019s 99.2% interest in Interinvest (which, in turn, maintained the interests in the Argentine Airlines noted above).9\n\nEx. C-18.\n\n6.\n\nAir Comet paid a purchase price of US$1 for the interest in Interinvest.10 Under the SPA, Air Comet agreed, in accordance with the industrial plan it created for the Argentine Airlines, to assume the assets and liabilities of the Airlines, to retain airline employees for two years, to make a US$50 million capital increase, to maintain its majority interest in the corporations, to service specified flight routes, and to expand aircraft fleets.11 For its part, SEPI agreed to assume the airlines\u2019 liabilities up to US$300 million, and to assume commitments resulting from the implementation of the industrial plan up to US$248 million.12 SEPI later agreed to contribute an additional US$205 million to cover the operational losses suffered by the airlines between July and October 2001.13\n\n*Id.* at \u00a72.\n\n*Id.* at \u00a7 7.\n\n*Id.* at\u00a7 9.\n\nMerits \u00b6 41.\n\n7.\n\nIn December 2002, ARSA and a majority of its creditors reached a settlement on debt restructuring, which was subsequently approved by an Argentine commercial court, as well as a court of appeals.14\n\nMerits \u00b6 46, Ex. C-526, C-530, C-531.\n\n**ii. Nature of the Dispute**\n-----------------------------\n\n8.\n\nClaimants allege that Respondent has unlawfully expropriated their investment in the Argentine Airlines.15 Claimants characterize this expropriation as consisting of two parts. The \"formal\" expropriation occurred when the Argentine Congress \"purposefully and explicitly\" enacted the nationalization of the companies in December 2008.16 However, this formal expropriation was allegedly the culmination of a long process of \"creeping\" expropriation which started in October 2004 or earlier.17 As such, according to Claimants, the dispute centers on two primary issues: (i) a disagreement between the Parties as to the Argentine regulatory framework\u2014regarding airfare caps in particular\u2014within which the Argentine Airlines were required to operate between 2002 and 2008, and (ii) disagreement between the Parties as to the remedy due to Claimants for the expropriation of their shares in those airlines.18\n\nMerits \u00b6 2.\n\nMerits \u00b6 357.\n\nMerits \u00b6 357.\n\nCM \u00b6 99.\n\n**II. Procedural Matters**\n--------------------------\n\n**a. Request for Arbitration and its Registration by ICSID**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn December 11, 2008, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received a Request for Arbitration (\"the Request\") against Respondent from Claimants. The Request concerned the alleged nationalization of two commercial airlines, and their subsidiaries, in which Claimants alleged having invested.\n\n10.\n\nIn the Request, Claimants invoked Argentina\u2019s consent to dispute settlement through ICSID arbitration provided in the Treaty, and, by way of an Most-Favored Nation (\"MFN\") clause contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty, in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic (the \"U.S.-Argentina BIT\").\n\n11.\n\nOn December 17, 2008, ICSID, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\"ICSID Institution Rules\"), acknowledged receipt of the Request and transmitted a copy to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington D.C.\n\n12.\n\nOn January 30, 2009, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request and notified the Parties thereof, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"the ICSID Convention\") and in accordance with Rules 6(l)(a) and 7(a) of the ICSID Institution Rules. The case was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1. On that same date, and in furtherance of Rules 7(c) and (d) of the ICSID Institution Rules, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to communicate any agreements reached regarding the number of arbitrators and the method for their appointment, and to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n**b. Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nOn April 3, 2009, Claimants requested that the Arbitral Tribunal be constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention; that the Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party and the third, the President of the Tribunal, be appointed by agreement of the Parties. On that same date, ICSID acknowledged Claimants\u2019 letter, and further advised the Parties that pursuant to Rule 3(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), either Party was to proceed to name two persons, one as their party-appointed arbitrator, and the other for the position of the President of the Tribunal. This first Party was to then invite the other Party to concur on the proposal for the position of the President of the Tribunal, and to name its party-appointed arbitrator.\n\n14.\n\nOn April 27, 2009, Claimants appointed Henri C. Alvarez, a Canadian national, as arbitrator.\n\n15.\n\nOn May 12, 2009, Claimants informed ICSID that Respondent had failed to appoint an arbitrator and had made no proposals for the position of the President of the Tribunal, and in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules requested that the Chairman of the Administrative Council appoint the two arbitrators that had not been appointed. The following day, ICSID informed Respondent that unless notification was received by May 29, 2009 that it had appointed an arbitrator, and that the Parties had reached an agreement on the appointment of the President of the Tribunal, then ICSID was to proceed to make the appointments in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention, ICSID Arbitration Rules and the normal procedures of the Centre.\n\n16.\n\nOn June 1, 2009, Respondent appointed Dr. Kamal Hossain, a Bangladeshi national, as arbitrator.\n\n17.\n\nFollowing some exchanges between the Parties and ICSID, the Parties were informed on December 14, 2009, that ICSID was to propose to the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council the appointment of Judge Thomas Buergenthal, a United States national, as the President of the Tribunal. The Parties were invited to provide observations to the proposed appointment by December 21, 2009.\n\n18.\n\nOn December 21, 2009, both Parties informed ICSID that they did not have any observations on the proposed appointment of Judge Thomas Buergenthal as President of the Tribunal.\n\n19.\n\nOn December 28, 2009, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Judge Thomas Buergenthal as President of the Tribunal.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter of January 4, 2010, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties and the arbitrators that the Tribunal was thus constituted by (i) Mr. Henri C. Alvarez, QC (appointed by Claimants), (ii) Dr. Kamal Hossain (appointed by Respondent), and (iii) Judge Thomas Buergenthal (appointed by ICSID pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention). Further, the Tribunal was informed that Dr. Sergio Puig, Counsel at ICSID, would serve as the Secretary to the Tribunal. He was subsequently succeeded in this capacity by Mrs. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, Counsel, ICSID.\n\n**c. Arbitral Procedure**\n-------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe First Session of the Tribunal with the Parties was held on March 22, 2010, at the World Bank\u2019s Paris Conference Centre, at which the Parties confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and that they did not have any objections in this respect.\n\n22.\n\nDuring the session, the Parties also agreed on a number of procedural matters, and that Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits would be filed by September 22, 2010. The Tribunal then proposed two schedules for the written and oral pleadings in this case.\n\n23.\n\nOn April 16, 2010, both Parties confirmed their agreement with the schedule proposed. Respondent, however, made a reservation to its agreement, noting that should the Tribunal decide to bifurcate, then a specific schedule for the proceedings on jurisdiction should be established.\n\n24.\n\nOn April 23, 2010, Respondent informed ICSID and the Tribunal of newspaper publications, in which it was reported that the alleged majority shareholder of some of the Claimants had transferred part of its ICSID claim to a U.S. investment fund in exchange for a contribution to pay the costs arising in the proceedings. Respondent requested that the Tribunal require Claimants to provide all available information regarding the matter and the content of the agreement that was signed with said investment fund, and to also submit all related documentation.\n\n25.\n\nOn May 28, 2010, Claimants filed their response stating that they had not sold their claim as alleged by Respondent. Claimants stressed that they had no obligation to disclose any agreements with third parties with respect to the funding of costs in this proceeding, and that Respondent did not argue the necessity or relevance of its request. Claimants further argued that due to Respondent\u2019s conduct (alleged nationalization) and refusal to pay any compensation, Claimants\u2019 group of companies were in a distressed financial state, and thus had no choice but to obtain external funding in order to afford the costs of the arbitration and pursue their claim against Respondent. Claimants lastly noted that in any instance, this financing did not affect the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n26.\n\nThe Parties were informed on June 16, 2010 that after careful consideration of their respective positions on the matter of obtaining third-party funding, the Tribunal had decided not to grant Respondent\u2019s request at this early stage as it did not consider the currently available information on record as sufficient. However, the Tribunal added that it did not preclude granting a similar request in the future once the main pleadings had been filed.\n\n27.\n\nOn September 21, 2010, the Tribunal granted an extension of the deadline for the filing of Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits until September 29, 2010, as agreed by the Parties, noting that Respondent would then have a one-week extension of the deadline for the filing of its subsequent submission.\n\n28.\n\nOn September 29, 2010, Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits.\n\n29.\n\nOn December 6, 2010, Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction, and Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction was subsequently filed on January 24, 2012.\n\n30.\n\nOn February 4, 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.l, ruling that Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections would be dealt with as a preliminary question, and that the proceeding on merits was accordingly suspended. The Tribunal also decided that a second round of pleadings on jurisdiction would be filed, with Respondent to file their Reply on Jurisdiction by March 7, 2011, and Claimants to file their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction within thirty (30) days of their receipt of Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction. Additionally, the Tribunal proposed two sets of dates for the hearing on jurisdiction.\n\n31.\n\nOn February 9, 2011, the Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on production of documents. Subsequently, Claimants filed observations on the Respondent\u2019s request on February 14, 2011, and Respondent filed a response on February 21, 2011.\n\n32.\n\nOn February 24, 2011, the Parties were invited to consult in regard to the schedule for the forthcoming hearing, and to submit an agreed proposal by April 25, 2011.\n\n33.\n\nOn February 28, 2011, Claimants filed a reply on Respondent\u2019s request for production of documents.\n\n34.\n\nOn March 1, 2011, the Parties were informed that the Tribunal, after careful and due deliberation, had decided not to grant Respondent\u2019s Request for the Production of Documents at this jurisdictional stage. It was added, however, that the Tribunal did not preclude a similar request at a later stage.\n\n35.\n\nOn March 10, 2011, Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction.\n\n36.\n\nOn April 12, 2011, Claimants filed a request for provisional measures, asserting that Respondent had initiated measures to collect taxes that would result in Respondent\u2019s effective acquisition of title to Claimants\u2019 Argentine holding company, Interinvest S.A. (\"Interinvest\"), and was thus requesting that the Tribunal order Respondent to halt any court or administrative collection proceedings against this company. Specifically, Claimants sought an interim order directing Respondent to withdraw or otherwise cease and desist from enforcing the tax-related payment orders that it had issued until the Tribunal rendered its award. They also requested that the Tribunal issue an immediate order preserving the *status quo ante* until such time as it ruled on this application for provisional measures. Claimants further requested that the Tribunal issue an emergency, temporary order prohibiting Respondent from enforcing the existing tax payment orders or from issuing any new ones.\n\n37.\n\nOn April 13, 2011, the Tribunal fixed a procedural calendar for the filing of the Parties\u2019 submissions on Claimants\u2019 request for the Tribunal to decide on provisional measures.\n\n38.\n\nOn April 20, 2011, Respondent submitted its observations on Claimants\u2019 request for an emergency, temporary order, stating that neither the ICSID Convention nor the Arbitration Rules made provision for the issuing of emergency, temporary orders, and that in any case, the absence of urgency was manifest in this instance. As such, Respondent requested that the Tribunal reject the request, and in addition reserved its rights and the State\u2019s power to levy taxes and to enforce such rights through such channels and in such courts, tribunals and otherwise as may be appropriate.\n\n39.\n\nOn April 26, 2011, Respondent requested an extension of the deadline that had been set out during the first session for the filing of new documents.\n\n40.\n\nAfter consulting with the Parties, on April 27, 2011, the Tribunal extended the deadline for the Parties to submit new documents; fixed a procedural calendar for the filing of the Parties\u2019 subsequent submissions on Claimants\u2019 requests for provisional measures; and invited the Parties to confer and to reach agreement on the structure, schedule and other matters regarding the hearing.\n\n41.\n\nAlso on April 27, 2011, Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n42.\n\nOn April 29, 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, denying Claimants\u2019 request for an emergency, temporary order, noting that the Parties would be able to fully present their arguments in such regard during the hearing on jurisdiction. The Parties were further invited to refrain from aggravating or extending the dispute.\n\n43.\n\nOn the same date, Claimants renewed their request for an emergency, temporary order, in light of the fact that Interinvest had been served with a notice for immediate payment of taxes. Respondent was invited to comment on Claimants\u2019 request by May 4, 2011.\n\n44.\n\nAlso on April 29, 2011, Respondent filed observations on Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures of April 12, 2011. Claimants filed a response on May 4, 2011.\n\n45.\n\nOn May 6, 2011, Claimants informed the Tribunal of the Parties\u2019 agreement concerning the organization of the hearing on jurisdiction, which was later confirmed by the Respondent. On the same date, Claimants filed their Reply on their Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n46.\n\nOn May 13, 2011, the Parties were informed that further to their exchanges on the matter of Claimants\u2019 request for an emergency temporary order of April 29, 2011, the Tribunal had determined that in view of the proximity of the hearing, there was no imminent or sufficiently imminent threat until the hearing, and as such Claimants\u2019 request was denied.\n\n47.\n\nAlso on May 13, 2011, Respondent filed a Rejoinder on Provisional Measures.\n\n48.\n\nOn May 27-31, 2011, the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction and Provisional Measures at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C.\n\n49.\n\nOn June 8, 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, posing questions to the Parties after the hearing.\n\n50.\n\nThe Parties filed their answers to the questions posed by the Tribunal in accordance with the procedural calendar that was set forth in Procedural Order No. 3, and on July 5, 2011, Claimants made a further submission to complement their answers.\n\n51.\n\nOn August 26, 2011, Ms. Annalise Nelson was appointed Assistant to the President of the Tribunal with the agreement of the Parties.\n\n52.\n\nOn August 30, 2011, Claimants filed a letter concerning the conclusion of the reorganization proceedings of Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. in Argentina and addressing recent case law, including the recent Decision on Admissibility and Jurisdiction in *Abaclat and others v. Argentina19,* and the Order Taking Note of the Discontinuance of the Annulment Proceeding in *A TA* v. *Jordan20*\n\n*Abaclat and others v.

Jordan\"\"),* Exhibit C-770.\n\n53.\n\nOn October 26, 2011, Respondent filed a letter in response to Claimants\u2019 letter of August 30, 2011, and adjoining the expert report of Mr. Juan Antonio Cabezudo Alvarez.\n\n54.\n\nOn November 8, 2011, Claimants filed a letter in response to Respondent\u2019s letter of October 26, 2011. In their letter, Claimants characterized portions of Respondent\u2019s letter as rearguing out-of-time its jurisdictional objection arising out of Claimants\u2019 alleged lack of *jus standi.* Claimants requested the Tribunal to strike Argentina\u2019s belated arguments and disregard the new expert report from Mr. Juan Antonio Cabezudo Alvarez. Claimants also noted recent case law, including the *Impregilo v. Argentina* award21 and the Decision on Jurisdiction in *Hochtief22*\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentine Repuhlic(\\CS\\D* Case No. ARB/07/17), Award, June 21, 2011 (hereinafter *\"\"Impregilo v. Argentina\"\"),* Exhibit C-772.\n\n*Hochtief AG v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31), Decision on Jurisdiction, October 24, 2011 (hereinafter *\"\"Hochtief v. Argentina\"\"),* Exhibit C-773.\n\n55.\n\nOn December 15, 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties, that it had taken note of the arguments made in Respondent\u2019s October 26, 2011 letter and Claimants\u2019 November 8, 2011 letter as they relate to the pleadings on jurisdiction, with the exception of the expert report of the Spanish attorney, Mr. Juan Antonio Cabezudo Alvarez, attached to Respondent\u2019s letter, and Respondent\u2019s arguments based thereon.\n\n56.\n\nAlso on December 15, 2011, Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to file certain dissenting opinions in recent case law. The Tribunal granted Respondent\u2019s request on December 20, 2011.\n\n57.\n\nOn December 22, 2011, Respondent filed a letter attaching the above-mentioned dissenting opinions, including those of (i) Professor Brigitte Stern in *Impregilo',* (ii) Mr. Chris Thomas in *Hochtief;* and (iii) Professor Georges Abi-Saab *in Abaclat.*\n\n58.\n\nOn February 17, 2012, Respondent filed a letter requesting leave from the Tribunal to introduce into the record the recently adopted decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in *Republic of Argentina v. BG Group pic* of January 17, 2012,23 and of the arbitral tribunal in the UNCITRAL case, *ICS v. Argentine Republic24*\n\n*Republic of Argentina v. BG Group pic,* United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, January 17, 2012 (hereinafter *\"Argentina v. BG\"),* Exhibit C-775.\n\n*ICS Inspection and Control Services Limited v. The Argentine Republic,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2010-9, Award on Jurisdiction, February 10, 2012 (hereinafter *\"ACS v. Argentina\"),* Exhibit C-774.\n\n59.\n\nOn February 22, 2012, the Tribunal accepted Respondent\u2019s letter of February 17, 2012, and provided Claimants with the opportunity to respond to this letter.\n\n60.\n\nOn February 28, 2012, Claimants filed a letter in response to Respondent\u2019s letter of February 17, 2012.\n\n61.\n\nOn March 26, 2012, Claimants filed a second request for provisional measures, alleging that Respondent had taken unlawful actions on March 14, 2012 that irreparably threaten to harm Claimants\u2019 investment and the rights Claimants seek to protect in this arbitration. Specifically, Claimants asserted that Respondent, acting through the Boards of Directors of the Argentine Airlines and their related service companies, which Respondent now controls, announced that they would submit Amended Financial Statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2008 for approval at upcoming Shareholders\u2019 Meetings. According to Claimants, the amended 2008 financial statements would also amend previously-approved and final financial statements for the fiscal years ending in 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007.25\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Application for Provisional Measures, March 26, 2012, \u00b6 4.\n\n62.\n\nIn their second request for provisional measures, Claimants sought an interim order directing Respondent to stop any procedures aimed at approving any formal or material changes to the financial statements of the Argentine Airlines for any year prior to 2008; to stop any procedures aimed at approving the 2008 Amended Financial Statements; to make available to Claimants\u2019 representatives in Interinvest, in their capacity as shareholders of the Argentine Airlines, all information available and subject to discussion and vote in any shareholders\u2019 meeting(s) to be scheduled in this respect; and to authorize Claimants\u2019 representatives in Interinvest to attend, participate and/or exercise their voting rights in any shareholders\u2019 meeting(s) to be scheduled in connection with the alleged \"adjustments\" to the Argentine Airlines financial statements, and in all cases free of any coercion, or physical or legal threat, until the Tribunal renders its Award.26 Claimants also requested that the Tribunal issue an emergency temporary order preserving the *status quo ante* with respect to the financial statements until such time as it ruled on this application for provisional measures.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 5.\n\n63.\n\nAlso on March 26, 2012, Respondent filed a letter, with attachments, informing the Tribunal of \"some new developments of a serious nature\" that had unfolded in criminal proceedings in Spain.\n\n64.\n\nOn March 28, 2012, the Tribunal fixed a procedural calendar for the filing of the Parties\u2019 submissions on Claimants\u2019 second request for the Tribunal to decide on provisional measures and for Claimants\u2019 response to Respondent\u2019s letter regarding the Spanish criminal proceedings.\n\n65.\n\nOn April 1, 2012, and following correspondence from the Parties, the Tribunal amended the procedural calendar for the filing of the Parties\u2019 submissions on Claimants\u2019 second request for provisional measures. The Tribunal directed the Parties to take no actions or steps to aggravate the dispute or to render Claimants\u2019 application moot pending the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of it.\n\n66.\n\nOn April 4, 2012, Claimants filed a response to Respondent\u2019s March 26, 2012 letter concerning the \"new developments\" in the Spanish criminal proceedings.\n\n67.\n\nOn April 11, 2012, Respondent filed observations on Claimants\u2019 second request for provisional measures.\n\n68.\n\nOn April 23, 2012, Claimants filed observations in reply to their second request for provisional measures.\n\n69.\n\nOn May 4, 2012, Respondent filed observations in rejoinder on Claimants\u2019 second request for provisional measures.\n\n70.\n\nOn May 24, 2012, Respondent filed further observations concerning Claimants\u2019 second request for provisional measures and Respondent's fourth objection on jurisdiction. On May 25, 2012, the Tribunal invited Claimants to file a response to Respondent's submission by June 1, 2012. On June 1, 2012, Claimants filed a response to Respondent\u2019s submission of May 24, 2012\n\n71.\n\nOn September 28, 2012, Respondent directed the Tribunal\u2019s attention to (i) the award rendered on August 22, 2012 in *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1); (ii) the decision rendered by a Swedish court on November 9, 2012 concerning the award rendered on October 1, 2007 in the case *RoslnvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation,* SCC Case No. V079/2005; and (iii) to a recent submission before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the case of *Thai-Lao Lignite (Thailand) Co., Ltd & Hongsa Lignite (Lao PDR) Co., Ltd v. Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.* By letter of October 9, 2012, Claimants, upon invitation from the Tribunal, provided their comments on Respondent\u2019s submission of September 28, 2012.\n\n**III. Position of the Parties on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Respondent\u2019s position**\n----------------------------\n\n72.\n\nIn its written and oral submissions on jurisdiction, Respondent argues the following:\n\ni. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimants failed to meet the requirements set forth in Article X of the Treaty;\n\nii. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimants have no legal standing to claim for legal rights that belong to another legal person;\n\niii. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate certain of Claimants\u2019 allegations that concern the acts of non-state entities, which cannot be attributed to Respondent; and\n\niv. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the investment invoked by Claimants is not an investment protected by the Treaty.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to declare, pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, that the Centre has no jurisdiction and that the Tribunal has no competence over this case and, therefore, to dismiss the claim, ordering costs and fees against Claimants, plus interest, pursuant to Rule 47(1)(j) of the Arbitration Rules.27\n\nRep. \u00b6 388.\n\n**b. Claimants\u2019 position**\n--------------------------\n\n73.\n\nIn their written and oral submissions on jurisdiction, Claimants argue the following:\n\ni. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 claims because Claimants have satisfied the procedural provisions of the Australia-Argentina BIT, which they may rely on through the application of the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause;\n\nii. The Tribunal has jurisdiction, in the alternative, because Claimants have satisfied and/or are excused for reasons of futility from the requirements set forth in Article X of the Treaty;\n\niii. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 claims because Claimants are legitimate parties to this arbitration;\n\niv. The Tribunal should defer questions of state attribution for acts of non-state entities to the merits phase of this arbitration or, in the alternative, determine that the acts alleged are attributable to Respondent; and\n\nv. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 claims because Claimants\u2019 investment was acquired and effected in accordance with the legislation of Argentina and in good faith.\n\nClaimants request the following relief: i) a declaration that the dispute is within the jurisdiction of the ICSID Convention and within the competence of this Tribunal; ii) an order dismissing all of Respondent\u2019s objections to the admissibility of the dispute and dismissing all of Respondent\u2019s objections to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal; and iii) an order that Argentina pay the costs for these proceedings,28 including the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses, and the costs of Claimants\u2019 representation, subject to interest until the day of payment.29\n\nThe Tribunal understands Claimants\u2019 submission in paragraph 385(iii) as seeking the costs in respect of deciding on the objections to its jurisdiction.\n\nRej. \u00b6385.\n\n**IV. Analysis**\n----------------\n\n**a. First Jurisdictional Objection: Claimants\u2019 Fulfillment of the Procedural Requirements of Article X of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nRespondent\u2019s first jurisdictional objection to this dispute is rooted in Article X of the Treaty, which provides that\n\n1. Disputes arising between a Party and an investor of the other Party in connection with investments within the meaning of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If a dispute within the meaning of section 1 cannot be settled within six months as from the date on which one of the parties to the dispute raised it, it shall be submitted, at the request of either party, to the competent tribunals of the Party in whose territory the investment was made.\n\n3. The dispute may be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal in any of the following circumstances:\n\n*(a)* At the request of one of the parties to the dispute, when no decision has been reached on the merits after a period of 18 months has elapsed as from the moment the judicial proceeding provided for in section 2 of this article was initiated or\n\nWhen such a decision has been reached, but the dispute between the parties persists;\n\n*(b)* When both parties to the dispute have so agreed.\n\n75.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants have failed to meet the requirements of Article X. Specifically, Respondent alleges that Claimants have not attempted to amicably settle their dispute in accordance with Article X(l) and (2) of the Treaty. Respondent also alleges that Claimants have not subjected their dispute to the Argentine courts for a period of eighteen months before seeking this arbitration, in accordance with Article X(3).\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimants have made two responses to this objection. First, Claimants assert that they are entitled to invoke the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause in Article IV(2) in order to benefit from the more favorable dispute settlement provisions of other BITs negotiated by Argentina. Second, Claimants assert that even if the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause does not permit them to borrow the dispute settlement provisions from other Argentine BITs, they have satisfied the requirements of Article X of the Treaty, or, in the alternative, that they should be excused from Article X\u2019s requirements for reasons of futility.\n\n77.\n\nAs the Parties\u2019 submissions concern two distinct arguments in the alternative, the Tribunal will address each of them in turn. The Tribunal will first address the issue of Claimants\u2019 compliance with the requirements of Article X of the Treaty. The Tribunal will then assess, on an alternative basis, the issue of the applicability of the MFN clause to Article X of the Treaty.\n\n**i. Compliance with the Requirements of Article X**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Position of Respondent**\n-----------------------------\n\n***6-month requirement***\n-------------------------\n\n78.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants resorted to the jurisdiction of ICSID without first conducting amicable negotiations for at least six months with the Argentine Republic, even though the fulfillment of this requirement is one of the conditions upon which Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration is based.30\n\nMem. \u00b610.\n\n79.\n\nUnder Article X(l) and (2) of the Treaty, disputes \"shall, if possible, be amicably settled\" within a term of six months.31 Article X(2) provides that the 6-month negotiation period must be counted from the date of submission of such dispute by either party.32 According to Respondent, the period starts to run once a party claims that there is disagreement about the facts and rights related to the Treaty, not when the Treaty is breached.33\n\nMem. T12.\n\nRep. \u00b6 34.\n\nRep. \u00b6 36.\n\n80.\n\nRespondent asserts, moreover, that investors must give formal notice of the dispute to Respondent\u2019s competent authorities, in order for the government to be aware of the dispute.34 This notice should describe the nature of the dispute and express the intent to commence amicable negotiations for the purpose of resolving the conflict within the framework of the Treaty.35\n\nRep. \u00b6 32.\n\n*Id.*\n\n81.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants failed to give notice to the Argentine authorities of the formal commencement of amicable negotiations and that these negotiations never actually took place.36 It was only on November 20, 2008 that Claimants notified Respondent of the filing of their claim under the Treaty, when they sent a letter informing Respondent that Claimants had decided to submit an investment dispute under the Treaty.37\n\nMem. \u00b615.\n\nMem. \u00b613.\n\n82.\n\nRespondent further submits that none of the documents submitted by Claimants as proof of negotiations mention the rights provided for in the Treaty, international arbitration proceedings, or even the Treaty\u2019s requirement to hold amicable negotiations for a term of six months.38 Although Claimants reference meetings with Argentine officials, nothing demonstrates that those discussions were held within the context of Article X(l). To the contrary, those meetings concerned the local legal framework applicable to Argentina\u2019s commercial air transportation industry.39\n\nMem. \u00b624.\n\nMem. \u00b6 21.\n\n83.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimants have submitted purported evidence, including newspaper articles and statements by Argentine senators and congressmen, that Respondent was aware that Claimants would resort to ICSID proceedings, but Respondent argues that this evidence is irrelevant.40 Respondent\u2019s objection is based on Claimants\u2019 failure to meet the 6-month amicable settlement requirement.41 Claimants\u2019 obligation under Article X(l) and (2) is not fulfilled by media discussions regarding the possibility of resorting to ICSID in the event that negotiations are unsuccessful.42 Likewise, the statements made by Respondent\u2019s congressmen and senators regarding Claimants\u2019 possible resort to ICSID do not constitute negotiations; such statements are speculative and do not express the will of the National Congress or the Respondent.43\n\nRep. 44, 45.\n\nRep. \u00b6 45.\n\nRep. \u00b6 47.\n\nRep. \u00b6\u00b6 48, 49.\n\n***18-month local court requirement***\n--------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the language of Article X(2) and (3) of the Treaty requires that disputes must first be submitted to the domestic courts of competent jurisdiction before they can be submitted to international arbitration44 This language is mandatory, and the prior submission of disputes to the local courts is a jurisdictional requirement which may not be set aside or disregarded.45\n\nRep. \u00b6 9.\n\nRep. \u00b6 17.\n\n85.\n\nRespondent disputes Claimants\u2019 assertion that they have met this requirement, based on an expropriation suit that was filed by the Argentine Republic against Interinvest in the Argentine courts. According to Respondent, the expropriation lawsuit under Argentine law and the present arbitration are clearly different, as they do not involve the same parties or subject matter46 The purpose of the expropriation lawsuit is for the domestic court to determine the value of the property expropriated by Argentina, while the subject of the arbitration is not only expropriation but also allegations of unfair treatment, arbitrary measures, and failure to grant full protection and security, which are all governed by the Treaty.47\n\nRep. \u00b6 71.\n\nRep. \u00b6 72.\n\n86.\n\nRespondent further argues that the Request for Arbitration filed with ICSID should have been submitted only *after* the dispute had been submitted to the local courts for 18 months. However, the expropriation suit commenced on February 5, 2009, while the Request for Arbitration was filed by Claimants earlier, on December 11, 2008.48\n\nRep. \u00b6 69.\n\n87.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that Claimants\u2019 assertion that they have satisfied the 18-month court requirement contradicts their invocation, through the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause, of the Argentina-U.S. or Argentina-Australia BITs. Both of the latter BITs establish that disputes may only be submitted to international arbitration if they have ***not*** been submitted to the local courts.49***Futility***\n\nRep. \u00b6 73.\n\n88.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants are not entitled to an excuse from the requirements of Article X by reason of futility. Argentine law guarantees the judicial protection of the rights at issue, and Claimants did not encounter any obstacles in the filing of judicial claims. The Argentine courts routinely adopt final and provisional decisions in less than eighteen months, in both ordinary and expedited summary proceedings.50 Moreover, there is no basis for Claimants to assert that they would be required to incur disproportionate court costs in pursuing a remedy before the Argentine courts, and there is no basis on which to conclude that the Argentine courts lack independence.51\n\nRep. \u00b6 75.\n\nRep. \u00b6\u00b676-84.\n\n**2. Position of Claimants**\n----------------------------\n\n***6-month requirement***\n-------------------------\n\n89.\n\nClaimants assert that they have complied with the 6-month period in the Treaty, as they submitted their request for arbitration well after six months had elapsed from the time Argentina \"instigated\" the dispute.52 By December 11, 2008, the Parties had gone through more than a year of intense negotiations and no fewer than three attempted settlement agreements.53\n\nCM \u00b6 22(ii).\n\nRej. \u00b6 11.\n\n90.\n\nClaimants assert that Article X requires neither a formal notice nor express allegations of Treaty breaches. The first part of Article X(l) of the Treaty broadly defines the term \"disputes\" as \"[disputes arising between a Party and an investor of the other Party in connection with investments within the meaning of this Agreement.\" This broad definition of disputes does not refer to the legal basis of such disputes nor does it require that any settlement negotiations be formally held under the Treaty or address or allege breaches of specific Treaty provisions. It requires only that the dispute be related to an investment.54\n\nCM \u00b6 76.\n\n91.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Article X(l) provides a \"best-efforts\" clause to attempt to settle the dispute, and Article X(2) provides a \"cooling-off\u2019 period whereby either party can proceed to the next stage as soon as six months have passed since the instigation or initiation of the dispute itself.55 The sole condition for proceeding from amicable settlement attempts to the next step is that the dispute \"cannot be settled within six months from the date on which one of the parties to the dispute instigated it.\"56\n\nRej \u00b6\u00b6 5, 70-71.\n\nCM \u00b6 82.\n\n92.\n\nClaimants assert that the Treaty\u2019s 6-month cooling off period starts to run as of the date on which one of the parties to the dispute \"instigated\" *('promovi\u00f3')* the dispute.57 This \"instigation\" of a dispute refers to the act or omission actually triggering the dispute. Thus, the 6-month period starts to run not when a formal breach of the treaty is alleged, raised or communicated, but rather when the disputed conduct occurs.58\n\n*Id.*\n\nCM \u00b6 87.\n\n93.\n\nClaimants note that while other treaties to which one of the Parties is a signatory may explicitly require a notification of the dispute under the BIT before the 6-month period can began to run, no such requirement is included in Article X of the Treaty.59 Furthermore, under Article X, there is no requirement that a claimant raise formal or explicit allegations of the Treaty breach.60 Considering that the dispute is to be submitted first to local tribunals and only thereafter to international arbitration, Article X cannot reasonably be construed to require that formal *treaty* allegations be made for the \"dispute\" to exist.61 Furthermore, international jurisprudence holds that it is not necessary for a State to expressly refer to a specific treaty in its exchanges with the other State\u2014what matters is that the exchanges \"refer to the subject-matter of the treaty.\"62\n\nCM \u00b6 96.\n\nRej. \u00b697.\n\nRej \u00b6\u00b697, 113.\n\nRej.\u00b61(132.\n\n94.\n\nClaimants assert that, as a matter of fact, Respondent \"instigated\" this dispute as early as October 2002, after it failed to implement promised relief measures for the Argentine Airlines.63 Alternatively, Claimants assert that the \"dispute\" began in October 2004, when Respondent rejected Claimants\u2019 request for an airfare increase.64 The dispute intensified in 2005 and 2006, and, after lengthy negotiations, Respondent again promised relief measures. However, by approving an insufficient airfare increase and failing to provide promised subsidies, Respondent again breached its agreement with Claimants.65\n\nCM \u00b6 **too.**\n\nRej. \u00b616.\n\n*Id.*\n\n95.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the dispute continued in April 2008, when Claimants requested Respondent to take urgent action to correct governmental measures impacting its operations, including the approval of airfare increases or subsidies.66 In May 2008, Respondent, Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines concluded an agreement to change the Airlines\u2019 corporate structure, increasing Respondent\u2019s interest and granting a controlling interest to a prospective private Argentine investor. As part of this agreement, Respondent agreed to raise domestic fares and grant relief measures. However, Respondent failed to do so, and the deal with the prospective investor ultimately fell through.67\n\nRej. \u00b6 17.\n\nCM \u00b6 106; Rej. \u00b6 17.\n\n96.\n\nOn July 17, 2008, the Parties reached an agreement regarding the sale of the Argentine Airlines to Respondent. Under the agreement, the Parties agreed that the purchase price would be determined by independent appraisers appointed by each Party and that, if there were still a disagreement on the price, the Parties would appoint a third independent appraiser.68 According to Claimants, however, Respondent continued the dispute on July 24, 2008, when it submitted a bill to Congress for the \"repossession\" of the Argentine Airlines. In doing so, Claimants allege, Respondent breached the July 17, 2008 Agreement.69 On September 18, 2008, the Argentine Congress passed a law approving Respondent\u2019s repossession of the Argentine Airlines. However, Congress determined that the amount of compensation would be calculated exclusively by the Argentine *Tribunal de Tasaciones de la Naci\u00f3n,* in disregard of the third-party valuation mechanism set out in the July 2008 Agreement, thus further entrenching the dispute.70\n\nCM \u00b6 111.\n\nCM \u00b6112.\n\nCM \u00b6123.\n\n97.\n\nFinally, Claimants assert that even if this Tribunal required the \"dispute\" between the Parties to concern the Treaty, Claimants have met this requirement. Respondent was aware that, if the ongoing negotiations failed, Claimants could submit an ICSID complaint. The dispute between Claimants and Respondent was a national event and was extensively discussed in the Argentine press starting in early 2008.71 During a Congressional debate in August 2008, various congressmen acknowledged that Claimants were preparing their ICSID arbitration under the Treaty. Moreover, during a September 1, 2008 Congressional hearing, Claimants\u2019 representatives confirmed they would resort to international arbitration if Respondent failed to pay fair compensation.72\n\nCM \u00b6 135.\n\nCM \u00b6 136.\n\n98.\n\nTherefore, according to Claimants, even if a \"dispute\" did not exist between the Parties between 2002 and 2007, the evidence demonstrates that the current dispute in connection with Claimants\u2019 investments had been instigated, raised and formally discussed by May 2008. The evidence also demonstrates that the Parties had attempted to solve this dispute amicably through several negotiations that lasted more than six months, including the negotiations that surrounded the May 15, 2008 Agreement and the July 17, 2008 Agreement.73\n\nCM \u00b6 127.\n\n***18-month local court requirement***\n--------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the 18-month local court requirement of Article X(3) has been satisfied, because Argentine tribunals have had the opportunity to undo the measures giving rise to this dispute for more than eighteen months, and yet have failed to do so74 Claimants cite to multiple actions brought before the Argentine courts. First, the *Tribunal de Tasaciones,* in two different valuations, in October 2008 and in January 2009, found that the Argentine Airlines were worth approximately negative US$832 million and negative US$770 million.75 Second, following Interinvest\u2019s rejection of the January 2009 valuation, Respondent initiated a lawsuit in an Argentine court seeking the expropriation of the shares of the Argentine Airlines. That court has not yet issued a substantive decision in the case76\n\nCM \u00b6 22(iii).\n\nCM \u00b6 140.\n\n*Id.*\n\n100.\n\nClaimants acknowledge that both the *Tribunal de Tasaciones\u2019* valuation and the expropriation lawsuit initiated by the GOA are based exclusively on Argentine law. However, these suits relate to the same subject matter now before this Tribunal: the question of compensation for Respondent\u2019s take-over of Claimants\u2019 investments.77\n\nCM \u00b6 139.\n\n101.\n\nClaimants also acknowledge that the 18-month period had not lapsed when they requested arbitration on December 11, 2008. However, at present, Respondent\u2019s expropriation lawsuit has been before Argentine tribunals for well over 18 months without resulting in any substantive decision78 Claimants assert, as a result, that (i) Argentine courts have had more than 18 months to decide the main issues in this dispute and that (ii) the core purpose of the local court requirement\u2014to give the host State the opportunity to consider and/or remedy the disputed measures before they are brought to international arbitration\u2014has been satisfied.79 International jurisprudence supports the position that under these circumstances, such preconditions have been met.80\n\nRej. \u00b6 161.\n\n*Id.*\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 162-165.\n\n102.\n\nFinally, Claimants assert that their satisfaction of the 18-month local court requirement of Article X(3) does not contradict the dispute settlement provisions of the U.S.-Argentina BIT.81 The U.S.-Argentina \"fork in the road\" clause requires the investor to choose either a local court remedy or international arbitration. However, here, it was Respondent, and not Claimants, who initiated the local expropriation suit.82 According to Claimants, this position is fully in accordance with Article X(2) of the Treaty, which makes clear that the proceedings before local tribunals may be submitted \"at the request of either party.\"83\n\nRej. \u00b6 171.\n\nCM \u00b6 143.\n\n*Id.*\n\n***Futility***\n--------------\n\n103.\n\nClaimants submit that even if this Tribunal were to determine that the requirements of Article X have not been met, it would be futile to require Claimants to make further attempts at amicable settlement or to require Claimants to resubmit the dispute to the Argentine courts for an additional 18 months.84\n\nCM \u00b6 22(iv).\n\n104.\n\nAccording to Claimants, they have attempted to amicably settle the present dispute on several occasions from September 2002 onwards, and with even greater focus as of May 2008.85 In addition to these negotiations, Claimants have also held additional negotiations with Argentina, from October 2008 until early 2010, specifically concerning the compensation due to Claimants for the expropriation of their investment.86\n\nCM \u00b6 158.\n\nCM \u00b6 159.\n\n105.\n\nClaimants also argue that requiring them to resubmit the dispute once they have satisfied the 18-month local court requirement would serve no purpose whatsoever and would only add cost and time to the proceedings.87 Furthermore, the fact that the core matter of the dispute has already been pending for more than 18 months demonstrates that it would be futile to now require Claimants to litigate for an additional 18 months.88 Jurisprudence supports the view that when a requirement to resort to local courts would be futile, ineffective and/or would not provide the claimant with appropriate means of legal redress, that requirement should be waived.89\n\nCM \u00b6 22(iv).\n\nRej. \u00b6 182.\n\nRej. \u00b6 192.\n\n106.\n\nClaimants argue that in any event, the failure to comply with the 6- and 18-month waiting periods is not a bar to jurisdiction. According to Claimants, the majority of ICSID tribunals addressing this issue have found that such waiting periods constitute procedural, rather than jurisdictional, requirements.90\n\nCM \u00b6 168.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n**(a) The Requirements of X(l) and X(2)**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nArticle X(l) and (2) reads as follows:\n\n1. Disputes arising between a Party and an investor of the other Party in connection with investments within the meaning of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If a dispute within the meaning of section 1 cannot be settled within six months as from the date on which one of the parties to the dispute raised it, it shall be submitted, at the request of either party, to the competent tribunals of the Party in whose territory the investment was made. *[Si una controversia en el sentido del p\u00e1rrafo 1 no pudiera ser dirimida dentro del plazo de seis meses, contando desde la fecha en que una de las partes en la controversia la haya promovido, ser\u00e1 sometida a petici\u00f3n de una de ellas a los tribunales competentes de la Parte en cuyo territorio se realiz\u00f3 la inversi\u00f3n.]*\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants that Article X(l) can fairly be interpreted as a general \"best efforts\" obligation for the parties to attempt to amicably settle their dispute. However, it would be an overly literal interpretation of Article X(2)\u2019s \"cannot be settled within six months\" language to read it as simply requiring that the Parties *wait* for six months after the dispute began before they proceed to the next step in the dispute settlement process. The natural reading of Articles X(l) and (2) together is that the Parties are obligated to make their best efforts to amicably settle their dispute, and that they are required to do so for six months before proceeding to the next step.\n\n**i. The Commencement of the 6-Month Period**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nClaimants assert that the relevant moment for Article X(2) is the date on which Respondent\u2019s substantive *conduct* that is in dispute takes place.91 In other words, the key inquiry is when the act or omission that triggered the dispute occurred. To reach this conclusion, Claimants point to the use of the word *\"promover\"* in the Spanish language original of Article X(2), the relevant portion of which reads *\"\"contando desde la fecha en que una de las partes en la controversia la haya promovido\"* They translate *\"promover\"* as \"initiate,\" \"provoke,\" \"give rise to,\" \"cause,\" and \"instigate.\"92 From this, Claimants conclude that *\"promover una controversia\"* refers to the \"substantive conduct, acts or omissions\" committed by Respondent that are at the origin of this dispute.93 Claimants note that *\"promover\"* is different from the verbs used in the dispute resolution preconditions of other BITs, which instead require the parties to *\"someter\"* a dispute or define the date that a dispute *\"surgid.\"94*\n\nCM **\u00b6** 87.\n\nCM **\u00b6** 84.\n\nCM \u00b6\u00b6 85, 86.\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 129-30.\n\n110.\n\nClaimants\u2019 interpretation does not ascribe a natural or ordinary meaning to the phrase *\"promover una controversia\"* or \"instigate a dispute.\" Claimants\u2019 argument focuses almost exclusively on the word *\"promover,\"* while largely ignoring the meaning or importance of the word \"dispute.\" While \"instigate\" or \"initiate\" or \"provoke\" all suggest the commencement of something, that something in question is the dispute itself, not the acts giving rise to the dispute. Both \"dispute\" and *\"controversia\"* are synonyms for \"argument\" or \"disagreement.\" As stated by the PCIJ in *Mavrommatis,* \"[a] dispute is a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons.\"95 To instigate a dispute, therefore, refers to the time at which the *disagreement* was formed, which can only occur once there has been at least some exchange of views by the parties. It does not refer to the commission of the act that caused the parties to disagree, for the very simple reason a breach or violation does not become a \"dispute\" until the injured party identifies the breach or violation and objects to it.\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.1J., Series A, No.* 2. p. 11. (hereinafter *\"\"Mavrommatis \").*\n\n111.\n\nClaimants assert that their interpretation is not unprecedented and that other investment treaties have similar provisions. However, the only provision Claimants have identified is NAFTA Article 1120, which has starkly different language from Article X(2).96 NAFTA Article 1120 includes the clause \"provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to a Claim.\" But Article X(2) makes no mention of \"the events giving rise to the claim,\" and it would be a stretch to read such a phrase into the plain meaning of\" *promover una controversia\"* Furthermore, to the extent that the purpose of the 6-month requirement is to grant the host state the opportunity to redress the problem before the investor submits the dispute to arbitration, measuring from the date that the breach occurred would not further this policy goal.97 Without some exchange of views, Respondent could have no idea that an investor believed it to be in breach.\n\nRej. \u00b6124.\n\n*See, e.g., Ronald S.* *Lauder v. The Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL Case), Award of September 3, 2001, \u00b6 185 (hereinafter *\"\"Lauder v. Czech Republic\"\"),* Exhibit C-329 (\"[T]he waiting period does not run from the date [on] which the alleged breach occurred, but from the date [on] which the State is advised that said breach has occurred. This results from the purpose of the waiting period, which is to allow the parties to enter into good-faith negotiations before initiating the arbitration.\").\n\n**ii. The Requirement of Formal Notification**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of Article X(l) supports Claimants\u2019 argument that they were not required to give formal notice in order to commence settlement negotiations. Article X(l) simply defines \"disputes\" as \"arising between a Party and an investor of the other Party in connection with investments within the meaning of this Agreement.\" There is nothing in this language that suggests that Claimants must formally notify Respondent that there is a dispute under the Treaty or identify the specific provisions of the Treaty that are the basis of the dispute. All that is required for a dispute to exist under Article X(l) is that it be \"in connection with investments.\" In this regard, Claimants\u2019 citation of *Vivendi I* is on point.98*Vivendi I* concerned the France-Argentina BIT, which contained an article with a similar definition of disputes as \"relating to investments made under this Agreement.\" The tribunal concluded that this article \"does not use a narrower formulation, requiring that the investor\u2019s claim allege a breach of the BIT itself. Read literally, the requirements for arbitral jurisdiction in Article 8 do not necessitate that the Claimant allege a breach of the BIT itself: it is sufficient that the dispute relate to an investment made under the BIT.\"99\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002 (hereinafter *\"Vivendi I v. Argentina\"),* Exhibit C-403.\n\n*Vivendi I v. Argentina,* Decision on Annulment, at \u00b6 55.\n\n113.\n\nClaimants correctly point out that other BITs expressly define \"dispute\" with reference to the dispute\u2019s legal basis under those BITs. For example, the U.S.-Ecuador BIT describes disputes as follows:\n\nFor purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to: (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.100\n\nRej. \u00b6 105, citing Article VI(1) of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT.\n\n114.\n\nThe U.S.-Ecuador BIT was addressed by the tribunals in *Murphy101* and *Burlington,*102 which determined that a dispute does not exist, and settlement of this dispute cannot be attempted, until it has been articulated in terms of a treaty breach. Specifically, the tribunal in *Murphy* held that the claimants were required to inform the respondent of their intention to hold talks for purposes of settling their claim under the BIT.103 However, both *Murphy* and *Burlington* are distinguishable based on the language of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT, and both tribunals make clear that their determination is predicated on the treaty\u2019s definition of \"dispute.\"104\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v Republic of Ecuador,* Decision on Jurisdiction, (ICSID Case No ARB/08/4), December. 15, 2010, at \u00b6 104 (hereinafter *\"Murphy v. Ecuador\"),* Exhibit C-417.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5), Decision on Jurisdiction, June 2, 2010, at \u00b6 337 (hereinafter *\"Burlington v. Ecuador*) LA AR 6.\n\n*See* *Murphy v. Ecuador,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6\u00b6 107-109.\n\n*See* *Burlington v. Ecuador,* Decision on Jurisdiction at \u00b6\u00b6 335-337 (\"[T]he \"dispute\" to which Article VI(3)(a) refers is one that relates to \"an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\" Stated otherwise, as long as no allegation of Treaty breach is made, no dispute will have arisen giving access to arbitration under Article VI.\"); *see also* *Murphy v. Ecuador,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 103.\n\n115.\n\nInternational jurisprudence also supports the general proposition that there is no requirement that a party formally notify the other party that negotiations are occurring under a particular treaty, in order for negotiations to be occurring with respect to a dispute. As the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") has stated:\n\n[I]t does not necessarily follow that, because a State has not expressly referred in negotiations with another State to a particular treaty as having been violated by conduct of that other State, it is debarred from invoking a compromissory clause in that treaty. The United States was well aware that Nicaragua alleged that its conduct was a breach of international obligations before the present case was instituted; and it is now aware that specific articles of the 1956 Treaty are alleged to have been violated. It would make no sense to require Nicaragua now to institute fresh proceedings based on the Treaty, which it would be fully entitled to do.105\n\n*Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States of America),* Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports November 26, 1984, \u00b6 83 (hereinafter *\"\"Nicaragua v. U.S.A.\"),* Exhibit C-406. *See also* *Case Concerning Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Georgia v. Russian Federation),* Preliminary Objections, Judgment, April 1, 2011,\u00b6 30, Exhibit C-554, (hereinafter *\"Georgia v. Russian Federation\").*\n\n116.\n\nBecause Article X and international jurisprudence are clear that, under these circumstances, Claimants were not obligated to initiate formal negotiations under the Treaty or to notify Respondent of their possible resort to ICSID arbitration under the Treaty, the Parties\u2019 voluminous materials regarding discussions in the Argentine media and within the Argentine Senate regarding the possibility of recourse to ICSID arbitration are not relevant.\n\n**iii. Determining When the Dispute Began**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nConsidering that a formal notification of the existence of the dispute or the start of the negotiation period was not required, the issue for the Tribunal is to identify when the \"dispute\" can be considered to have begun. Considering that the Request for Arbitration was brought on December 11, 2008, the critical date is therefore June 11, 2008, six months earlier.\n\n118.\n\nIt is clear from the voluminous briefing on this subject that the two sides have had differing views on the regulation and control of the Argentine Airlines for years, and that the Parties have had numerous communications and exchanges, that have included the highest levels of the Argentine government.106 However, the disagreements during this period have been dynamic, and Claimants\u2019 arguments reflect this. Claimants have identified two \"core issues\" to their dispute: 1) a disagreement over the regulatory framework that was applied to Claimants (regarding the airfare caps imposed upon the Argentine Airlines) and 2) a disagreement over the compensation owed to Claimants for the expropriation of their investment (through Respondent\u2019s direct expropriation of Interinvest\u2019s shares).107 The first issue, an alleged \"creeping expropriation\" of the *Argentine Airlines,* purportedly began in 2004.108 The second issue, the alleged direct expropriation of *Interinvest\u2019s* shares in the Argentine Airlines, began much later.\n\n*See, e.g.,* CM \u00b6 103.\n\nCM \u00b6 99.\n\nRej. \u00b6 91.\n\n119.\n\nInternational courts and tribunals agree that for a dispute to exist, it must have crystallized into an actual disagreement. As the ICJ held in *Mavrommatis,* \"A dispute is a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons.\"109 It must be shown that \"the claim of one party is positively opposed by the other.\"110 As the *Maffezini* tribunal recognized, the dispute \"must relate to clearly identified issues between the parties and must not be merely academic...The dispute must go beyond general grievances and must be susceptible of being stated in terms of a concrete claim.\"111 A diplomatic request by an investor to a host State for further assistance does not, on its own, necessarily express disagreement on the parties\u2019 rights and obligations.112 Instead, only when a request \"manifest[s] a disagreement over the rights and obligations\" can it be considered a dispute.113\n\n*Mavrommatis, Judgment No. 2,* p. 11.\n\n*South West Africa (Ethiopia v. South Africa; Liberia v. South Africa),* Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 328; *Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (New Application: 2002) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda),* Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2006, p. 40, para. 90.\n\n*Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Decision on Jurisdiction, January 25, 2000 (hereinafter *\"Maffezini v. Spain\"),* at \u00b6 94 (internal citations omitted).\n\n*See* *Burlington v. Ecuador,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 298 (\"While Claimant\u2019s expectation is conceivably a diplomatic request for further assistance in connection with the indigenous opposition in the Block, this request for assistance does not express disagreement with the manner in which the Respondent has fulfilled its obligation to provide protection and security in the Block. In and of itself, a request for assistance does not express disagreement on the parties\u2019 rights and obligations are, unless the surrounding context suggests otherwise, *i.e.* that the party whose assistance is requested has thus far failed to abide by its duty to assist.\").\n\n*See id.* at \u00b6 320 (\"In the view of the Tribunal, the 4 December 2002 letter is sufficient to raise a \"dispute\" within the meaning of Article VI(3) of the Treaty. While the main purpose of the letter is to request assistance from PetroEcuador with the episodes of violence and the opposition met in the Block, the tone and the context of the letter do manifest a disagreement over rights and obligations.\")\n\n120.\n\nIt is clear that a disagreement between the Parties regarding the *regulatory treatment* of the Argentine Airlines had developed long before the June 11, 2008 critical date, and that the Parties had conducted substantial negotiations regarding this disagreement. Claimants assert that a dispute has existed in this case since late 2004, when the Respondent rejected the Argentine Airlines\u2019 request for an increase in airfare caps.114 This dispute allegedly escalated in 2006 when, despite prior promises to increase the airfare caps, Respondent now conditioned this and other measures on Claimants\u2019 transfer of a percentage of their shares in ARSA.115 It is true that many of the discussions between the Parties took the form of a *request* from Claimants for various promised regulatory changes. However, a 2004 letter from the Argentine Airlines to Respondent makes clear their position that Respondent has failed to properly apply its regulations.116 This demonstrates that Claimants plainly disagree with Respondent over the application of Argentine laws and regulations to them.\n\nCM \u00b6 101.\n\nCM \u00b6 102.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Merits \u00b6 124, citing an October 4, 2004 letter from the Argentine Airlines to the Argentine Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Ricardo Jaime, in which they request an increase in the airfare caps. In this letter, the Argentine Airlines assert that the current airfare caps imposed on them are \"completely out of step with the cost increases brought about by the fuel price increase, thereby distorting the remunerative rate concept established in Law No. 19,030, the Law on Commercial Aviation Policy.\" *See* Ex. C-71.\n\n121.\n\nIt is less clear that a disagreement between the Parties regarding the *expropriation* of Interinvest\u2019s shares existed before June 11, 2008. While Claimants assert that they disagreed with Respondent over the fair valuation of their investment by April 2008,117 the evidence on this is not so clear. At that point, Respondent\u2019s first attempt to find a buyer for the Argentine Airlines had failed, because Claimants had rejected the potential buyer\u2019s purchase offer.118 However, it seems difficult to characterize Claimants\u2019 rejection of a *third party\u2019s* purchase offer as a *legal* dispute with Respondent, rather than simply a failed business transaction. The Parties subsequently executed an agreement providing for Respondent to buy the shares of the Argentine Airlines on July 17, 2008. While Claimants argue that the negotiating environment of this agreement was hostile and threatening,119 it is conceptually difficult to view an executed *agreement* as constituting a legal *dispute120*\n\nRej. \u00b6 91\n\nCM \u00b6 104.\n\nCM \u00b6 107.\n\nLater, on September 18, 2008, Congress passed a law approving Respondent\u2019s repossession of the Argentine Airlines, and authorized compensation to be calculated by the *Tribunal de Tasaciones de la Naci\u00f3n,* in disregard of the third-party valuation mechanism of the July 2008 agreement. CM \u00b6 123. Following a disagreement between the *Tribunal de Tasaciones* and Credit Suisse, Claimants\u2019 valuator, as to the value of the Argentine Airlines, Congress passed a law on December 22, 2008 authorizing the expropriation of the Argentine Airlines\u2019 shares that belonged to Interinvest. Merits \u00b6 276.\n\n122.\n\nThe issue, therefore, is whether it is enough for purposes of Article X(2) that by June 11, 2008, a disagreement existed concerning the *regulatory treatment of the Argentine Airlines* (and was being negotiated), even if a clear disagreement regarding the *valuation of Interinvest\u2019s (ultimately expropriated) shares in the Argentine Airlines* had not yet crystallized. In other words, are these two disagreements sufficiently related that negotiations under the first disagreement are enough to satisfy Article X(2)?\n\n123.\n\nThe answer to this question is yes. International jurisprudence suggests that the *subject matter* of the negotiations should be the same as the dispute that is brought before the court or tribunal. In the recent *Georgia v. Russia* case, the ICJ noted that \"the exchanges must refer to the subject-matter of the treaty with sufficient clarity to enable the State against which a claim is made to identify that there is, or may be, a dispute with regard to that subject-matter.\"121 The tribunal in *CMS,* describing the existence of multiple types of sovereign actions that could constitute disputes, noted that \"as long as [these multiple different actions] affect the investor in violation of its rights and cover the same subject matter, the fact that they may originate from different sources or emerge at different times does not necessarily mean that the disputes are separate and distinct.\"122\n\n*Georgia v. Russian Federation,* Preliminary Objections, Judgment, April 1, 2011, \u00b6 30, Exhibit C-554. *See also* *Generation Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9), Award, September 15, 2003, \u00b6 14.5, Exhibit C-297, noting that, in that case, \"[t]here is no doubt that the subject matter of the two mediations was the Claimant\u2019s Parkview Project and the conduct of Ukrainian authorities in respect thereto. This is sufficient for the purposes of the requirement in Article VI(2) of the BIT.\"\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on Jurisdiction, July 17, 2003, at \u00b6 109 (hereinafter, *\"CMS v. Argentina\").*\n\n124.\n\nClaimants have characterized the subject matter of their dispute as concerning Respondent\u2019s treatment of Claimants\u2019 investments in the Argentine Airlines and Interinvest.123 Respondent has retorted that the subject matter of the negotiations between the Parties was merely contract issues and matters of domestic law, which is different from the subject matter of a BIT claim.124 However, Respondent\u2019s argument is really just a general assertion that the claim must be characterized in the same terms (and possibly employing the same legal theories) when it is being negotiated as when it is finally subjected to arbitration. Again, nothing in the text of Article X(l)\u2019s reference to \"a dispute in connection with investments\" requires that the dispute be characterized solely in terms of Treaty violations.\n\nRej. \u00b6132.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.\n\n125.\n\nGiven that the formal expropriation alleged does indeed appear to be closely related to, and follow, what the Claimants characterize as \"only the culmination of a creeping expropriation\" that began in October 2004,125 it appears reasonable to conclude that these two core issues are related to the point that they share the same subject-matter. Therefore, given that the dispute had crystallized before June 11, 2008, and that the Parties continued to exchange views and work towards agreement after this point, it is clear that the Claimants have satisfied the 6-month amicable settlement period.\n\nMerits \u00b6 501.\n\n**(b) Futility**\n----------------\n\n126.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to find that Claimants had not formed a \"dispute\" within the meaning of Article X(l) before June 11, 2008, and had not attempted to amicably settle the dispute by the time they filed the Request for Arbitration on December 11, 2008, the Claimants\u2019 failure to comply with this obligation should be excused for reasons of futility. Claimants have asserted that further negotiations with Respondent would be futile, because they have attempted to settle this dispute from 2002 until May 2008, and then again between October 2008 and early 2010.\n\n127.\n\nICSID tribunals have held that waiting periods may be waived when further negotiations would be futile. For example, the tribunal in *Occidental* held that additional \"attempts at reaching a negotiated solution were indeed futile in the circumstances\" where the investor had sought to rebut allegations in a *caducidad* proceeding, to no avail, for 18 months before the *caducidad* decree was finally issued.126\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation et al. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11), Decision on Jurisdiction, September 9, 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 93-95, Exhibit C-439.\n\n128.\n\nClaimants assert that they continued negotiations with Respondent between October 2008 and early 2010.127 These negotiations concerned a potential transaction whereby Respondent would assume Claimants\u2019 obligations and rights with respect to purchase orders Claimants had placed for several Airbus aircraft on the Argentine Airlines\u2019 behalf. According to Claimants, Respondent was interested in assuming these commitments in exchange for the termination of these ICSID proceedings.128 Respondent has not challenged this assertion.129 While a draft agreement was initialed on February 8, 2009, and although Respondent later obtained financing from the Spanish government for this agreement, Respondent ultimately did not sign the agreement.130\n\nCM \u00b6\u00b6159.\n\nMerits \u00b6\u00b6 284-303; CM \u00b6\u00b6 158-65.\n\n*See also* Exhibit C-235, containing a February 8, 2009 draft agreement between Respondent and Interinvest. In Section 3.1(b) of the agreement, Interinvest would be required to *\"desistir\u00e1 \u00edntegra y expresamente de todos los derechos que pudiera eventualmente invocar, como tambi\u00e9n a todas las acciones entabladas o en curso, fundados o vinculados a las medidas mencionadas en el p\u00e1rrafo anterior [la re-nacionalizaci\u00f3n, estatizaci\u00f3n, expropiaci\u00f3n relativa a las empresas del Grupo AA], as\u00ed como tambi\u00e9n a cualquier tipo de solicitud de arbitraje y/o conciliaci\u00f3n, demanda judicial... \".*\n\nCM \u00b6 162.\n\n129.\n\nThis failed transaction, the negotiations for which lasted at least six months, demonstrates that even after Respondent had received formal notice of Claimants\u2019 legal claims against Respondent under the Treaty, the Parties continued to attempt but were ultimately unable to reach any sort of amicable agreement. It is clear, therefore, that requiring Claimants to engage in any further settlement attempts would serve no further purpose.\n\n**(c) The Local Court Requirement of Articles X(2) and (3)**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nRespondent also argues that Claimants have failed to comply with Articles X(2) and (3), which require that Claimants\u2019 dispute must be submitted to a local court of the host State for a period of 18 months before they may submit the dispute to this Tribunal.131 In response, Claimants have identified two different proceedings that they assert \"count\" for purposes of Articles X(2) and (3): first, the valuations of the Argentine Airlines that were conducted in October 2008 and January 2009, and second, the expropriation lawsuit that was initiated by Respondent against Interinvest shortly after the January 2009 valuation was completed.\n\n\"2. If a dispute within the meaning of section 1 cannot be settled within six months as from the date on which one of the parties to the dispute raised it, it shall be submitted, at the request of either party, to the competent tribunals of the Party in whose territory the investment was made.  \n 3. The dispute may be submitted to an international arbitral tribunal in any of the following circumstances: *(a)* At the request of one of the parties to the dispute, when no decision has been reached on the merits after a period of 18 months has elapsed as from the moment the judicial proceeding provided for in section 2 of this article was initiated or When such a decision has been reached, but the dispute between the parties persists; *(b)* When both parties to the dispute have so agreed.\"\n\n131.\n\nRespondent raises several issues with Claimants\u2019 identified proceedings. First, Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration should have been filed only after the dispute was brought before the Argentine courts; in fact, the expropriation proceedings post-date the filing of these ICSID proceedings. Second, the expropriation proceedings only concern local laws, not international investment claims. Third, the parties in the expropriation proceeding\u2014namely, Respondent and Interinvest\u2014are not identical to the parties to this arbitration proceeding.\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with Respondent\u2019s assertion that the subject matter of the expropriation suit in domestic court is not the same as the subject matter of this arbitration. It is true that the Argentine court proceedings only involved the determination of the value of the expropriated assets, while the ICSID proceeding raises specific issues related to the validity of the expropriation (i.e., fair and equitable treatment, arbitrary and unjustified measures, and full protection and security). As a matter of substance, however, the goal of both suits is to make the Claimants (and Interinvest, in the case of the Argentine proceeding) whole for the economic loss suffered as a result of the nationalization. As the ICJ Chamber in *ELSI* noted,\n\n[T]he local remedies rule does not, indeed cannot, require that a claim be presented to the municipal courts in a form, and with arguments, suited to an international tribunal, applying different law to different parties: for an international claim to be admissible, it is sufficient if the essence of the claim has been brought before the competent tribunals and pursued as far as permitted by local law and procedures, and without success.132\n\n*Case concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy),* Judgment, I.C.J. Reports, July 20, 1989, \u00b6 59, Exhibit C-437.\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that the fact that the local court proceeding was brought by Respondent against Interinvest rather than against Claimants themselves does not affect Claimants\u2019 fulfillment of this requirement. As the *ELSI* Chamber acknowledged, international legal remedies may apply \"different law to different parties\" than local law remedies do, and this should not be a barrier to the fulfillment of any local court remedy requirements. That the domestic expropriation proceedings were brought against Interinvest, an Argentine company owned by Claimants through Air Comet, does not prevent those proceedings from counting for purposes of Article X(2) and (3) when the subject matter of those proceedings is the same as that before this Tribunal.\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, moreover, that the Treaty permits either party to initiate local court proceedings for purposes of Article X. In this case, it was Respondent that initiated the dispute against Interinvest. Therefore, the manner in which the proceedings have been cast by Respondent in local courts should not give rise to a successful objection against the Claimants that they failed to comply with the procedural requirements of Article X, as long as the subject matter of the dispute under the Treaty was considered in the local proceedings, which, in this case, it was.\n\n135.\n\nFinally, while Claimants concede that the 18-month local court period had not lapsed at the time they filed their Request for Arbitration, they are correct to note that 18 months have subsequently passed, and the local suit remains pending. As such, the core objective of this requirement, to give local courts the opportunity to consider the disputed measures, has been met. To require Claimants to start over and re-file this arbitration now that their 18 months have been met would be a waste of time and resources.133\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina* v. *Yugoslavia),* Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996 (II), at 613, \u00b6 26 (\"For the purposes of determining its jurisdiction in this case, the Court... need only note that, even if it were to be assumed that the Genocide Convention did not enter into force between the Parties until the signature of the Dayton-Paris Agreement, all the conditions are now fulfilled to found the jurisdiction of the Court *ratione personae.* It is the case that the jurisdiction of the Court must normally be assessed on the date of the filing of the act instituting proceedings.... The present Court applied this principle in the case concerning the Northern Cameroons (I.C.J. Reports 1963, p. 28), as well as in *Nicaragua Jurisdiction,* when it stated: \u2018It would make no sense to require Nicaragua now to institute fresh proceedings based on the Treaty, which it would be fully entitled to do.\u2019 (I.C.J. Reports 1984, pp. 428-429, para. 83.)\"); *Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia),* Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 412 (hereinafter *\"Croatia v. Serbia\")* \u00b6 85, Exhibit C-579 (\"The Court observes that as to the first of these two arguments, given the logic underlying the cited jurisprudence of the Court deriving from the 1924 Judgment in the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions case (Judgment No. 2, 1924, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 2), it does not matter whether it is the applicant or the respondent that does not fulfill the conditions for the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, or both of them \u2014 as is the situation where the compromissory clause invoked as the basis for jurisdiction only enters into force after the proceedings have been instituted. What matters is that, at the latest by the date when the Court decides on its jurisdiction, the applicant must be entitled, if it so wishes, to bring fresh proceedings in which the initially unmet condition would be fulfilled. In such a situation, it is not in the interests of the sound administration of justice to compel the applicant to begin the proceedings anew\u2014 or to initiate fresh proceedings \u2014 and it is preferable, except in special circumstances, to conclude that the condition has, from that point on, been fulfilled.\").\n\n136.\n\nFor the reasons articulated above, this Tribunal finds that the Claimants have satisfied the requirements of Article X(l)(3) of the Treaty. However, because the Claimants invoked, in the alternative, the application of the Treaty\u2019s Most-Favored Nation Clause in relation to Respondent\u2019s first objection, the Tribunal now turns to this claim.\n\n**ii. The Application of the Most-Favored Nation Clause (Article IV(2)) to Dispute Settlement Provisions**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nArticle IV(2) of the Treaty provides that\n\nIn all areas governed by this Treaty, such treatment shall not be less favourable than that accorded by each Contracting Party to investments made within its territory by investors of a third country.\n\n138.\n\nIn their Request for Arbitration, Claimants invoked the MFN clause in Article IV(2), and asserted that this clause entitles them to use \"the more favorable treatment accorded to investors under, for example, the U.S.-Argentina BIT.\"134 In their Memorial on the Merits, Claimants again invoke the MFN clause, reference the U.S.-Argentina BIT as an example, and assert that they have complied with all the requirements of the U.S.-Argentina BIT in order to access ICSID arbitration.135 Then, in their Counter-Memorial, Claimants assert that they rely on the dispute settlement provisions of the Australia-Argentina BIT.136 Article 13(1) of the Australia-Argentina BIT provides that\n\nAny dispute which arises between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party relating to an investment shall, if possible, be settled amicably. If the dispute cannot so be settled, it may be submitted, upon request of the investor, either to:\n\n(a) the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party which has admitted the investment; or\n\n(b) international arbitration in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Article.\n\nArticle 13(3), in turn, provides that the investor may choose international arbitration proceedings through either ICSID, a tribunal governed by UNCITRAL Rules, or any other mutually-agreed arbitration rules.\n\nRFA \u00b6 44.\n\nMerits \u00b6\u00b6 328-331. Article VII(2) of the U.S.-Argentina BIT provides that in the event of a dispute, the parties \"should initially seek resolution through consultation and negotiation.\" If this is unavailing, the investor may choose to submit the dispute for resolution before a) the courts or administrative tribunals of the State party to the dispute; b) in accordance with any previously-agreed procedures; or c) in accordance with the terms of subprovision 3. Article VII(3), in turn, provides that if the investor has not submitted the dispute for resolution under VII(2)(a) or (b), and that six months have elapsed from the date the dispute arose, the investor may submit the dispute to ICSID, ICSID Additional Facility, in accordance with UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, or any other mutually agreed arbitration rules. *See* Ex. C-3.\n\nCM \u00b6 7; *see* Ex. C-394.\n\n**1. Position of Respondent**\n-----------------------------\n\n139.\n\nRespondent asserts that the MFN clause of Article IV(2) of the Treaty may not be used by Claimants to access the dispute settlement provisions of another BIT to which Argentina and a third State are parties, for the following reasons:\n\n140.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that the obligations contained in Article X\u2014to first hold negotiations and to submit the dispute to the Argentine courts for 18 months\u2014are *jurisdictional* requirements that may not be set aside or disregarded.137\n\nMem. \u00b6 32; Rep. \u00b6 96.\n\n141.\n\nSecond, Respondent characterizes Article X as part of its standing, unilateral offer to arbitrate.138 This unilateral offer must be accepted by the investor in order for there to be an arbitration agreement, and in accepting the offer the investor is not entitled to alter the terms of acceptance.139 Arbitration is based on consensus, and if there is no respect for the established conditions of Respondent\u2019s offer, there can be no consent to arbitration.140\n\nMem. \u00b6 39.\n\nMem. \u00b6 40-41.\n\nMem. \u00b6 44.\n\n142.\n\nThird, Respondent asserts that as a rule, MFN clauses contained in BITs are neither arbitration agreements nor part of the treaty\u2019s offer to arbitrate; they cannot therefore be applied to jurisdictional matters.141 An MFN clause may *only* apply to jurisdictional matters where the State Parties have so consented. This consent, in turn, must be based on the States\u2019 clear and unequivocal intentions as expressed in the treaty.142\n\nMem. \u00b6 48; Rep. \u00b6 111.\n\nMem. \u00b6 48.\n\n143.\n\nRespondent concedes that arbitral tribunals have not adjudicated this issue uniformly. However, according to Respondent, starting with *Maffezini v. Spain,* those tribunals applying MFN clauses to jurisdictional matters have failed to understand that MFN clauses do not extend to dispute settlement provisions and are not a part of offers to arbitrate.143 Nor do such decisions reflect the majority view on the subject. Indeed, an \"equal number of decisions\" have rejected recourse to dispute settlement provisions through a treaty\u2019s MFN clause.144 Respondent also notes that \"many\" States have subsequently explicitly limited the scope of the MFN treatment in their bilateral investment treaties in order to avoid the result reached in *Maffezini*.145\n\nMem. \u00b6 52.\n\nRep. \u00b6 132; *see also* Respondent\u2019s Letters of February 17 and 28 September 2012.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55.\n\n144.\n\nFourth, Respondent argues that the ordinary meaning of the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause does not demonstrate the two States\u2019 clear and unequivocal intention to apply it to the provisions on the settlement of disputes, either in accordance with the rules on treaty interpretation in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\") or in accordance with the *ejusdem generis* principle.146\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 57-68.\n\n145.\n\nTo the contrary, argues Respondent, substantial evidence demonstrates that the States\u2019 intention was for the MFN clause *not* to apply to matters of jurisdiction and procedure.147 Respondent asserts that the 18-month clause is an essential provision of the Treaty which was specifically negotiated by Argentina and Spain, as it has been in some\u2014but not all\u2014of Argentina\u2019s BITs.148 Moreover, at the time the Treaty was concluded, both Parties had entered into other BITs that did not contain local court preconditions. It is therefore impossible that the Parties intended for the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause to apply to dispute settlement provisions, because such an interpretation would have immediately deprived Article X of all effect.149 Finally, Argentina continued to include 18-month court provisions in subsequent BITs. Such provisions would be meaningless if it was possible for them to be set aside by applying an MFN clause.150\n\nMem. \u00b6 28.\n\nMem. \u00b6 70.\n\nRep. \u00b6 113.\n\nRep. \u00b6 145.\n\n146.\n\nFifth, Respondent asserts that Claimants cannot be allowed to import parts of the dispute settlement clause of the U.S.-Argentina BIT, which contains a fork-in-the-road provision.151 The dispute settlement provisions of the Treaty and the U.S.-Argentina BIT are fundamentally different and incommensurate. Under the Treaty, if the dispute is *not* submitted to the Argentine courts, it may not proceed to international arbitration, whereas under the U.S.-Argentina BIT, if the dispute *is* submitted to the Argentine courts, it may not subsequently proceed to international arbitration. There is no evidence that Spain and Argentina accepted, through the application of the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause, such a \"radical change\" in their consent to international jurisdiction.152\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b674-75.\n\nRep. \u00b6 124.\n\n147.\n\nSixth, Respondent argues that the authentic interpretation of the State Parties to the Treaty is clear. *In Maffezini,* in which an Argentine investor sued Spain under the Treaty, the Kingdom of Spain adopted the same position as the Argentine Republic is taking in the instant case regarding the inapplicability of the MFN clause to dispute settlement provisions.153 The unilateral interpretation previously made by Spain has now been upheld by the Argentine Republic, thus making it an authentic interpretation of the Treaty in accordance with Article 31(3) of the VCLT.154\n\nMem. \u00b6 83.\n\nRep. \u00b6 125.\n\n148.\n\nSeventh, Respondent asserts that Claimants\u2019 invocation of Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina BIT, through application of the MFN clause in their Counter-Memorial, is not timely and must be dismissed.155 To change the instrument upon which they are relying at this point is against the principle of good faith and should be barred by estoppel.156 It also severely affects Respondent\u2019s right to defend itself and turns the jurisdiction of this Tribunal into a moving target.157\n\nRep. \u00b6 104.\n\nRep. \u00b6 105.\n\nRep. \u00b6 106.\n\n**2. Position of Claimants**\n----------------------------\n\n149.\n\nClaimants assert that through the operation of the MFN provision in Article IV(2) of the Spain-Argentina BIT, they may rely on the procedural rules on admissibility of investor-state claims contained in Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina BIT, rather than the provisions set forth in Article X of the Treaty. Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina BIT provides neither the 6-month nor the 18-month requirements contained in the Treaty\u2019s Article X.158\n\nCM \u00b6 23.\n\n150.\n\nClaimants assert that the text of Article IV(2) of the Treaty clearly indicates that the MFN standard can be relied on with respect to the waiting periods provided in Article X.159 The MFN clause is extremely broad because it encompasses \"all matters\" dealt with in the Treaty.160 The third and fourth paragraphs of Article IV list exhaustively those matters that are excluded from the scope of the MFN clause. This list does not include dispute-resolution provisions or \"waiting periods.\"161 Therefore, on the basis of *expressio unius est exclusio alterius,* the MFN clause extends to all matters not expressly excluded.162\n\nCM \u00b6 24.\n\nCM \u00b6 26.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n151.\n\nSecond, according to Claimants, there is no rule that an MFN clause can only be deemed to apply to dispute settlement provisions where there is evidence that this is the Parties\u2019 clear and unequivocal intention. Argentina\u2019s reliance on this purported special presumption finds no support in either the VCLT or international jurisprudence.163\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 29-32.\n\n152.\n\nThird, Claimants assert that the case law decided under the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause164 unanimously supports Claimants\u2019 position. In each of the four cases, the claimants invoked Article IV(2) to displace the provisions of Article X. In each case, the tribunals emphasized the inclusive \"in all matters\" language of Article IV(2). And in each of the cases, the tribunals did not deny application of the MFN clause to the \"waiting periods.\"165\n\nCM \u00b6 29 et seq. Claimants make reference to *Maffezini v. Spain;* *Gas Natural SDG SA v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/10), Decision on Jurisdiction, June 17, 2005 (hereinafter, *\"Gas Naturalv. Argentina\"),* Exhibit C-260; *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA. and Intergua Servicios Integrates de Agua SA. v.

Argentina* was consolidated with *AWG Group Ltd. v. Argentine Republic,* a related arbitration brought under the UNCITRAL Rules).\n\nCM \u00b6 29.\n\n153.\n\nFourth, Claimants note that a number of other arbitral tribunals have permitted claimants to invoke MFN clauses of their applicable BITs in order to bypass waiting periods. In those cases, despite the fact that the base BIT contained waiting periods, the tribunals granted the claimants the more favorable treatment of other treaties.166 According to Claimants, only three167 out of a total of thirteen tribunals have rejected the invocation of an MFN clause to displace an 18-month local court precondition to international arbitration.168 However, the MFN clauses of the applicable BITs in *Wintershall, ICS* and *Daimler* were substantially different from that of the present Treaty\u2019s MFN clause, and the facts of those cases were also substantially different.169\n\nCM \u00b6 44.\n\n*Wintershall Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14), Award, December. 8, 2008 (hereinafter *\"Wintershall v. Argentina\"),* LA AR 7; *ICS v. Argentina,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2010-9, Award on Jurisdiction, February 10, 2012; *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1), Award, August 22, 2012 (hereinafter *\"Daimler v. Argentina\").*\n\nCM \u00b6 51; Claimants\u2019 Letter of February 28, 2012, at 2; Claimants\u2019 Letter of October 9, 2012, at 1.\n\nCM \u00b6 52, 57; Claimants\u2019 Letter of February 28, 2012, at 2, 4; Claimants\u2019 Letter of October 9, 2012, at 2-4.\n\n154.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent is wrong to characterize the jurisprudence on this issue as being sharply divided.170 Instead, Respondent included in its case survey a series of decisions which are distinguishable from the instant case.171 Those cases did not concern use of the MFN clause to bypass procedural or admissibility-related waiting periods (which depend solely on the action and filing date of the claimant). Instead, the claimants in those cases sought to use the MFN clause to extend the Tribunal\u2019s substantive jurisdiction.172\n\nRej. **\u00b6** 44.\n\nAccording to Claimants (CM \u00b6 59), these cases include *Salini Costruttori SpA and Italstrade SpA v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13), Decision on Jurisdiction, November 15, 2004 (hereinafter *\"Salini v. Jordan\"),* LA AR 21; *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24), Decision on Jurisdiction, February 8, 2005 (hereinafter *\"Plamav. Bulgaria\"),* LA AR 11; *Telenor Mobile Communications v. Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/15), Award, September 13, 2006, (hereinafter *\"Telenor v. Hungary\"),* Exhibit C-254; and *Vladimir Berschader and Moise Berschader v. The Russian Federation* (SCC Case No. 080/2004), Award, April 21, 2006 (hereinafter *\"Berschader v. Russian Federation\"),* LA AR 19.\n\nCM **\u00b6** 59.\n\n155.\n\nFifth, Claimants assert that Respondent\u2019s treaty negotiation practice demonstrates that it did not include waiting periods in many of its BITs. Only 10 of the 50 BITs referenced in Respondent\u2019s Memorial provide for the 18-month period. This further confirms that such provisions are procedural and technical in nature, and do not relate to matters of fundamental public policy for Argentina.173\n\nCM \u00b6 71.\n\n156.\n\nSixth, according to Claimants, Respondent has not put forth an \"authentic interpretation\" of the text based on the State Parties\u2019 subsequent practice.174 What Argentina is claiming is not an interpretation of Article IV of the Treaty, but rather an amendment to the text of Article IV.175 Even if it was an interpretation, Respondent must demonstrate an agreement and/or consistent subsequent practice between the State Parties as to the interpretation. Respondent, however, relies only on statements made by Spain in the context of a single dispute, the *Maffezini* case, in which Spain was the respondent.176\n\nRej. \u00b6 60.\n\nId.\n\nRej. \u00b6 61.\n\n157.\n\nSeventh, the Claimants believe there is no contradiction in using Article 7(3) of the U.S.-Argentina BIT because of its fork-in-the-road choice between local court remedies and international arbitration. Claimants themselves have not submitted the present dispute to the Argentine courts; rather, it was Respondent that submitted the question of compensation to local courts. Claimants, therefore, would not be precluded from going to international arbitration under the U.S.-Argentina BIT.177\n\nRej. \u00b6 21.\n\n158.\n\nFinally, Claimants assert that their invocation of the Australia-Argentina BIT is not untimely. According to Claimants, they relied on the MFN clause even before they submitted their Request for Arbitration.178 Moreover, Claimants relied on the Australia-Argentina BIT for the first time in their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction because Argentina itself only raised its objection with respect to the 6-month waiting period for the first time in its Memorial on Jurisdiction.179\n\nRej. \u00b6 14. *See* Claimants\u2019 letter to the President of the Argentine Republic, November 20, 2008, Ex. C-265 (\"In that sense, pursuant to Article X(4) of the Treaty, and invoking its Article IV(2) which provides investors with the right to invoke the most favoured nation treatment that the Republic has granted to investors of other countries, as for example to the investors of the United States or the Republic of Chile\").\n\nRej. \u00b6 56.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n**b. The Ordinary Meaning of Article IV**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nArticle IV, captioned \"Treatment,\" provides as follows:\n\n1. Each Party shall guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment of investments made by investors of the other Party.\n\n2. In all matters governed by this Agreement, such treatment shall be not less favourable than that accorded by each Party to investments made in its territory by investors of a third country.\n\n3. Such treatment shall not extend, however, to the privileges which either Party may grant investors of a third State by virtue of its participation in:  \n -a free trade area;  \n -a customs union;  \n -a common market;  \n -a regional integration agreement; or\n\nAn organization of mutual economic assistance by virtue of an agreement concluded prior to the entry into force of this Agreement, containing terms analogous to those accorded by that Party to participants of the said organization.\n\n4. The treatment accorded under this article shall not extend to tax deductions or exemptions or other analogous privileges granted by either Party to investors of third countries by virtue an agreement to prevent double taxation or any other tax agreement.\n\n160.\n\nOn its face, the language of Article IV(2) is broad. It applies to \"all matters governed by this Agreement.\" Its language in Spanish is no less broad: *\"en todas las materias regidas por el presente Acuerdo)\u2019* \"All,\" or *\"todas,\"* is unambiguously inclusive. \"Matters,\" or *\"materias,\"* is also broad and general. While not decisive on the issue, it is illustrative to note that other BITs have confined the application of MFN treatment to a smaller category of activities than Article IV(2)\u2019s broad \"all matters\" language. The Argentina-Germany BIT,180 for example, contains more constrained provisions:\n\n- Article 3(1): None of the Contracting Parties shall accord in its territory *to the investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party or to investments in which they hold shares,* a less favorable treatment than the treatment granted to the investments of its own nationals or companies or to the investments of nationals or companies of third States.\n\n- Article 3(2): Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, *as regards its activities related to investments,* to a less favorable treatment than the one accorded to its own nationals and companies or to nationals and companies of third States.181\n\nThe Argentina-Germany BIT was at issue in *Wintershall, Hochtief, Daimler* and *Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8), Decision on Jurisdiction, August 3, 2004 (hereinafter *\"Siemens v. Argentina\"),* Exhibit C-330.\n\nTreaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, April 9, 1991, UNTS Vol. 1910, 171 (1996)(emphasis added). Ad Article 3 in the Protocol to the Argentina-Germany BIT provides as follows: \"(a) The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed \"activity\" within the meaning of article 3, paragraph 2: the management, utilization, use and enjoyment of an investment. The following shall more particularly, though not exclusively, be deemed \"treatment less favourable\" within the meaning of article 3: less favourable measures that affect the purchase of raw materials and other inputs, energy or fuel, or means of production or operation of any kind or the marketing of products inside or outside the country. Measures that are adopted for reasons of internal or external security or public order, public health or morality shall not be deemed \"treatment less favourable\" within the meaning of article 3.\"\n\n161.\n\nThe MFN clause in the Italy-Jordan BIT at dispute in *Salini v. Jordan* also contains a more limited scope of application:\n\n- Both Contracting Parties, within the bounds of their own territory, *shall grant investments effected by, and the income accruing to, investors of the Contracting* *Party* no less favourable treatment than that accorded to investments effected by, and income accruing to, its own nationals or investors of Third States.182\n\n*Salini v. Jordan,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 66.\n\n162.\n\nLikewise, the MFN clause in the U.K.-Argentina BIT at dispute in *ICS v. Argentina* contains a more limited scope of application:\n\n- Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investors of the other Contracting Party, *as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments,* to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State.183\n\n*ICS v. Argentina,* Award on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 65. As noted above, the *ICS* Tribunal determined that the MFN clause of the U.K.-Argentina BIT did not apply for purposes of dispute settlement provisions. In reaching this conclusion, the tribunal pointed to 1) the state of the law at the time the BIT was concluded and the expectation of the parties were such that, without express language in the treaty, treatment could not have extended to dispute resolution mechanisms (\u00b6\u00b6 285-296); 2) the contextual language established that \"treatment\" only referred to the \"management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of\u2019 an investment (\u00b6\u00b6 297-304); and 3) the phrase \"in its territory\" imposes a territorial limitation that excludes international arbitration, which is in the nature of an extraterritorial dispute settlement procedure (\u00b6\u00b6 305-309).\n\n163.\n\nIn the BITs referenced above, MFN treatment only applies to qualifying \"investments,\" \"activities related to investments,\" \"income accruing\" to investors, or \"management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal\" of those investments. Such terms are narrower than the general \"matters\" language contained in the Treaty. Moreover, none of these other BITs contains the simple and expansive \"all\" of the Treaty.184\n\n*See also* *Maffezini v. Spain,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 60 (noting that with respect to the BITs concluded by Spain, \"the only one that speaks of \"all matters subject to this Agreement\" in its most favored nation clause, is the one with Argentina. All other treaties, including those with Uruguay and Chile, omit this reference and merely provide that \"this treatment\" shall be subject to the clause, which is of course a narrower formulation.\").\n\n164.\n\nOther subsections of Article IV of the Treaty contain explicit carve-outs to the application of MFN treatment. Article IV(3) provides that MFN treatment shall not extend to the treatment either Party extends to third states by virtue of their common participation in a free trade area, a customs union, a common market, a regional integration agreement or an organization of mutual economic assistance. Article IV(4) provides that MFN treatment shall not extend to the treatment either Party extends to investors of third states concerning tax deductions or similar provisions. The issues of jurisdiction and admissibility are absent from this list of explicit carve-outs.\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that investment arbitration jurisprudence on the ordinary meaning of MFN provisions has not been entirely consistent, even when the same BIT is concerned. Notably, each of the cases that has addressed Article IV(2) of the Treaty has concluded that the broad language of the MFN clause applies to the Article X dispute resolution provisions.185 However, other tribunals have disagreed. The Belgium/Luxembourg-Soviet Union BIT applied by the tribunal in *Berschader* contained \"all matters\" language similar to that of the Spain-Argentina BIT. Nonetheless, the *Berschader* tribunal rejected the claimant\u2019s attempt to use the MFN clause. In contrast with the tribunals in *Maffezini, Gas Natural* and the *Suez* cases, the tribunal in *Berschader* noted that \"all matters covered by the present treaty\" cannot be interpreted \"literally,\" because the MFN clause is not capable of being applied at all to several of the matters covered by the BIT.186\n\n*Maffezini v. Spain,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 64; *Gas Natural v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6\u00b6 30-31; *Suez InterAguas v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 54-55; *Suez Vivendi v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 54-55. *See also* *Impregilo v. Argentina,* Award, at \u00b6 108, in which the majority of arbitrators determined that the broad \"all matters\" language of the MFN clause in the Italy-Argentina BIT extended to dispute settlement provisions. Note, however, that one of the arbitrators, Brigitte Stern, dissented on this particular point. *Impregilo v. Argentina,* Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, at \u00b6 46 et seq.\n\n*Berschader v. Russian Federation,* Award, at \u00b6 192.\n\n166.\n\nLikewise, the tribunals that have adjudicated the MFN provisions of the Argentina-Germany BIT have not uniformly interpreted the ordinary meaning of that BIT\u2019s MFN provisions.187 The tribunals in *Siemens* and *Hochtief* concluded that the language of the MFN provisions (language that is less sweeping and more particularized than the MFN clause in the instant Treaty) implicitly included dispute settlement provisions.188 However, the tribunals in *Wintershall* and *Daimler* disagreed.189 The *Wintershall* tribunal determined that the BIT\u2019s MFN clause in Article 3 \"does *not* mention that the most-favoured-nation \"treatment\" as to investments, and investment related activities, *is to be in respect of \"all relations\" or that it extends to \"all aspects\" or covers \"all matters in the treaty*,\"\"190 The *Daimler* tribunal, for its part, determined that the language of the Argentina-Germany BIT\u2019s MFN clause was territorially limited, that \"treatment\" was intended by the parties to refer only to treatment of the investment, and that the BIT did not extend MFN treatment to \"all matters\" subject to the BIT.191\n\nThe MFN clauses of the Germany-Argentina BIT are contained in numerous provisions. *See \u00b6* 158 of this decision, *supra.*\n\n*Siemens v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 85 et seq.; *Hochtief v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at **\u00b6** 66 et seq.

Nonetheless, the Tribunal acknowledges that it does not adjudicate in a vacuum. The issue of application of MFN clauses to dispute settlement provisions has been addressed by numerous panels and in numerous factual scenarios. Moreover, both Parties have made extensive analyses and arguments on the case law on this issue. Below, the Tribunal will identify the points on which the different case holdings can be distinguished, and the points on which there is analytical disagreement between tribunals.\n\n**i. UNCTAD\u2019s Case Taxonomy**\n-----------------------------\n\n168.\n\nAs noted by Claimants, UNCTAD\u2019s recent publication *on Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment192* categorizes the cases addressing the application of MFN clauses to jurisdiction in a way that largely corresponds with each case\u2019s outcome.\n\n\"Most Favoured-Nation Treatment,\" UNCTAD Series on International Investment Agreements II at 66-67, UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2010/1, January 24, 2011 (hereinafter \"UNCTAD *MFN Treatment* \u2019), Exhibit C-563.\n\n169.\n\nUNCTAD sorts the cases into two categories. In the first category, claimants \"have invoked the MFN treatment clause to override a procedural requirement that constitutes a condition for the submission of a claim to international arbitration.\"193 UNCTAD refers to this category of cases as concerning \"admissibility\" requirements. In the second category, claimants \"have attempted to extend via MFN the jurisdictional threshold, i.e., the scope of the mandate of the arbitral tribunal, beyond that specifically set forth in the basic treaty. This use of the MFN clause would give the arbitral tribunal jurisdiction to hear issues or disputes that the basic treaty does not contemplate or expressly excludes.\"194 UNCTAD refers to this category of cases as concerning \"scope of jurisdiction.\"\n\n*Id.* at 66.\n\n*Id.* at 67.\n\n170.\n\nUNCTAD identifies the following cases as fitting within the \"admissibility\"195 category: *Maffezini, Siemens, Gas Natural, National Grid,196 Suez InterAguas, AWG Group197* and *Wintershall.* To these cases, the Tribunal would add *Impregilo,198 Hochtief,199 Abaclat200ICS,201* and *Daimler202* In each of these cases, the claimant was required under the respective terms of its BIT\u2019s dispute settlement provisions to seek a remedy before a local court of the host State for a period of time before bringing arbitration. Each of the claimants in these cases sought to use its BIT\u2019s MFN clause in order to \"borrow\" a dispute settlement provision from another treaty that did not contain a local court requirement as a precondition of arbitration. With the exceptions of *Wintershall, ICS* and *Daimler* the claimants\u2019 arguments were successful.\n\n*Id.* at 67-73.\n\n*National Grid Pic v. Argentine Republic* (UNCITRAL), Decision on Jurisdiction, June 20, 2006, (hereinafter *\"National Grid v. Argentina\"),* LA AR 25.\n\n*See Suez Vivendi v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n*Impregilo v. Argentina,* Award, at \u00b6\u00b6 79 et seq. (note, again, the dissenting opinion of B. Stern on this issue).\n\n*Hochtief v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6\u00b6 59 et seq. (note, again, the dissenting opinion of C. Thomas on this issue).\n\n*Abaclat v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, at \u00b6\u00b6 568 et seq.\n\n*ICS v. Argentina,* Award, at \u00b6\u00b6 243 et seq.\n\n*Daimler v. Argentina,* Award, \u00b6\u00b6 179 et seq.\n\n171.\n\nUNCTAD identifies the following cases as fitting within the \"scope of jurisdiction\"203 category: *Salini, Plama, Telenor, Berschader,* and *Tza Yap Shum204* In these cases, the claimants sought to use the MFN clause to expand the scope of jurisdiction under their applicable BIT. In *Salini,* the claimant attempted to use the MFN clause to bring in contract claims before an ICSID tribunal. In *Plama,* the claimant attempted to use the MFN clause to broaden the scope of jurisdiction beyond that of its applicable BIT, which only provided jurisdiction to resolve issues of compensation in the case of an expropriation.205 Similarly, in *Telenor* and *Berschader,* the claimants attempted to use the MFN clause to broaden jurisdiction beyond their BITs, which only provided jurisdiction over expropriation claims.206 In each of these cases, the claimant\u2019s attempts to rely on the MFN clause were rejected by the tribunals. UNCTAD identified only one case within this category, *RoslnvestCo,* that departed from this trend.207\n\nUNCTAD *MFN Treatment,* at 73-79.\n\n*Tza Yap Shum v. The Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6), Decision on Jurisdiction and Competence, June 19, 2009.\n\n*Plama v. Bulgaria,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6\u00b6 186-187.\n\n*Telenor v. Hungary,* Award, at \u00b6\u00b6 81-83, *Berschader v. Russian Federation,* Award, at \u00b6\u00b6 151-153.\n\n*RoslnvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation,* Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Case No. 079/2005, Award, October 2007; *see also* UNCTAD *MFN Treatment,* at 79. *The Russian Federation v. RoslnvestCo UK Ltd,* Case No. T24891-07, Order, Stockholm District Court, November 9, 2011. In a default judgment rendered November 9, 2011, the Stockholm District Court declared that the arbitration agreement, which had arisen through the claimant\u2019s request for arbitration under the Russia-U.K. BIT, did *not* give the arbitrators jurisdiction to determine whether Russia had undertaken measures of expropriation against the claimant..\n\n172.\n\nLooking at the taxonomy above, it is clear that Claimants\u2019 position falls within the \"admissibility\" category of cases cited by UNCTAD, in which tribunals normally rule in favor of applying the MFN clause. Claimants are seeking to apply the Treaty\u2019s MFN clause in order to dispense with the requirements of Article X, namely, that the Parties attempt to amicably settle their dispute for 6 months, and that their dispute be subjected to the local courts of Argentina for 18 months.\n\n**ii. Other Interpretative Issues**\n-----------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nIn addition to looking at case law according to outcome, the Tribunal considers the interpretative assumptions underlying tribunals\u2019 decisions. At least one of the tribunals in the \"admissibility\" cases identified by UNCTAD looked for evidence that the State parties did *not* intend to include dispute settlement provisions within the scope of the MFN clause. As the tribunal in *Gas Natural* stated, \"Unless it appears clearly that the state parties to a BIT or the parties to a particular investment agreement settled on a different method for resolution of disputes that may arise, most-favored-nation provisions in BITs should be understood to be applicable to dispute settlement.\"208\n\n*Gas Natural* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 49.\n\n174.\n\nIn contrast, tribunals in the \"scope of jurisdiction\" cases have taken as a starting principle that the extension of the MFN clause to cover jurisdictional issues *cannot be assumed.* As the tribunal in *Plama* set forth, \"an MFN provision in a basic treaty does not incorporate by reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in another treaty, unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the Contracting Parties intended to incorporate them.\"209 According to *Plama,* \"an arbitration clause must be clear and unambiguous and the reference to an arbitration clause must be such as to make the clause part of the contract (treaty).\"210\n\n*Plama v. Bulgaria,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 223.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 218. *See also Berschader v. Russian Federation,*Award, at \u00b6 181.\n\n175.\n\nLikewise, tribunals have differed in their views on whether dispute settlement provisions constitute a vital protection of foreign investors. Many of the tribunals following the *Maffezini* Decision on Jurisdiction have determined that these provisions are a fundamental part of the \"treatment\" or protection owed to investors:\n\n- \"Notwithstanding the fact that the basic treaty containing the clause does not refer expressly to dispute settlement as covered by the most favored nation clause, the Tribunal considers that there are good reasons to conclude that today *dispute settlement arrangements are inextricably related to the protection of foreign investors,* as they are also related to the protection of rights of traders under treaties of commerce.\"211\n\n- \"From the point of view of the promotion and protection of investments, the stated purposes of both the Argentina-Spain BIT and the Argentina-U.K. BIT, *dispute settlement is as important as other matters governed by the BITs and is an integral part of the investment protection regime that the respective sovereign states have agreed upon.\"212*\n\n- \"[T]he Tribunal considers that the critical issue is whether or not the dispute settlement provisions of bilateral investment treaties constitute part of the bundle of protections granted to foreign investors by host states. As the Tribunal sees the history, first of the ICSID Convention, which created the institution of investor-state arbitration, and subsequently of the wave of bilateral investment treaties between developed and developing countries (and in some instances between developing countries *inter se), a crucial element - indeed perhaps the most crucial element - has been the provision for independent international arbitration of disputes between investors and host states. The creation of ICSID and the adoption of bilateral investment treaties offered to investors assurances that disputes that might flow from their investments would not be subject to the perceived hazards of delays and political pressures of adjudication in national courts. \"213*\n\n- *\"Access to [dispute settlement] mechanisms is part of the protection offered under the Treaty. It is part of the treatment of foreign investors and investments and of the advantages accessible through a MFN clause \"214*\n\n- \"Article X[\u2019s dispute settlement provision] is a benefit conferred on investors and designed to protect their interests and the interests of a State Party in its capacity as a host State party to a dispute with an investor: *it is a protective right that sits alongside the guarantees against arbitrary and discriminatory measures, expropriation, and so on.\"215*\n\n*Maffezini v. Spain,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 54 (emphasis added).\n\n*Suez InterAguas v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 57 (emphasis added).\n\n*Gas Natural v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 29 (emphasis added).\n\n*Siemens v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 102 (emphasis added).\n\n*Hochtief v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 68 (emphasis added).\n\n176.\n\nThe above tribunals do not share the concern expressed by Respondent, and by a few other tribunals, that such an approach disregards the fundamental requirement that a State Party consent to jurisdiction. For example, the tribunal in *Telenor* noted, \"[W]hat has to be applied is not some abstract principle of investment protection in favour of a putative investor who is not a party to the BIT and who at the time of its conclusion is not even known, but the intention of the States who are the contracting parties.\"216 Because consent is a basic requirement for jurisdiction over a State, and because the terms of consent to arbitration are negotiated on an individual basis for each BIT, these tribunals were unwilling to assume, without explicit language by the State Parties on this point, that the jurisdictional requirements of one BIT can be borrowed by an investor of a third State.\n\n*Telenor v. Hungary,* Award, at \u00b6 95. See also *Wintershall v. Argentina,* Award, at \u00b6 179, which notes with approval the tribunals that do not \"regard as sufficient a consent of the Host State to international arbitration which would be a merely presumed consent.\"\n\n177.\n\nThe position taken by each tribunal may very well be influenced to an extent by the facts before it. The tribunals that considered whether MFN protection could extend to admissibility requirements were not asked to extend the reach of MFN protection to provisions that would change the arbitral forum or the scope of matters that could be subjected to arbitration. In contrast, the tribunals that considered the latter issue were not required to assess whether MFN protection could cover admissibility requirements.\n\n178.\n\nIn *Plama,* for example, while the tribunal held that the MFN clause could not be used to substitute the BIT\u2019s dispute settlement mechanism in favor of ICSID arbitration, it also expressed a certain sympathy for the *Maffezini* tribunal:\n\nThe decision in *Maffezini* is perhaps understandable. The case concerned a curious requirement that during the first 18 months the dispute be tried in the local courts. The present Tribunal sympathizes with a tribunal that attempts to neutralize such a provision that is nonsensical from a practical point of view. However, such exceptional circumstances should not be treated as a statement of general principle guiding future tribunals in other cases where exceptional circumstances are not present.217\n\nWhat the *Plama* tribunal characterized as *Maffezini\u2019s* \"curious\" 18-month local court requirement has not proved to be as \"exceptional\" as the *Plama* tribunal suggests. Since the *Plama* decision on jurisdiction was issued, numerous tribunals have addressed the application of MFN clauses to 18-month local court requirements.218 In any case, the *Plama* tribunal\u2019s dictum suggests a view that treatment of a requirement may vary depending on the nature of that requirement.\n\n*Plama v. Bulgaria,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 224.\n\n*See, e.g., Gas Natural, National Grid, Suez Vivendi, Suez InterAguas, Impregilo, Hochtief, Abaclat.*\n\n179.\n\nMoreover, the tribunal in *Maffezini* itself was careful to stress that its decision was bounded by \"important limits arising from public policy considerations.\"219*Maffezini* included within these limits BIT clauses that provide for a specific arbitration forum, such as ICSID, and that provide for a highly institutionalized system of arbitration with precise rules of procedure.220 For the *Maffezini* tribunal, such provisions cannot be replaced or bypassed.\n\n*Maffezini v. Spain,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 56.\n\n*Id.,* at \u00b6 63.\n\n180.\n\nTo be sure, several tribunals have criticized the *Maffezini* public policy limits. The *Plama* tribunal noted that *Maffezini* did not specify the origin or the basis of these \"public policy\" considerations.221 The *Salini* and *Wintershall* tribunals asserted that the limits identified by *Maffezini* did not do enough to prevent the risk of treaty shopping.222 Nonetheless, a significant number of tribunals have either directly applied *Maffezini\u2019s* four limitations or have used its discussion as the basis for an inquiry into what public policy considerations animated the State parties\u2019 formulation of their MFN clauses. For example, in *Plama* and *Berschader,* the tribunals found it significant that the BIT was concluded while the State respondents were still communist governments, favoring limited dispute settlement and limited protections for investors.223\n\n*Plama v. Bulgaria,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 221.\n\n*Salini v. Jordan,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 115, *Wintershall v. Argentina,* Award, at \u00b6 182.\n\n*Plama v. Bulgaria,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 195-97; *Berschader v. Russian Federation,* Award, at \u00b6\u00b6 200, 203.\n\n181.\n\nIn light of the above discussion, the Tribunal is cognizant of the concern articulated by numerous tribunals that the reach of the MFN clause not extend beyond appropriate limits. The Tribunal also acknowledges that the nature of the dispute settlement provisions that Claimants seek to replace via the Article IV(2) MFN clause is relevant to any such determination.\n\n182.\n\nIn that respect, the Tribunal finds it significant that Claimants have not requested that the Tribunal apply the MFN clause in order to replace the Treaty\u2019s provisions on the arbitral forum or rules. Nor have Claimants requested that the Tribunal apply the MFN clause in order to broaden the scope of legal issues that may be adjudicated through arbitration. Instead, they have argued that the procedural requirements of Article X, namely the negotiation and local court requirements, may be bypassed in favor of the more procedurally limited dispute settlement provisions of the Australia-Argentina BIT.\n\n**(b) The dispute settlement clause of the U.S.-Argentina BIT and the Australia-Argentina BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nAs a final argument, Respondent has protested Claimants\u2019 invocation of the U.S.-Argentina BIT and the Australia-Argentina BIT on two grounds. First, Respondent asserts that Claimants cannot take advantage of the U.S.-Argentina BIT\u2019s dispute settlement provisions because there is no advantage to take; the U.S.-Argentina BIT\u2019s fork-in-the-road provisions (providing for either a local court remedy or an arbitral remedy) are not better, but simply constitute a different settlement regime.224 Second, Respondent argues that Claimants\u2019 invocation of the Australia-Argentina BIT is inadmissible because it was untimely presented, and that modifying the dispute settlement procedures invoked \"severely affects\" its right to defend its interests.\n\nThe relevant provisions of Article VII of U.S.-Argentina BIT, on dispute settlement include the following: Article VII(2): \"In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute for resolution: (a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or (b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; or (c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\" Article VII(3) provides that \"Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b)... the national or company may choose to consent in writing to the submission to the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration\" to ICSID, to the ICSID Additional Facility, in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration or to any other mutually agreed arbitration institution. Note that Respondent\u2019s argument could be extended to the Australia-Argentina BIT invoked by Claimants. Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina BIT provides that \"1. Any dispute which arises between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party relating to an investment shall, if possible, be settled amicably. If the dispute cannot so be settled, it may be submitted, upon request of the investor, either to: (a) the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party which has admitted the investment; or (b) international arbitration,\" including to ICSID, in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules or to any other mutually agreed arbitration institution.\n\n184.\n\nOn the first point, it is clear that the U.S.-Argentina BIT (and the Australia-Argentina BIT) has advantages that the Treaty does not; under the former, it is possible to access arbitration with fewer procedural preconditions. Moreover, Claimants have not already selected the local court \"fork\" under the U.S.-Argentina BIT. Article X(3)(a) of the Treaty is satisfied when *either* the Respondent or the investor brings the suit before a local court. Here, it was the Respondent that brought a suit against Interinvest in the Argentine courts relating to the expropriation of the Argentine Airlines. As such, it is clear that Claimants have not already \"picked\" the local court \"fork,\" thereby forfeiting their access to arbitration.\n\n185.\n\nOn the second point, the Tribunal notes that Respondent does not point to any actual or perceived harm, nor is there any evidence that Claimants\u2019 switch from relying on the U.S.-Argentina BIT to relying on the Australia-Argentina BIT would have any effect on the arguments made by Respondent. As such, the Tribunal rejects this argument.\n\n186.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal finds that Claimants may equally rely on the Article IV(2) MFN clause of the Treaty to make use of the dispute resolution provisions contained in Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina BIT. The broad \"all matters\" language of the Article IV(2) MFN clause is unambiguously inclusive. Moreover, applying the dispute settlement provisions contained in Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina BIT would not change the scope, the forum or the rules applicable to this arbitration. Claimants have satisfied the requirements of Article 13 of the Australia-Argentina BIT, which states that any dispute \"shall, if possible, be settled amicably,\" and which permits an investor to submit the dispute to international arbitration in the event that it cannot be settled.225 Claimants have clearly complied with this provision.\n\nAustralia-Argentina BIT, art. 13, Exhibit C-394.\n\n**c. Second Jurisdictional Objection: Claimants\u2019 Standing**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Claimants\u2019 Investment in Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Position of Respondent**\n-----------------------------\n\n187.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants\u2019 claims, which are based on the alleged violation of rights held by Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines, are derivative and indirect in nature. As such, argues Respondent, Claimants do not have standing to bring this claim. On one hand, Claimants are claiming rights that are vested in third parties (namely, Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines) who are not parties to this arbitration.226 On the other hand, Claimants have only indirect shareholdings in these companies, which they hold through the Spanish intermediary company Air Comet S.A.227\n\nRep. \u00b6 222.\n\nRep. \u00b6 223.\n\n188.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants bring two different indirect claims. The first of these claims relates to Interinvest S.A.\u2019s rights. Respondent asserts that Interinvest, an Argentine company which is not protected under the Treaty, is the only entity with legal standing to complain of the alleged expropriation of the Argentine Airlines\u2019 shares.228 The second of these claims relates to the rights of ARSA and AUSA. Here, according to Respondent, Claimants also invoke a set of rights which are not held by them.229 The only entities with legal standing to complain of the adoption of airfare regulatory measures are ARSA and AUSA, the parties whose assets were affected by the measures.230\n\nMem. \u00b6 108.\n\nMem. \u00b6114.\n\nMem. \u00b6116.\n\n189.\n\nRespondent asserts that it did not adopt any measure to the detriment of Claimants\u2019 own investment. None of Claimants\u2019 shares in Air Comet were expropriated. Furthermore, the rights deriving from those shares were not infringed, nor was their exercise limited in any way.231 There is a distinction between the rights of companies and of their shareholders,232 and it would be unjust to award compensation to a person or an entity that is not entitled to obtain redress.233\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 102, 115.\n\nMem. \u00b6123.\n\nMem. \u00b6 126.\n\n190.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants\u2019 indirect claim is inadmissible under the Treaty, which affords no protection to indirect shareholders.234 Respondent notes that while some investment treaties refer to the \"direct or indirect\" control of assets or provide for the protection of both the rights and interests of investors, the Treaty does not allow indirect claims to be filed.235 Moreover, in defining \"investment,\" the Treaty includes property and rights acquired by foreign investors.236 It does not protect the mere shareholders\u2019 *interests* in the companies in which they have an indirect shareholding.237\n\nRep. \u00b6 172.\n\nMem. \u00b6153.\n\nMem. \u00b6159.\n\nMem. \u00b6 160.\n\n191.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent asserts that Claimants\u2019 indirect claim is inadmissible under general international law.238 It is a general principle of law that the company\u2019s shareholders cannot complain of alleged violations of rights vested in the company in which they hold shares.239 The decisions rendered by the International Court of Justice have consistently maintained that, under international law, shareholders are not entitled to assert the rights of the companies in which they have a shareholding. In other words, derivative claims are not valid.240 Respondent notes that the European Court of Human Rights has also rejected the admissibility of indirect actions.241 Under international law, indirect or derivative claims can only be accepted where a treaty has expressly provided for indirect or derivative actions.242\n\nMem \u00b6 128.\n\nMem. \u00b6130.\n\nRep. \u00b6 175.\n\nMem. \u00b6 136.\n\nMem. \u00b6 141.\n\n192.\n\nRespondent also argues that the ICSID Convention does not allow indirect or derivative claims to be filed. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention lays down the objective criteria for a dispute to fall within the jurisdiction of the Centre.243 When the ICSID Convention was drafted, the drafters considered allowing controlling shareholders of domestic companies to bring claims to enforce the rights of the companies in which they held shares.244 However, the drafters ultimately rejected this possibility. Instead, they drafted Article 25(2)(b), which provides for the possibility of a domestic but foreign-controlled company to sue its own State when the parties agreed that the domestic company would be treated as a national of the other State due to its foreign control.245\n\nMem. \u00b6 165.\n\nMem. \u00b6 167.\n\nMem. \u00b6 168.\n\n193.\n\nIt is further Respondent\u2019s view that neither the ICSID Convention nor international investment law or customary or general international law provide for a *jurisprudence constante* principle.246 The judicial decisions cited favorably by Claimants that concern BITs permitting indirect shareholding are not applicable to this dispute.247\n\nRep. \u00b6 195.\n\nRep. \u00b6 204.\n\n194.\n\nRespondent also urges that Claimants\u2019 indirect claim is inadmissible under Argentine law. Argentine law does not allow indirect claims to be filed, and the corporation is the only entity empowered to defend its own interests.248 Respondent notes that general international law and the Treaty require that the Tribunal apply the domestic law of the State in which the shareholder holds interests in order to decide on the rights that may be invoked by a shareholder under international law.249 It has been recognized in ICSID decisions that domestic law is relevant for the purposes of determining ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction.250\n\nMem. \u00b6 182.\n\nRep. \u00b6 238.\n\nRep. \u00b6 240.\n\n195.\n\nRespondent makes a number of policy claims regarding Claimants\u2019 standing. It asserts that Claimants disregard the set of legal relationships existing among the companies which are part of the corporate chain connecting Teinver S.A. to the Argentine Airlines, as well as those relationships between these companies and their own creditors.251 If the Tribunal were to order Respondent to pay Claimants compensation, then Claimants would be allocated payments that should have been prioritized for the Argentine Airlines\u2019 creditors and the remaining intermediary companies. Claimants, as the last link in this chain of creditors and shareholders, would be unjustly enriched.252\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 196-98.\n\nMem. \u00b6 205.\n\n196.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent asserts that there is an actual risk of double or multiple claims, because there is nothing to prevent Interinvest S.A. from filing an action before the Argentine courts in parallel with the present arbitration.253 Multiple claims could potentially lead to a situation of double recovery.254 In addition, allowing Claimants to file this indirect action erroneously implies that shareholders have a right to the preservation of the value of their holdings, when in fact, the value of stockholdings varies according to the fluctuations in corporate assets.255\n\nMem. \u00b6 209.\n\nMem. \u00b6 211.\n\nMem. \u00b6 212.\n\n197.\n\nFinally, Respondent points out that only Teinver S.A. currently owns shares in Ar Comet. Between October 2007 and December 2009, both Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos transferred all of their shares in Air Comet to Teinver. As such, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos are neither direct nor indirect shareholders in the Argentine companies.256\n\nRep. \u00b6 154.\n\n**2. Position of Claimants**\n----------------------------\n\n198.\n\nClaimants assert that they are not claiming rights held by Interinvest and/or the Argentine Airlines. Rather, they are claiming in their own name and on their own behalf, on the basis of the rights conferred on them by the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.257 Claimants reiterate that their own claims include the following actions taken by Respondent: 1) formally expropriating Claimants\u2019 investment in the Argentine Airlines without any compensation; 2) effectuating the creeping expropriation of their investments in the Argentine Airlines; 3) failing to treat Claimants\u2019 investment in Interinvest and the Argentina Airlines fairly and equitably; 4) impairing by unjustified and discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension or disposal of Claimants\u2019 investments in Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines; 5) failing to provide the required protection to Claimants\u2019 investments in Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines; and 6) violating specific obligations entered into with respect to Claimants\u2019 investment in Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines.258\n\nCM \u00b6 220.\n\nCM \u00b6 221.\n\n199.\n\nClaimants argue that these claims arise directly from their rights under the Treaty, that is, the protection that Respondent owes directly to Claimants as Spanish investors in Argentina. Claimants are thus not asserting contractual rights held by the Argentine companies in question. Claimants are entitled to claim that Respondent\u2019s conduct was in breach of the Treaty, regardless of whether that conduct may also amount to a breach of Interinvest\u2019s or the Argentine Airlines\u2019 rights under local law.259\n\nCM \u00b6 225, Rej. \u00b6 246.\n\n200.\n\nClaimants assert that claims by both direct and indirect shareholders for measures impacting their shareholdings are admissible under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention, and are well recognized in international law. First, Claimants assert that claims by shareholders for harm caused to their shareholdings have been unanimously upheld by ICSID tribunals. While Respondent asserts that a shareholder may not recover damages for harm caused to its \"shares and other forms of participation\" in companies incorporated in the host-State, virtually all ICSID tribunals that have decided similar objections unanimously have rejected them.260 Moreover, ICSID tribunals have acknowledged that an *indirect* shareholder could claim damages \"suffered by a company in which it holds shares,\" even though the applicable BIT did not contain the \"direct or indirect\" wording.261\n\nCM **\u00b6** 226.\n\n\u00b6 246; Rej. \u00b6 229 (citing *Siemens v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 137).\n\n201.\n\nSecond, Claimants argue that claims by indirect shareholders are admissible under the wording of the Treaty. While the Treaty does not contain \"direct or indirect\" language, Article 1(2) of the Treaty provides that \"any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind [including] shares and other forms of participation in companies\" constitute qualifying investments. Under this inclusive formulation, indirect shareholders may pursue claims for measures affecting their \"shares and other forms of participation in companies.\"262 This conclusion was also reached by other ICSID tribunals interpreting Article 1(2) of the Treaty.263 Furthermore, the object and purpose of the Treaty is to create favorable conditions and to promote capital flow and investment between investors of the Contracting Parties. This aim is equally pursued through direct and indirect ownership of investments.264\n\nCM \u00b6 234.\n\n\u00b6 235 (citing *Gas Natural v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 34).\n\nCM \u00b6 237.\n\n202.\n\nThird, Claimants argue that international law does not support Respondent\u2019s position, and that Argentina\u2019s reliance on ICJ case law is misplaced. According to Claimants, the question addressed in those cases was not whether the shareholders had a cause of action under international law, but whether, under customary international law, a State could exercise diplomatic protection over its nationals, who are shareholders with investments affected by a third State.265 The right of a particular State to exercise diplomatic protection in favor of its nationals\u2014even if they are shareholders in foreign companies\u2014is irrelevant to the issue of whether an investor has standing under a BIT to claim for measures impacting its shareholding in local companies.266\n\nCM \u00b6\u00b6 248-50.\n\nCM \u00b6 252.\n\n203.\n\nFourth, in Claimants\u2019 view, Respondent misinterprets Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Article 25(2)(b) is not applicable to the present dispute, since the Treaty lacks any reference to the Parties\u2019 consent to treat a company incorporated in the host State and controlled by a foreign investor as a foreign investor for the purposes of the Treaty. Claimants have not even attempted to invoke 25(2)(b) as a source of jurisdiction.267 Furthermore, Argentina misunderstands the negotiating history of this provision. The issue before the drafters concerned whether to allow local companies access to the ICSID Convention in certain situations such as when they were owned by foreign nationals.268\n\nCM \u00b6 259.\n\nRej. \u00b6 282.\n\n204.\n\nFifth, Claimants assert that Argentine corporate law is irrelevant to decide whether Claimants have *jus standi* under the Treaty and international law. Claimants\u2019 claims are Treaty claims, and they do not constitute an exercise of rights under Argentine domestic law.269\n\nCM \u00b6 265.\n\n205.\n\nSixth, Claimants argue that Argentina\u2019s policy concerns are immaterial to the outcome of the current arbitration and, in any case, are misleading and unfounded. Claimants assert that none of Respondent\u2019s policy objections has any support in the Treaty, the ICSID Convention or international law, including investment case law.270 Respondent\u2019s concerns about preferential treatment over third parties (including creditors), double recovery and double-payment pertain to the merits of the dispute, not to the jurisdictional stage.271\n\nCM \u00b6 269.\n\nCM \u00b6 270.\n\n206.\n\nFinally, Claimants assert that Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos are legitimate parties to the arbitration. Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos transferred their shares to Teinver on December 10, 2009, but this transfer has no impact on their standing in the current arbitration. The relevant dates for determining ICSID jurisdiction are the dates of consent and/or registration of the dispute.272 Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos indirectly held shares in Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines both when consent was perfected and at the time the Request for Arbitration was submitted.273\n\nRej. \u00b6 300.\n\n*Id.*\n\n**3. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nIn maintaining that the Claimants do not have standing because they are merely \"indirect\" shareholders in Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines, Respondent advances two distinct legal arguments.274 The first argument addresses the question whether Claimants, as shareholders, can recover damages for harms that were inflicted *upon the companies* in which Claimants invested (i.e., Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines), as opposed to harms that were inflicted directly upon Claimants themselves. This will be referred to below as Respondent\u2019s \"derivative claim\" argument. Respondent\u2019s second legal argument concerns the question whether Claimants must be direct shareholders, in the sense that they must *directly* own the shares in Interinvest, rather than through an intermediary subsidiary such as Air Comet. This will be referred to below as Respondent\u2019s \"intermediary investor\" argument.\n\nRep. \u00b6\u00b6 222-23.\n\n**(a) Respondent\u2019s \"Derivative Claim\" Argument**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Article I of the Treaty**\n------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Treaty provides no protection to \"derivative\" shareholders. While it protects the shareholders\u2019 *direct* rights arising out of the shares, it does not, in Respondent\u2019s view, protect the shareholders\u2019 \"mere interests\" in the companies in which they have the shareholding. Respondent asserts that while some investment treaties may provide for the protection of both the rights and interests of investors, the Treaty does not provide for this possibility. Respondent contrasts the language of Article 1(2) with the analogous provision of the U.S.-Argentina BIT, which extends protections to \"a company or shares of stock or *other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof\"275* Respondent also notes that the U.S.-Argentina BIT, in contrast to the Treaty, protects investments that are \"owned or controlled *directly or indirectly,\"276*\n\nMem. \u00b6 162.\n\nMem. \u00b6 152.\n\n209.\n\nWhile Respondent is correct to note that Article 1(2) of the Treaty does not explicitly include or exclude \"indirect\" investments from its coverage, the broad and inclusive language of this provision suggests that \"indirect\" shareholders are protected by the Treaty. Article 1(2) sets forth the definition of \"investments\" that are protected under the Treaty:\n\nThe term \"investments\" shall mean any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind, acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment and in particular, but not exclusively, the following:\n\n-shares and other forms of participation in companies;\n\n\u2026\n\n210.\n\nThis definition is broad and inclusive. \"Investment\" encompasses \"any kind of assets,\" \"property and rights of every kind,\" and the list of qualifying investments that follows the definition is exemplary rather than exclusive. Other ICSID tribunals interpreting the Treaty have noted the breadth of this definition. The tribunal in *Gas Natural* noted that \"while the ICSID Convention does not define the term \u2018investment,\u2019 the BIT clearly does so in an inclusive way,\" and that the Treaty\u2019s definition \"follows the almost universal practice of BITs to define the subject of the Treaty as comprehensively as possible.\"277\n\n*Gas Natural v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n\n211.\n\nThe other ICSID tribunals that have looked at the Treaty have found Article 1(2)\u2019s broad language to implicitly permit the kinds of claims that Claimants have advanced. In the *Suez Vivendi* and *Suez InterAguas* arbitrations, Argentina raised an identical argument, asserting that the shareholder claimants had no standing to bring the dispute because they were alleging a merely \"derivative\" injury based on the injury to the company in which they hold shares, rather than a direct injury claimants had suffered. The tribunals in these cases rejected this argument, finding that claimants had a valid \"investment\" under the terms of the Treaty:\n\n\"[U]nder the plain language of these BITs, the Tribunal finds that Suez\u2019s as well as AGBAR\u2019s and InterAguas\u2019 shares in APSF are \"investments\" under the Argentina-France and Argentina-Spain BITs. These shareholders thus benefit from the treatment promised by Argentina to investments made by French and Spanish nationals in its territory. Consequently, under Article 8 of the French treaty and Article X of the Spanish treaty, these shareholder Claimants are entitled to have recourse to ICSID arbitration to enforce their treaty rights. Neither the Argentina- France BIT, the Argentina-Spain BIT, nor the ICSID Convention limit the rights of shareholders to bring actions for direct, as opposed to derivative claims. This distinction, present in domestic corporate law of many countries, does not exist in any of the treaties applicable to this case.\"278\n\n*Suez InterAguas v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 49; *see also* *Suez Vivendi v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 49.\n\n212.\n\nIt is notable that the *Suez* tribunals described the Treaty as not *limiting* the rights of shareholders to bring \"derivative\" claims. The tribunals explicitly rejected the notion that there is any \"default\" under international investment law that restricts what kinds of claims can be brought. In this respect, the tribunals refused to take their cues from domestic corporate law. Under this logic, the fact that the Treaty does not explicitly permit \"derivative\" actions is irrelevant, because the very concept of a \"derivative\" claim is alien to the Treaty or the ICSID Convention.\n\n213.\n\nThe tribunal in *Gas Natural* reached a similar result as the *Suez* tribunals, using a slightly different reasoning. In *Gas Natural,* Argentina again argued that claimant, a shareholder in an Argentine company that was granted concessions, lacked standing to bring its claim. The tribunal disagreed. After finding claimant\u2019s shareholdings in the Argentine company to constitute a valid \"investment\" under the Treaty, it found the claimant to have standing because \"a claim asserting the impairment of the value of the shares held by Claimant as a result of measures taken by the host government gives rise to an investment dispute within the meaning of Article X of the BIT[\u2026]\"279 The tribunal in *Gas Natural* accepted that a diminution in the value of the claimant\u2019s shares constituted an injury under the Treaty. Like the *Suez* tribunals, the *Gas Natural* tribunal was simply not perturbed by the possibility that this claim was merely \"derivative\" of an injury to the Argentine company.280\n\n*Gas Natural v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\nThe *Gas Natural* tribunal also implies that it is generally understood that foreign investors acquire rights under the ICSID Convention and the applicable BIT when they purchase shares in a locally-established corporation: \"Indeed, the standard mode of foreign direct investment, followed in the present case and in the vast majority of transnational transfers of private capital, is that a corporation is established pursuant to the laws of the host country and the shares of that corporation are purchased by the foreign investor, or alternatively, that the shares of an existing corporation established pursuant to the laws of the host country are acquired by the foreign investor. The scheme of both the ICSID Convention and the bilateral investment treaties is that in this circumstance, the foreign investor acquires rights under the Convention and Treaty, including in particular the standing to initiate international arbitration.\" *(Id.* at \u00b6 34).\n\n214.\n\nIn light of the language of Article 1(2), this Tribunal finds that the Claimants have standing based on their investments in the Argentine Airlines. Respondent\u2019s subsequent legal arguments, which draw on ICJ case law, the ICSID Convention and Argentine law, assert that the \"derivative\" distinction matters for purposes of interpreting the Treaty. However, none of Respondent\u2019s arguments, which are analyzed below, undermine the conclusions reached by this Tribunal in light of the text of Article 1(2).\n\n**ii. ICJ Case Law**\n--------------------\n\n215.\n\nRespondent asserts that general international law does not permit indirect claims brought by shareholders for harms suffered by the companies in which they hold shares. Specifically, Respondent points to *Barcelona Traction (Belgium v. Spain),* in which the ICJ held that Belgium lacked *jus standi* to exercise diplomatic protection of Belgian national shareholders with respect to measures taken by Spanish authorities that affected the Canadian company in which the Belgian nationals held shares.\n\n216.\n\nClaimants argue that *Barcelona Traction* is not applicable, because the case\u2019s holding does not concern the direct standing of shareholders, but only whether a right of a *state* had been violated as a result of its nationals having suffered an infringement of their rights as shareholders. However, in order to determine whether Belgium had a right to bring its case, the Court had to first address the scope of the Belgian nationals\u2019 rights as shareholders. On that issue, the Court concluded that \"Not a mere interest affected, but solely a right infringed involves responsibility, so that an act directed against and infringing only the company\u2019s rights does not involve responsibility towards the shareholders, even if their interests are affected.\"281\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Co., Ltd. (Belgium v. Spain),* 1970 I.C.J. 3, \u00b6 46 (February 1970).\n\n217.\n\nNonetheless, *Barcelona Traction\u2019s* discussion of shareholder rights is inapposite to the circumstances of the present case for two reasons.\n\n218.\n\nFirst, the Court\u2019s decision was made in the absence of the specific framework of a BIT. The Court noted that such treaties, while not applicable to the Belgian shareholders, could give shareholders a \"direct right to defend their interests against states.\"282 This indeed is the Claimants\u2019 case since they brought their claim under a BIT that explicitly protects investments they have made in any kind of assets, including shares.\n\n*Id.*. at \u00b6 90.\n\n219.\n\nSecond, the Court acknowledged that international law was silent on the issue of shareholder rights. In the absence of any international authority, the Court explicitly resorted to municipal law to provide the content of the shareholders\u2019 rights.283 In the present case, there is no reason to resort to municipal law when the treaty instrument provides the source of the rights asserted by the Claimants.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 50.\n\n220.\n\nThe Court\u2019s analysis in *Barcelona Traction* was confirmed in its 2007 judgment on preliminary objections in *Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Guinea v. DRC),* where the Court noted that foreign investment treaties have taken primacy under international law in adjudicating the rights of companies and their shareholders:\n\nThe Court is bound to note that, in contemporary international law, the protection of the rights of companies and the rights of their shareholders, and the settlement of the associated disputes, are essentially governed by bilateral or multilateral agreements for the protection of foreign investments, such as the treaties for the promotion and protection of foreign investments, and the Washington Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which created an International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), and also by contracts between States and foreign investors. In that context, the role of diplomatic protection somewhat faded, as in practice recourse is only made to it in rare cases where treaty r\u00e9gimes do not exist or have proved inoperative.284\n\nIn *Diallo,* for the reasons explained in *Barcelona Traction,* the Court was compelled to resort to the municipal law of the DRC to assess the scope of Mr. Diallo\u2019s rights in the absence of an applicable BIT.285\n\n*Case Concerning Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of Congo),* 2007 I.C.J. 1 (May 24), \u00b6 88 (hereinafter *\"Ahmadou Sadio Diallo* case\").\n\n*Id.; see also Ahmadou Sadio Diallo* case,, 2010 I.C.J. 1, \u00b6 104.

However, these cases involve an adjudication of a shareholder\u2019s rights under a specific instrument\u2014the ECHR\u2014that is simply not comparable to an investment treaty.\n\n221.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2019s assertions, *Barcelona Traction* and *Diallo* do not solidify any general principle of international law on shareholder rights that should be applied to the present dispute. Indeed, the Court has taken pains in both *Barcelona Traction* and *Diallo* to distinguish these cases from the situation in which an investment treaty regime would apply.\n\n**iii. The ICSID Convention**\n-----------------------------\n\n222.\n\nRespondent argues that the ICSID Convention does not extend protections to claims by shareholders. Specifically, Respondent asserts that the ICSID Convention\u2019s drafters had discussed the possibility of allowing shareholders of domestic companies to bring claims, but that this idea was ultimately rejected in favor of Article 25(2)(b) as it currently stands.\n\n223.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that the ICSID Convention\u2019s drafters rejected the possibility of shareholders bringing \"derivative\" suits under the ICSID Convention. The history cited by Respondent only concerns a very specific issue that arose in the ICSID Convention\u2019s negotiations concerning the nationality of claimants. As Christoph Schreuer explained in his authoritative *Commentary,* while the ICSID Convention was intended for disputes between a State and a national of another State, and not for disputes between a State and its own nationals, the drafters were aware that the reality on the ground could be more complicated. Many States required a foreign investor to carry out its activities under a locally incorporated company.286 While such a company would otherwise be precluded from bringing a suit because of its nationality, the drafters ultimately created Article 25(2)(b) as an exception to the nationality requirement to accommodate this situation.\n\n*See* Christoph Schreuer, The Icsid Convention: A Commentary (2nd Ed.), AR LA-63 at 296.\n\n224.\n\nTherefore, to the extent that the drafters \"rejected\" the suggestion that the local company\u2019s shareholders be granted standing, it was only in this specific and limited context. Moreover, the drafters rejected this suggestion in this specific context for practical reasons rather than because of any general view that \"derivative\" actions should not be permitted under the ICSID Convention: they noted that such an arrangement \"would not be feasible where shares are widely scattered and their owners are insufficiently organized.\"287\n\n*Id.* at 297.\n\n225.\n\nFinally, Article 25(2)(b) simply is not relevant to these proceedings. Claimants are nationals of another State, not a local Argentine company. Moreover, in order for Article 25(2)(b) to apply, the State parties to a BIT must agree to treat locally incorporated companies in this manner. Spain and Argentina did not so agree in their Treaty or elsewhere.\n\n**iv. Argentine Law**\n---------------------\n\n226.\n\nRespondent has asserted that Argentine law does not permit \"derivative\" claims to be brought by shareholders to recover for injuries done to the companies in which shareholders own shares. However, Respondent fails to demonstrate how Argentine corporate law is relevant to the issue of jurisdiction.\n\n227.\n\nRespondent has argued that \"it has been recognized that domestic law is relevant for the purposes of determining ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction.\"288 Respondent is, of course, correct that domestic law may be \"relevant\" to jurisdictional issues. However, the cases cited by Respondent address the situation in which domestic law is used by a tribunal to determine a *question of fact* in connection to a jurisdictional issue.289 In none of these cases does domestic law *define* the basic jurisdictional requirements. Instead, domestic law may be used by a tribunal in order to determine whether a claimant has, as a matter of fact, satisfied the legal requirements for ICSID jurisdiction that are set by the applicable BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\nRep. \u00b6 240.\n\n*See, e.g., Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26), Award, August 2, 2006, \" 149, 157 (hereinafter *\"Inceysa v. El Salvador\")(regarding,* the reliance upon domestic law in order to determine whether an investment was illegal or fraudulent), LA AR 77; *Camuzzi International SA. v.

Argentina\"\"),* Exhibit C-402 (\"Even though particular aspects relating to the meaning and scope of the rights relating to the assets are governed by the law and regulations of the Argentine Republic, it must be borne in mind, as noted above, that as regards jurisdiction the applicable law is that of the Convention and the Treaty.\"); see also *Government of the Province of East Kalimantan v. PT Kaltim Prima Coal and others* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/3), Award, December 28, 2009, \u00b6 166 (LA AR 194)(\"A review of ICSID cases shows that *tribunals do refer to national law, for instance to determine whether the requirements of nationality or of the existence of an investment are fulfilled.* In other words, depending on the circumstances, certain jurisdictional requirements under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention may sometimes have to be assessed taking into account national law.\")(emphasis added).\n\n228.\n\nRespondent itself has acknowledged that the jurisdictional requirements for this dispute are contained in the ICSID Convention and in the applicable BIT. It stated in its Memorial on Jurisdiction that \"The question relating to the competence of this Tribunal consists, therefore, in determining how a foreign investor may acquire *ius standi.* The answer to this question may be found in the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.\"290 Furthermore, investment arbitration case law on this point is well-documented and consistent.291 In *BG Group pic v. Argentina,* for example, the tribunal rejected the very argument made here by Respondent. As that tribunal noted:\n\nArgentina\u2019s reliance on principles of domestic corporate law must fail. BG\u2019s claim is made under the Argentina-UK BIT. BG is an \"Investor\" who has made an \"Investment\" in Argentina within the definition of Article 1 (a)(ii) of the treaty. It is further uncontroverted that BG\u2019s shares in [the local companies] are \"assets\" within the meaning ascribed to the term in this award pursuant to Argentine law. *The meaning of the BIT is to be determined not by analogy with private law rules, but from the words of [the] treaty itself and in the light of the purpose which it sets out to achieve292*\n\nMem. \u00b6151.\n\n*See, e.g.,* *CMS v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 42 (\"the applicable jurisdictional provisions are only those of the Convention and the BIT, not those which might arise from national legislation.\"); *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on Jurisdiction, December 8, 2003.1) \u00b6 50, Exhibit C-490 (\"The jurisdiction of the Centre is determined by Article 25 of the Convention. In addition, the competence of the Tribunal is governed by the terms of the instrument expressing the parties\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration.

Note, that the Final Award rendered by the Tribunal was subsequently denied enforcement on different grounds by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The D.C. Circuit decided the appeal on the basis of arbitrability, finding that BG and Argentina had not agreed to submit the arbitrability question itself to arbitration, and that the BG tribunal did not have jurisdiction to consider the matter of its own competence. *See Republic of Argentina v. BG Group pic,* D.C. Cir., No. 11-7021 (January 17, 2012).\n\n**(b) Respondent\u2019s \"Intermediary Investor\" Argument**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nIn addition to its \"derivative claim\" arguments, Respondent also argues that the Treaty does not provide standing to an \"indirect\" shareholder who only owns shares in the allegedly injured company through an intermediary (in this case, Air Comet).293 Respondent suggests that because Article 1(2) does not explicitly refer to investments made \"directly or indirectly,\" indirectly-held investments are not protected.\n\nRep. \u00b6\u00b6 207-208.\n\n230.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2019s assertions, nothing in the broad language of Article 1(2) of the Treaty suggests that shares held through subsidiaries are excluded from coverage under Article 1(2). Again, the language of Article 1(2) affirmatively extends the definition of protected \"investments\" to \"any kind of assets\" and \"property and rights of every kind.\" For this reason, the Tribunal considers that Claimants\u2019 shareholdings in the Argentine Airlines constitute \"investments\" under Article 1(2).\n\n231.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is consistent with previous awards. In *Siemens v. Argentina,* which concerned a BIT with language very similar to Article 1(2) of the Treaty, the tribunal conducted a close textual analysis of the relevant treaty provision that is instructive to the present dispute. The claimant in *Siemens* was a German investor who held shares in an intermediary company, which in turn held shares in a local company. The tribunal concluded that the claimant\u2019s investment was covered by the BIT, using the following reasoning:\n\nThe Tribunal has conducted a detailed analysis of the references in the Treaty to \"investment\" and \"investor.\" The Tribunal observes that there is no explicit reference to direct or indirect investment as such in the Treaty. The definition of \"investment\" is very broad. An investment is any kind of asset considered to be such under the law of the Contracting Party where the investment has been made. The specific categories of investment included in the definition are included as examples rather than with the purpose of excluding those not listed. The drafters were careful to use the words \"not exclusively\" before listing the categories of \"particularly\" included investments. One of the categories consists of \"shares, rights of participation in companies and other types of participation in companies.\" The plain meaning of this provision is that shares held by a German shareholder are protected under the Treaty. *The Treaty does not require that there be no interposed companies between the investment and the ultimate owner of the company.* Therefore, a literal reading of the Treaty does not support the allegation that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments.294\n\n*Siemens v. Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 137 (emphasis added).\n\n232.\n\nSeveral other ICSID tribunals have found indirectly-held shareholdings to constitute investments, even where the BIT does not explicitly refer to \"directly or indirectly\" held investments. For example, the tribunals in *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia295 Cemex v. Venezuela296* and *Mobil v. Venezuela297* addressed similar fact patterns and reached similar conclusions to that in *Siemens.*\n\n*Ioannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia,* (ICSID Case No ARB/05/18), Decision on Jurisdiction, July 6, 2007, \u00b6\u00b6123, Exhibit C-486, at \u00b6\u00b6 123-124 (following *Siemens).*\n\n*Cemex Caracas Investments B. V. and Cemex Caracas II Investments B. V. v.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27), Decision on Jurisdiction, June 10, 2010, at \u00b6\u00b6 162-65, Exhibit C-483.\n\n**(c) Respondent\u2019s Policy Arguments**\n-------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nIn addition to its legal arguments regarding the issue of the \"indirectness\" of Claimants\u2019 shareholdings, Respondent has advanced a number of policy arguments against Claimants\u2019 standing in this dispute. According to Respondent, the Claimants are upsetting the hierarchy of creditor claims against the Argentine Airlines and Interinvest, and it is inappropriate to award damages to a shareholder rather than to the company that has actually suffered injury. Respondent also expresses its concern that this suit could increase the risk that Respondent could be subjected to double-payment, because Interinvest could recover through the Argentine Courts in addition to any recovery by the Claimants under the Treaty.\n\n234.\n\nRespondent\u2019s assertions could have relevance in the merits proceeding of this case, but Respondent fails to demonstrate why these assertions are relevant at the jurisdictional stage. Moreover, Respondent has failed to articulate why these policy issues, as specifically applied to the facts at hand, should affect the outcome of this jurisdictional objection. Respondent has not attempted to demonstrate the extenuating nature of the facts here, or to differentiate the facts in this case from the large number of other ICSID cases in which claimant shareholders were found to have standing.\n\n235.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal finds that Claimants, as indirect shareholders, have standing to recover for damages that were inflicted upon the companies\u2014i.e., Interinvest and the Argentine Airlines\u2014in which Claimants invested. The ordinary language of Article 1(2) is designed to protect \"all assets\"\u2014including indirect shareholdings. The Tribunal also finds that Claimants are not deprived of standing by the fact that their investments were made through their subsidiary, Air Comet.\n\n**ii. Claimants\u2019 Other Investments**\n------------------------------------\n\n**1. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nClaimants assert that they have made several qualifying investments under Article 1(2) of the Treaty, and that these investments in Argentina go beyond the ownership and control of \"shares and other forms of participation in companies.\"298 Specifically, Claimants assert that they have also made the following qualifying investments under the Treaty: (a) significant capital contributions to expand and support the Argentine Airlines\u2019 operations, (b) concessions to operate in the Argentine airlines sector, (c) investment in management and know-how, (d) rights relating to aircraft, engines, a flight simulator, etc., and (e) movable and immovable property.299\n\nRej. \u00b6\u00b6 199-202.\n\nCM \u00b6\u00b6 217-219; Letter of June 16, 2011, at 3.\n\n237.\n\nRespondent disputes that these investments qualify under Article 1(2). Specifically, Respondent asserts that Claimants have not substantiated by evidence their capital contributions, nor would such contributions confer any rights other than those vested in shareholders.300 Respondent asserts that Claimants do not directly hold concessions to operate in the Argentine airlines sector and that they did not invest in other property and rights already within the possession of the Argentine Airlines at the time of investment.301 Finally, Respondent asserts that Claimants have not demonstrated that they actually made investments in the Argentine Airlines\u2019 aircrafts, or that the Argentine Airlines were the recipients of aircrafts ordered by Astra, an Irish subsidiary of Claimants, nor would these activities constitute qualifying \"investments\" under the Treaty.302\n\nRep. \u00b6 163.\n\nRep. \u00b6 166.\n\nRep. \u00b6 164.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal will not address Claimants\u2019 other alleged investments at this time. The Tribunal has concluded that Claimants\u2019 indirect shareholdings constitute an \"investment\" under the Treaty. Consequently, Claimants have standing to bring this dispute. The Tribunal may consider Claimants\u2019 other alleged investments at the merits stage of these proceedings.\n\n**iii. Claimants\u2019 Third-Party Funding Agreement and Assignment of Award Proceeds**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nDuring the hearing on jurisdiction, Respondent raised its concern that Claimants\u2019 and Air Comet\u2019s recent reorganization proceedings in Spain could affect Claimants\u2019 authorization to bring this case.303 In its post-hearing submissions, Respondent has also questioned two agreements entered into by Claimants subsequent to commencing this arbitration. One of these, a Credit Assignment Agreement among Teinver, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos as the assignors and Air Comet as the assignee (the \"Assignment Agreement\"), dated January 18, 2010, concerned the assignment to Air Comet of the proceeds of a potential award in this arbitration. The other, a Funding Agreement made between Claimants and Burford Capital Limited, an investment company headquartered in Guernsey, and effective as of April 14, 2010 (the \"Funding Agreement\"), concerned the financing of Claimants\u2019 litigation expenses in this arbitration.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Tr. Day 3 at 495, 505 and 578, Respondent\u2019s Letter of June 23, 2011, \u00b6 8 et seq.\n\n240.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that Air Comet commenced voluntary reorganization proceedings on April 20, 2010.304 Nor do they dispute that the Claimants each commenced voluntary reorganization roughly a year later, with Teinver on December 23, 2010, Autobuses Urbanos on January 28, 2011, and Transportes de Cercanias on February 16, 2011.305\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of June 16, 2011, at 16-17.\n\n*Id.,* at 12, Respondent\u2019s Letter of June 23, 2011, \u00b6 9.\n\n241.\n\nThe Parties also acknowledge that Claimants concluded the Assignment Agreement, by which Claimants agreed to assign to Air Comet proceeds of an eventual award in this case.306 In addition, the Parties acknowledge that Claimants executed the Funding Agreement with Burford.307 However, the Parties disagree as to the effects of these agreements on Claimants\u2019 standing in this case.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of June 16, at 16; Respondent\u2019s Letter of June 23, 2011, \u00b6 17.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of June 30, 2011, at 5-6; Respondent\u2019s Letter of June 23, 2011, \u00b6 23. While the Funding Agreement became effective on April 14, 2010, the transaction contemplated by it only closed on July 4, 2010. *See* Ex. RA-160, Schedule 1 No. 3(a) and Claimants\u2019 Letter of June 30, 2011, at 6.\n\n**1. Position of Respondent**\n-----------------------------\n\n242.\n\nAs a procedural matter, Respondent asserts that Claimants concealed their reorganization proceedings as late as April 12, 2011, and that Claimants were under a duty to make registration documents and court filings available to the Tribunal and Respondent.308\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter of June 23, 2011, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 15.\n\n243.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimants\u2019 assignment to Air Comet of proceeds from an eventual award in this case was \"fraudulent,\" because it was made on a date \"suspiciously close\" to Air Comet\u2019s reorganization, and \"gratuitous,\" because it was not backed by consideration.309 Respondent asserts that Claimants should have notified Respondent as the alleged debtor of the agreement.310 Moreover, Respondent argues that the agreement contravenes Spanish public policy on collection preferences, and that consequently the parties to the agreement were required to obtain judicial authorization from the Spanish courts in order to proceed.311\n\nId. at \u00b618.\n\nId.. at \u00b619.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b627.\n\n244.\n\nAs for the assignment itself, Respondent maintains that Claimants assigned to Air Comet a right they never owned, because Claimants themselves lack jurisdiction to bring this dispute and claim a remedy. Such an assignment would violate the general principle of law under which \"a person can transfer no greater right than he owns[\u2026]\"312 Moreover, Claimants\u2019 lack of standing is clear in light of the very text of the assignment to Air Comet and related court-filed writings, which note that \"AIR COMET is the one that is in fact affected by the expropriation since it owns 100% of Interinvest S.A., which in turn owns 100% of Aerolineas Argentinas\u2019 shares..,\"313\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter of October 26, 2011, at 13.\n\n*Id.* at 12-13.\n\n245.\n\nRegarding Claimants\u2019 Funding Agreement with Burford, Respondent asserts that it is Burford, and not Claimants, that is the real party interested in this arbitration. According to Respondent, Burford has \"not only invoked that it holds a purported \"common legal interest\" with the Claimants in this proceeding, but it is also the only party that would seem to be potentially benefited in the case of a hypothetical award against Argentina in the instant case.\"314\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter of June 23, 2011,\u00b6 39.\n\n246.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Burford does not meet the basic jurisdictional requirements under the ICSID Convention. Burford is not an investor in Argentina, nor is it a company organized in Spain that could invoke the Treaty relied upon by Claimants to institute this arbitration proceeding.315 Thus, allowing Burford to benefit from a dispute settlement mechanism authorized under the Treaty is contrary to the object and purpose of the latter, and would impermissibly bypass the limits of Argentina\u2019s and Spain\u2019s consent to arbitral jurisdiction.316\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 42.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter of October 26, 2011, at 9-10.\n\n**2. Position of Claimants**\n----------------------------\n\n247.\n\nClaimants contest Respondent\u2019s assertion that Claimants have purposefully concealed information from this Tribunal regarding the voluntary reorganizations. Claimants assert that they have disclosed in good faith all relevant facts during this arbitration proceeding, and that the allegedly \"concealed\" reorganizations have no bearing on this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Likewise, the Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement are irrelevant to the question of the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.317\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of June 30, 2011, at 10.\n\n248.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent\u2019s assertions are misplaced for the following reasons: (i) Claimants\u2019 standing to bring this arbitration is exclusively governed by the ICSID Convention and the Treaty; (ii) under the ICSID Convention, the Treaty and international law, the relevant date for the purposes of determining the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is the date of the institution of the proceedings; and (iii) both the Spanish reorganization proceedings and the Assignment Agreement post-date the institution of the proceedings.318\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of June 16, 2011, at 9-11.\n\n249.\n\nClaimants emphasize that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention defines \"national of another contracting state\" as \"any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute *on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration\"319* According to Claimants, this principle has been firmly established by ICSID tribunals, and moreover, is a firmly established rule in international adjudication.320\n\n*Id.* at 8 (emphasis added).\n\n*Id.* at 8-9.\n\n250.\n\nClaimants note that consent was perfected on November 20, 2008, that the Request for Arbitration was filed on December 11, 2008, and that registration of their Request by ICSID took place on January 30, 2009. No events between those dates would affect the Claimants\u2019 standing in these proceedings.321 Each of Respondent\u2019s allegations occurred after the institution of these proceedings, and is therefore irrelevant to the issue of jurisdiction. Specifically, the Assignment Agreement between Claimants and Air Comet was executed January 18, 2010. The Funding Agreement between Claimants and Burford took effect on April 14, 2010. Claimants\u2019 Spanish reorganization proceedings occurred starting in late December, 2010.\n\n*Id.* at 9.\n\n251.\n\nWith respect to Claimants\u2019 Spanish reorganization proceedings, Claimants note that these proceedings were voluntarily initiated, and that Claimants have kept the administration and disposition powers over their assets.322 Claimants assert that under Spanish law, they do not need the express authorization of their respective reorganization administrators to continue any arbitration proceedings, including the instant one before ICSID, unless they were to withdraw, to accept a counter-claim, or to settle the dispute.323 Nonetheless, their respective reorganization administrators have provided letters demonstrating their knowledge and acquiescence to continue this arbitration.324\n\n*Id.* at 14.\n\n*Id.* at 15.\n\n*Id.* at 15, Claimants\u2019 Letter of June 30, 2011, at 16.\n\n252.\n\nClaimants argue that their assignment of the rights of the net proceeds of this arbitration to Air Comet has no bearing on Claimants\u2019 standing to bring this arbitration. The Assignment Agreement is a valid transaction which remains in full force and effect. Even if the Assignment Agreement was declared null and void, such circumstance would not undermine Claimants\u2019 standing to bring the present claim against Argentina. Claimants\u2019 position as Argentina\u2019s creditor would remain unaltered, and Air Comet would be the only one affected by the declaration of nullity.325\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of June 30, 2011, at 11.\n\n253.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants argue that Respondent incorrectly characterizes the Air Comet assignment as an \"assignment of a claim.\" In fact, Claimants have executed an assignment of the rights to the net proceeds that may be obtained from an eventual award against Argentina. Claimants remain the legal holders of the claim against Argentina.326 Under the assignment, Air Comet is to receive any proceeds that may remain after deducting all payments.327\n\n*id*\n\n*Id.* at 11-12.\n\n254.\n\nFinally, with respect to the Burford Funding Agreement, Claimants submit that Burford is not a party to the arbitration. The Claimants did not sell or transfer the claim to Burford. Rather, Burford funds the arbitration in exchange for a percentage of the recovery in the case of a successful claim. Such financing agreements are frequently made, and Respondent has pointed to no investment award or decision finding third-party funding to be illegitimate, unlawful or inappropriate.328\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of June 30, 2011, at 5-7\n\n**3. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n**(a) Existence of Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nFirst, international case law has consistently determined that jurisdiction is generally to be assessed as of the date the case is filed:\n\n- The Court recalls that, according to its settled jurisprudence, its jurisdiction must be determined at the time that the act instituting proceedings was filed. Thus, if the Court has jurisdiction on the date the case is referred to it, it continues to do so regardless of subsequent events.329\n\n- [I]t is generally recognized that the determination of whether a party has standing in an international judicial forum, for purposes of jurisdiction to institute proceedings, is made by reference to the date on which such proceedings are deemed to have been instituted.... This is not only a principle of ICSID proceedings, it is an accepted principle of international adjudication that jurisdiction will be determined in the light of the situation as it existed on the date the proceedings were instituted. Events that take place before that date may affect jurisdiction; events that take place after that date do not. The ICJ developed cogent case law to this effect in the *Lockerbie* case. (...) The consequence of this rule is that, once established, jurisdiction cannot be defeated. It simply is not affected by subsequent events. Events occurring after the institution of proceedings (...) cannot withdraw the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the dispute.330\n\n*Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of Congo v. Belgium),* Judgment, February 14, 2002, I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 3, \u00b6 26, Ex. C-762.\n\n*Compania de Aguas del Aconquija SA. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Jurisdiction, November 14, 2005, \u00b6\u00b660, 61 and 63. *See also* Schreuer, The Icsid Convention: A Commentary, Ex. C-761 at 92 (\"It is an accepted principle of international adjudication that jurisdiction will be determined by reference to the date on which the judicial proceedings are instituted. This means that on that date all jurisdictional requirements must be met. It also means that events taking place after that date will not affect jurisdiction.\").\n\n256.\n\nSecond, to the extent that Respondent\u2019s standing argument is based on the assertion that Claimants transferred their rights or interests in this case to Burford after initiating this arbitration, this argument is unavailing. As Schreuer notes, \"ICSID Tribunals have applied [the principle that jurisdiction is determined as of the date of filing] consistently. In some cases the claimants had divested themselves of or had transferred the rights that had given rise to the dispute after the institution of proceedings. Tribunals have rejected the argument that, as a consequence, claimants in the proceedings were no longer the real parties in interest.\"331 In *CSOB* v. *Slovakia,* the claimant had, subsequently to filing the arbitration, assigned its arbitral claims against the respondent to a third party. The tribunal in *CSOB* held that it is generally recognized that the determination whether a party has standing in an international judicial forum for purposes of jurisdiction to institute proceedings is made by reference to the date on which such proceedings are deemed to have been instituted. Since the Claimant instituted these proceedings prior to the time when the two assignments were concluded, it follows that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear this case regardless of the legal effect, if any, the assignments might have had on Claimant\u2019s standing had they preceded the filing of the case.332\n\n*Id.* at 92.\n\n*See* *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, a.s. (CSOB) v. The Slovak Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4), Decision on Jurisdiction, May 24, 1999, at \u00b6 31 (hereinafter *\"CSOB v. Slovak Republic\u2019* \u2019), Exhibit C-539.\n\n257.\n\nThird, to the extent that Respondent\u2019s characterization of the Assignment Agreement as \"fraudulent\" implies that Claimants committed illegalities under Spanish law with respect to the performance of their investment, this argument is similarly unavailing. In *Hamester v. Ghana,* the respondent argued that claimant had committed illegalities in the performance of the investment.333 Like the Treaty, the BIT in *Hamester* required the investment to be legally acquired. However, the Tribunal found that *subsequent* illegality did not affect its jurisdiction over claimant\u2019s dispute.334\n\n*Gustav F.W. Hamester GmbH & Co. KG v. Republic of Ghana* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24), Award, June 18, 2010, at \u00b6 96 (hereinafter *\"Hamester v. Ghana\"),* LA AR 73.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 127 (\"The Tribunal considers that a distinction has to be drawn between (1) legality as at the *initiation* of the investment (\"made\") and (2) legality *during the performance* of the investment.... Legality in the subsequent life or performance of the investment is not addressed in Article 10. It follows that this does not bear upon the scope of application of the BIT (and hence this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction) - albeit that it may well be relevant in the context of the substantive merits of a claim brought under the BIT. Thus, on the wording of this BIT, the legality of the creation of the investment is a jurisdictional issue; the legality of the investor\u2019s conduct during the life of the investment is a merits issue. Therefore, in this first step of the analysis of the case relating to jurisdiction, the Tribunal is only concerned with allegations of fraud in the initiation of the investment, and not with the multiple allegations of fraudulent conduct during the life of the investment....\").\n\n258.\n\nRespondent has not countered these cases with any opposing case law, nor has it seriously sought to distinguish the facts in the current dispute. As a factual matter, Respondent does not contest Claimants\u2019 assertion that consent to this arbitration was perfected on November 20, 2008, that the Request for Arbitration was filed on December 11, 2008, and that registration took place on January 30, 2009. Nor does Respondent assert that any of the events it alludes to occurred prior to this time. Ordered chronologically, the subsequent events referred to by Respondent in its pleadings occurred as follows:\n\n\u2022 January 10, 2010: Assignment Agreement executed assigning potential proceedings of an award under this arbitration from Claimants to Air Comet\n\n\u2022 March 23, 2010: Reorganization proceedings of Air Comet commence\n\n\u2022 April 14, 2010: Funding Agreement executed between Burford and Claimants regarding the financing of this arbitration\n\n\u2022 April 24, 2010: Agreement executed between King & Spalding, counsel for Claimants, and Claimants\n\n\u2022 June 21, 2010: Agreement between Air Comet and its reorganization administrators\n\n\u2022 December 22, 2010: Spanish judge authorizes Air Comet\u2019s reorganization administrators to consent to the Burford Agreement\n\n\u2022 December 23, 2010: Reorganization proceedings of Teinver commence\n\n\u2022 January. 28, 2011: Reorganization proceedings of Autobuses commence\n\n\u2022 February 16, 2011: Reorganization proceedings of Cercanias commence\n\n259.\n\nBased on the fact that each of the allegations made by Respondent concerns an event\u2014the Claimants\u2019 reorganizations, the Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement\u2014that postdates the filing of the arbitration, the Tribunal finds this sufficient grounds to reject Respondents\u2019 objection. The Tribunal will not address Respondent\u2019s remaining allegations regarding the Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement as they concern Claimants\u2019 standing, without prejudice to further submissions by the Parties in respect of the Respondent\u2019s allegations in so far as they affect the merits of Claimants\u2019 claims, as appropriate, during the merits stage.\n\n**d. Third Jurisdictional Objection: Issues of State Attribution**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nIn their Memorial on the Merits, Claimants have asserted that the administration of Argentine President Nestor Kirchner was \"hostile towards Claimants\u2019 management of the Argentine Airlines and seemed driven by a desire to ultimately \"re-Argentinize\" the companies.\"335 Claimants assert that the administration took a number of measures that destabilized the legal and business environment surrounding Claimants\u2019 investment.336\n\nMerits \u00b6 164.\n\n*Id.*\n\n261.\n\nIn particular, Claimants highlight President Kirchner\u2019s appointment of Mr. Ricardo Cirielli as Undersecretary of Air Transportation. Claimants describe Mr. Cirielli as a powerful union leader who had a record\u2014both before and after his appointment\u2014of being openly critical of Claimants\u2019 management of the Argentine Airlines.337 Claimants assert, moreover, that during his appointment as Undersecretary of Air Transportation, Mr. Cirielli repeatedly lent his support to the unions and spoke out against airfare increases requested by the Argentine Airlines.\n\n*Id.*\n\n262.\n\nClaimants also assert that the Government of Argentina \"implicitly suppor[ed]\" strikes organized by the Argentine Aeronautical Technical Staff Association (\"APTA\") and the Argentine Airline Pilots Association (\"APLA\").338 Claimants point to a 9-day strike that was organized by APLA and APTA in November 2005. Claimants allege that this strike severely affected the Argentine Airlines generally and ARSA in particular, affecting around 95,000 passengers, causing nearly 380 flights to be suspended and causing a loss of approximately US$12 million to the Argentine Airlines.339\n\nMerits \u00b6 182.\n\n*Id.*\u00b6\u00b6 170-71, 184-190.\n\n**i. Position of Respondent**\n-----------------------------\n\n**ii. Position of Claimants**\n-----------------------------\n\n267.\n\nClaimants assert that questions of state attribution should be decided in the merits phase of this arbitration.352 Several investment law awards have held that whether state attribution is a question of jurisdiction or of merits is not clear-cut, and depends on the given case.353 Here, because the question of state attribution is closely intermingled with the merits, and because it requires an in-depth analysis of the complex relationships between certain acts and the state, it is appropriate to resolve these issues during the merits phase.354\n\nCM \u00b6 291.\n\nCM \u00b6\u00b6 291-293.\n\nCM \u00b6 298.\n\n268.\n\nIn the alternative, Claimants argue that the acts of the unions are attributable to Respondent. There is ample evidence that in various instances, APTA and APLA acted \"on the instructions or under the direction or control\" of Respondent.355 Respondent maintains that the acts of the unions can only be attributable to the GOA if the government exercised \"effective control\" over them. Some tribunals have, however, rejected this \"effective control\" test in favor of an \"overall control\" test, including the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the European Court of Human Rights.356 Claimants assert that there is ample evidence that Respondent exerted overall control over the unions, especially through Mr. Cirielli.357 By appointing Mr. Cirielli as Undersecretary of Air Transportation while allowing him to simultaneously retain a position as union leader, Respondent created the situation of control over the union.358 Respondent also, at least implicitly, supported strikes organized by APLA and APTA, including strikes in November 2005, September and October 2007, and January 2008, which caused the Argentine Airlines significant harm.359\n\nCM \u00b6 299.\n\nCM \u00b6\u00b6 299-300.\n\nCM \u00b6 301; Rej. \u00b6 314.\n\nRej. \u00b6 314.\n\n*Id.*\n\n269.\n\nClaimants assert that they do not currently seek to attribute to Respondent acts by Mr. Cirielli made prior to his appointment as Undersecretary.360 Claimants simply seek to demonstrate that the Argentine Government knowingly appointed and kept in office an Undersecretary of Air Transportation who had previously served as the Secretary General of the powerful APTA union and who was openly hostile to Claimants\u2019 management of the Argentine Airlines as an element of their allegations of unfair treatment under the Treaty at the hands of the Respondent.361 Moreover, Respondent does not dispute that the acts by Mr. Cirielli during his tenure as Undersecretary are attributable to Respondent.362 Citing Article 4 of the ILC Articles, Claimants assert that such acts are attributable to Respondent, even if they amount to an abuse of power.363\n\nRej. \u00b6 317.\n\nCM \u00b6 305; Rej. \u00b6 317.\n\nCM \u00b6 302.\n\nCM \u00b6 303.\n\n**iii. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent has not asserted that *none* of the acts alleged in Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits are attributable to the Argentine Government. Rather, Respondent\u2019s arguments in this regard concern only whether certain alleged acts committed by two Argentine labor unions and by the Argentine Undersecretary of Air Transportation may be attributed to the State.\n\n271.\n\nWhile Respondent asserts that substantial case law supports its position that the question of attribution is jurisdictional in nature,364 this case law also recognizes that not all questions of attribution are identical or involve an identical context. Case law on this subject *does* support the conclusion that matters of state attribution should be adjudicated at the jurisdictional stage when they represent a fairly cut-and-dry issue that will determine whether there is jurisdiction.\n\nMem. \u00b6 220.\n\n272.\n\nFor example, the issue before the *Maffezini* tribunal concerned the question whether the dispute between the claimant and respondent, a private commercial corporation established by the Spanish government, constituted an investor-State dispute under the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, or whether it merely constituted a private dispute. The *Maffezini* tribunal determined that the question whether the respondent could be considered a state entity was critical to whether the tribunal could take jurisdiction over the case.365 In *CSOB,* and also for purposes of determining whether the dispute constituted an investor-State dispute under Article 25, the tribunal had to determine whether the claimant was a private entity or subject to state control.366\n\n*Maffezini v. Spain,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 75. The tribunal noted that the issue of whether the private commercial corporation was a state entity for purposes of determining the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the tribunal was necessarily an issue to be decided at the jurisdictional stage of these proceedings. However, the tribunal noted that the issue of whether the actions and omissions complained of by the claimant were imputable to the State was an issue that \"bears on the merits of the dispute and can be finally resolved only at that stage.\" *Id.*\n\n*CSOB v. Slovak Republic,* Decision on Jurisdiction, at \u00b6 27. In *CSOB,* the respondent had argued that the claimant did not meet the requirement of Article 25(1) that a dispute must be between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. Specifically, the respondent had argued that the dispute was between two Contracting States because the claimant was purportedly a state agency of the Czech Republic rather than an independent commercial entity, and because the real party in interest to the dispute was the Czech Republic. The tribunal concluded, however, that the respondent failed to sustain its contention that the Centre lacked jurisdiction and the tribunal competence to hear the case on the ground that the claimant was acting as an agent of the State or discharging essentially governmental activities. *See also Homester v. Ghana,* Award, at \u00b6 141 (\"For a jurisdictional objection to prosper, it has to be such a definitive impediment that the Tribunal has no right to entertain, or enquire into, the dispute. If, for example, one takes the jurisdictional requirements *ratione personae* as set out in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, i.e. that the dispute is a legal dispute between a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention and investors of another Contracting State, the determinative criteria are clear and easily answered: the two Parties must respectively be a foreign investor from a Contracting State, and a Contracting State, for jurisdiction to exist. Here, as jurisdiction depends on the German/Ghana BIT, the Tribunal can deal with a dispute between the German company Hamester and the Republic of Ghana. In other words, if Hamester was not a German company, or if the case had been brought against a State other than Ghana, there would evidently have existed a clear jurisdictional objection. Not all issues, however, are so discrete or easily answered. Many\u2014as is the case with attribution\u2014entail more complex considerations, which could be characterized both as jurisdictional and relevant to the merits (and so to be considered only if the Tribunal has jurisdiction). Moreover, each of the alleged acts is closely connected to the question of whether Respondent has committed substantive violations of the BIT.\").\n\n273.\n\nHere it is not necessary for the Tribunal to attribute the acts of the unions and Mr. Cirielli to the Respondent in order for this Tribunal to have jurisdiction over the dispute. The Claimants allege actions by Argentine government institutions contrary to the Treaty, whose attribution to the Respondent is not in dispute. Moreover, the issue of the attribution of the acts by the unions and Mr. Cirielli is not clear-cut. As the tribunal in *Hamester* noted:\n\n[I]n many instances, questions of attribution and questions of legality are closely intermingled, and it is difficult to deal with the question of attribution without a full enquiry into the merits. In any event, whatever the qualification of the question of attribution, the Tribunal notes that, as a practical matter, this question is usually best dealt with at the merits stage, in order to allow for an in-depth analysis of all the parameters of the complex relationship between certain acts and the State... This approach \u2014 to deal with the question of attribution as a merits question \u2014 is particularly appropriate, in the Tribunal\u2019s view in this case. The Tribunal is not faced here with a situation where it is readily evident that the State is not involved at all, or where the issue is capable of an answer based upon a limited enquiry (akin to other jurisdictional issues).367\n\nRespondent argues, based on *Hamester,* that it is clear that Respondent is not involved at all with these alleged acts, and that this issue can be resolved on a preliminary basis. However, the issue is not as straight-forward as Respondent asserts.\n\n*Hamester v. Ghana,* Award, at \u00b6\u00b6 143-45.\n\n274.\n\nClaimants\u2019 assertions regarding the unions and Mr. Cirielli are closely connected to their allegation that Respondent has violated the Treaty. Both sets of assertions concern the difficult and fact-intensive question of whether the Argentine government tolerated or encouraged or otherwise supported the union activities in question. In the case of the unions, Claimants assert that Respondent\u2019s support of the unions was part of its broader goal to renationalize the Argentine Airlines.368 In the case of Mr. Cirielli, Claimants seek to demonstrate that Respondent knowingly appointed and kept in office an individual who was hostile to the Claimants\u2019 presence in Argentina.369 If the Tribunal were to resolve these issues at this jurisdictional stage, it would do so only on the basis of the Parties\u2019 arguments from their jurisdictional pleadings. The Tribunal would not have the benefit of the Parties\u2019 further pleadings on the merits or any further evidentiary submissions that may touch upon these issues. Given the fact-intensive nature of Claimants\u2019 allegations, the Tribunal must postpone adjudication of this issue until the merits phase. Consequently, Respondent\u2019s jurisdiction objection is rejected.\n\nCM \u00b6 301.\n\nCM \u00b6 305.\n\n275.\n\nGiven this conclusion, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to address in detail the substance of Respondent\u2019s arguments regarding attribution. The Tribunal does note, however, that Respondent has requested the Tribunal to expressly declare that the acts of labor unions are not attributable to the Argentine Republic under Articles 4 or 5 of the ILC Articles,370 which address, respectively, the conduct of organs of a State and of persons or entities that are empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of government authority. Claimants have responded to this request, arguing that they do not in fact maintain that the unions fall within Articles 4 or 5 of the ILC Articles. Rather, to Claimants, the issue is whether they fall within Article 8 of the ILC Articles,371 which concerns conduct of a person or group acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of a State. Because the two Parties agree that Article 8, and not Articles 4 or 5, would be relevant to the analysis of the unions\u2019 conduct,372 there is no need for this Tribunal to make any such declaration.373\n\nRep. **\u00b6** 257.\n\nRej. \u00b6 307\n\n*See also* Rep. \u00b6 256.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while the Parties agree that Article 8 of the ILC Articles applies to the unions\u2019 activities, they remain at odds over the proper interpretation of the term \"control\" as used in Article 8. As noted above, Respondent maintains that the rigorous standard of \"effective control,\" which has been used in *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua v. United States),* Merits, Judgment, *(\"Nicaragua Merits\")* I.C.J. Reports 1986, \u00b6 115, and *Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide* (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro), 2007 ICJ Reports 1, \u00b6 396 et seq. (February 26) (LA AR 75), and which is described in the ILC Commentary at Article 8, \u00b6 4, is the appropriate legal standard. Claimants maintain, instead, that the proper standard to be applied to the unions is the less rigorous standard of \"overall control,\" which has been used in *Prosecutor v. Dusko Tadic,* International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Case IT-94-1-A (1999), ILM, vol. 38, No. 6 (November 1999), p. 1518, at 1541, \u00b6 117 and p. 1546,\u00b6 145, Exhibit C-504; and *vaLoizidou v. Turkey,* Merits, ECHR, Judgment, December 18, 1996, \u00b6 56, Exhibit C-505.\n\n276.\n\nFinally, it should be clarified that both Parties agree that the current objection on the attribution of state acts refers to Mr. Cirielli\u2019s acts *before and after* his tenure as the Undersecretary of Air Transportation. While Claimants discuss Mr. Cirielli\u2019s acts *during* office in their pleadings,374 this issue was not within the scope of Respondent\u2019s original objection.375 Furthermore, Claimants assert that they do not seek to attribute liability to Respondent for Mr. Cirielli\u2019s pre-office acts.376 As such, the Parties do not appear to actually disagree on the issue of attribution as it concerns Mr. Cirielli\u2019s conduct before and after holding his office.377\n\nCM \u00b6 302.\n\nMem. \u00b6 228.\n\nCM \u00b6 304; Rej. \u00b6 317.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties appear to disagree on the legal standard applicable to Mr. Cirielli\u2019s conduct while in office. Claimants assert that ILC Article 4 is applicable to his acts (CM \u00b6 302, Rej. \u00b6 316), while Respondent suggests that Article 8 should apply (Rep. \u00b6 279). For the reasons indicated previously, and because Mr. Cirielli\u2019s conduct while in tenure of his position was not the subject of Respondent\u2019s objection, the Tribunal declines to address these arguments at this time.\n\n**e. Fourth Jurisdictional Objection: The Legality of Claimants\u2019 Investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**i. Position of Respondent**\n-----------------------------\n\n277.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s fourth and final objection, it asserts that Claimants\u2019 investment is not protected by the Treaty because of alleged illegalities connected to that investment. Specifically, Respondent asserts that Claimants, by certain actions taken with respect to their investment, have violated Spanish and Argentine law and have committed other misdeeds.\n\n***Alleged Violations of Spanish Law***\n---------------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nRespondent bases its allegations on a pending proceeding in Spain involving the directors of Air Comet. Respondent alleges that subject matters of the investigation have a direct impact on and relation to this arbitration.378\n\nRep. \u00b6 286.\n\n279.\n\nRespondent bases its allegations on facts alleged by the Office of the Attorney General in an ongoing Spanish court investigation of directors of SEPI and Air Comet, involving acts related to the 2001 Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") between SEPI and Air Comet.379 According to Respondent, the investigation concerns whether these actors were guilty of misappropriation of public funds, fraud or illegal exaction, document forgery, fraudulent use of process, and/or crimes against the federal treasury in connection with the SPA.380\n\nMem. \u00b6 254.\n\n*Id.*\n\n280.\n\nThe SPA, which provided for the transfer of SEPI\u2019s 99.2% shareholding in Interinvest to Air Comet, was approved by the Spanish Cabinet and was subsequently executed on October 2, 2001. As part of the SPA, SEPI sold to Air Comet S.A. its interest in Interinvest for US$ 1 dollar, while SEPI agreed to transfer $300 million to Interinvest to service ARSA\u2019s liabilities (in addition to transferring other funds to Air Comet).381 Respondent alleges that instead of complying with the terms of the SPA, Air Comet used the SEPI funds to buy the existing claims against ARSA, with Air Comet subrogated as a creditor.382\n\nRep. \u00b6 282.\n\nMem. \u00b6 257.\n\n281.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the defendants in this investigation purportedly have asserted that SEPI and Air Comet executed a supplemental private agreement, signed on October 15, 2001, in which the parties agreed that Air Comet would subrogate the claims as described above. However, the Spanish Office of the Attorney General believes this document may either be a false document created after its indicated date, or, to the extent it is an authentic document, it concerns conduct that deviates from that which was authorized in the SPA by the Spanish Cabinet.383\n\nMem. \u00b6 259.\n\n282.\n\nRespondent alleges that Air Comet committed tax fraud in connection with its subrogation of ARSA\u2019s debt claims. Respondent asserts that Air Comet failed to declare its subrogation for tax purposes, even though it created a taxable event under Spanish law when it acquired claims against ARSA.384 According to Respondent, several of the defendants in the proceeding have already made court statements and the State Agency of the Tax Administration has issued an expert report.385\n\nMem. \u00b6 261-262.\n\nMem. \u00b6 267.\n\n283.\n\nRespondent notes that the Spanish Central Court for Investigative Proceedings No. 6 of Madrid concluded on September 7, 2011 that the investigations in this proceeding allow the inference that Diaz Ferran, Pascual Arias and Mata Romayo were involved in conduct that could be \"presumably and initially qualified as a crime against the Treasury Department committed by Air Comet.\"386 Respondent also notes that the Prosecution of the Spanish National Court has requested a penalty of imprisonment for Mr. Diaz Ferran, Mr. Pascual Arias and Mr. Antonio Mata Ramayo, along with a joint compensation amounting to 99 million euros.387\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter of October 26, 2011, at 2, citing the September 7, 2011 Order of the Central Court for Investigation Proceedings No. 6 in Madrid, Ex. AR-172, at 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter of March 26, 2012, at 2, citing Annex I.\n\n284.\n\nIn addition to this investigation, Respondent notes a number of \"new developments\" as of March 26, 2012 in pending Spanish criminal proceedings that directly involve Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias.388\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s Letter of March 26, 2012.\n\n285.\n\nFirst, Respondent notes that the Central Court for Investigation Proceedings No. 1 of Madrid admitted a criminal investigation proceeding on February 2, 2012 against Mr. Diaz Ferran, Mr. Pascual Arias and Mr. Ivan Losada (administrator of Teinver S.L.) in connection with their management of Viajes Marsans.389\n\n*Id.* at 3, *see also* Annex II.\n\n286.\n\nSecond, Respondent notes that Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias are being investigated in another proceeding by the Spanish National Court in connection with the potential commission of procedural fraud. According to Respondent, the two men allegedly submitted false documentation to a judge in order to obtain an unfair judicial resolution.390\n\n*Id.* at 5; *see also* Annexes IV and V.\n\n287.\n\nThird, Respondent notes that one of the Marsans Group\u2019s creditors has brought a criminal action against Mr. Diaz Ferran, Mr. Pascual Arias, Mr. Ivan Losada and Mr. Angel de Cabo in the Court for Investigation Proceedings No. 8 of Madrid, concerning their actions with respect to insolvency proceedings. According to Respondent, Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias sold their companies to Possibilitum Business, controlled by Mr. de Cabo, which had engaged in illegal activities in the course of reorganization proceedings.391\n\n*Id.* at 6.\n\n288.\n\nFourth, Respondent points to a proceeding pending before Commercial Court No. 12 of Madrid, and notes that the Province of Madrid\u2019s Prosecutor (Economic Crimes Section) has requested the court that Mr. Diaz Ferran, Mr. Pascual Arias and Possibilitum Business be declared guilty with respect to acts taken as the *de facto* and *de jure* administrators in the reorganization of Viajes Marsans S.A., Viajes Crisol S.A.U., Rural Tours S.A.U. and Tiempo Libre S.A.U.392\n\n*Id.* at 6-8; see also Annex VII.\n\n289.\n\nFifth, Respondent notes that the Commercial Court No. 9 of Madrid found Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias \"guilty of the bankruptcy of Seguros Mercurio S.A.\"393 Respondent notes that the court also found Teinver and other Marsans Group companies \"liable as accomplices to the bankruptcy.\"394 Specifically, Teinver and the other companies directly took part in transactions, particularly in 2008 and 2009, intended to fraudulently remove assets owned by Seguros Mercurio.395\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter of May 24, 2012, at 1.\n\n*Id.* at 1-2.\n\n*Id.* at 2.\n\n***Alleged Violations of Arsentine Law***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nRespondent notes that Air Comet was engaged in \"irregular and fraudulent behavior\" during the course of ARSA\u2019s reorganization proceedings.396 Respondent asserts that during the reorganization proceedings, Air Comet was both the controlling company of the airline *and* its main creditor, thereby acting in an impermissible double role under Argentine law.397\n\nMem. \u00b6 269; Rep. \u00b6 309.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 270-271.\n\n291.\n\nRespondent also notes that a criminal investigation has been filed in the Argentine courts against Antonio Mata Ramayo, Diaz Ferran, Pascual Arias and others, as directors of ARSA, regarding the \"fraudulent administration\" of the company.398 The investigation comprises several components. First, and similar to the Spanish investigation above, the subjects of investigation have been charged with causing Air Comet\u2019s fraudulent diversion of SEPI funds intended to settle ARSA\u2019s liabilities.399 Second, the investigation concerns ARSA\u2019s December 31, 2001 balance sheet, which allegedly included bogus entries regarding SEPI\u2019s alleged capital contribution of ARS 1,238 million in 2001. Respondent asserts that these bogus entries resulted in the dilution of the Argentine State\u2019s shares in the airlines, reducing its participation below the minimum legal threshold for active participation as a shareholder.400 Third, the investigation concerns possible crimes committed by Mr. Mata and others in relation to Air Comet\u2019s subrogation of claims previously held by third-party creditors. Allegedly, Air Comet re-assigned these claims to another company, Royal Romana Playa S.A., for valuable consideration, allowing the latter to cast a vote in ARSA\u2019s reorganization plan.401\n\nMem. \u00b6 272; *see also* RA 168.\n\nMem. \u00b6 274.\n\nMem. \u00b6 275; Rep. \u00b6 319.\n\nMem. \u00b6 276.\n\n292.\n\nFinally, Respondent asserts that it is irrelevant that the Commercial Court of Buenos Aires ended ARSA\u2019s reorganization proceedings on June 17, 2011.402 The termination of those proceedings does not demonstrate that Claimants committed no illegalities with respect to ARSA\u2019s reorganization, and indeed, the criminal investigations in Spain and Argentina are ongoing with respect to Claimants\u2019 fraudulent conduct and irregularities in connection with ARSA.403\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter of October 26, 2011, at 3.\n\n*Id.,* at 1-2.\n\n***Other Alleged Misdeeds***\n----------------------------\n\n293.\n\nRespondent also points to a number of \"issues\" with the business management of the Grupo Marsans and of the Argentine Airlines. Respondent characterizes Marsans\u2019 management worldwide as \"deplorable,\" noting that Air Comet\u2019s operations halted in 2009, that a number of writs of attachment have been issued against Marsans\u2019 owners, Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias, that other legal suits that have been brought against certain Marsans affiliates, and that certain Marsans affiliates are undergoing reorganization.404 Respondent also notes \"accounting irregularities\" in the Argentine Airlines, including the commingling of assets.405***The Relevant Inquiry of Legality for Purposes of Jurisdiction***\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 279-307; Rep. \u00b6 305-308.\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 308, 312.\n\n294.\n\nRespondent asserts that the Treaty only protects investments that were made and carried out in accordance with the laws of the host state.406 The purpose of Article 1(2), which defines \"investments,\" is to prevent the Treaty from protecting investments that should not be protected.407 Moreover, there is consensus within international investment law that fraud is prohibited according to good practices and international public policy.408\n\nMem. \u00b6 319.\n\nMem. \u00b6 322.\n\nMem. \u00b6 325.\n\n295.\n\nRespondent does not believe that the jurisdictional issue solely concerns whether the investments were *made* in accordance with Argentine law; this interpretation leads to results contrary to the object and purpose of the Treaty.409 If the investment\u2019s *inception* was the only relevant criterion at the jurisdictional stage, this would lead to an absurd situation in which transactions that were made legally, but were followed by \"an everlasting series of illegal acts\" following their creation, nonetheless still benefit from the Treaty\u2019s protections.410 Moreover, it would be necessary to consider the time at which each investment was made, which would be infeasible in most disputes in which there are numerous investment transactions involved.411\n\nRep. \u00b6\u00b6 347-48, 356.\n\nRep. \u00b6 356.\n\nRep. \u00b6 363.\n\n296.\n\nRespondent asserts that even if the jurisdictional test is limited to the time of the investment\u2019s inception (here, the acquisition by Air Comet of Interinvest), the Tribunal is not limited to assessing only the formal act of executing the SPA.412 Rather, the Tribunal must take account of the whole complex transaction leading to the \"inception\" of the investment, which includes both the execution of the SPA and the breach of or compliance with its terms.413\n\nRep. \u00b6 365-66.\n\n*Id.*\n\n297.\n\nFinally, Respondent notes that even though this Tribunal is not bound by the conclusions made by local authorities, they may be of \"substantial assistance\" for the Tribunal to determine the legality of Claimants\u2019 investments.414 Furthermore, the \"presumption of innocence\" criminal law standard cannot be imputed into the context of international investment law, as Claimants have argued.415\n\nRep. \u00b6\u00b6 369-71.\n\nRep. \u00b6\u00b6 374-75, citing CM \u00b6 331.\n\n***Good Faith***\n----------------\n\n298.\n\nAs a final argument, Respondent asserts that an investment that \"deliberately runs afoul of the law of the state\" cannot be considered to have been made in good faith.416 Respondent points to Claimants\u2019 alleged breach of good faith in Air Comet\u2019s subrogation of ARSA\u2019s creditors\u2019 claims and in Air Comet\u2019s failure to declare this subrogation to the Spanish authorities due to its character as a taxable event417 Respondent also accuses the Grupo Marsans of ignoring good faith principles \"in multiple jurisdictions.\"418\n\nMem. \u00b6\u00b6 338, 340.\n\nMem. \u00b6 342.\n\nMem. \u00b6 345.\n\n**ii. Position of Claimants**\n-----------------------------\n\n299.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent has failed to establish that Claimants\u2019 investments do not conform to Argentine or Spanish law. According to Claimants, Respondent\u2019s allegations of illegality are \"meritless.\"419 The mere existence of investigations in Spain and Argentina regarding Claimants\u2019 investments does not provide grounds for the Tribunal to deny jurisdiction.420 Moreover, Respondent fails to demonstrate how the issues at play in the Spanish investigation would render Claimants\u2019 acquisition of its investment illegal under Argentine law.421 Claimants assert that, in any event, the Treaty only requires that the investment be in conformity with the host State\u2019s law at the time of the initiation of the investment, which it did.\n\n\u00b6 316; *see also* Claimant\u2019s Letter of April 4, 2012.\n\nCM \u00b6\u00b6 317, 319.\n\nCM \u00b6 318\n\n***Alleged Violations of Spanish Law***\n---------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Spanish legal investigations are not relevant to the jurisdictional inquiry because they do not concern Claimants\u2019 *acquisition* of their participation in the Argentine Arlines. Respondent has not claimed that Claimants made their acquisition through, for example, an act of corruption or fraud.422 Instead, the Spanish investigations concern 1) whether, in the performance of the SPA, SEPI should have requested prior consent of the Spanish Cabinet before allowing Air Comet to subrogate the rights of ARSA creditors,423 and 2) whether Air Comet should have considered the acquisition of those credits for purposes of corporate income tax.424\n\nCM \u00b6 342.\n\nCM \u00b6 343.\n\nCM \u00b6 345.\n\n301.\n\nMoreover, Claimants assert that Air Comet properly used the funds provided by SEPI,425 and it did so with SEPI\u2019s consent426 Claimants state that Respondent is also mistaken in its allegation that Air Comet gratuitously increased its patrimony with SEPI funds while failing to add them to its asset base for Spanish corporate tax purposes. Those credits against ARSA never actually entered into Air Comet\u2019s patrimony. Air Comet acted in accordance with the SPA and the December 2001 Agreement in using SEPI\u2019s funds in direct benefit of ARSA\u2019s shareholder (Interinvest), which in return capitalized the credits, increasing its stockholding in ARSA and reducing the airline\u2019s debt.427\n\nCM \u00b6 322; CM \u00b6 340.\n\nCM \u00b6 344.\n\nCM \u00b6 345.\n\n302.\n\nClaimants argue that the \"mere existence\" of the investigations and court proceedings in Spain and Argentina is insufficient to demonstrate an illegality.428 Claimants note that even if a Spanish or Argentine court was to render a decision finding that Claimants had breached domestic law when making their investments, such a decision would not be binding on this Tribunal.429 Respondent must prove its allegations of illegality before this Tribunal.\n\nCM \u00b6 331.\n\nCM \u00b6 332.\n\n303.\n\nMore specifically, Claimants disagree with Respondent regarding the contents of the September 7, 2011 Spanish court order. Claimants assert that the order did *not* make a final determination that crimes had been committed.430 Rather, the court decided to continue with its investigation based on its finding that a crime may have been committed against the Spanish Treasury with respect to Air Comet\u2019s Spanish corporate income tax for 2002.431 In that same order, however, the court also ordered the dismissal of every other accusation against Air Comet and the other individuals, including Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias, which included the crimes of falsification, unlawful exaction, procedural fraud, and misappropriation of public funds.432 With respect to the alleged crimes against the Spanish Treasury, there has been no decision on the preliminary investigation.433\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of November 8, 2011, at 3.\n\n*Id.* at 4.\n\n*Id.* at 5.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of April 4, 2012, at 3.\n\n304.\n\nAccording to Claimants, even assuming that Respondent had provided sufficient legal and factual elements for the Tribunal to find a violation of Spanish law, it fails to demonstrate how such breaches of Spanish law could amount to breaches under Argentine law, which is the only standard under the Treaty (Art. 1(2)).434\n\nCM \u00b6 348.\n\n305.\n\nWith respect to the \"new developments\" alleged by Respondent, Claimants assert that these developments have no bearing on either the inception of Claimants\u2019 investment or on Argentine law, and that in any case, these developments consist of \"mere allegations.\"435\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of April 4, 2012, at 2.\n\n306.\n\nFirst, with respect to the proceedings at the Central Court for Investigation Proceedings No.l of Madrid regarding the alleged embezzlement by Mr. Diaz Ferran, Mr. Pascual Arias and Mr. Ivan Losada, Claimants assert that these proceedings are totally unrelated to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and to the subject matter of the arbitration436\n\n*Id.* at 3.\n\n307.\n\nSecond, with respect to the procedural fraud claims, Claimants deny the validity of the claims as well as Respondent\u2019s purportedly unsupported conclusions.437\n\n*Id.* at 4.\n\n308.\n\nThird, with respect to the investigation concerning the legality of operations within the reorganization proceedings pending before the Court for Investigation Proceedings No. 8 of Madrid, Claimants assert that neither the claims nor the reorganizations themselves have any bearing on the present arbitration.438\n\n*Id.*\n\n309.\n\nFourth, concerning the reorganization proceeding pending before Commercial Court No. 12 of Madrid, Claimants assert that this proceeding is irrelevant to the present arbitration. Moreover, the Prosecutor\u2019s petition has been opposed by the interested parties and no decision has yet been issued439**.**\n\nFifth, Claimants address the Commercial Court No. 9 of Madrid\u2019s findings that Gerardo Diaz Ferran and Gonzalo Pascual Arias were \"guilty of the bankruptcy of Seguros Mercurio, S.A.\" and that Teinver and other Marsans Group companies were liable as accomplices. Claimants assert that the bankruptcy of Seguros Mercurio S.A. is \"unrelated to Claimants\u2019 second request for provisional measures, the jurisdiction of this tribunal, or even the subject matter of these proceedings.\"440 Moreover, the Court\u2019s May 11, 2012 decision is not final, and Claimants understand that such appeal will be filed in due course.441\n\n*Id.*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of June 1, 2012, at 2.\n\n*Id.* at 2.\n\n***Alleged Violations of Argentine Law***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nClaimants assert that Argentine investigations into fraudulent management are groundless. First, Claimants state that the funds obtained from SEPI were properly used and directly or indirectly resulted in a benefit to ARSA and AUSA.442 Second, Claimants note that Respondent did not disapprove of ARSA\u2019s 2001 balance sheets, and that Respondent\u2019s participation levels shrank after it failed to make the necessary contributions to maintain its participation at prior levels443 Claimants note that the Argentine proceedings remain at the preliminary investigation stage444\n\nCM \u00b6 322.\n\nCM \u00b6 321.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of June 30, 2011, 18-19.\n\n311.\n\nClaimants also assert that Air Comet fully complied with the Argentine Bankruptcy Law with respect to the reorganization of ARSA.445 The majority of ARSA\u2019s trustees approved the settlement agreement between ARSA and its creditors, and this settlement was subsequently approved by the responsible Argentine court446 Furthermore, the Commercial Court of Buenos Aires ended ARSA\u2019s reorganization proceedings on June 17, 2011. The court made no finding that Claimants, Air Comet or Interinvest had committed irregularities or illegalities during the reorganization. This decision therefore confirms that Respondent\u2019s accusations of \"irregularities\" in the context of ARSA\u2019s reorganization are groundless.447***Other Alleged Misdeeds***\n\nCM \u00b6 351.\n\nCM \u00b6\u00b6 352, 355.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter of August 30, 2011, at 1.\n\n312.\n\nClaimants respond that Respondent has failed to demonstrate the relevance of the bankruptcy proceedings or of the other circumstances surrounding Grupo Marsans\u2019 financial difficulties448 Furthermore, Claimants assert that it was Respondent\u2019s own failure to grant prompt and adequate compensation and to observe its commitments that severely impacted Claimants\u2019 group of companies.449\n\nCM \u00b6 365.\n\nCM \u00b6\u00b6 366-67.\n\n***The Relevant Inquiry of Legality for Purposes of Jurisdiction***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nClaimants assert that the Treaty only requires that the investment conform to law of the host State at the time it was \"acquired or effected.\"450 In other words, the analysis of the Tribunal at this stage must focus on the initiation of the investment. This assertion is also confirmed by relevant case law.451 Claimants note that Respondent has not denied that Air Comet prevailed at the SEPI auction and legally acquired 99.2% shares of Interinvest, and that the SPA is a legal and binding agreement under Spanish law.452\n\nCM \u00b6 371.\n\nRej. \u00b6 324.\n\nCM \u00b6 371; *see also* CM \u00b6 313.\n\n314.\n\nRespondent\u2019s allegations refer only to the performance, rather than the inception, of Claimants\u2019 investment.453 But Respondent has failed to provide any authority in support of its assertion that an investment must conform to the host state\u2019s law throughout the course of its operation and not just at the time of its commencement in order for it to fall within the protection of the Treaty. If such a requirement existed, almost any investment could be disqualified from Treaty coverage by pointing to technical violations of local law in the operation of the investment.454 Furthermore, as described above, Respondent has failed to substantiate its allegations on non-performance.455***Good Faith***\n\nCM \u00b6 374; *see also* CM \u00b6 314.\n\nCM \u00b6 374.\n\nRej. \u00b6 328.\n\n315.\n\nClaimants assert that Respondent has not provided evidence that Claimants acted in bad faith at the time of making the investment (or later)456 Unlike the case law cited by Respondent, there is no evidence of fraud on the part of Claimants at the time of the making of their investment, nor is there evidence that Claimants have attempted to gain access to an ICSID arbitration procedure to which they would not otherwise have been entitled.457 Respondent has simply repeated certain allegations such as the allegation that Air Comet purportedly committed tax fraud under Spanish law in its acquisition of liabilities of ARSA.458\n\nCM \u00b6 375.\n\nCM \u00b6 378.\n\n*Id.*\n\n**iii. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nThe Parties disagree on two initial legal issues regarding the above allegations. First, they disagree over whether, under the Treaty and international investment law, *all* illegalities committed by investors in connection with an investment can deprive the investor of protection under the Treaty, or only illegalities that are related to the inception of the investment. Second, the Parties disagree on whether, as a factual matter, the illegalities alleged to have been committed by the Claimants occurred at the \"inception\" of the investment or at a subsequent time.\n\n**1. Timing of the Alleged Illegality**\n---------------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nAs Respondent notes, it is widely acknowledged in investment law that the protections of the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism should not extend to investments made illegally. As noted recently by the tribunal in *Hamester v. Ghana,*\n\nAn investment will not be protected if it has been created in violation of national or international principles of good faith; by way of corruption, fraud, or deceitful conduct; or if its creation itself constitutes a misuse of the system of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention. It will also not be protected if it is made in violation of the host State\u2019s law (as elaborated, *e.g.* by the tribunal in *Phoenix)459*\n\n*Hamester v. Ghana,* Award.\u00b6 123.\n\n318.\n\nHowever, as the Treaty itself makes clear, the critical time period for determining an investment\u2019s legality is the time the investment was made. Articles 1(2), II and III(l) of the Treaty address qualifying investments made by investors. Article 1(2) defines \"investments\" as follows:\n\nThe term \"investments\" shall mean any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind, *acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment[.]* (emphasis added)\n\nThe application of ordinary meaning of Article 1(2) to the Claimants is perfectly straightforward: in order to qualify as an \"investment\" under the Treaty, Claimants\u2019 investments must have been acquired or effected in accordance with Argentine law, the country receiving the investment. In other words, the relevant inquiry is whether Claimants\u2019 entry into the investment, here its acquisition of shares in Interinvest through Air Comet, is legal.\n\n319.\n\nOther provisions of the Treaty support this interpretation. Article 11(1), which concerns the promotion and acceptance of investments, states that \"[e]ach Party shall encourage, to the extent possible, investments *made* in its territory by investors of the other Party and shall accept those investments in accordance with its legislation.\" (emphasis added) Article III(l), which addresses the protection of investments, requires each party to \"protect within its territory investments *made, in accordance with its legislation,* or the investors of the other Party[\u2026]\" (emphasis added).\n\n320.\n\nCase law addressing BITs with similar language also supports this interpretation. The Germany-Ghana BIT at issue in *Hamester* contained similar language to the Treaty, and the tribunal ruled that only the inception of the investment was relevant for its jurisdictional inquiry:\n\nThe Tribunal considers that a distinction has to be drawn between (1) legality as at the *initiation* of the investment (\"made\") and (2) legality *during the performance* of the investment. Article 10 legislates for the scope of application of the BIT, but conditions this only by reference to legality at the initiation of the investment. Hence, only this issue bears upon this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Legality in the subsequent life or performance of the investment is not addressed in Article 10. It follows that this does not bear upon the scope of application of the BIT (and hence this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction) - albeit that it may well be relevant in the context of the substantive merits of a claim brought under the BIT. Thus, on the wording of this BIT, the legality of the creation of the investment is a jurisdictional issue; the legality of the investor\u2019s conduct during the life of the investment is a merits issue.460\n\n*Hamester v. Ghana,* Award, at \u00b6 127 (emphasis added).\n\n321.\n\nSimilarly in *Fraport,* the respondent in that dispute had asserted that in order for the claimant to maintain jurisdictional standing under the Germany-Philippines BIT, the investment must not only be in accordance with the domestic law at the commencement of the investment but must also continually remain in compliance with the domestic law. While the tribunal ultimately agreed with the respondent that the investment was illegally *acquired,*461 the tribunal rejected the respondent\u2019s interpretation regarding the *continuation* of the investment. It noted,\n\nThe language of both Articles 1 and 2 of the BIT emphasizes the initiation of the investment. Moreover the effective operation of the BIT regime would appear to require that jurisdictional compliance be limited to the initiation of the investment. If, at the time of the initiation of the investment, there has been compliance with the law of the host state, allegations by the host state of violations of its law in the course of the investment, as a justification for state action with respect to the investment, might be a defense to claimed substantive violations of the BIT, but could not deprive a tribunal acting under the authority of the BIT of its jurisdiction462\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25), Award, August 16, 2007 (hereinafter *\"Fraport v. Philippines\"),* LA AR 84. This award was subsequently annulled, but the annulment decision was based on different grounds. *See Fraport v. Philippines,* Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010, LA AR 145.\n\n*Fraport v. Philippines,* 2007 Award at \u00b6 345.\n\n322.\n\nEven in *Inceysa,* a case in which the tribunal determined that the claimants had committed numerous fraudulent acts, the tribunal\u2019s inquiry was directed towards the *inception* of the investment: \"[T]he foreign investor cannot seek to benefit from an investment *effectuated* by means of one or several illegal acts and, consequently, enjoy the protection granted by the host state, such as access to international arbitration to resolve disputes, because it is evident that *its act had a fraudulent origin* and, as provided by the legal maxim, \"nobody can benefit from his own fraud.\"463 All of the *Inceysa* tribunal\u2019s factual findings of fraud concerned the inception of the investment, including the claimant\u2019s presentation of false information as part of its bid tender, false representations made during the bidding process, false documents submitted as part of its bid, and a hidden relationship with another bidder in contravention of the bidding rules464\n\n*Inceysa v. El Salvador,* Award, at \u00b6 242 (emphasis added).\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 236.\n\n323.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that the relevant law for purposes of determining whether the investment was legally made is the law of the host State. Several of Respondent\u2019s arguments concern allegations of illegality under *Spanish* law. In support of these arguments, Respondent asserts that \"the general principles that endorse the non-protection of illegal investments or investments made in bad faith... are not limited to the law of the host State, but also to the laws of other countries that may be involved.\"465 Once again, however, Article 1(2) of the Treaty, which refers to investments \"acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of *the country receiving the investment,\"* makes clear that the relevant law for this issue is the legislation of Argentina.\n\nMem. \u00b6 340.\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Alleged Illegalities**\n--------------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nRespondent has failed to demonstrate that Claimants, as a factual matter, committed illegalities in the process of *acquiring* their investment in the Argentine Airlines. In this respect, the onus is on Respondent. While Claimants must make a *prima facie* showing that their investment comes within the protections of the Treaty,466 Respondent has not, with this objection, raised any issue of fact to counter Claimants\u2019 showing.467\n\n*See, e.g.,* *Salini v. Jordan,* Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 151 (\"In conformity with [substantial] jurisprudence, the Tribunal will accordingly seek to determine whether the facts alleged by the Claimant in this case, if established, are capable of coming within those provisions of the BIT which have been invoked.\").\n\nA number of tribunals have held that a respondent bears the burden of proof with respect to the facts alleged in its jurisdictional objections. *See, e.g., Rompetrol Group N. V. v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3), Decision on Jurisdiction, April 18, 2008,\u00a0\u00b6 75, Exhibit C-523. (\"It will be seen that the jurisdictional objection entails issues of fact (whether the investments were and are under Mr. Patriciu\u2019s dominant control; whether the origin of the investment funds was Romanian), and issues of law (what effect such factual circumstances would have on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to hear a complaint by the investor). The issues of fact are ones which the Respondent bears the burden of proving according to the requisite standard, in order to sustain the claims of law it bases on them. The Parties are in dispute over both the issues of fact and the issues of law.\"); *Desert Line Projects LLC v. The Republic of Yemen* (ICSID Case No. ARB05/17), Award, February 6, 2008, \u00b6 105 (LA AR 83) (\"the Respondent has not come close to satisfying the Arbitral Tribunal that the Claimant made an investment which was either inconsistent with Yemeni laws or regulations or failed to achieve acceptance by the Respondent.\"); *Hamester v. Ghana,* Award at \u00b6 132 (\"Having carefully considered all the evidence, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not fully discharged its burden of proof\u2019 with respect to respondent\u2019s allegation of illegality in the inception of the investment).\n\n325.\n\nAs Claimants note, Respondent has not denied that Air Comet prevailed at the SEPI auction and legally acquired 99.2% shares of Interinvest, and that the SPA is a legal and binding agreement under Spanish law.468 Instead, Respondent relies on the argument that account must be taken of the whole complex transaction leading to the \"inception\" of the investment\u2014i.e., the SPA and its \"related legal acts, including the breach of or compliance with its terms.\"469\n\nCM \u00b6 313.\n\nRep. \u00b6\u00b6 365-366.\n\n326.\n\nHowever, Respondent\u2019s reliance on the whole of the SPA \"transaction\" is misplaced. The SPA is a contract between SEPI and Air Comet to effectuate an exchange of benefits, liabilities and obligations. Some of the commitments made by the parties relate to the transfer of share ownership in Interinvest.470 However, the SPA\u2019s other commitments concern not only SEPI\u2019s assumption of liabilities and other economic commitments of the Argentine Airlines, but also obligations as diverse as management structures, the size of the Argentine Airlines\u2019 aircraft fleet, the air routes to be taken by the Argentine Airlines, and employee headcount.471 Each of these commitments, whether they are related to the transfer of shares or not, represents a promise to perform *once the contract has been executed.* As such, any question of whether either party has complied with or breached any of these terms of the SPA is a question of *performance.* Any breach that occurs later does not retroactively invalidate, render illegal or otherwise undermine the integrity or binding nature of the SPA itself; rather, it triggers a party\u2019s legal liability under the SPA.\n\nEx. C-18, \u00a7\u00a7 1-6.\n\n*See* Ex. C-18, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 9.\n\n327.\n\nAs discussed above, the relevant jurisdictional inquiry is whether Claimants acquired or made their investment in compliance with Argentine law. Here, Claimants *made* their investment by entering into the SPA. There is no evidence on the record that Claimants failed to comply with any Argentine laws or committed any illegalities in *entering* SPA. No evidence suggests that either Claimants or SEPI were not authorized to sign the agreement, that Claimants committed fraud or made a critical omission in how they represented themselves during the bidding process, or that Claimants engaged in any corruption or failure to comply with bidding or other procurement requirements.\n\n328.\n\nConsequently, this Tribunal finds that each of Respondent\u2019s allegations concerns either Claimants\u2019 performance under the SPA (i.e., Claimants\u2019 subrogation of ARSA\u2019s creditors\u2019 claims) or other events subsequent to the acquisition of their investment. Respondent\u2019s allegations regarding whether Claimants wrongly approved of ARSA\u2019s 2001 balance sheets, whether Claimants\u2019 role in ARSA\u2019s reorganization violated Argentine law, and whether the Marsans Group \"deplorably managed\" its investments, are all issues arising *subsequently* to Claimants\u2019 acquisition of their investment.\n\n**3. Claimants\u2019 Alleged Lack of Good Faith**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nAs a final argument, Respondent asserts that Claimants breached good faith principles when Air Comet subrogated ARSA\u2019s creditors\u2019 claims and when it failed to declare this subrogation to the responsible tax authorities.472 Respondent also generally accuses Grupo Marsans of ignoring good faith principles \"in multiple jurisdictions.\"473\n\nMem. \u00b6 342.\n\nMem. \u00b6 345.\n\n330.\n\nNone of these alleged acts relate to the *acquisition* of Claimants\u2019 investment, but rather post-date the making of the investment. Moreover, the cases cited by Respondent held that the relevant inquiry for whether an investment breaches good faith principles is determined with respect to the *acquisition* of their investment. In *Inceysa,* the case upon which Respondent principally relies, the tribunal found that the claimant\u2019s numerous fraudulent representations violated the fundamental rules of the bidding process and constituted a breach of good faith474 Unlike the present case, *Inceysa* concerned the claimant\u2019s acts with respect to the *acquisition* of its investment. Likewise, in *Phoenix,* the tribunal found that the claimants had made no actual \"economic investment\" but rather \"simply a rearrangement of assets within a family to gain access to ICSID jurisdiction to which the initial investor was not entitled.\"475*Phoenix* is simply not on point to the circumstances of the present dispute. Therefore, Respondent has failed to demonstrate that Claimants did not act in good faith in acquiring their investment.\n\n*Inceysa v. El Salvador,* Award, at \u00b6\u00b6 236-37.\n\n*Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5), Award, 15 April 2009, LA AR 85, at \u00b6 140.\n\n331.\n\nIn conclusion, for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal rejects Respondent\u2019s fourth objection. The Tribunal notes that certain of the allegations raised under this objection may affect the merits of the claim and that it will be open to the Parties to make further submissions in respect of these allegations as appropriate during the merits stage of the Arbitration.\n\n**V. Costs**\n------------\n\n332.\n\nBoth Parties have requested the Tribunal to order costs and fees, plus interest, against the opposing Party. The Tribunal reserves this question for subsequent adjudication.\n\n**VI. Decision on Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal declares that:\n\n1) The Objections to Jurisdiction are rejected;\n\n2) It joins to the merits the determination of Respondent\u2019s responsibility for the acts of nonstate entities."}, {"Title": "Decision on Provisional Measures", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2016-04-08T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Dr. Kamal Hossain", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Dr. Kamal Hossain\n---------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nAlthough I respect my distinguished colleagues, and I agree with the decision to the extent that in the operative part in paragraph 239(a), it directs \"the Respondent to refrain from publicizing the Complaints or the criminal investigation and any relation they may have to this arbitration, whether by communications to the press or otherwise\", I am compelled to give my dissenting opinion for the reasons elaborated below.\n\n2.\n\nI do not agree that at this late stage we need to defer a \"decision in respect of the Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures as it relates to the suspension of the criminal proceedings in regard of counsel for the Claimants and the Claimants' court-appointed receivers, with liberty to the Claimants to bring this Application back before the Tribunal in this respect should it become necessary\". I also do not agree that we need again to \"remind(s) the Parties that they are obligated to refrain from aggravating the dispute\", having done so on previous occasions.\n\n3.\n\nMy main disagreement with my colleagues, however, centres around setting out of contentious factual positions, which are not necessary for the order made. In my view it is inappropriate to set out these contentious issues in the decision on provisional measures, as these convey the erroneous impression that these issues may be treated as settled. This would, in my view, be unacceptable, as it would amount to determining issues which are to be determined in the final award.\n\n4.\n\nMy objections relate to some preliminary but fundamental unresolved issues which are to be dealt with in the award on the merits upon consideration of the evidence on record, such as\n\n- Who are the Claimants?\n\n- How and when did the Claimants invest in the Argentine Republic?\n\n- What is the \"investment\" made by the Claimants?\n\n- Does King and Spalding have a valid Power of Attorney ?\n\n5.\n\nParagraphs 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27 and 29 of the decision on provisional measures refer to the \"Claimants\" although the issue regarding the identity of the Claimants is still unresolved and is to be determined in the final award on the merits. I am, therefore, of the view that as this issue is still unresolved, an impression to the contrary should not be conveyed by the reference to \"Claimants\" (without any qualification) in the paragraphs referred to above.\n\n6.\n\nI cannot agree with paragraph 164 where \"Claimants\" are being referred to, without clarification of the identity of the Claimants. The paragraph refers to \"the Marsans corporate group to which Claimants belong\" and further reference is made to the \"ultimate shareholders of the Claimants\", and \"the company through which they [Claimants] made their investments, Air Comet\". These assertions appear to presume that the issue of identity has been resolved. This is clearly not the case and the Tribunal is yet to decide whether the three named \"Claimants\" - Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A., and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. - can upon consideration of the entire evidence be treated as Claimants. It would appear that \"the Marsans group\" has in effect been prosecuting the claims, and putting themselves forward as Claimants. The Marsans group is admittedly not a corporate entity. It is a group composed of an indeterminate number of members and, therefore, it cannot be treated as \"Claimants.\"\n\n7.\n\nThe issue of the identity of the \"Claimants\" is not one which has been decided by the Tribunal. This issue is still being considered by the Tribunal. I, therefore, disagree to the reference to \"Claimants\" without any qualifications in the provisional measures decision. In particular, I am of the view that a view taken at the jurisdictional stage cannot to be treated as \"a final decision\". The Tribunal in *Siemens AG v Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004) expressed its view on this issue in the following terms:\n\n\"At this [jurisdictional] stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal is not required to consider whether the claims under the Treaty made by Siemens are correct. **This is a matter for the merits**. The Tribunal simply has to be satisfied that, if the Claimant's allegations would be proven correct, then the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider them.\" [ *emphasis added* ]\"\n\n8.\n\nI cannot agree with the observation in paragraph 172 that \"the Tribunal notes that the statements made in the public deeds are consistent with the previous statements in evidence from the receivers\". We have not analyzed the evidence from the receivers. As such we cannot reach a conclusion on whether the public deeds are consistent with any evidence from the receivers. The Exhibit C-1200 (Affidavit) itself raises questions about its effectiveness. For instance on page two of each of the affidavits it is stated:\n\n\"He does not certify through documentation the present representation, that he assures to have been granted, therefore the effectiveness of this deed is subject to subsequent ratification of the represented person. I have advised the parties appearing before me of this circumstance and they insist in this execution\".\n\nThe Tribunal has not decided on the impact of this or any subsequent ratification. This remains an open and contested issue which should be determined in the award on the merits.\n\n9.\n\nAttention was drawn to the paragraphs 42 and 76 relating to the issue of counsel's authority to represent Claimants in this arbitration. The effect of the Nominated Lawyer (King & Spalding) having acquired direct financial interests in the subject matter of this arbitration case and any award is an issue which merits consideration. It may be noted that under the Funding Agreement (in particular clauses 6.1 and 6.2) the Funder, which is not an \"investor\" under the BIT, is intended to be a significant beneficiary, along with the Nominated Lawyers, of the proceeds of any award. The award proceeds are to be immediately paid to the Nominated Lawyers or an escrow agent for payment to the Funder and payment of any outstanding invoices (including those of the Nominated Lawyers). Only the remainder will be paid to Claimant.\" Paragraph 31 refers to the Credit Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement between the Claimants and Burford and the issue of standing (or lack of legal standing) of the Claimants' counsel, King & Spalding. The issue of the Funding Agreement is further discussed in paragraphs 135, and 150 of the decision on provisional measures. We are yet to decide on these issues which are to be dealt with in the award on the merits. I consider it inappropriate for these contentious factual issues to be included in the decision on provisional measures, when consideration of these issues on the basis of evidence and due consideration of the relevant legal implications is awaited and is to be dealt with in the Tribunal's award on the merits.\n\n10.\n\nThe issue for this Tribunal to determine in its final award is whether King & Spalding has valid powers of attorney. Claimants argued that the powers of attorney are valid and that the Claimants' reorganization administrators are simply \"stepping into the shoes\" of Claimants for purposes of the continuation of this arbitration. Respondent argues, to the contrary, that Claimants' powers of attorney were extinguished by the bankruptcy, that a new powers of attorney are needed, and that a valid new powers of attorney have not yet been granted to King & Spalding or anyone else. This remains a contentious issue to be determined in the award on the merits.\n\n11.\n\nClaimants have produced letters written by the trustees in insolvency for each of the Claimants that purport to \"ratify\" the powers of attorney. Respondent submits that these letters are flawed. Respondent submits that the letters are not addressed directly to ICSID but rather to King & Spalding, attorneys representing Claimants. It also submits that the letters are undated, and that they do not appear to have been notarized. Finally, Respondent submits that the letters appear to have been executed unilaterally by the trustees, and do not appear to be the result of an order from a commercial court of Madrid. According to Respondent, the trustees lack the right to \"ratify\" the acts done by King & Spalding and to authorize the firm to carry on its activities.\n\n12.\n\nThis issue is thus clearly not free from complexity. It will be for the Tribunal to decide in the award on the merits whether the Claimants have discharged the onus of proving that their lawyers have continued capacity to represent them after the commencement of the insolvency proceedings. The questions, among others, which the Tribunal is to consider before rendering its final award is whether the undated non-notarized letters, which were not submitted to the ICSID Tribunal before August, 2013, can be accepted as proof that King & Spalding fulfilled the legal requirement for representing the Claimants after the insolvency proceedings had commenced.\n\n13.\n\nIn paragraph No. 183 the majority decision notes:\n\n\"Further, the Respondent has raised the question of the alleged invalidity of the powers of attorney held by King & Spalding and their authority to represent the Claimants in this arbitration. This matter has been before the Tribunal for some time and has been the subject of extensive expert evidence and argument. The Respondent has also raised the same or similar arguments before both this Tribunal and in the Complaints as to the alleged motives for which the Claimants and their counsel would seek to uphold the validity of the powers of attorney. **Again, this is clearly a matter squarely within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to decide in its award\"**. [ *Emphasis added* ]\n\n14.\n\nThe statement in paragraph 183 is clearly in contradiction to the previous statement in paragraph 136 where it is stated as follows:\n\n\"136. Finally, with respect to King & Spalding's authorization to represent the Claimants, **this issue was also squarely before the Tribunal and there was substantial evidence before it in support of the ongoing validity of the relevant powers of attorney, including repeated statements from the Claimants' court-appointed receivers**\". [ *Emphasis added* ]\n\n15.\n\nGiven the contradictory positions on the issue of the validity of the powers of attorney indicated above, this issue clearly must remain open for decision in the final award.\n\n16.\n\nIn paragraph 181 of the decision it is stated, \"This issue [i.e. Claimants claim is a derivative and indirect and, falls outside the scope of the BIT] has been extensively briefed and addressed in this arbitration\". In my view, this issue despite a preliminary view having been taken at the jurisdiction stage cannot be treated as a final view and must be treated as an issue that still remains to be dealt with in the award on merits.\n\n17.\n\nParagraph 184 refers to a \"brief review of certain aspects of the Complaints\" and concludes that \"it would appear that these arbitral proceedings could be seen as the motivation, at least in part, for the filing of the Complaints\". I cannot agree with this speculative conclusion regarding \"the real motivation\" of the independent prosecutors in Argentina. There is no evidence to suggest that the filing of the Complaints is anything other than what it purports to be, an investigation into possible criminal activities. In my view, no evidence was adduced before the Tribunal, which could justify the making of adverse comments about independent criminal investigations being undertaken by a sovereign state.\n\n18.\n\nIn paragraph 185 it is stated \"At this stage, the Tribunal concludes that there is a direct relationship between the Complaints and the criminal investigation commenced by the Federal Prosecutor and this ICSID arbitration such that certain rights of the Claimants in this arbitration may warrant protection\". I cannot agree with this conclusion of the majority of the Tribunal since this issue was not treated as a contentious issue, as would be evident from the Tribunal having expressly stated in paragraph 193 that:\n\n\"[T]he criminal proceedings commenced by way of the Complaints and the Federal Prosecutor's preliminary investigation do not address the investment dispute before the Tribunal and, therefore, do not threaten the exclusivity of these ICSID proceedings.\"\n\n19.\n\nIt is clear to me from the following extracts from the majority decision, with which I concur, that there was consensus to deny the grant of provisional measures with regard to the following matters:\n\n- \"[T]he criminal proceedings commenced by way of the Complaints and the Federal Prosecutor's preliminary investigation do not address the investment dispute before the Tribunal and, therefore, do not threaten the exclusivity of these ICSID proceedings\" (paragraph 193).\n\n- \"[I]n the absence of any specific indication of how Claimants or their officers and directors have been harassed or intimidated, there is no basis for provisional measures in that regard\" (paragraph 200).\n\n- The Tribunal \"reaches the same conclusion with respect to Burford\" and I concur (paragraph 201).\n\n- \"[I]t not clear whether the criminal investigation commenced by the Federal Prosecutor includes allegations against counsel or the Claimants' court-appointed receivers\" (paragraph 206).\n\n- The request for provisional measures should not be granted and the Tribunal should defer its decision \"as it relates to the request that the Tribunal order the suspension of the criminal proceedings in regard of counsel for Claimants and Claimants' cout-appointed receivers (paragraph 208).\n\n- There is consensus that Claimants have not \"on the basis of the evidence presented to date, demonstrated irreparable harm or necessity for the granting of the provisional measures requested\" (paragraph 228).\n\n- \"[I]t is not clear whether counsel or the Claimants' court-appointed receivers are included within the scope of the investigation. At this stage, on the basis of the evidence and arguments before it, the Tribunal is unable to determine whether there is sufficient likelihood that counsel and the court-appointed receivers are included within the scope of the criminal investigation so as to justify granting the interim measure sought in their regard\" (paragraph 230).\n\n- \"[F]or the purposes of provisional measures, the requirement of urgency is met when a question cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits\" (paragraph 233).\n\n- \"[I]t will take some time before the investigation is completed and a recommendation or charge, if any, is submitted to the Federal court. While there was no specific evidence given on how much time this process can be expected to take, the Tribunal's sense is that it is likely to take several months and, therefore, formal charges are not imminent\" (paragraph 234).\n\nIn light of the consensus on not granting provisional measures with regard to the above matters, it is not appropriate to set out contentious factual matters in the provisional measures decision, which should appropriately be dealt with in the final award on the merits.\n\n20.\n\nAgain, I regret that I have felt compelled to give this dissenting opinion."}], "Content": "Decision on Provisional Measures\n--------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis decision addresses an Application for Provisional Measures submitted by Claimants on 29 July 2015 (\"Claimants\u2019 Application\") in respect of criminal complaints made by entities of Respondent against Claimants and their subsidiary, Air Comet, S.A.U. (\"Air Comet\"), the legal representatives of these companies and their Spanish court-appointed receivers, Claimants\u2019 counsel in these proceedings, as well as Claimants\u2019 third-party funder, and the criminal investigation commenced by the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Argentina on the basis of these complaints.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------------\n\n2.\n\nOn 29 July 2015, Claimants submitted their Application.1\n\nThis is Claimants\u2019 third application for provisional measures. The first request for provisional measures was submitted by Claimants on 12 April 2011 and it was decided by Procedural Order No. 4 dated 3 October 2012. The second request for provisional measures was submitted by Claimants on 26 March 2012 and it was decided by Procedural Order No. 5, dated 3 October 2012\n\n3.\n\nOn 30 July 2015, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of Claimants\u2019 Application and invited Respondent to comment on it within eight business days from its receipt of the electronic version of the Spanish translation of this document. The Spanish translation was received from Claimants on 31 July 2015.\n\n4.\n\nBy communication of the Secretary of the Tribunal dated 3 August 2015, and in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s directions of 30 July 2015, the deadline for the filing of Respondent\u2019s response to Claimants\u2019 Application was scheduled for 12 August 2015.\n\n5.\n\nOn 12 August 2015, Respondent filed its Response to Claimants\u2019 Application (\"Respondent\u2019s Response\"). In its prayer for relief, Respondent requested that the Tribunal dismiss Claimants\u2019 Application and requested leave to submit a decision of the Argentine Federal Court of Appeals and a report filed in the criminal proceedings in Spain against one of Claimants\u2019 ultimate shareholders.2\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6 81. The documents the Respondent sought leave to submit are: \"...the decision rendered by the Federal Court of Appeals in Contentious-Administrative Matters of the City of Buenos Aires in the local expropriation proceeding, and the accusation report filed by the Prosecutor\u2019s Office in the criminal proceedings pending in Spain for fraudulent concealment of assets and other crimes, which account of the facts and crimes was admitted by Mr. D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n and the other accused parties in such proceeding on July 1, 2015.\"\n\n6.\n\nOn 8 September 2015, the Tribunal invited Claimants3 to (i) file observations on Respondent\u2019s request of 12 August 2015, concerning the admissibility of new evidence; and (ii) if they so wished, to submit a reply to Respondent\u2019s Response, both by 15 September 2015.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal uses the term \"Claimants\" as it has been defined since the beginning of these proceedings, i.e. Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A.\n\n7.\n\nOn 15 September 2015, Claimants submitted a letter informing the Tribunal of the filing by the Argentine Attorney General of the Treasury (the \"Treasury Attorney General\") and the head of the Office of the Prosecutor for Economic Crimes and Money Laundering (the \"PROCELAC\") of a criminal complaint against Claimants, Burford Capital, Ltd. (\"Burford\"), Air Comet, King & Spalding LLP (\"King & Spalding\"), and Fargosi & Asociados (the \"PROCELAC Complaint\"), together with a number of supporting documents.\n\n8.\n\nIn light of the above, Claimants requested that the Tribunal: (i) grant a 10-day extension of the deadline for the filing of their reply to Respondent\u2019s Response and Respondent\u2019s request for admissibility of new evidence; (ii) order that Respondent immediately produce a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint (the \"Production Request\", incorporated into Claimants\u2019 Application); and (iii) schedule a hearing on Claimants\u2019 Application.\n\n9.\n\nOn 16 September 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the deadline for the filing of Claimants\u2019 response to Respondent\u2019s letter of 12 August 2015 was suspended until the Tribunal issued directions on Claimants\u2019 Production Request. The Tribunal also requested that Respondent advise the Tribunal by 18 September 2015 whether and how quickly it could provide a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint to Claimants.\n\n10.\n\nAlso on 16 September 2015, Respondent informed the Tribunal that \"the Argentine Treasury Attorney General\u2019s Office has already transmitted to the head of PROCELAC the Tribunal\u2019s request for a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint filed by such body, which copy is not in the possession of this representation. Any responses provided by the PROCELAC in this respect will be duly transmitted to the Tribunal.\"4\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter dated 16 September 2015, pp. 3-4.\n\n11.\n\nOn 23 September 2015, the Tribunal invited (i) Respondent to inform the Tribunal by 25 September 2015, whether it had received any response from the PROCELAC on the Tribunal\u2019s request for a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint; and (ii) Claimants to provide a response by 29 September 2015. The Tribunal also confirmed its availability to hold a hearing in Washington, D.C. on 3 and/or 4 November 2015. It further invited the Parties to confirm their availability by 28 September 2015, should the Tribunal determine that a hearing on Claimants\u2019 Application was required.\n\n12.\n\nOn 24 September 2015, Respondent submitted PROCELAC\u2019s response on the Tribunal\u2019s request for a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint dated 18 September 2015. In its response, the head of PROCELAC indicated that because the PROCELAC Complaint had been filed with the court, pursuant to Article 204 of Argentina\u2019s Code of Criminal Procedure (the \"ACCP\"), no copy of such complaint could be provided.\n\n13.\n\nOn that same date, both Parties confirmed their availability to hold a hearing on Claimants\u2019 Application during 3 and/or 4 November 2015, in Washington, D.C.\n\n14.\n\nOn 29 September 2015, Claimants submitted their response to Respondent\u2019s communication of 24 September 2015.\n\n15.\n\nOn 2 October 2015, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Parties\u2019 respective submissions of 24 and 29 September 2015, and took note that the Parties had confirmed their availability on the proposed hearing dates. It further (i) requested that Respondent produce a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint; (ii) requested Claimants to confirm whether their letter of 29 September 2015 constituted their Reply in Claimants\u2019 Application or whether they still wished to submit a full Reply; and (iii) requested Claimants to respond to Respondent\u2019s request for the admission of the two new documents set out in paragraph 81(c) of Respondent\u2019s Response.\n\n16.\n\nOn 6 October 2015, Claimants submitted their reply to the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 2 October 2015, noting that they wished to submit a full Reply, for reasons of expediency, and not opposing the incorporation into the arbitral record of the two new documents set out in paragraph 81(c) of Respondent\u2019s Response of 12 August 2015.\n\n17.\n\nOn that same date, Respondent submitted its reply to the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 2 October 2015, reiterating its inability to produce the PROCELAC Complaint and providing details permitting identification of the relevant domestic court to which the PROCELAC Complaint had been submitted.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter of 8 October 2015, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Parties\u2019 respective letters of 6 October 2015. It further acknowledged receipt on 6 October 2015, of the Spanish translation of Claimants\u2019 letter of 29 September 2015, and on 7 October 2015, of the English translation of Respondent\u2019s letter of 6 October 2015.\n\n19.\n\nIn the same letter, the Tribunal (i) set deadlines for a second round of written submissions, (ii) scheduled a hearing on Claimants\u2019 Application for 3 November 2015, at the seat of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"Centre\") in Washington, D.C. (the \"Hearing\"), (iii) provided the hearing schedule and related logistics information, and (iv) reminded the Parties that Respondent\u2019s share of the sixth advance payment requested by the Centre on 18 May 2015 remained outstanding. The Tribunal ordered:\n\n(a) Claimants to file a Reply to Claimants\u2019 Application by 14 October 2015, with the Spanish translation to follow by 16 October 2015;\n\n(b) Respondent to file its Rejoinder to Claimants\u2019 Application, including any comments that it might have with regard to Claimants\u2019 letter of 29 September 2015, and/or any other correspondence on this matter, by 23 October 2015, with the English translation to follow by 27 October 2015; and\n\n(c) both Parties to inform the Tribunal and opposing counsel by 16 October 2015, of the names and affiliations of all representatives who will attend the Hearing.\n\n20.\n\nIn accordance with this schedule, on 14 October 2015, Claimants filed their Reply to Claimants\u2019 Application. On 15 October 2015, Claimants filed a corrected version of their Reply to Claimants\u2019 Application (\"Claimants\u2019 Reply\"), together with a complete version of the PROCELAC Complaint and related file materials which they had been able to obtain from the court.\n\n21.\n\nOn 16 October 2015, both Parties submitted their respective lists of participants for the Hearing.\n\n22.\n\nOn 22 October 2015, Claimants submitted a letter to the Tribunal attaching three public deeds executed by Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers in Spain, as a new exhibit, Exhibit C-1200.\n\n23.\n\nOn 23 October 2015, the President of the Tribunal invited Respondent to submit any observations that it might have on Claimants\u2019 letter of 22 October 2015, and Exhibit C-1200 attached to it, within two business days from its receipt of the Spanish translation of said letter. Respondent would then have one business day to provide the English translation of its observations.\n\n24.\n\nOn that same date, the President of the Tribunal supplemented the Tribunal\u2019s directions of 8 October 2015, by providing further logistical instructions to the Parties in preparation for the Hearing.\n\n25.\n\nAlso on 23 October 2015, Respondent filed its Rejoinder to Claimants\u2019 Application (\"Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder\") and Claimants provided a Spanish translation of their letter of 22 October 2015.\n\n26.\n\nOn 26 October 2015, Claimants provided an English translation of the relevant parts of their Exhibit C-1200, filed with their letter of 22 October 2015.\n\n27.\n\nOn 27 October 2015, Respondent provided an English translation of its Rejoinder. On that same date, Respondent submitted to the Tribunal a letter with its observations on Claimants\u2019 letter of 22 October 2015 and Exhibit C-1200.\n\n28.\n\nOn 28 October 2015, Respondent provided an English translation of its letter of 27 October 2015.\n\n29.\n\nOn 3 November 2015, the Tribunal held the Hearing on Claimants\u2019 Application in Washington, D.C.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND5**\n----------------------------\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal is of the view that a detailed review of the factual background related to the criminal proceedings, which are the cause of Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures, is necessary in order to permit the Parties to know the basis for this decision.\n\n30.\n\nOn 23 February 2015, the Treasury Attorney General, who has conduct of the arbitration on behalf of Respondent, the Republic of Argentina, submitted a complaint pursuant to Article 177(1) of the Argentine Criminal Code (\"ACC\") to the office of the Public Prosecutor of the Nation (*Procuradora General de la Naci\u00f3n*) against the legal representatives and/or officers or directors of the following companies: Burford, Claimants\u2019 third-party funder; the Claimant Teinver S.A.; Air Comet, Claimants\u2019 subsidiary; the Claimant Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A.; and the Claimant Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. (the \"TAG Complaint\").6 The TAG Complaint alleged that the parties it named had committed fraud pursuant to Article 174(5) of the ACC. The TAG Complaint stated that the Treasury Attorney General\u2019s office had learned of the alleged fraudulent conduct within the context of these arbitration proceedings.\n\nSee Exhibit RA-686.\n\n31.\n\nAt the heart of the TAG Complaint are two agreements: the Credit Assignment Agreement, dated 18 January 2010, between Claimants as the assignors and Air Comet as the assignee of the collection rights that may arise out of Claimants\u2019 claim in these proceedings (the \"Assignment Agreement\"); and the Funding Agreement, dated 14 April 2010, between Claimants and Burford concerning the financing of Claimants\u2019 litigation expenses in this arbitration (the \"Funding Agreement\").7 The TAG Complaint also referred to the fact that during the course of 2013 the Treasury Attorney General\u2019s office had learned that the voluntary insolvency proceedings of Claimants (which had commenced in late 2010 and early 2011) had progressed to liquidation proceedings and been entrusted to the administration of court-appointed receivers.8 The TAG Complaint goes on to state that as a result of this new judicial occurrence, Respondent had raised, as a new defense to Claimants\u2019 claim in this arbitration, that Claimants\u2019 counsel lacked legal standing since the powers of attorney originally granted to them had been terminated by Claimants\u2019 insolvency.9\n\nThese agreements, respectively Exhibits RA-159 and RA-160, were addressed in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction of 21 December 2012.\n\nAs recorded in the Decision on Jurisdiction, Air Comet commenced voluntary insolvency proceedings on 20 April 2010 and on 22 December 2010, the Spanish court supervising its insolvency suspended Air Comet\u2019s powers of administration. The Claimants subsequently commenced voluntary insolvency proceedings on 22 December 2010 (Teinver S.A.), 28 January 2011 (Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A.) and 16 February 2011 (Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A.). The suspension of the powers of administration and disposition of Claimants and their liquidation proceedings were ordered by the Spanish court on 10 April 2013 (Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A.), 29 April 2013 (Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A.) and 26 April 2013 (Teinver S.A.).\n\nWith their reply on the merits, Claimants submitted letters from each of the administrators and receivers for Claimants in which the authors give their names and say they are making an appearance before the Tribunal and make certain declarations. Among the statements made by the receivers is that they ratify all acts performed on behalf of Claimants from the beginning of the arbitration to the date of signature of their letter and they ratify the power of attorney originally granted by each Claimant to counsel. Although the statements were signed by the relevant receivers, they were not dated. In the proceedings before the Tribunal, the Respondent took the position that the letters from the receivers were not in proper form and were not valid documents.\n\n32.\n\nThe TAG Complaint alleges that the Funding Agreement entails a fraud against the groups of creditors of the companies that make up the \"Marsans Group\", which includes each of Claimants and Air Comet. It alleges that after the signature of the Assignment Agreement, Air Comet commenced voluntary insolvency proceedings a few days after Claimants and Burford executed the Funding Agreement. It also alleges that at the time of the Funding Agreement, Claimants had already planned their voluntary insolvency proceedings at the end of 2010 and the beginning of 2011. As a result of these agreements and conduct, the TAG Complaint alleges that the potential compensation sought in these arbitration proceedings by Claimants was excluded from the insolvency proceedings, which amounts to a fraud on the creditors, which include Respondent by way of its shareholdings in the Argentine Airlines.10\n\nSee Exhibit RA-686, pp 6-7.\n\n33.\n\nAlthough the TAG Complaint does not refer to them in its initial \"Purpose\" section, the complaint goes on to make allegations involving the court-appointed receivers11 and counsel for Claimants12 in its subsequent sections. The TAG Complaint suggested that there had been connivance between Claimants, their legal counsel and their funder which affected the creditors in the insolvency proceedings of Claimants and other members of the \"Marsans Group\" in Spain and Argentina.13\n\nSee TAG Complaint, Exhibit RA-686, pp 4-5, 8. At p 8, the TAG Complaint states that \"the trustees in insolvency of the four companies of the \"Marsans Group\" have taken part (criminal involvement) in the scheme behind the agreement of 14 April 2010, which is considered here as the *corpus delicti*. Indeed, it is not admissible for the trustees in insolvency to consent to an agreement which, as explained above, provides that the payments in favour of the Funder (BURFORD CAPITAL LTD) should be made outside the framework of the insolvency proceedings - thus committing fraud against the estate in insolvency - before any payment is made to any other creditor.\" **[Exhibit RA-686, p. 11 (Spanish version)]**\n\nReference is made to Claimants\u2019 counsel, King & Spalding LLP, in several places in the TAG Complaint. Amongst others, see Exhibit RA-686, p 6, where the TAG Complaint states that while King & Spalding LLP is not a formal party to the Funding Agreement, it is expressly mentioned as the legal firm in charge of the claim before this Tribunal. It goes on to state that the Funding Agreement entails committing fraud against the respective groups of creditors of the companies that make up the \"Marsans Group\", which includes Claimants in these proceedings and their subsidiary, Air Comet, as the alleged assignee of the claim. The TAG Complaint also alleges that King & Spalding LLP acted without proper authorization or valid powers of attorney and suggests that letters filed by King & Spalding LLP, allegedly on behalf of Claimants\u2019 insolvency receivers confirming their authorization of King & Spalding LLP\u2019s representation of Claimants, were not in an appropriate form and constituted a case of \"document fraud\": see Exhibit RA-686, pp 7-8. **[Exhibit RA-686, p. 8 (Spanish version)]**\n\nSee Exhibit RA-686, p 9 (English version). **[Exhibit RA-686, p. 12-13 (Spanish version)]**\n\n34.\n\nThe TAG Complaint also stated that although the requirements for a completed crime had not yet been satisfied, as there had not yet been a disposition of assets or economic harm, it requested the investigation of the crimes referred to as attempted crimes. It also alleged that the fraudulent conduct it describes was designed to mislead both this Tribunal and the Argentine Republic.\n\n35.\n\nThe relief contained in the TAG Complaint included, *inter alia*, a request that it be forwarded to the PROCELAC. It also requested that the matter be forwarded to the Federal Criminal Court for the City of Buenos Aires (the \"Federal Court\") in order for the relevant criminal investigation to be conducted.14\n\nExhibit RA-686, p 13 (English version). **[Exhibit RA-686, p. 19 (Spanish version)]**\n\n36.\n\nOn 3 March 2015, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to request leave to submit into the record a copy of the TAG Complaint. The request was made on the basis that the \".criminal complaint is closely intertwined with certain facts at stake in this arbitration and is intended to prevent the Argentine Republic - in the hypothetical case that this tribunal found it must pay compensation - from making a payment to detriment of the legitimate creditors in Claimants\u2019 insolvency proceedings. If such were the case, the Argentine Republic would be making a wrong payment and would therefore be forced to pay twice. This will result in an irreparable harm to Argentina.\"15\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s letter of 3 March 2015, p 1. The letter went on to state that the TAG Complaint referred \".in essence to the agreement entered into between Claimants and Air Comet S.A.U. on 18 January 2010 and the agreement entered into between Claimants and Burford Capital Ltd on 14 April 2010.\" Further, the letter stated that the facts in question had been raised before the Tribunal at the hearing on the merits and in subsequent communications and were relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s decision. The letter also stated that at the hearing on the merits, the Respondent had brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention that it would file a complaint with the Argentine judicial authorities in respect of the potential commission of a crime.\n\n37.\n\nOn 17 March 2015, Claimants responded to Respondent\u2019s letter of 3 March 2015. In their letter, Claimants stated that they had not seen the alleged criminal complaint since a copy had not been provided to them, nor was it publicly available. As a result, Claimants reserved their rights to request production of the document and to request relief from the Tribunal, including provisional measures with a view to preventing Respondent from further aggravating the dispute. Nevertheless, Claimants stated that in the interest of a rapid resolution of the arbitration, they did not object to the submission of the TAG Complaint into the record.16\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 letter of 17 March 2015.\n\n38.\n\nIn their letter, Claimants went on to make a number of further comments, including the fact that both the Funding Agreement and the Assignment Agreement had previously been addressed before the Tribunal, that both agreements are valid and post-dated Claimants\u2019 acquisition and management of the Argentine Airlines and the expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment of 2008. As a result, Claimants stated that the agreements impugned by Respondent were immaterial to both the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the merits of Claimants\u2019 claims.17\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 letter of 17 March 2015, pp 2-3. The Claimants went on to suggest that the motive for the filing of the TAG Complaint was for political reasons and was not related to any issue of substance nor based on a legitimate motive relating to the merits of the arbitration: see pp 3-4.\n\n39.\n\nIn light of Claimants\u2019 position with respect to the submission of the TAG Complaint, the Tribunal granted leave, on 18 March 2015, for the submission of the TAG Complaint.\n\n40.\n\nOn 13 May 2015, Respondent submitted the TAG Complaint.18\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s letter of 13 May 2015. In its letter accompanying the TAG Complaint, the Respondent contested a number of statements made by Claimants in their letter of 17 March 2015 and made reference to the obligation to file criminal complaints in connection with what it referred to as the deceitful or fraudulent operations relating to the management of the Argentine Airlines. In this regard, it referred to a criminal investigation commenced in October 2002 in connection with the alleged commission of the crime of fraudulent administration of the Argentine Airlines, amongst other legal proceedings.\n\n41.\n\nOn 29 July 2015, Claimants submitted their Application. In their Application, Claimants alleged that Respondent had recently:\n\n\u2022 Threatened criminal prosecution against Claimants\u2019 and Air Comet, S.A.U. (\"Air Comet\")\u2019s legal representatives for their participation in this arbitration, including the execution of the Assignment and Funding Agreements;\n\n\u2022 Threatened King & Spalding with criminal prosecution for its role in representing Claimants in this arbitration;\n\n\u2022 Threatened Burford Capital Limited (\"Burford\"), the capital provider in this arbitration under arrangements repeatedly recognized by the competent Spanish courts, and Burford\u2019s directors personally with criminal prosecution;\n\n\u2022 Issued a formal Petition for Investigation in that regard necessitating the retention of Argentine criminal defense counsel and interfering with freedom of travel to Argentina;\n\n\u2022 Summoned its Attorney General before a domestic criminal court to answer preliminary accusations of failing to discharge her obligations by not earlier investigating Claimants; and\n\n\u2022 Engineered media coverage about this matter, including a particularly inflammatory article labelling King & Spalding and Burford as a \"fraudulent ring\" and calling Claimants\u2019 submissions to this Tribunal the product of a \"vultures and crows committee.\"19\n\nIn addition, Claimants submitted that the Tribunal had previously ordered, on a number of occasions, that the Parties refrain from taking any steps that would aggravate or extend the dispute and that Respondent\u2019s conduct violated those previous orders and warranted immediate relief.20\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, pp 1-2 (footnotes omitted).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, pp 2-3. In this regard, Claimants referred to the following: Procedural Order No. 2; Tribunal\u2019s letter of 13 May 2011; Tribunal\u2019s letter of 1 April 2012; Procedural Order No. 4; and Procedural Order No. 5.\n\n42.\n\nIn their Application, Claimants went on to respond to Respondent\u2019s allegations, including those relating to the Funding Agreement and the Assignment Agreement, as well as counsel\u2019s authority to represent Claimants in this arbitration. In respect of the latter, Claimants explained that after the commencement of Claimants\u2019 voluntary insolvency proceedings in late 2010 and early 2011, the court-appointed administrators had, in April 2013, taken over the administration of Claimants\u2019 affairs and since then had been giving instructions to counsel for Claimants in their capacity as court-appointed insolvency receivers or trustees.21 Claimants\u2019 Application went on to contest that there was any basis for the allegations set out in the TAG Complaint. Claimants also alleged that an article which had appeared in the Argentine newspaper, *P\u00e1gina 12*, on 12 April 2015, reflected that it had received direct access to information that is a part of a confidential criminal investigation and in evidence in this arbitration. Claimants alleged that access had been obtained from Respondent and requested an order directing Respondent to refrain from further aggravating the dispute by disclosing details regarding the arbitration to the press.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, pp 4-5. These facts and the related issues were covered in considerable detail in evidence and argument at the hearing on the merits and in the Parties\u2019 submissions.\n\n43.\n\nClaimants went on to allege that they were entitled to provisional measures on the basis that Respondent had caused them irreparable harm that would not adequately be repaired by an award of damages. They also asserted that Respondent\u2019s conduct reflected that it had no intention of complying with an eventual award in these proceedings and that Respondent\u2019s conduct violated Articles 26 and 53 of the ICSID Convention and constituted a new breach of its treaty obligations.22\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, p 14. The Claimants went on to submit that this conduct further supported their request for the payment of compound interest on any amounts awarded to them until full payment.\n\n44.\n\nIn their request for relief, Claimants requested provisional measures:\n\n(i) Enjoining Argentina from aggravating the dispute between the Parties;\n\n(ii) Ordering Argentina to refrain from altering the *status quo* ;\n\n(iii) Ordering Argentina to refrain from harassing Claimants through baseless domestic litigation and unlawful resort to the media; and\n\n(iv) Ordering Argentina to cease and desist from its criminal investigation, which violates Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.23\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, pp 16-17.\n\n45.\n\nOn 12 August 2015, Respondent submitted its Response to Claimants\u2019 Third Application for Provisional Measures (the \"Respondent\u2019s Response\"). In its Response, Respondent reviewed the requirements for the granting of provisional measures and submitted that Claimants had failed to meet at least three of the five requirements for the granting of such measures.24\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, pp 3-5. The Respondent noted that Claimants had requested provisional measures on two previous occasions and that the measures had been denied by the Tribunal.\n\n46.\n\nAmong the requirements which Respondent said Claimants had not met, was the requirement of a right to be protected in connection with this arbitration. In this regard, Respondent noted that in their Application, Claimants had stated that the allegations raised in the TAG Complaint would have no effect on the ultimate outcome of the arbitration.25 Respondent went on to cite a number of arbitral awards holding that the rights to be preserved in a request for interim measures must relate to the requesting party\u2019s ability to have its claims and requests for relief in the arbitration fairly considered and determined and for any award granted to be effective and capable of being enforced. Respondent submitted that, in this case, the TAG Complaint would not impair Claimants\u2019 right to have their claims heard and determined by the Tribunal given the current stage of the proceedings.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, pp 5-6.\n\n47.\n\nFurther, Respondent submitted that although the facts in the TAG Complaint at issue are related to these arbitration proceedings, this did not permit an inference that the exclusivity of the arbitration proceedings under Article 26 of ICSID Convention, or the rights of Claimants under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention are in jeopardy. In this regard, Respondent referred to ICSID awards which had held that the exclusivity of ICSID proceedings does not extend to criminal proceedings.26\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, pp 6-8 and sources cited there.\n\n48.\n\nRespondent went on to submit that the TAG Complaint did not give rise to a risk of irreparable harm to Claimants and that the latter had failed to specify which right related to the arbitration might be threatened by the TAG Complaint. It also submitted that the making of a criminal complaint was a sovereign act relating to criminal liability of individuals who were outside the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n49.\n\nRespondent also referred to Article 177(1) of the ACC which, in its view, had required the Treasury Attorney General to make the TAG Complaint. Respondent also submitted that the TAG Complaint had been made to the PROCELAC which was now responsible for assessing whether a preliminary investigation should be commenced and that it was only upon completion of its assessment that the office of the Public Prosecutor would determine, in its own discretion, whether to implement any relevant measures and conduct a preliminary investigation. According to Respondent, it was only upon completion of that investigation that, in the event that there was sufficient evidence, the TAG Complaint would be referred to the relevant judicial authorities.27\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, pp 13-15.\n\n50.\n\nRespondent also went on to point out that in the event that the Argentine judicial authorities determined that there was a sufficient basis to initiate a criminal investigation, then the Argentine Constitution and legal system provided abundant guarantees of the accused\u2019s procedural rights.\n\n51.\n\nIn addition, Respondent submitted that there was no urgency to justify the granting of provisional measures. In this regard, Respondent submitted that if the TAG Complaint gave rise to the commencement of a criminal proceeding, this would not amount to a case of urgency since the procedure would take time. Respondent submitted that whatever the result, the decision in the criminal proceedings would not be issued before the Tribunal rendered its final award in this arbitration.28\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, pp 23-25.\n\n52.\n\nIn its request for relief, Respondent requested that Claimants\u2019 Application be dismissed with costs.29\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, pp 26-27. In addition, the Respondent sought leave to submit the decision of the Federal Court of Appeals in Contentious-Administrative Matters of the City of Buenos Aires in the local expropriation proceeding and a copy of the report of the Spanish prosecutor\u2019s office in respect of the fraudulent concealment of assets and other crimes alleged against Mr. D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n, one of the ultimate shareholders of Claimants.\n\n53.\n\nOn 14 September 2015, the general prosecutor in charge of the PROCELAC, Mr. Carlos Gonella, filed the PROCELAC Complaint before the Federal Appeals Chamber against all of the parties named in the TAG Complaint as well as Claimants\u2019 counsel in this arbitration, King & Spalding and Fargosi & Asociados, and all of the court-appointed receivers in the insolvencies of Claimants and Air Comet for fraud pursuant to Article 174(5) of ACC. In addition, a complaint pursuant to Article 1 of Law 14,034, for promoting political or economic sanctions against the State, was made against all of those persons involved in the alleged fraud who were Argentine citizens. The filing of the PROCELAC Complaint was announced at a joint, televised press conference held by the Treasury Attorney General and the head of PROCELAC on the same day.\n\n54.\n\nThe filing of the PROCELAC Complaint by the PROCELAC and the press conference were brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention by way of Claimants\u2019 letter to the Tribunal of 15 September 2015.30\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 letter of 15 September 2015 together with attachments consisting of: an extract from the PROCELAC website which contained a video of the press conference; a notice published by the PROCELAC; various press articles which had reported on the Criminal Complaint and press conference; and a copy of the presentation slides used by the Treasury Attorney General and the head of PROCELAC at the press conference. The slides set out the corporate organization of Claimants and their holdings in the Argentine Airlines, the relationships between counsel, Claimants and Burford, relevant provisions of Articles 172 and 174 of the ACC and the relevant article of Law 14,034.\n\n55.\n\nIn their letter to the Tribunal, Claimants alleged that the PROCELAC Complaint had personally named the individual lawyers representing Claimants and was an attempt to use domestic criminal laws to circumvent the arbitration and put pressure on Claimants, their funder and their lawyers to drop the claims in this arbitration. Claimants also submitted that contrary to Respondent\u2019s Response, the head of PROCELAC had indicated that the case would move quickly such that a decision could be expected within three months.31 In light of the new criminal complaint (the PROCELAC Complaint) and press conference, Claimants requested an extension of the deadline to file their Reply on their Application and a hearing on the matter.\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 letter of 15 September 2015, pp 2-3 and the sources cited there.\n\n56.\n\nAs described previously, the Tribunal extended the deadline for Claimants\u2019 Reply and requested that Respondent advise it as to whether and how quickly it could provide a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint to Claimants. In its response of 16 September 2015, Respondent advised that it did not have a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint and had forwarded a copy of the Tribunal\u2019s request to the PROCELAC.\n\n57.\n\nOn 24 September 2015, Respondent advised that it had been advised by the PROCELAC that since the PROCELAC Complaint had been filed with the court, pursuant to Article 204 of the ACC no copy of the PROCELAC Complaint could be provided. Respondent attached to its letter a copy of the PROCELAC\u2019s response to that effect.32\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s letter of 24 September 2015 and PROCELAC\u2019s note of 23 September 2015.\n\n58.\n\nOn 29 September 2015, Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to request that Respondent produce a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint and order Respondent to, amongst other things, suspend the criminal complaints (the TAG Complaint and the PROCELAC Complaint, together referred to as the \"Complaints\") and to stop what it said was Respondent\u2019s unlawful conduct.33\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 letter of 29 September 2015. In their letter, Claimants provided further information and detail regarding the Criminal Complaint as well as argument in support of Claimants\u2019 Application. The Claimants also provided a copy of the transcript of the press conference of 14 September 2015.\n\n59.\n\nOn 2 October 2015, the Tribunal requested that Respondent provide a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint and set deadlines for the submission of Claimants\u2019 Reply and Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder.\n\n60.\n\nOn 6 October 2015, Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to advise that they ~~had been~~ might be able to obtain a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint which they would file with their Reply.\n\n61.\n\nOn 13 October 2015, Mr. Marijuan, the Federal Prosecutor in the Public Prosecutor\u2019s office to whom the matter had been assigned, issued a Request for Letters Rogatory addressed to the appropriate court of first instance in the city of Washington D.C., requesting certified copies of the record in this arbitration.34\n\nSee copy and translation of the Request for Letters Rogatory issued by Federal Prosecutor Marijuan, Exhibit C-1215. The Request states that it attaches a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint which it states was filed on 14 September 2015. The Request states, in part, as follows:  \n Through said complaint, [the Prosecutor in charge of the PROCELAC] requested the investigation of the alleged fraudulent maneuvers carried out against the Argentine state by the legal representatives, officers and executives of the companies \"Burford Capital Ltd.\", \"Teinver S.L.\", \"Air Comet S.A.U.\", \"Auto Urbanos del Sur S.A.\", and \"Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A.\". In this respect, it is hereby made known that the procedural subject matter of the investigation referred hereto are different maneuvers in relation to a series of agreements entered into by the above mentioned companies, and the submission of certain documentational allegedly apocryphal before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), aiming at the misappropriation of funds arising from a possible conviction against the Argentine republic under the arbitration process filed before the above mentioned organization, pursuant to the expropriation of the controlling capital stock of the companies \"Aerolineas Argentinas S.A.\" and \"Austral L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas S.A.\". Said maneuvers would aim at prejudicing those creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings of the companies\u2019 claimant before the ICSID; which proceedings are filed before the Kingdom of Spain; and which, at the same time, would prejudice public funds, as the State could end up paying a compensation amounting to USD 1,036,200,000 to those who would not be the legitimate creditors thereof, being potentially exposed to the risk of being forced to pay for such compensation twice.  \n Having said that, and in order to set a legal framework to the Request herein, I make known that based on the records appearing on the case file, King & Spalding law firm - legal representative of the companies\u2019 claimant before the ICSID - would have submitted invalid documents in the arbitration proceedings to certify its legal capacity, in an attempt to lead the Arbitration Court to error, thus making an award that would oblige the Argentine state to make a payment to the detriment of itself and of the creditors of the failed companies.\n\n62.\n\nOn 14 October 2015, Claimants submitted their Reply. Claimants attached a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint dated 14 September 2015, which they were able to obtain on October 9, 2015 in the afternoon.35\n\nSee Exhibit C-1198. The PROCELAC Complaint itself, produced as part of a larger file with Claimants\u2019 Reply, consists of 30 pages and was signed by PROCELAC\u2019s General Prosecutor, Mr. Carlos Gonella. It appears to have been received by the Secretariat of the Federal Appeals Court on 14 September 2015 and received by Office No. 9 of the Federal Prosecution Service on 14 September 2015. In addition, it appears that the PROCELAC Complaint was assigned by a federal judge to Federal Criminal Prosecution Office No. 9 on 15 September 2015. Further, the file attached as Exhibit C-1198 also contained a note from Federal Prosecutor Guillermo Fernando Marijuan dated 21 September 2015. As described further below, Prosecutor Marijuan\u2019s note, in its description of the Complaints submitted to his office, expressly refers only to the legal representatives, officers and management of Burford, Teinver S.L., Air Comet, Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. and Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. According to the Respondent, Prosecutor Marijuan\u2019s description of the Complaints narrowed the scope of the investigation which he has undertaken. This is disputed by Claimants and reviewed by the Tribunal in its analysis below, in Section IV.E of this Decision.\n\n63.\n\nThe PROCELAC Complaint is filed by the General Prosecutor in charge of the PROCELAC and the Coordinator of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Division of PROCELAC. It states that it is a criminal complaint against the legal representatives, executives, and/or directors of Burford, the three Claimants and Air Comet. It also names specifically King & Spalding and each of the individual lawyers as well as a paralegal who have participated in this arbitration as well as the lawyers of Claimants\u2019 Argentine counsel\u2019s law firm, Fargosi & Asociados. The PROCELAC Complaint also names the insolvency administrators of each of Claimants and Air Comet as well as \"any other individual or legal entity that is identified in the course of the investigation that should be carried out due to the crime of fraud against the public administration (Art. 174, subsection 5 of the Criminal Code [C\u00f3digo Penal, C.P.]) and, for those previously identified who are Argentine citizens, for promoting political or economic sanctions against the State (Art. 1, Law 14,034)..,\".36\n\nSee Exhibit C-1198, pp 1-2 (footnotes omitted).\n\n64.\n\nBy way of background, the PROCELAC Complaint referred to the TAG Complaint as follows:\n\nThe PTN indicated in its presentation that the persons involved were the legal representatives, executives, or directors of the Burford, Teinver, Air Comet, Autobuses Urbanos and Transportes de Cercanias companies. In addition, it detailed the maneuver subject to the complaint describing a series of agreements made between the referred to companies and the presentation of certain documentation, possibly apocryphal, to the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter, \"ICSID\"). All of this, with the purpose of illegally appropriating the sums arising from a possible ruling against the Argentine republic, in the framework of the arbitration that it pursues before the referred to body, arising from the expropriation of the controlling share package of Aerolinas [ *sic* ] Argentinas S.A. (hereinafter, \"**Aerolineas**\") and Austral Lineas Areas [ *sic* ] S.A. (hereinafter \"**Austral**\").\n\nThis maneuver would have the purpose of harming the interests of the creditors in the insolvency liquidation proceedings of the complainant companies before the ICSID - proceedings that they pursue in the Kingdom of Spain, but, in addition, the national public treasury, which may be liable for paying an indemnity that would amount to the sum of **USD 1,036,200,000** to those who would not be its legitimate creditors. To this should be added that, in these circumstances, the Argentine republic would be exposed to the risk of paying the referred to indemnity for a second time.\n\nSpecifically, the PTN asserted that \"*should the counterclaim not be considered favorably by the ICSID tribunal, it would be an attempt to oblige the Argentine state to make a clearly fraudulent payment to the legitimate creditors, a circumstance that the Argentine state cannot allow.\"* It also stated that the *\"accused are trying, by means of a fraudulent maneuver to avoid the rightful intervention of Spanish justice in the various insolvency procedures in order - by means of a ruse - to induce the Arbitrational tribunal into an error and to thereby obtain an improper benefit.*\"\n\nIt adds that \"*in the case of transferring future sums of money arising from a favorable decision for the complainants in the arbitrational proceedings we would be witnessing a consummated crime when the financial damage to the bankruptcy creditors is verified of the companies identified above\"* and that *\"added to this would be the damages that the State would undoubtedly experience, if it were to pay a hypothetical indemnity established in a ruling, to those who were not the legitimate creditors, and thereby being exposed to a situation that would involve the principle that states that* ***he who pays badly should pay twice.***\"\n\nAlong with the complaint, the PTN included a copy of various documents, presentations, and resolutions relating to the file being processed before the ICSID and reports in relation to the universal proceedings being pursued in Spain.37\n\nExhibit C-1198, pp 2-4 (emphasis in original). The PROCELAC Complaint also notes that the PROCELAC has received a witness statement from Mr. Eduardo Barcesat, who appeared as counsel on behalf of the Respondent in the arbitral proceedings and that it would request that the office of the Public Prosecutor obtain duly certified copies of the bankruptcy proceedings of Claimants and Air Comet in Spain, copies of all the criminal proceedings registered against the ultimate, personal shareholders of Claimants and certified copies of the ICSID file in these proceedings.\n\n65.\n\nAs part of its description of the relevant events, the PROCELAC Complaint reviews the corporate structure of Claimants, the amounts of the claim and counter-claim and Respondent\u2019s defence in this arbitration that Claimants\u2019 claim is of a \"derived or indirect nature\" and refers to Mr. Eduardo Barcesat\u2019s witness statement to the effect that Claimants lack capacity to sue since they were \"not contracting parties, as defined by Article 25 of the ICSID regulations [ *sic* ], and that in the application of Article 42, subsection 2 of the same regulations,\" the provisions of the domestic legal system of the state receiving the investment applied.38\n\nExhibit C-1198, pp 12-13. The PROCELAC Complaint goes on to state that Air Comet was the principal, direct shareholder of Interinvest which, in turn, is the parent company of the Argentine Airlines and that the liquidation stage of its insolvency commenced in 2011. The PROCELAC Complaint speculates that this might be why Claimants commenced the arbitration, rather than Air Comet. It goes on to suggest that the object of such a maneuver was to evade the rights of the creditors of Air Comet. The PROCELAC Complaint also goes on to state that although the Respondent had put forward an objection to jurisdiction on the basis of Claimants\u2019 lack of ability to sue, the matter had not yet been addressed in the arbitration.\n\n66.\n\nThe PROCELAC Complaint goes on to review the Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement and concludes that in the event Respondent were required to make a payment to Claimants pursuant to an award in the arbitration, the claims of the creditors of Claimants would be evaded and Respondent would be exposed to the possibility of having to make a double payment.39 The PROCELAC Complaint also states that due to the insolvency of Claimants, the powers of attorney authorizing King & Spalding to represent Claimants had become invalid. It also suggests that the letters from the insolvency administrators of Claimants40 were possibly \"apocryphal documents\" or signed by the insolvency administrators in excess of their powers. The PROCELAC Complaint suggests that the letters from the administrators could be either null and void or, perhaps, reflect possible connivance of the insolvency administrators with Claimants in order to evade Claimants\u2019 creditors and detrimentally affect Respondent.41 The PROCELAC Complaint also addressed the question of the immunities provided for under the ICSID Convention, Articles 21 and 22, noting that in the circumstances of this case any protection afforded by these articles would not be an impediment for proceeding with the charges described since these put the public order of Respondent at threat. The PROCELAC Complaint also referred to certain arbitral awards which have held that states have the right and duty to investigate crimes, independent of the existence of an ICSID arbitration.42\n\nIn this regard, the PROCELAC Complaint relies on the witness statement of Mr. Barcesat which it quotes as follows:  \n This mechanism consists of an ostensible fraud against the Argentine republic given that were there to be a possible payment in favor of the claimants, the amounts would not be received by the group of creditors of the respective bankruptcy files but rather by Burford Capital LTD. In addition, if the Argentine republic paid incorrectly it would not only be exposed to a double payment, but also to pay the fine that Spanish bankruptcy law applies when a payment is made in favor of a single creditor to the detriment of the rest of the creditors.  \n \u2026  \n [T]here is a procedural fraud and it puts the national treasury at risk of having to pay the amount of the award, plus another as a punitive measure in favor of the verified creditors in bankruptcy proceedings in Spain.  \n See Exhibit C-1198, pp 15-16.\n\nExhibits C-842, C-843 and C-844.\n\nExhibit C-1198, p 17. In addition, the PROCELAC Complaint goes on to state that the authorization by the court in the Air Comet insolvency for Air Comet\u2019s insolvency administrators to approve the Funding Agreement was of no effect since, according to it, that agreement as well as the powers of attorney authorizing King & Spalding LLP to represent Claimants should have been authorized by the court in charge of Claimants\u2019 insolvencies. See Exhibit C-1198, pp 10-19.  \n Further on, the PROCELAC Complaint alleges that in order to validate their legal capacity \"...representatives of King & Spalding would have included in the case file invalid documents that accredit said capacity, in an attempt to induce the arbitrational tribunal into an error, and in this manner obtain a ruling that obliges the Argentine state to make a payment to its detriment and to the detriment of the creditors, leading to the referred to criminal concept.\" See Exhibit C-1198, p 23.\n\nExhibit C-1198, pp 27-28 and the sources cited there.\n\n67.\n\nAs will be described in the next section, in their Reply, Claimants took into account the contents of the PROCELAC Complaint and responded to Respondent\u2019s Response. In addition, they repeated and expanded upon the measures requested in their Application.\n\n68.\n\nIncluded in the file that Claimants were able to obtain from the Public Prosecutors\u2019 office, was a note signed by the Federal Prosecutor assigned to the PROCELAC Complaint, Mr. Marijuan, acknowledging receipt of the PROCELAC Complaint and notifying it to the Coordinator of the Bankruptcy Division of PROCELAC and requesting the referral of PROCELAC Preliminary Investigation File No. 890. That note reads in relevant part as follows:\n\nI. Received, provide for its entry into the IT system FiscalNet and proceed with the prosecution in accordance with article 196 of the Argentine Procedural Criminal Code.\n\nII. An investigation on the criminal complaint submitted by Dr. Carlos Gonella, Attorney- General and head of the Economic and Money Laundering Attorney- General\u2019s Office (PROCELAC), which consists of the alleged fraudulent manoeuvres conducted against the National State by the legal representatives, officers or directors of \"Burford Capital LTD\", \"Teinver S.L.\", \"Air Comet S.A.U.\", \"Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A.\" and \"Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A.\" is being carried out.  \n In order to describe the manoeuvres subject to the criminal complaint, several agreements entered into the abovementioned corporations among themselves have been detailed and certain documentation allegedly apocryphal submitted before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) has been presented. Such manoeuvres have the purpose of obtaining sums resulting from a potential award against the Argentine Republic illegally; all this within the framework of the arbitration conducted before the abovementioned centre for the expropriation of the controlling shares of \"Aerolineas Argentinas S.A.\" and \"Austral L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas S.A.\".  \n Said manoeuvres may have the purpose of damaging the creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings of Claimants before the ICSID - proceedings conducted in the Kingdom of Spain - which, in turn, may also damage the national public treasury, as it may end up paying a compensation of USD 1,036,200,000 to those illegitimate creditors and exposing itself to a risk of having to pay the potential compensation twice.\n\nIII. The purpose of this proceeding having been identified, be it notified to the Coordinator of the Bankruptcy Division of the Economic Money Laundering Attorney-General\u2019s Office (PROCELAC) and request the referral of the Preliminary Investigation No. 890 and its corresponding documentation.43\n\nSee Federal Prosecutor Marijuan\u2019s note dated 21 September 2015, included in Exhibit C-1198. Although not referred to in Claimants\u2019 Reply nor the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, this note and its interpretation were the object of argument and discussion at the Hearing, as described below.\n\n69.\n\nOn 22 October 2015, Claimants submitted three public deeds executed in Spain by the court-appointed receivers acting on behalf of Claimants in the various insolvency proceedings in Spain, all before notaries public.44 In the public deeds, the court-appointed receivers in each of the insolvency proceedings of Claimants deposed to the following:\n\n\u2022 They confirmed their identity and powers to act on behalf of the respective Claimants in their capacity as court-appointed receivers, and attached evidence of their appointment.45\n\n\u2022 They confirmed that they executed the letters submitted in these proceedings as Exhibits C-842, C-843 and C-844, which confirmed and ratified the powers of attorney granted to King & Spalding to act as counsel for each of Claimants in the arbitration. They refer to the letters by their exhibit numbers in the arbitration and confirm the dates on which those letters were executed by them.\n\n\u2022 They confirmed the terms and effects of the letters filed as Exhibits C-842, C-843 and C-844 and that King & Spalding has acted at all times with valid powers of attorney to represent Claimants in the arbitral proceedings and continue to be in force.\n\n\u2022 They confirm they were aware of the PROCELAC criminal investigation and deny fully the allegations made in both the TAG Complaint and PROCELAC Complaint and, in particular, deny that the individuals accused have attempted to defraud Claimants\u2019 creditors in the arbitral proceedings or before the Argentine Public Administration.\n\n\u2022 They confirm that the Funding Agreement executed by Burford and Claimants is in force and has not been affected by the insolvency proceedings, nor by the initiation of the liquidation stage or by the current regime of suspension of faculties of the insolvent Claimants.\n\nThese were submitted by Claimants as Exhibit C-1200 in these proceedings.\n\nExhibit C-1200 is made up of a series of deeds notarized by notaries public in Spain, which must be read together. Each Claimant is represented in Spain by two court-appointed receivers. In the first deed, one of the court-appointed receivers for each of Claimants made declarations on his own behalf and on behalf of his cocourt-appointed receiver. In notarizing this deed, notary public Manuel Gerardo Tarr\u00edo Berjano noted that he had not been presented with documents to confirm the representation of the deponents\u2019 co-court-appointed receiver and that the notarized deed was subject to the subsequent ratification of those receivers. In a second deed, notary public Tarr\u00edo confirms the ratification by two of the other co-court-appointed receivers who appeared personally before him to confirm their ratification. In a third deed, notary public Francisco Regalado Marichalar notarized the ratification of the first deed by the third co-receiver who appeared before him in Bilboa.\n\n70.\n\nOn 23 October 2015, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder.\n\n71.\n\nOn 27 October 2015, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to object to the admission of Exhibit C-1200 on the basis that it was untimely and, therefore, inadmissible. While reserving its rights to respond more fully, Respondent noted that the objection to the validity of counsel\u2019s powers of attorney had been raised some time ago and that despite this, the notarial deeds from Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers had only been produced on the eve of the Hearing. Further, and in any event Respondent submitted that the deeds submitted could not cure the deficiencies in the powers of attorney since the deeds did not reflect the intervention of the judge or judges overseeing the relevant insolvency proceedings and did not permit determining in any conclusive manner the dates on which the letters identified as Exhibits C-842, C-843 and C-844 had been issued.\n\n**IV. THE POSITION OF THE PARTIES ON THE CLAIMANTS\u2019APPLICATION**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimants\u2019 Application**\n-----------------------------\n\n72.\n\nAt the time of filing their Application, Claimants contended as the basis for their request that Respondent had threatened criminal prosecution against them, their representatives, lawyers and their funder. The basis for and scope of Claimants\u2019 Application was expanded as events unfolded.\n\n73.\n\nIn their Application as filed on 29 July 2015, Claimants first identified a series of actions of Respondent that motivated the request. Second, Claimants argued that Respondent\u2019s ongoing allegations about improprieties in the Spanish insolvency proceedings were baseless. Third, they addressed Respondent\u2019s letter of 13 May 2015, which was said to aggravate the dispute between the Parties and threaten the *status quo* of this arbitration. Fourth, Claimants considered that the TAG Complaint was groundless and made numerous false statements. Finally, Claimants submitted that Respondent\u2019s dissemination of its misleading and groundless accusations to the Argentine media further aggravated the dispute.\n\n74.\n\nThe actions underlying Claimants\u2019 Application were that Respondent had:\n\n\u2022 Threatened criminal prosecution against Claimants\u2019 and Air Comet\u2019s legal representatives for their participation in this arbitration, including the execution of the Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement;\n\n\u2022 Threatened King & Spalding with criminal prosecution for its role in representing Claimants in this arbitration;\n\n\u2022 Threatened Burford, the capital provider in this arbitration under arrangements repeatedly recognized by the competent Spanish courts, and Burford\u2019s directors personally with criminal prosecution;\n\n\u2022 Issued a formal Petition for Investigation (the TAG Complaint) in that regard necessitating the retention of Argentine criminal defense counsel and interfering with freedom of travel to Argentina;\n\n\u2022 Summoned [the Treasury] Attorney General before a domestic criminal court to answer preliminary accusations of failing to discharge its obligations by not earlier investigating Claimants; and\n\n\u2022 Engineered media coverage about this matter, including a particularly inflammatory article labelling King & Spalding and Burford as a \"fraudulent ring\" and calling Claimants\u2019 submissions to this Tribunal the product of a \"vultures and crows committee.\"46\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, pp. 1-2 (internal citations omitted).\n\n75.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, such conduct violates international law and it is entirely within the powers of the Tribunal to order Respondent to cease and desist from continuing it.47\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, p. 2.\n\n76.\n\nClaimants contended that Respondent\u2019s actions appear to have a single end: to enable it to mount a smear campaign in front of the Tribunal to attempt to raise some sort of suspicion about Claimants\u2019 legitimacy and King & Spalding\u2019s authority to represent Claimants in this arbitration.48 In this regard, they noted that the Funding Agreement\u2019s validity and enforceability has been recognized, *inter alia*, in all three of Claimants\u2019 respective insolvency proceedings.49 Moreover, Claimants affirmed that the insolvency proceedings in Spain and all the issues regarding Claimants\u2019 assignment of rights to a portion of the proceeds of any award rendered in this arbitration to their subsidiary, Air Comet, have been conducted in strict accordance with the Spanish Bankruptcy Law and in a fully transparent manner. Hence, Respondent\u2019s allegations about improprieties in the Spanish insolvency proceedings are baseless.50\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, p. 3.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, p. 6.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, pp. 3-7.\n\n77.\n\nClaimants also asserted that Respondent\u2019s letter of 13 May 2015, which had not been authorized by the Tribunal, aggravated the dispute and threatened the *status quo* of the arbitration.51 Respondent\u2019s letter of 13 May 2015 was said to aggravate the dispute in two ways: (i) by continuing Respondent\u2019s irrelevant allegations about the legality of the Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement; and (ii) by presenting new, improper claims on the merits, that Claimants\u2019 underlying investments were illegal.52\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, p. 7. That letter attached a copy of the TAG Complaint filed by the Treasury Attorney General with the PROCELAC.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, p. 7.\n\n78.\n\nClaimants also submitted that the TAG Complaint is groundless and makes numerous false statements. Claimants argued that, even at face value, the TAG Complaint does not provide the alleged factual basis that would warrant an investigation of a potential fraud against this Tribunal, the Argentine Republic, its authorities, or any party at all. Rather, it simply describes facts that are well known by this Tribunal, and that the Treasury Attorney General happens to disagree with, including legitimate actions carried out by Claimants during this arbitration, such as the execution of the Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement.53\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, p. 8. See also *id.*, pp. 9-11.\n\n79.\n\nClaimants also submitted that Respondent had disseminated misleading and groundless accusations to the Argentine media and further aggravated the dispute. Claimants cited a \"particularly inflammatory\" article labeling King & Spalding and Burford as a \"fraudulent ring\" and calling Claimants\u2019 submissions to this Tribunal the product of a \"vultures and crows committee.\" In Claimants\u2019 view, the fact that the article falsely accuses King & Spalding, specifically naming Claimants\u2019 counsel, and Burford, provides evidence of \"the irreparable damage that the Treasury Attorney General\u2019s and the [newspaper\u2019s] irresponsible behavior has already *caused.*\" On that basis, Claimants requested that the Tribunal order Respondent to refrain from further aggravating this dispute by disclosing any details regarding this arbitration to the press.54\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, pp. 12-13.\n\n80.\n\nIn their Application, Claimants referred to their previous requests for provisional measures to sustain that the Tribunal has the power under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and [Article] 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to order provisional measures to ensure compliance with its earlier orders.55 Further, Claimants relied on a decision of the tribunal in *Quiborax S.A., Non-metallic Minerals S.A. and Alan Fosk Capl\u00fan v. Plurinational State**of Bolivia56* to assert that they are \"entitled to provisional measures because, as explained above, Argentina has caused irreparable harm that would not be adequately repaired by an award of damages.\"57\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, fn. 48.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/06/2 (\"*Quiborax v. Bolivia*\")\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, p. 13-14 and the various sources cited there.\n\n81.\n\nClaimants also contended that Respondent\u2019s letter of 13 May 2015 and the TAG Complaint improperly attempted to prolong this arbitration and further aggravated the dispute between the Parties in five ways. First, by raising issues that the Parties have already fully briefed and argued at the proper procedural stages and, hence, Respondent should not be allowed to unilaterally initiate a new round of substantive briefing at this late stage. Second, by using the TAG Complaint to make misleading allegations about conduct that, even if true (*quod non*), would not impact the ultimate resolution of this arbitration. Third, by making clear that it has no intention of complying with an eventual award in these proceedings, a declaration which violates Articles 26 and 53 of the ICSID Convention, constitutes a new breach of Argentina\u2019s treaty obligations, and further supports Claimants\u2019 request for compound interest. Fourth, by threatening the *status quo* by harassing Claimants with domestic litigation. Finally, by irresponsibly leaking or communicating to the press details regarding this arbitration.58\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application, pp. 14-16.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Response**\n----------------------------\n\n82.\n\nRespondent submitted its Response on 12 August 2015.\n\n83.\n\nIn its Response, Respondent asserted that Claimants\u2019 Application failed to meet the requirements of the ICSID Convention and international law for the granting of provisional measures.59\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6 13.\n\n84.\n\nRespondent submitted that Claimants\u2019 Application only identified one of several requirements60 for the granting of provisional measures, namely irreparable harm, and states some general assertions on the facts supporting Claimants\u2019 request. In Respondent\u2019s view, Claimants failed to link such facts with the requirements to be met for the granting of such measures and also failed to submit any supporting evidence.61 Respondent also submitted that Claimants had provided no evidence supporting their assertions that it had threatened Claimants\u2019 legal representatives or leaked information regarding the arbitration to the press.62\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16 (\"the legal grounds on which an ICSID Tribunal may recommend provisional measures are stated in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 39, and the relevant requirements have been developed by international case law, to wit: (a) existence of a right to be protected in connection with a main case; (b) danger as a result of delay (emergency); (c) risk of irreparable harm; (d) *prima facie* existence of a basis of competent jurisdiction and admissibility of the claim; and (e) the judgment on the merits must not be anticipated. Said requirements must be met irrespective of the content of the provisional measure required. As stated by the tribunal in *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, even the so called \u2018principle of nonaggravation\u2019 cannot supplant the requirements of Article 47\").\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6 18.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6 19. In addition, the Respondent submitted that since Claimants asserted that it had already caused them irreparable harm, this was now a *fait accompli* and an application seeking a recommendation for provisional measures was pointless. See Respondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6 18.\n\n85.\n\nOn that basis, Respondent submitted that the Tribunal should analyze Claimants\u2019 Application on the basis of the TAG Complaint.63\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6 19.\n\n86.\n\nRespondent then provided an analysis of three out of a total of five requirements which Claimants had failed to prove: (i) the provisional measures sought are intended to protect Claimants\u2019 right(s) in connection with their claim before ICSID;64 (ii) there is risk of irreparable harm for Claimants;65 and (iii) there is urgency or danger in delay for Claimants.66\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 21-31.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 32-55.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 72-80.\n\n87.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants had failed to explain the right which is the subject matter of their claim before ICSID whose protection is sought by way of their request for provisional measures. In addition, Claimants state in their Application that the TAG Complaint does not undermine the rights which are the subject matter of their claim in this arbitration.67 Respondent cites Claimants\u2019 Application where it states that \"even if they were true (*quod non*) the allegations raised in the [TAG Complaint] would have no effect on the ultimate outcome of this arbitration.\"68\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6 21.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6 21.\n\n88.\n\nRespondent also cited a number of decisions by other ICSID tribunals, such as in *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria69* and *Caratube International Oil Company LLP v. Republic of Kazakhstan70,* which, according to it, have rejected provisional measures similar to those requested by Claimants here, given the inexistence of a right to be protected in connection with the main case.71\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/03/24 (\"*Plama v. Bulgaria*\").\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/08/12 (\"*Caratube v. Kazakhastan I*\").\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25 and the sources cited there.\n\n89.\n\nFurther, according to Respondent, the TAG Complaint, upon which Claimants\u2019 Application was based, does not impair either the exclusivity of the ICSID arbitration proceeding under Article 26 of the Convention, or the potential use of Article 53. In this regard, Respondent relied on the decisions in *v. Bolivia*, *Convial Callao S.A. and CCI - Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Concesiones de Infraestructura S.A. v. Republic of Peru*,72 and *Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic73* to note that although criminal proceedings can be related to an ICSID arbitration, that does not *per se* threaten the exclusivity of the arbitration proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. The exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings applies only to investment disputes and, hence, it does not extend to criminal proceedings.74\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/10/2 (\"*Convial Callao v. Peru*\").\n\nICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6 (\"*Lao Holdings v. Lao*\").\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 26-29.\n\n90.\n\nWith respect to irreparable harm, Respondent submitted that there is no such risk for Claimants because (a) the TAG Complaint does not constitute a risk of irreparable harm,75 (b) the TAG Complaint was made in compliance with a legal duty,76 and (c) there are sufficient guarantees of the fairness of any court proceedings which may be commenced.77\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 33-41.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 42-55.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 56-71.\n\n91.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the petition for a criminal investigation could not be deemed to give rise to a risk of irreparable harm because: a criminal investigation which would normally take years could hardly amount to an impairment considering that all procedural stages have been completed in the arbitration; the Parties and the purpose of this arbitration proceeding are different from those of the criminal investigation; and criminal prosecution is a sovereign act relating to the criminal liability of individuals who, by definition, are outside the scope of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the competence of this Tribunal.78\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 33-41.\n\n92.\n\nFurther, Respondent submitted that the TAG Complaint was made in compliance with a legal duty. According to Argentina\u2019s domestic law, any and all public officers or employees who, in the performance of their duties, may be aware of or become acquainted with the commission of any crime liable to be prosecuted, are under a duty to report such crime, *proprio motu*. The TAG Complaint was made in compliance with this duty imposed upon the Treasury Attorney General\u2019s Office and, therefore, upon its public officers and employees. Accordingly, the TAG Complaint had been submitted within the framework of the laws in force, which provide that the independent office of the PROCELAC be the addressee of any complaints in order to assess the commencement of any preliminary investigations in respect of institutionally significant events.79\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 42-55. The Respondent further noted that the tribunal in the case of *Lao Holdings v. Lao* recognized the government\u2019s sovereign right to enforce its criminal laws, the power to pursue a criminal investigation of any acts which may constitute a crime in its own territory, as well as to investigate whether the claimants have made investments in accordance with the legal requirements set forth in the applicable general laws.\n\n93.\n\nRespondent also submitted that in the event the TAG Complaint gave rise to a criminal investigation, the proceeding would be governed, and the individuals affected would be protected, by guarantees afforded by Argentina\u2019s National Constitution and the international instruments to which Argentina is a party.80 Respondent also asserted that in the Spanish legal system there are similar guarantees and recalls that in the criminal proceeding in Spain for concealment of assets, Mr. D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n, together with other accused parties, pleaded guilty at trial of the crimes attributed to them and they accepted sentences for such offenses. Furthermore, the guarantees of due process and the right to defense in the local expropriation trial were also respected.81\n\nCore principles governing the criminal procedure in Argentina include due process of law guarantee, the principles of legality, innocence, and the non-retroactive nature of criminal laws. Respondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6 59.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 56-71.\n\n94.\n\nFinally, Respondent submitted that Claimants had failed to explain the urgency which would justify granting any provisional measures. Whatever the outcome of the TAG Complaint, Respondent submitted that a decision on it would not be issued before the Tribunal renders its final award in this arbitration. Therefore, according to Respondent, there is clearly no urgency or danger in the delay for Claimants.82 Relying on the decision of the International Court of Justice in the *Asylum Case*, Respondent submitted that the danger of being made subject to an ordinary court proceeding does not constitute a case of urgency, nor does any right exist to request protection against the ordinary action of justice, given that such an action would entail hindering the application of the law, and it would therefore amount to a guarantee of immunity. Therefore, as found in *Caratube v. Kazakhstan I*, no provisional measures which unduly infringe the sovereign right of any State to carry out criminal proceedings should be granted.83\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6 73.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Response, \u00b6\u00b6 77-80.\n\n**C. Claimants\u2019 Reply**\n-----------------------\n\n95.\n\nWith their Reply, Claimants submitted a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint and modified and expanded their Application in light of it. In their Reply, Claimants covered three principal topics: (i) immunity under the ICSID Convention; (ii) the Complaints; and (iii) Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures.\n\n**1. Immunity Under The ICSID Convention**\n------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nArticles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention grant immunity against legal process to persons appearing in ICSID arbitration proceedings with respect to acts performed by them in the exercise of their functions. Claimants submitted that this includes them, their representatives and their legal counsel. Claimants relied on the decisions in *Caratube v. Kazakhstan I* and *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey84* and submitted that immunity granted by Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention is applicable even without a specific order of an ICSID tribunal. According to Claimants, the right and duty to investigate crime cannot mean that by starting a criminal investigation, a State may baulk an ICSID arbitration.85\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/06/08 (\"*Libananco v. Turkey*\").\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 17.\n\n97.\n\nClaimants submitted that in the present case, Respondent had initiated criminal investigations into an alleged fraud perpetrated by Claimants and their representatives and agents in this proceeding. According to Claimants, there is no doubt that all of these individuals are \"persons appearing in proceedings under this Convention\" in the terms of Article 22 of the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, the underlying acts for which these individuals are being investigated are directly related to their participation in this ICSID arbitration, either as Claimants\u2019 representatives (*i.e.*, the receivers), funder (Burford) or lawyers and paralegals (members of the law firms King & Spalding and Fargosi & Asociados). Finally, Claimants submitted that the PROCELAC Complaint is based on facts and allegations before this Tribunal. Therefore, all of the acts mentioned in the PROCELAC Complaint are covered by the immunity against legal process under Article 22 of the ICSID Convention and the Tribunal should, therefore, order Respondent to cease and desist its criminal investigations.86\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20. The Claimants also submitted that ICSID tribunals have interpreted the immunities and privileges under Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention in broad terms.\n\n**2. The Complaints**\n---------------------\n\n98.\n\nClaimants submitted that Respondent has aggravated the dispute by initiating criminal proceedings against them, their counsel, and their third-party funder on the basis of the arguments and evidence that Respondent has placed before the Tribunal in these arbitral proceedings.87 Based on a preliminary review of the PROCELAC Complaint, Claimants noted that it alleges that Claimants, their court-appointed receivers, their funder, their counsel, and any other individual or juridical person that may be identified during the criminal investigation, may have committed two crimes: fraud against the Argentine public administration (Article 174(5) of the ACC), and, pursuant to Law 14,034, the crime of \"fostering political or economic sanctions against the State,\" specifically targeting the Argentine nationals that currently represent Claimants in this arbitration.88\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 22.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 28.\n\n99.\n\nWith respect to the latter, Claimants submitted that if the mere appearance of Argentine nationals as Claimants\u2019 counsel is a crime subject to the very severe penalties under Argentine law, then Claimants submitted that their right to pursue their investment claims under the BIT and freely design their legal strategy is unlawfully restricted by Argentine law. According to Claimants, Respondent cannot argue at the same time that Argentine law governs this dispute and also that Claimants are not entitled to be assisted by Argentine lawyers. Hence, Claimants submitted that the Tribunal should adopt the necessary measures to allow them to continue presenting their case in the manner they deem fit, and protecting their right to freely choose counsel in this arbitration and in any ensuing proceedings to enforce a potential award and to preserve the immunity provided in Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention.89\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 30.\n\n100.\n\nClaimants then addressed and contested a number of the allegations that the PROCELAC Complaint contains.90 They also argued that the allegations of the PROCELAC\u2019s prosecutor not only contradict applicable international law, such as the ICSID Convention, but also contradict Argentine law because Law 14,034 should be considered repealed under Argentina\u2019s current constitutional regime.91\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 34-44.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 31.\n\n101.\n\nIn sum, according to Claimants, both the TAG Complaint and the PROCELAC Complaint represent an abuse of Argentina\u2019s domestic criminal process for the purpose of avoiding the payment of compensation required under international law for the admitted expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment in Argentina. They further represent an attempt to intimidate Claimants, their court-appointed receivers, their attorneys, their funder, and even this Tribunal, to illicitly influence the final award.92\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 46.\n\n**3. Claimants\u2019 Request For Provisional Measures**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nClaimants asserted that the Tribunal has the power to issue the provisional measures requested and noted that Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules set forth the requirements of an application for provisional measures.93\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 47-49.\n\n103.\n\nClaimants submitted that Article 47 of the ICSID Convention allows the Tribunal to grant provisional measures based on two, and only two, criteria: (a) the \"provisional measures should be taken to preserve the rights of either Party;\" and (b) the \"circumstances must so require it.\" According to Claimants, the latter standard has been interpreted as meaning that the provisional measures be both \"necessary\" and \"urgent.\"94\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6 50.\n\n104.\n\nIn particular, Claimants asserted that the requested provisional measures (i) would be taken to preserve Claimants\u2019 rights,95 (ii) are necessary to preserve them and avoid significant harm,96 and (iii) it is urgent that the Tribunal issue them.97\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 52-62.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 63-75.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 76-79.\n\n105.\n\nWith respect to preservation of their rights, Claimants submitted that by launching the criminal proceedings, Respondent was unlawfully seeking to prevent Claimants from pursuing their BIT claim and eventually enforcing this Tribunal\u2019s final award. Relying on the findings in *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine98* and *City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*,99 Claimants noted that provisional measures are appropriate to preserve a tribunal\u2019s mission to determine finally the issues between the parties and to protect a party from actions that prejudice the implementation of an eventual award. Provisional measures are thus necessary to preserve Claimants\u2019 right to access to justice and to enforce their rights under the BIT.100\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/02/18.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/06/21 (\"*City Oriente v. Ecuador*\").\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 52-54.\n\n106.\n\nAccording to Claimants, other rights affected by Respondent\u2019s criminal accusations include the obstruction of their right to present an effective defense (*i.e.*, without improper interference from Respondent), and Claimants\u2019 right to access to legal counsel, both of which have been acknowledged by the *Quiborax v. Bolivia* and *Libananco v. Turkey* tribunals.101 In addition, the provisional measures are necessary to preserve Claimants\u2019 rights to the *status quo* (and restoration thereof) and to the non-aggravation of the dispute. Claimants also submitted that Respondent\u2019s conduct increased its damages by way of expenses incurred in relation to the criminal defense in Argentina, reputational moral damages, and further breaches to the fair and equitable treatment standard provided for in the BIT.102\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b655.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 57-61.\n\n107.\n\nIn respect of irreparable harm, Claimants maintained that there is no stand-alone requirement to prove irreparable harm for granting provisional measures. Referring to the Tribunal\u2019s reasons in Procedural Order No. 4, Claimants said that the only requirement is to demonstrate urgency and necessity. In this regard, Claimants submitted that necessity means that provisional measures must be required to avoid harm or prejudice, including harm caused to the integrity of ICSID arbitration proceedings, being inflicted upon the applicant. Claimants noted that the alleged requirement that harm must be \"irreparable\" is not found in Article 37 of the ICSID Convention or Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that many tribunals have found that the harm at risk need only be significant. They also submitted that a number of tribunals have found that a direct relationship between criminal proceedings and an ICSID arbitration may justify the preservation of a claimant\u2019s rights in ICSID arbitrations by way of provisional measures.103\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b663, 65 and the various sources cited there.\n\n108.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the provisional measures are necessary to protect their ability to pursue their claims before the Tribunal for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022 Respondent\u2019s criminal proceedings and the international media campaign it has staged have created an atmosphere designed to hinder Claimants\u2019 ability to pursue their claims before the Tribunal by exerting undue pressure on Claimants to desist from the claim, on their counsel to desist from representing their clients in this arbitration, and on their funder, Burford, to cease to provide funds to Claimants.\n\n\u2022 If the requested measures are not granted, Respondent may continue to exert such pressure during any future annulment or enforcement proceedings, given that Respondent has stated that the criminal proceedings it has initiated might take years.\n\n\u2022 Respondent\u2019s measures threaten the *status quo* of the arbitration and threaten to aggravate and extend the dispute. The measures also disregard the immunities provided for in Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention. The use of Argentina\u2019s court system to antagonize the Parties and unduly intimidate Claimants to desist from their complaint in this arbitration is sufficient to demonstrate irreparable harm.\n\n\u2022 Respondent\u2019s conduct complained of undermines the integrity of the arbitral proceedings, which cannot be compensated by a monetary award.\n\n\u2022 The criminal proceedings are exclusively based on arguments and submissions made before this Tribunal. In this regard, Respondent is undermining the integrity of the process by having recourse to an alternative forum in violation of Articles 26 and 53 of the ICSID Convention. The criminal investigation against Claimants\u2019 counsel and funder are intended to deprive Claimants of the legal expertise and capital required to advance their claims in this arbitration.\n\n\u2022 The due process rights of Claimants, their representatives, counsel and funder would be compromised in the domestic criminal proceedings despite Respondent\u2019s assurances. In this regard, Claimants\u2019 concerns are said to be illustrated by Respondent\u2019s refusal to produce a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint when requested to do so by the Tribunal.\n\n\u2022 Respondent\u2019s statements with respect to the time required for the criminal investigations to take place are not accurate. Within two months of Respondent\u2019s Response, the PROCELAC has concluded its investigation and has proceeded to file a complaint with the Public Prosecutor.\n\n\u2022 Suspending the criminal proceedings would not disproportionately burden Respondent. While Claimants would suffer irreparable harm if the provisional measures are not granted, Respondent would not incur any meaningful harm. Further, the Spanish creditors in Claimants\u2019 insolvency proceedings have no legal basis for a double recovery. Any payment by Respondent would be made pursuant to an award issued by an ICSID tribunal and it is unlikely that the Spanish authorities would consider that Respondent was in breach of any legal obligation for complying with any such award.104\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b674-75.\n\n109.\n\nOn the question of urgency, Claimants argued that, according to ICSID jurisprudence, such as in *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania,105* \"urgency\" simply means that the provisional relief cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits. Claimants state that Respondent\u2019s argument that the criminal proceedings will take considerable time assumes that no adverse consequences or harm will arise unless and until the parties investigated are either indicted or convicted. However, the mere fact that the criminal investigation has given rise to a formal complaint before the Argentine courts while Claimants\u2019 Application was pending indicates that the granting of interim measures cannot await the issuance of an award on the merits. Claimants submit that contrary to Respondent\u2019s characterization of its criminal proceedings, these are not a legitimate exercise of a State\u2019s police powers. Rather, the criminal investigation is intended to deprive Claimants of the legal expertise and capital to advance their claims in arbitration and to, ultimately, avoid complying with the final award.106\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/05/22 (\"*Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*\").\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b676-77.\n\n110.\n\nFinally, Claimants submitted that this criminal proceeding is not a legitimate exercise of a State\u2019s police powers. Rather, the criminal investigation is tailored to deprive Claimants of the legal expertise and capital to advance their claims before this Tribunal and ultimately to avoid complying with the final award.107\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b676-79.\n\n111.\n\nAs indicated previously, Claimants modified and extended the scope of the relief requested in their Application. They revised their request for relief to request the award of the following provisional measures:\n\n(i) confirm that Argentina\u2019s conduct is in violation of Article 22 of the ICSID Convention;\n\n(ii) order Argentina to restore the status quo ante by ceasing and desisting the criminal investigation;\n\n(iii) order Argentina to refrain from further harassing Claimants, their counsel, and their funder through baseless domestic proceedings and unlawful resort to the media;\n\n(iv) enjoin Argentina from otherwise further aggravating the dispute between the Parties;\n\n(v) order Argentina to pay the costs of this provisional measures proceeding;\n\n(vi) order Argentina to pay the cost of Claimants\u2019, their representatives\u2019, counsel\u2019s, and funder\u2019s cost of defense in the local criminal proceedings;\n\n(vii) order Argentina to pay Claimants damages for moral and reputational injuries inflicted on their counsel and funder; and\n\n(viii) order Argentina to provide satisfaction to Claimants.\n\nAdditionally, if Argentina fails to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s order regarding (ii), (iii) and (iv), Claimants request a finding in the final award that Argentina has further violated the Treaty\u2019s obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment.108\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.\n\n**D. Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder**\n-----------------------------\n\n112.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent repeated its position that Claimants\u2019 Application does not meet the requirements for the provisional measures to be granted. In particular, it submitted that (i) the provisional measures requested are not intended to protect a right of Claimants in connection with their claim before ICSID;109 (ii) there is no risk of irreparable harm for Claimants;110 and (iii) there is no urgency or danger in the delay for Claimants.111\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 11-40.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 41-83.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 84-98.\n\n**1. There Is No Right Sought To Be Protected In Connection With Claimants\u2019 Claim Before ICSID**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent submitted that (1) there is no threat to exclusivity, *status**quo*, non-aggravation of the dispute or integrity of the proceeding;112 and (2) immunity does not mean impunity.113\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 11-22.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 23-40.\n\n114.\n\nRespondent asserted that in their Application, Claimants had failed to identify the rights that are the subject of their claim before ICSID whose protection they seek by way of Claimants\u2019 Application. Further, Claimants had stated in their Application that the TAG Complaint challenged by them did not undermine those rights.114 Without identifying the rights whose protection they sought, Claimants in their Application merely stated that the criminal complaint in question undermined the integrity of the arbitration in violation of Articles 26 and 53 of the ICSID Convention.115 According to Respondent, Claimants simply state that \"Argentina\u2019s criminal proceedings do not constitute a legitimate exercise of a State\u2019s police powers,\" but fail to provide any evidence to support their assertion. In this regard, Claimants had failed to meet their burden of proof.116\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 11.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 12.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 14.\n\n115.\n\nIn respect of the element of necessity pleaded by Claimants, Respondent maintained that generally stating that a criminal investigation affects the *status quo* aggravates the dispute and undermines the integrity of the proceeding is not sufficient for a provisional measure to be granted.117 Relying on the decision of the tribunal in *Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd. v. Republic of Indonesia*,118 Respondent argued that without any concrete element of intimidation, harassment or otherwise abusive behavior, provisional measures cannot be justified. In Respondent\u2019s view, Claimants in this case have not met their burden of proof, since merely claiming that being the subject of a criminal investigation is intimidating does not suffice to obtain protection through provisional measures.119\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and ARB/12/40 (\"*Churchill Mining v. Indonesia*\").\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 16-19 and the sources cited there.\n\n116.\n\nFinally, Respondent cited the findings of tribunals to the effect that when issuing provisional measures the State\u2019s sovereignty should not be unduly encroached.120\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21 and the sources cited there.\n\n117.\n\nWith regard to the question of immunity, Respondent asserted that the immunity provided for in Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention is functional, *i.e.*, *ratione materiae*, and not *ratione personae*, as Claimants incorrectly plead in their Reply. Respondent cited the decision of the International Court of Justice in the Case concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 to support its assertion that the invocation of arguments of immunity to obtain impunity cannot be admitted.121\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 24.\n\n118.\n\nRespondent distinguished between personal immunity (granted to Heads of State from the jurisdiction of foreign courts while in office) from functional immunity (granted only with respect to specifically identified acts). It then relied on the wording of Article 21 of the ICSID Convention and cited the preparatory work of the Convention where it was noted \"that parties would in fact be immune only in respect of acts done before the tribunal as parties to the dispute.\" Thus, in Respondent\u2019s view, the acts of persons appearing in ICSID proceedings that are not performed \"in the exercise of their functions\" fall outside the scope of the immunities set forth in Article 22 of the ICSID Convention.122\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.\n\n119.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Complaints instituted by the Argentine Treasury Attorney\u2019s General Office and PROCELAC are related to the Funding Agreement between Burford and Claimants, as well as to the possible commission of the crime of attempted fraud. It maintained that the subject matter of the Complaints does not relate to an event that took place before the Tribunal. Rather, the TAG Complaint was based on the Funding Agreement, which Respondent discovered during these proceedings and submitted in evidence, and on the exchange of communications between Burford and the court-appointed receivers of Air Comet, which allegedly came to the knowledge of Respondent and was submitted in the arbitration proceedings with the Tribunal\u2019s leave in early 2015.123 Consequently, the subject of the criminal proceedings did not take place before the Tribunal but is, in fact, external to these arbitration proceedings. Further, Claimants\u2019 reliance on *Caratube v. Kazakhstan I* (concerning witness intimidation) and *Libananco v. Turkey* (where there was a breach of the lawyer-client privilege by intercepting communications between Libananco Holdings Co. Limited and its counsel) is factually inapposite in light of the different circumstances of this case.124\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 32 and the source cited there. The Respondent goes on to allege that Claimants attempted to keep these circumstances secret.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 31-36.\n\n120.\n\nFinally, Respondent submitted that during the hearing on jurisdiction, Claimants did not claim that there had been violation of immunities, nor question the independence of the Argentine judiciary, when two witnesses (Mr. D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n and Mr. Pascual Arias, the ultimate shareholders of Claimants) reported that they had been summoned before Argentine criminal courts in another investigation. On this basis, Claimants\u2019 Application is at odds with their previous position and cannot be accepted because it violates the principle of good faith and more specifically the prohibition of *venire contra factum proprium*.125\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39. The Respondent noted that the criminal proceedings in question were at a much more advanced stage than the [Complaints] on which the [Application] is based.\" The criminal investigation in question was stated to be those before National Criminal Court No. 27, Secretariat 124 of the City of Buenos Aires (which appear to have been commenced in 2002 in relation to the alleged [...]\n\n**2. There Is No Risk Of Irreparable Harm For Claimants**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nRespondent contended that (1) the Complaints do not pose a risk of irreparable harm;126 (2) the Complaints were made in compliance with a legal duty;127 and (3) court proceedings are sufficiently guaranteed.128\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 46-57.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 58-65.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 66-83.\n\n122.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Complaints do not pose a risk of irreparable harm, nor do they jeopardize Claimants\u2019 ability to develop their claims before this Tribunal, contrary to Claimants\u2019 assertions. Respondent says that Claimants\u2019 allegations have not been proved or even alleged on a concrete basis, but are merely generic statements with no supporting documentation or evidence. Further, Respondent said that the Complaints are only the first step in the beginning of criminal investigations. The investigations themselves are still to be carried out, and the courts have to decide whether there is sufficient merit for the respective criminal cases to continue their course.129 In Respondent\u2019s view, it is not reasonable to seek the suspension of a criminal investigation before the clarification of the events under investigation.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 47.\n\n123.\n\nRespondent also submitted that provisional measures are, by definition, temporary and meant to cease upon the issuance of the award that settles the dispute. Claimants\u2019 submissions appeared to request the issuance of a measure whose effects persist beyond the award, which is clearly inadmissible. Further, Claimants request specific relief on the merits, such as compensation and moral damages, which are not appropriate in an application for provisional measures.130\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 46-50.\n\n124.\n\nWith regard to the second defence, Respondent stated that the TAG Complaint was simply aimed at informing the relevant authorities of the possible commission of a crime requiring public prosecution of which it had become aware, and the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office considered that there was sufficient evidence to initiate the appropriate preliminary investigation.131 Claimants\u2019 submission that the legal and factual issues raised in the TAG Complaint are closely related to the issues that have been extensively discussed in this arbitration are opportunistic and contradict Claimants\u2019 original position when they first became acquainted with the complaint: \"the criminal complaint that Attorney General Abbona filed on February 23, 2015 - whatever its content may be - has nothing to do with the merits of this arbitration.\"132 Respondent contended that such criminal proceedings do not affect the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.133\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 58-60.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 62.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 64.\n\n125.\n\nIn respect of its third defence, Respondent referred again to the lack of objection by Claimants concerning the criminal proceedings in Argentina involving Messrs. D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n and Pascual Arias and which were referred to during the hearing on jurisdiction and considered this to be sufficient to dismiss Claimants\u2019 Application.134 Further, Respondent submitted that the current status of the PROCELAC Complaint is that it is still within the preliminary investigation stage. Therefore, the investigation into the possible commission of criminal offenses has no impact on the resolution of this arbitration and there is no urgency to justify the issuance of provisional measures.135\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 69-73.\n\n126.\n\nRespondent also reiterated that the criminal proceedings will be based on the guarantees enshrined in the Argentine Constitution and international instruments with constitutional status. Hence, the guarantees to achieve an independent and impartial administration of justice are protected under Argentine law.136 Finally, according to Respondent, Claimants can rely upon another due process guarantee, which relates to the possibility of resorting to a system of subsidiary protection of rights - the Inter-American system of human rights protection, once all internal avenues of protection of their fundamental rights and freedoms are exhausted, and of obtaining a favorable judgment.137\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 75-82.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 82-83.\n\n**3. There Is No Urgency Or Danger In The Delay For Claimants**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nRespondent submitted that Claimants\u2019 conduct in this arbitration confirms that the measures requested are not urgent. Claimants\u2019 Application was submitted nearly four months after the TAG Complaint that motivated such requests was filed in February 2015.138 Respondent also noted that during the proceedings on provisional measures, Claimants requested that deadlines be extended and a hearing be held. Respondent asserted that these facts show that the provisional measure requested is not \"urgent\" for this Tribunal to grant it.139\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 84, 88.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 89.\n\n128.\n\nRespondent also suggested that Claimants had misrepresented its position by contending that it allegedly stated that the TAG Complaint would not give rise to a \"criminal complaint\" in the near future. Respondent said that what it asserted was that it was to be expected that a \"decision\" on the TAG Complaint would not be issued before the Tribunal renders its final award.140\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 93-94, 96.\n\n129.\n\nFinally, Respondent noted that Claimants again referred to the International Court of Justice decision in the *Asylum* case for \"the principle that \u2018urgent cases\u2019 do not include the danger of regular prosecution\" and stated that Claimants had not demonstrated that the exception to that principle, that arbitrary action had been substituted for the rule of law.141\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 96-97.\n\n130.\n\nHence, according to Respondent, the measures requested by Claimants do not meet the \"urgency\" requirement that must be satisfied for a provisional measure to be granted by this Tribunal.\n\n**E. The Parties\u2019 Oral Submissions**\n------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nIn their oral submissions, Claimants clarified and expanded upon their previous written submissions, taking into account Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder. By way of overview, Claimants stated that while they recognized that a State has authority to investigate and prosecute real crime, it has no right to abuse its criminal process for an improper purpose such as harassing or intimidating counsel or parties by trying to undermine the integrity of the arbitration and the award.142\n\nHearing transcripts (\"TR\"), p 15.\n\n132.\n\nClaimants emphasized what they said are the mistaken premises of the criminal proceedings and the lack of merit of the TAG Complaint, the PROCELAC Complaint and the investigation commenced by the Public Prosecutor. In this regard, Respondent\u2019s fundamental premise that it might have to pay Claimants or their creditors twice is false since the creditors have brought no other claims against Argentina and the only form in which they can obtain compensation is through Claimants in this arbitration.143\n\nTR, pp 16-17. The Claimants suggested that the Respondent is not seeking to protect the creditors but, rather, to avoid compensating them.\n\n133.\n\nClaimants also addressed each of the criminal allegations raised in the Complaints, noting that each of them was intimately linked to the arbitration and matters before the Tribunal. In this regard, Claimants say that the claims against their Argentine counsel for a breach of Article 1 of Law 14,034 were clearly stated in the PROCELAC Complaint to be purely on the basis of their participation as counsel before the Tribunal in these proceedings and would deny Claimants in this case, and in any other case, access to local law expertise and have a chilling effect on the exercise of ICSID arbitration rights in general.144 Claimants also submitted that Law 14,034 could not have been intended to apply in the circumstances of this case and that pursuing complaints against Claimants\u2019 Argentine counsel on this basis constituted a violation of international law, the United Nations Convention on Human Rights and Article 22 of the ICSID Convention, amongst others.\n\nTR, pp 19, 53-58; PROCELAC Complaint, Exhibit C-1198, pp 22, 24. The Claimants refer to the complaint relating to Law 14,034 as the peace time equivalent of an allegation of treason.\n\n134.\n\nWith respect to the allegations of fraud contained in the Complaints, Claimants submitted that each of these was based on arguments or evidence before the Tribunal and the subject of its inquiry. In this respect, Claimants say that the PROCELAC Complaint bases one of its allegations of fraud on the fact that Claimants have brought a derived or indirect claim which is inadmissible under the BIT. The PROCELAC Complaint also notes that although Respondent put forward this argument in the arbitration proceedings in the jurisdictional phase, the issue has yet to be resolved \".even though it is an essential point of the allegedly illegal manoeuvre that is intended against the Argentine Republic and the bankruptcy creditors.\"145 Claimants point out that this issue was considered and rejected as a basis to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in the Decision on Jurisdiction at paragraphs 208 through 214.\n\nTR, pp 39-40, 78-79; PROCELAC Complaint, Exhibit C-1198, pp 11-13.\n\n135.\n\nWith respect to the allegations of fraud based on the Funding Agreement and the Assignment Agreement, Claimants submit that these agreements were found by the Tribunal, in the Decision on Jurisdiction, not to have affected the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and were currently before the Tribunal which had received substantial evidence that the agreements in question had been approved by Air Comet\u2019s and Claimants\u2019 insolvency receivers and approved by the Spanish courts.146 In addition, Claimants said that the court-appointed receivers have repeatedly confirmed their approval and the continuing validity of the Funding Agreement, most recently in their sworn notarized declarations submitted as Exhibit C-1200.147 With respect to the Assignment Agreement, Claimants submitted that it clearly only assigned the proceeds of an eventual award to Air Comet, after payment of fees owed to Burford and counsel and did not transfer any claims or right to a claim, which remained with Claimants. They also noted that the Assignment Agreement had been disclosed in the insolvency proceedings and it has not been challenged in any court or by any creditor.148\n\nTR, pp 23, 40-48.\n\nTR, p 46; Claimants\u2019 demonstrative slides 34-36.\n\nTR, pp 46-47.\n\n136.\n\nFinally, with respect to King & Spalding\u2019s authorization to represent Claimants, Claimants submitted that this issue was also squarely before the Tribunal and there was substantial evidence before it in support of the ongoing validity of the relevant powers of attorney, including repeated statements from Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers.149\n\nTR, pp 20-22, 48-53; Claimants\u2019 demonstrative slides 42-47. Claimants also said that Respondent\u2019s suggestion, at Exhibit C-1198, p 23, that. the legal representatives of King & Spalding would have included in the case file invalid documents that accredit said capacity, in an attempt to induce the arbitral tribunal into error, and in this manner obtain a ruling that obliges the Argentine state to make a payment to its detriment and to the detriment of the creditors, leading to the referred criminal concept..is completely contradicted by the sworn, notarized statements of Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers, Exhibit C-1200. The Claimants also submitted that the criminal chamber of the Spanish *Audiencia Nacional* of 7 September 2015, Exhibit C-1210, recognized the legal representation of Claimants by King & Spalding in these proceedings.\n\n137.\n\nWith respect to each of these issues, Claimants submitted that they were properly before the Tribunal and that by commencing the criminal proceedings, Respondent was attempting to supersede or impede the Tribunal\u2019s determination of these issues, thereby demonstrating that the criminal proceedings relate to the arbitration and violate the principle of exclusivity of ICSID jurisdiction set out in Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.150\n\nTR, pp 77-79; Claimants\u2019 opening statement slides 61-68, 81.\n\n138.\n\nClaimants also submitted that the Complaints and the criminal investigation commenced by the Federal Prosecutor breached a number of their protected rights, including their right to enforce their rights under the BIT through ICSID arbitration conducted fairly and in good faith, the right to the exclusivity provided for in Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, the right to have the Tribunal determine its own jurisdiction and the merits of the case, the right of immunity of counsel, representatives and agents under Article 22 of the ICSID Convention, the preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute, and the right to an enforceable award under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention. Claimants submitted that all of these rights related to the integrity of the arbitration proceedings, which the Tribunal had the authority to control in its inherent jurisdiction.151 Claimants also emphasized that Respondent, through the joint press conference held by the Treasury Attorney General and the head of PROCELAC had unnecessarily and improperly publicized the Complaints, thereby aggravating the dispute and harming Claimants, their counsel, their court-appointed receivers and their funder.152\n\nTR, pp 25-28, 70-79.\n\nTR, pp 26-27, 32-33; PowerPoint presentation used at the press conference and transcript of the press conference. In addition, Claimants emphasized that the press conference had been televised and made accessible on the PROCELAC\u2019s website.\n\n139.\n\nIn their oral submissions, Claimants further developed their claim and relief requested in respect of the immunity provided by Article 22 of the ICSID Convention. In this regard, Claimants submitted that Argentina is bound by Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention and that each of Claimants, their court-appointed receivers, their counsel and their funder were covered by the immunity provided for in Article 22 of the ICSID Convention from legal process, including the Complaints and criminal investigation. Claimants also submitted that the Complaints and the criminal investigation breached Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention by targeting protected individuals with respect to acts performed by them in the exercise of their functions in pursuit of the arbitration. According to Claimants, Respondent\u2019s conduct in pursuing the Complaints and criminal investigation was intended to intimidate and coerce Claimants, their court-appointed receivers, their counsel and their funder and to derail the arbitration and frustrate the enforcement of the final award. This conduct justifies the granting of the provisional measure requested to order Respondent to cease and desist from pursuing the criminal investigation as well as the permanent injunction requested in this regard.\n\n140.\n\nIn addition, Claimants submitted that they had the legitimate expectation that their BIT arbitration with Respondent would proceed as provided by the ICSID Convention, including the immunity afforded by Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention. Claimants submitted that Respondent\u2019s breach of the expectation, protected by the terms of the BIT, was justiciable as such.153\n\nTR, pp 59-60; Claimants\u2019 demonstrative slides 57, 69.\n\n141.\n\nClaimants submitted that each of them, their court-appointed receivers, their counsel and their funder154 were covered by the immunity afforded by Article 22 of the ICSID Convention on the basis of the clear language in that article as \"persons appearing in proceedings under [the Convention] as parties, agents, counsel, advocates, witnesses or experts.\" Further, Claimants submitted that, contrary to Respondent\u2019s argument, the Complaints and criminal investigation specifically targeted acts performed in pursuit of the arbitration and reviewed the criminal offences alleged in the Complaints. According to Claimants, the allegations contained in the Complaints and the subject of the criminal investigation repeatedly refer to this arbitration and matters before the Tribunal, including Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction based on an indirect or \"derivative\" claim, the Funding Agreement which was executed exclusively in pursuit of the arbitration and King & Spalding\u2019s authority to represent Claimants in the arbitration.155\n\nWith respect to Claimants\u2019 funder, Burford, Claimants submitted that as an \"agent\" of Claimants, it was covered in the same manner as the escrow agent was found to covered by immunity under Article 22 of the ICSID Convention in the tribunal\u2019s Decision on Preliminary Issues, dated 23 June 2008, in the *Libananco v. Turkey* case. According to Claimants, they were required to turn to a litigation funder after the Respondent\u2019s uncompensated expropriation of their investment in order to permit them to pursue the arbitration. See TR, pp 60-61.\n\nTR, pp 61-67; Claimants\u2019 demonstrative slides 60-68.\n\n142.\n\nAs concerns the relief sought by Claimants, at the Hearing they refined their request as follows:\n\nAs provisional measures:\n\ni. Declare that Argentina has breached the rights to be protected (*e.g.*, Claimants\u2019 right to good-faith ICSID arbitration, including immunity under Articles 21/22, preservation of the *status quo*, and non-aggravation of the dispute)\n\nii. Order Argentina to (a) restore the *status quo ante* by ceasing and desisting the criminal investigation and (b) refrain from further aggravating the dispute\n\nIn the final award:\n\ni. Permanently enjoin Argentina from criminally prosecuting Claimants and their representatives, counsel and funder, for actions taken in relation to this Arbitration\n\nii. Order Argentina to pay the costs of this provisional measures proceeding\n\niii. Order Argentina to pay the cost of Claimants\u2019 and their representatives\u2019, counsel\u2019s and funder\u2019s cost of defense in the local criminal proceedings\n\niv. Order Argentina to pay Claimants damages for moral and reputational injuries inflicted on their representatives, counsel and funder156\n\nClaimants\u2019 demonstrative slide 99.\n\n143.\n\nFurther, Claimants explained the relief requested in the following terms:\n\nSo, first, as interim relief, we request that [the Tribunal] make a declaration that Argentina has violated each of the rights at issue. and then, second, as interim relief, we request that [the Tribunal] order Argentina to cease and desist from the criminal proceedings, and order it, once again, not to further aggravate or extend the dispute until such time as the Tribunal issues its Final Award.\n\nNow, that is all that we are seeking... as immediate, urgent interim relief, and we ask that [the Tribunal] issue an order to that effect as soon as possible.\n\nNow, the remaining requests. can all be deferred and be incorporated into the Final Award. And these include, perhaps most importantly, a request that [the Tribunal] convert the interim injunction into a permanent one that would forever bar Argentina from criminally prosecuting Claimants, their agents, counsel, and funder for actions taken during the course of and in relation to this arbitration for which we had ICSID immunity.\n\nIn addition, the Award should include all costs of this Provisional Measures hearing, reimbursement by Argentina of the attorney\u2019s fees that Claimants, their representatives, counsel, and funder have incurred in defending against the criminal accusations in Argentina, and damages for moral and reputational injury to Claimants, their representatives, counsel, and funder, and all these additional damages should also include a compound post-Award interest.157\n\nClaimants\u2019 demonstrative slide 99; TR, pp 85-87. The Claimants then went on to provide argument and refer to various decisions in support of both the interim and permanent relief sought. In respect of the remedy of satisfaction, which Claimants had set out in their request for relief in their Reply, they submitted that this was properly due for the various breaches of international law committed by the Respondent, including the breach of the right to immunity under Article 22 of the ICSID Convention, the right to an arbitration conducted in good faith, the right to preservation of the *status quo*, and the right to fair and equitable treatment under the BIT. They went on to state that insofar as the remedy of satisfaction was concerned, Claimants believed that a declaration of the Respondent\u2019s breaches would be sufficient remedy: see TR, pp 86-87.\n\n144.\n\nBy way of a general response to the various aspects of the relief requested in Claimants\u2019 Application, Respondent submitted that requests for a declaration of a breach of international law and any request for compensation was beyond the appropriate scope of an application for interim measures. According to Respondent, such requests were issues on the merits of an award, and not intended to be addressed in an application for interim measures.158 In addition, Respondent submitted that Claimants\u2019 request that the Tribunal make a finding of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the BIT in the event that Respondent did not comply with a number of the provisional measures requested was also clearly beyond the scope of an application for interim measures. In this regard, Respondent noted that Claimants were requesting new substantive relief in this arbitration and that such new claims cannot be introduced by a claimant after the submission of its reply on the merits without the authorization of the tribunal, which had not been requested or obtained in this case.159\n\nTR, p 152.\n\nTR, pp 153-154. In addition, the Respondent submitted that by requesting relief on the merits and compensation for the breaches alleged by Claimants, the latter had demonstrated that, in fact, any damage or harm that they might suffer was compensable by damages and, therefore, not irreparable.\n\n145.\n\nRespondent repeated its position that there was no factual or legal basis for the provisional measures requested by Claimants.\n\n146.\n\nRespondent went on to submit that there were serious indicia in materials before the Tribunal to permit a reasonable suspicion that *prima facie* criminal conduct had occurred to the detriment of the mass of creditors in the Spanish insolvency proceedings affecting Claimants and to the detriment of the interest of Argentina. According to Respondent, the facts and conduct giving rise to this suspicion were completely outside of the realm of the arbitration proceedings and, therefore, were not protected by the immunities provided for in the ICSID Convention.\n\n147.\n\nRespondent also addressed the process pursuant to which the Complaints and the criminal investigation would be handled under Argentine law and the due process guarantees afforded by independent courts consistent with constitutional guarantees.\n\n148.\n\nRespondent also addressed the principles and rules of international law applicable in this case and Claimants\u2019 failure to meet the requirements for the grounding of provisional measures in this case, including the lack of an interest to be protected, the lack of urgency and the failure to demonstrate a risk of irreparable harm.160\n\nTR, pp 100-102.\n\n149.\n\nIn respect of the reasons which led the office of the Treasury Attorney General to file the TAG Complaint, Respondent stated that the basis for its reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct had been discovered in the arbitration proceedings when it learned that Claimants had assigned their right to collect on an eventual favorable award in this arbitration to Air Comet, after deduction of costs for their legal advisors, consultants and experts. Respondent noted that Claimants\u2019 funder, Burford, was not a party to this agreement and that Claimants and Air Comet were preparing a scenario conducive to the signing of the Funding Agreement. The Funding Agreement was then entered into, without the participation of Air Comet. Respondent said that pursuant to the terms of the Funding Agreement, Claimants turned to King & Spalding and Burford to take the necessary measures to ensure that the funds recovered in an eventual award in Claimants\u2019 favor would be deposited into an escrow account, satisfactory to Burford, located outside the United States. Thereafter, if Claimants receive any award proceeds, these shall be paid immediately to the nominated lawyers or the escrow account from which Claimants and Burford direct that the recovery amount due to Burford shall be paid as soon as practicable and then other outstanding invoices owed to counsel and consultants shall be paid, with the remainder going to Claimants. Respondent submitted that this structure established by the Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement was intended to elude the mass of creditors in the various insolvency proceedings affecting the Grupo Marsans, to which Claimants and Air Comet belong. They also noted that Mr. D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n, one of the ultimate shareholders of Claimants, and other individuals, have been convicted of concealment of assets and a conspiracy to defraud in the insolvency proceedings affecting Grupo Marsans.161\n\nTR, pp 106-113.\n\n150.\n\nRespondent said that it learned of the Assignment Agreement and Funding Agreement only by chance, in the context of the arbitration, and that they were not filed or disclosed by Claimants. Rather, Respondent said that Claimants refused to provide a copy of the Assignment Agreement when Respondent first requested a copy of it in April 2010.162 Further, Respondent said that the Funding Agreement was submitted in these proceedings by it, not Claimants.163 Respondent said that Claimants were not transparent in this regard and with respect to other information and documents of which it has learned in the court proceedings in Spain or by chance during the course of the arbitration hearing.164\n\nOn 23 April 2010, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal require that Claimants provide all available information with respect to a report in a newspaper article in which it was reported that Grupo Marsans had ceded part of its claim against Argentina to an investment fund in return for US $25 million to cover legal expenses. In response, on 28 May 2010, Claimants stated that they had not sold their claim as alleged and that no such transaction had occurred or was contemplated. They also objected to the request on the basis that they had no obligation to disclose agreements with third parties with respect to the funding of their costs of the arbitration and noted that the Respondent had not supported its request for the production of documents by demonstrating their necessity or otherwise complying with the usual requirements for production of documents. The Claimants also submitted that the question of financing of their costs did not affect the jurisdiction of the Tribunal: see Claimants letter of 28 May 2010. The Tribunal subsequently declined to order the production of the documents requested by the Respondent at that early stage of the proceedings: see the instructions of the Tribunal conveyed by the Secretariat\u2019s message of 16 June 2010.\n\nIt appears that the Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement were filed in the Air Comet insolvency proceedings and were acknowledged and approved by the administrators/receivers in Air Comet\u2019s insolvency. These then applied to the relevant court for approval of the Funding Agreement and specifically referred to the Assignment Agreement in their request. The court subsequently approved the administrators/receivers\u2019 consent to the Funding Agreement. It appears that the Funding Agreement was submitted in evidence in these proceedings by the Respondent who obtained a copy from the Spanish lawyer representing the Argentine Airlines as creditors in the insolvency proceedings of Air Comet and Claimants.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent mentioned the insolvency proceedings of Claimants and correspondence between the court-appointed receivers of Air Comet and Burford filed in the insolvency proceedings in Spain: TR, pp 109-110. The Respondent also questioned whether Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers had informed the court of the Respondent\u2019s counter-claim which would constitute another liability against the business of the Grupo Marsans: see TR, p 110.\n\n151.\n\nRespondent also pointed to the attempts by Claimants to extend or ratify the original powers of attorney granted to King & Spalding as adding to the well-founded nature of its suspicion of the commission of criminal conduct. In this regard, Respondent said that the three letters submitted by Claimants in 2013 (Exhibits C-842, C-843 and C-844) were manifestly flawed since they were not in public form, not dated and not approved or filed with the court and yet it was only shortly before the hearing on provisional measures that the court-appointed receivers sought to submit notarized statements confirming the powers of attorney and ratifying the representation of Claimants by King & Spalding. In any event, Respondent maintained that the notarized statements from the court-appointed receivers (submitted as Exhibit C-1200) were still deficient in that they did not show a date certain of the issuance of the letters and they do not show any approval or intervention by the judges in the insolvency proceedings.165\n\nTR, pp 119-121.\n\n152.\n\nAs a result, Respondent said that the office of the Treasury Attorney General had a well-founded suspicion that criminal conduct had occurred. Further, according to Respondent, the relevant facts and conduct, such as the signing of the Funding Agreement, are outside the scope of the arbitration.166\n\nTR, p 118.\n\n153.\n\nRespondent also further explained the legal duty on the office of the Treasury Attorney General to report any crimes liable to prosecution observed by public officials or employees.167 In accordance with that obligation, the office of the Treasury Attorney General had submitted its complaint to the office of the Prosecutor General and, specifically, the PROCELAC which is the specialized agency with the technical capability to investigate a possible economic crime. It was then up to the PROCELAC to conduct an investigation of the facts and information contained in the TAG Complaint and to draw up its conclusions and present them to the appropriate federal court.168\n\nPursuant to Article 177 of the ACC (Exhibit RA-691) and Article 249 of the ACC (Exhibit RA-692).\n\nTR, pp 122-123. The Respondent submitted that the office of the Treasury Attorney General and the PROCELAC acted pursuant to a legal duty and merely filed a criminal complaint. They did not promote a prosecution in strict legal terms and were not parties to any criminal action: see TR, pp 116-117.\n\n154.\n\nRespondent went on to explain and emphasize that the scope of the investigation that would be conducted as a result of the TAG Complaint and the PROCELAC Complaint was determined by the federal prosecutor in charge of the case who has conduct of the investigation. According to Respondent, in a note dated 21 September 2015, Federal Prosecutor Marijuan had defined a more limited scope of investigation.169 According to Respondent, the criminal investigation pursued by the Federal Prosecutor will address only the alleged maneuvers aimed at channeling payment of an eventual award by way of the Funding Agreement in order to elude the rights of the creditors in the insolvency proceedings in Spain, thereby exposing Respondent to the risk of having to make a payment which would not necessarily be final.170 As a result, since the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s note does not mention Law 14,034, no potential charges in respect of a breach of its provisions were being investigated.171\n\nSee the quoted passage from Federal Prosecutor Marijuan\u2019s note of 21 September 2015 at \u00b6 68, above: Exhibit C-1198.\n\nTR, pp 125-126, 167-169, 174-177.\n\nTR, pp 125-126, 164-165, 169.\n\n155.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent submitted that in his note, Federal Prosecutor Marijuan restricted the scope of the investigation to \".the legal representatives, officers or directors\" of Burford, Air Comet and Claimants. According to Respondent, under Argentine law the expression \"legal representatives\" (*representantes legales*) is a term of art having a specific meaning which includes only the authorized legal representatives of a company such as its president and officers or its directors and does not include legal counsel who may represent a party in litigation. As a result, Respondent stated that King & Spalding and its lawyers as well as Fargosi & Asociados and its lawyers were not included within the scope of the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s criminal investigation.172\n\nTR, pp 168-169, 174-178. The Respondent also submitted that the court-appointed receivers of Claimants were not included within the scope of the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s investigation since they were not the ones who represented Claimants with respect to the documents in question: TR, p 178.\n\n156.\n\nRespondent also reviewed the requirements for the granting of provisional measures and the relevant sequence of events and facts and submitted that on this basis Claimants had not demonstrated urgency,173 a right to be protected or any irreparable harm or effect on Claimants\u2019 ability to pursue the arbitration.174\n\nTR, pp 158-160.\n\nTR, pp 161-162. Amongst other things, the Respondent submitted that the investigation commenced by the Federal Prosecutor was merely at the investigative stage and that given that early status, there was no harm to the legal situation of Claimants in the arbitration: TR, p 156.\n\n157.\n\nIn respect of Claimants\u2019 submissions relating to immunity under the ICSID Convention, Respondent submitted that this was not an issue as far as counsel to Claimants were concerned since the criminal investigation did not include them within its scope.175 With respect to Burford, Respondent submitted that as a funder to Claimants it was not included within the scope of immunity provided for in Article 22 of the ICSID Convention. In this regard, Respondent pointed to the language of the Funding Agreement which specifically provided that nothing in the agreement created a fiduciary, lawyer client or agency relationship between Claimants and Burford.176 Respondent went on to distinguish Burford\u2019s status from that of the escrow agent in the *Libananco v. Turkey* case, noting that in the latter case the escrow agent held shares as part of a mechanism decided by the arbitral tribunal and was not an external funder.177\n\nTR, p 169.\n\nTR, pp 169-171. See also Funding Agreement, Exhibit RA-160, Article 15.3.\n\nTR, p 172. The Respondent also repeated its reference to the fact that Messrs. D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n and Pascual Arias had appeared to give testimony in an earlier criminal investigation commenced in 2002 and that Claimants had described those proceedings as simply at the investigative stage and had not raised any complaint in respect of that investigation or the hypothetical violation of the immunities provided for in the ICSID Convention. Similarly, in the present investigation, no specific accusations have been made and, therefore, there was no basis for complaint or possible grounds for a breach of any right to immunity under the ICSID Convention: TR, pp 126-128.\n\n158.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s submissions in respect of the narrowing of the scope of the criminal investigation by Federal Prosecutor Marijuan, Claimants made a number of points. Among these was the submission that the note itself made no reference to narrowing or setting the scope of the investigation. Rather, the note contained only a summary description of alleged \"maneuvers\" subject to the Complaints and goes on to refer to several documents, the three allegedly \"apocryphal\" letters from Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers and that the conduct subject of the investigation had the \"purpose of obtaining sums resulting from a potential award against the Argentine Republic illegally...\". As a result, Claimants submitted that the note actually maintained the full scope of the TAG Complaint and the PROCELAC Complaint.178 Claimants also pointed to language contained in the Request for Letters Rogatory issued by the Federal Prosecutor, which referred specifically to King & Spalding as the \"legal representative\" of Claimants and that they were alleged to have submitted \"invalid documents\" in the arbitration in order to certify their legal capacity.179 Claimants said that this contradicts Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Federal Prosecutor Marijuan\u2019s note as excluding counsel to Claimants from the scope of the criminal investigation.180\n\nTR, pp 196-198. The Claimants also maintained that the only reason they were able to obtain a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint and the investigation file was that Mr. Fargosi, Claimants\u2019 Argentine counsel, was granted access because he was the subject of or a party to the investigation.\n\nSee Exhibit C-1215, p 2: \"Having said that, and in order to set a legal framework to the request herein, I make known that based on the records appearing on the case file, King & Spalding law firm - legal representative of the companies Claimant before the ICSID - would have submitted invalid documents in the arbitration proceedings to certify its legal capacity, in an attempt to lead the Arbitration Court into error, thus making an award that would oblige the Argentine state to make a payment to the detriment of itself and of the creditors of the failed companies.\"\n\nTR, pp 200-202. The Claimants also referred to information contained on the Argentine Supreme Court\u2019s website which listed in its description of the PROCELAC Complaint both King & Spalding and Fargosi & Asociados and all of the individual lawyers involved as counsel in the arbitration. In addition, Claimants referred to the covering page of the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s file which listed as \"*imputados*\" in alphabetical order, the first two lawyers from King & Spalding acting as counsel for Claimants, followed by the summary reference to \"and others\" (*y otros*): see Exhibit C-1198. Further, Claimants also noted that in the English translation of the Letters Rogatory provided by the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s office, the term \"*representantes legales*\" used in referring to King & Spalding appeared as \"legal representative\": TR, pp 205-206; Exhibit C-1215. Finally, Claimants also alleged that even if the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Prosecutor Marijuan\u2019s note were correct, he could at any time broaden the scope of the proceedings.\n\n159.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s submissions regarding the inappropriateness of claiming substantive relief in an application for interim measures, Claimants submitted that in order to request interim measures they were required to establish the rights to be protected or a predicate for ordering the provisional measures. In this regard, Claimants submitted that as a predicate for the issuance of the restraining orders requested they had alleged various breaches of rights that entitled them to protection, including the right to immunity. In Claimants\u2019 submission, it would be entirely appropriate for the Tribunal to find that the rights in question had, in fact, been breached as part of their determination to grant the interim measures requested.181\n\nTR, pp 218-222.\n\n160.\n\nFinally, with respect to Respondent\u2019s argument that Claimants\u2019 request for relief in the final award demonstrated that no risk of irreparable harm existed, Claimants submitted that any such argument did not apply to the urgent interim relief requested in respect of conduct alleged to affect the immunities under the ICSID Convention or threatening the procedural integrity of the arbitral procedure.182 Further, Claimants also submitted that granting relief such as an award of the defence fees incurred in defending against the criminal proceedings was in no way inconsistent with the request for provisional measures.\n\nTR, pp 222-223.\n\n161.\n\nIn its response, Respondent commented on Claimants\u2019 interpretation of the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Request for Letters Rogatory (Exhibit C-1215) and contested that King & Spalding was named a subject of the investigation. Rather, Respondent submitted that in referring to the Complaints being investigated, the Federal Prosecutor referred only to the legal representatives, officers and executives of Burford and of Claimants. Further, Respondent submitted that Claimants had not contested that under Argentine law the term \"legal representative\" of a company does not include counsel authorized to represent the company at trial.183 In addition, Respondent noted that no mention of any possible infraction of Law 14,034 was mentioned in the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Request for Letters Rogatory and that this supported their interpretation of the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s note that no investigation for treason or its equivalent was being pursued.\n\nTR, pp 231-232.\n\n162.\n\nFinally, Respondent referred to the various convictions in Spain of Mr. D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n and other individuals related to the Marsans Group regarding, amongst other things, the concealment of assets subject to the insolvency proceedings of the Marsans Group in Spain. In this context, Respondent referred to the judgment of 7 September 2015 of the Spanish National Criminal Court as demonstrating the illegitimate nature of the payment mechanism provided for in the Funding Agreement.184 It also repeated its position that the TAG Complaint relating to the Funding Agreement, seen in the context of the court\u2019s judgment, was not related to the arbitration.185 Finally, Respondent made reference to a recent criminal complaint filed by Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. (\"ARSA\"), in which ARSA had alleged the misappropriation and mismanagement of funds paid by Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (\"SEPI\") to Air Comet pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement by which Air Comet, and Claimants, acquired an interest in the Argentine Airlines.186\n\nTR, pp 252-254; Exhibit RA-687/C-1210.\n\nTR, p 254.\n\nTR, pp 227-230, 255-256.\n\n**V. ANALYSIS AND DECISION**\n----------------------------\n\n163.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Application is somewhat unusual. Unlike the situations addressed by other ICSID tribunals to which the Parties have referred, the alleged conduct giving rise to the request for provisional measures comes near the end of the proceedings. In this case, the oral hearing has been completed, the Parties have submitted their post-hearing briefs and submissions on costs and what remains is for the Tribunal to formally close the proceedings and issue its award. Further, each of Claimants and their related corporate entities are in some form of insolvency proceedings in Spain.\n\n164.\n\nSince the submission of the Parties\u2019 post-hearing briefs, the Tribunal has received a series of requests, primarily from Respondent, to admit additional documents and judgments from the insolvency proceedings in Spain of the Marsans corporate group to which Claimants belong, as well as a number of documents and judgments from related criminal proceedings. As noted previously in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction and in this Decision, Claimants have also been the subject of their own insolvency proceedings and have had receivers appointed by the Spanish courts. These various proceedings have given rise to many different decisions and judgments in the insolvency and criminal proceedings in Spain, a number of which have made reference to Claimants, the ultimate shareholders of Claimants, and the company through which they made their investment, Air Comet. Given the possible relevance of some of these developments to this arbitration, the Tribunal has permitted the submission of most of the documents in question.\n\n165.\n\nGiven the timing of Claimants\u2019 Application, it does not address the \"usual\" arguments made in this type of application like the possible effect that the criminal proceedings at issue could have on the obtaining of evidence, the possible intimidation of witnesses or other effects which would impede the procedural progress of the arbitration. Rather, Claimants say the Complaints and the criminal investigation, together with the publicity that Respondent has given to these, have affected or threatened to affect rights related to this arbitration which are entitled to protection, despite the late stage of the proceedings. These rights are said to be: the right to enforce Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT through ICSID arbitration conducted in good faith; the right to the integrity of the proceedings, including the right of exclusivity of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention; the right for the Tribunal to determine its own jurisdiction and the merits of the case; the right of immunity of Claimants, their counsel, representatives and funder; and the right to an enforceable award under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention. In their final form, Claimants\u2019 requests for relief include orders granting provisional measures as well as substantive relief on the merits in the final award.\n\n**A. Claimants\u2019 Requests On The Merits**\n----------------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal first addresses Claimants\u2019 requests on the merits. In respect of these, in their Reply, Claimants requested that the Tribunal award Claimants damages for moral and reputational injuries,187 satisfaction for the injury caused by Respondent\u2019s internationally wrongful acts188 and, in the event Respondent fails to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s provisional orders, a finding that Respondent has breached its obligation to ensure fair and equitable treatment under the terms of the BIT.189\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 8 and 80, 59-61.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 8 and 80, FN 6. While Claimants did not specifically identify these in their Reply, the alleged breaches of international law which, according to them, would give rise to a finding of breach and satisfaction, appear to be the alleged breaches of the immunity afforded under Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 8 and 80, 81.\n\n167.\n\nAt the hearing, Claimants requested a permanent injunction restraining Respondent from criminally prosecuting Claimants, their representatives, counsel and funder for acts relating to this arbitration and an order that Respondent pay damages for moral and reputational injuries caused to their representatives, counsel and funder.190 With respect to their claim for satisfaction in their Reply, Claimants specified that the breaches of international law committed by Respondent in respect of which satisfaction was due included the breach of the right to immunity under Article 22 of the ICSID Convention, the right to an arbitration conducted in good faith, the right to preservation of the *status quo* and the right to fair and equitable treatment under the BIT.191\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 request for relief: demonstrative slides 115-117. The Claimants stated that they would submit a brief, supplemental costs and damages application for consideration as part of the final award, if the Tribunal ruled in Claimants\u2019 favour on the requested provisional measures.\n\nSee \u00b6 143, above, and FN 157 and the sources cited there. The Claimants also stated that in so far as satisfaction was concerned, a declaration of the Respondent\u2019s breaches would be sufficient remedy. The Claimants also requested an order that the Respondent pay the cost of defence in the Argentine criminal proceedings of Claimants, their representatives, counsel and funder.\n\n168.\n\nAs indicated previously, Respondent maintains that Claimants\u2019 requests for relief on the merits, including the request for declarations of new alleged breaches of international law or Claimants\u2019 BIT rights and the requests for moral damages and satisfaction come too late and cannot be advanced at this late stage without authorization of the Tribunal. In any event, Respondent says that these forms of relief are inappropriate in an application for provisional measures. Claimants, on the other hand, say that the Tribunal has the authority to award the additional relief and damages they seek. They also submitted that in addition to giving rise to relief on the merits, their claims of breaches of international law by Respondent served as the predicate for the various provisional measures requested.192\n\nSee above at \u00b6\u00b6 81 and 144. The Claimants did not directly address the Respondent\u2019s objection that their new claims on the merits were too late and not admissible on that basis.\n\n169.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent is correct that, in principle, an application for provisional or interim measures is not the appropriate vehicle for requesting relief on the merits, nor for the Tribunal to grant an award of relief on the merits. Further, the Tribunal accepts that in order for a party to submit a new claim or defence after the pleadings are complete, it requires the authorization of the Tribunal, which has not been sought in this case.193\n\nIn this regard, see \u00b6 18 of the minutes of the first session on March 22, 2010 in which the procedure for this arbitration was determined. It provides that the Parties would not bring new arguments, witnesses or evidence in their reply and rejoinder on the merits, unless these are in rebuttal to claims or issues raised by the other Party in the previous pleading.\n\n170.\n\nAccordingly, subject to the Tribunal\u2019s comments below in respect of the integrity of the proceedings, Claimants\u2019 request for relief on the merits cannot properly be addressed in Claimants\u2019 Application. At this stage of the proceedings, adding new requests for relief on the merits would require the authorization of the Tribunal after having heard both Parties on the issue.194 As a result, the Tribunal must dismiss Claimants\u2019 claims for relief on the merits as brought in Claimants\u2019 Application.\n\nFurther, in the event Claimants were to seek authorization to request additional relief on the merits and the Tribunal were to authorize the same, the Respondent would be entitled to present its response on the merits of those claims and further evidence and argument would likely be required in order for the Tribunal to address the claims fully.\n\n171.\n\nBefore turning to the provisional measures requested by Claimants, the Tribunal addresses Respondent\u2019s objection to the admission of the sworn and notarized statements submitted in the form of public deeds by each of the court-appointed receivers of Claimants (Exhibit C-1200). In this regard, Respondent has objected that the statements in question come late and have not been authorized by the Tribunal. In addition, Respondent submitted that the filing of these statements reflects the seriousness with which Claimants and the court-appointed receivers take Respondent\u2019s position that the powers of attorney are no longer valid and shows that at the time of filing the TAG Complaint there were justified reasons for doing so.195 On the other hand, Claimants said that the public deeds are relevant to the issues before the Tribunal on this Application.196\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s letter of 27 October 2015. In addition, the Respondent took the position that even these most recent statements from the court-appointed receivers were defective since, in its view, the public deeds do not establish a date certain on which the previous letters from the court-appointed receivers (Exhibits C-842, C-843 and C-844) were issued. In addition, the Respondent submitted that the public deeds did not show any involvement or intervention by the judges in the respective insolvency proceedings in Spain. See TR, pp 120121.\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 letter of 22 October 2015.\n\n172.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the public deeds submitted by the court-appointed receivers should be admitted into evidence in these proceedings. The public deeds are relevant to a number of issues before the Tribunal on Claimants\u2019 Application and, more generally, in the arbitration. They clearly relate to the question of the validity of King & Spalding\u2019s powers of attorney and their authority to represent Claimants in the arbitration and, indeed, in Claimants\u2019 Application. As noted previously, the question of the authorization of counsel to represent Claimants figures prominently in the Complaints and appears related to the allegation that there had been connivance among Claimants, their legal representation and Burford with respect to the Funding Agreement. This question also relates to the suggestion that the court-appointed receivers participated in a scheme to deceive the Tribunal (whether by way of \"apocryphal\" documents or use of authentic documents in a fraudulent manner) set out in the PROCELAC Complaint.197 Further, the PROCELAC Complaint requests the investigation of the court-appointed receivers in the insolvency proceedings of Claimants in respect of their alleged participation in illegitimate conduct.198 This is the first opportunity that the Spanish court-appointed receivers have to respond to the allegations contained in the Complaints and the Tribunal believes it is appropriate for them to do so in the circumstances.199 In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the statements made in the public deeds are consistent with the previous statements in evidence from the receivers.\n\nSee PROCELAC Complaint, Exhibit C-1198, pp 22-23.\n\nPROCELAC Complaint, Exhibit C-1198, p 25.\n\nIt appears that Claimants were first able to obtain a copy of the PROCELAC Complaint on or about 9 October 2015 (see \u00b6 62, above). The Claimants submitted the public deeds from the court-appointed receivers with their letter of 22 October 2015. A summary of the contents of these deeds are set out at paragraph 69, above.\n\n173.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal admits the public deeds of the court-appointed receivers submitted as Exhibit C-1200.\n\n**B. Provisional Measures Requested by Claimants**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the provisional measures requested by Claimants and the requirements for granting such measures. In this regard, the focus of Respondent\u2019s position was that Claimants had not met at least three of the requirements for the granting of provisional measures: the need to demonstrate a right related to the arbitration which must be protected; the need to demonstrate the threat of irreparable harm if the measures are not granted; and the need to demonstrate an urgent need to issue the measures requested. The Tribunal will address each of these requirements in turn, including the differences between the Parties\u2019 positions in respect of the nature and content of the requirements in question and whether these have been met.\n\n**1. The Rights To Be Protected By Provisional Measures**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nAs described above, Claimants submitted that a number of their rights require protection by way of provisional measures. Those rights were articulated in their final form at the hearing and can be summarized as follows: the right to enforce Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT through ICSID arbitration conducted in good faith; the right to integrity of the proceedings, including the right of exclusivity of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention; the right for the Tribunal to determine its own jurisdiction and the merits of the case; the immunity of counsel, Claimants and their representatives and funder; and the right to an enforceable award under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n176.\n\nRespondent submits that the measures requested by Claimants are not intended to protect rights at issue in the arbitration before the Tribunal. According to Respondent, only the rights at issue in the arbitration may be protected by way of provisional measures. Respondent says that although they have some connection to this arbitration, the Complaints and the criminal investigation which are the subject of Claimants\u2019 Application are unrelated to the matters before the Tribunal in this case. Respondent says that the Complaints and the criminal investigation are separate criminal proceedings relating to events which did not take place before the Tribunal and are external to the proceedings before it. In this regard, Respondent maintains that the Complaints are related to the Funding Agreement and conduct related to it, which are external to these arbitration proceedings.200 In addition, Respondent says that it is difficult to see how the Complaints and criminal investigation can affect any of Claimants\u2019 rights at this late stage of the proceedings when only the final award is pending. Finally, Respondent submits that Claimants have not met what it says is the high burden on them to demonstrate that provisional measures should be granted to require the suspension of criminal proceedings. In particular, Respondent says that Claimants have not provided any concrete evidence of conduct in breach, or threatening imminent breach, of Claimants\u2019 rights.\n\nSee, for example, Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n\n177.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the rights available for protection by provisional measures are not restricted to rights which may form the subject matter of the dispute between the Parties. As a number of tribunals have found, the rights which may be protected include procedural rights, such as the preservation of the integrity of the proceedings and the preservation of the *status quo* and non-aggravation of the dispute.201 As found in the *Quiborax v. Bolivia* and *Plama v. Bulgaria* decisions, the applicable criterion is that the right or rights to be preserved are related to the dispute in the sense that those rights must relate to the applicant\u2019s ability to have its claims and requests for relief in the arbitration fairly considered and decided by the arbitral tribunal and for any arbitral decision which grants the relief sought to be effective and capable of carrying out.202\n\nSee in this regard, *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 26 February 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 117-118 and the other decisions and sources cited there.\n\nSee *Plama v. Bulgaria*, Order, dated 6 September 2005, \u00b6 40, as quoted in *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 118.\n\n178.\n\nThe materials and evidence before the Tribunal reflect a close relationship between both the TAG Complaint and the PROCELAC Complaint and this arbitration. Further, the criminal investigation, as described in the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s note of 21 September 2015 is based on the Complaints and while its precise scope may remain somewhat uncertain, it clearly incorporates a number of the same allegations contained in the Complaints which are closely connected with the arbitration and the issues before the Tribunal.\n\n179.\n\nAmong the various indicia of the close relationship between the Complaints and this ICSID arbitration are, in the first place, Respondent\u2019s letter of 3 March 2015 which stated that the TAG Complaint was closely intertwined with certain facts at stake in the arbitration and was intended to prevent Respondent from making a payment in detriment to the creditors in the insolvency proceedings as well as to Respondent itself. The TAG Complaint and the PROCELAC Complaint both allege that Claimants, together with their counsel, court-appointed representatives and funder were, in essence, perpetrating a fraud not only on the creditors in the insolvency proceedings and Respondent, but also on the Tribunal itself.203\n\nIn this regard, see \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, above, and the references to the TAG Complaint made there; the PROCELAC Complaint, Exhibit C-1198, \u00b6\u00b6 63-66 where specific reference is made to each of counsel for Claimants, the court-appointed receivers of Claimants and Burford, the alleged use of certain documents in this arbitration with the purpose of illegally appropriating the sums arising from a possible award and the Respondent\u2019s counter-claim in the arbitration is made. The PROCELAC Complaint goes on to refer to the witness statement of Mr. Barcesat, counsel for the Respondent in this arbitration, with respect to Claimants\u2019 lack of capacity to sue since its claim was a derivative one based on indirect shareholdings. The PROCELAC Complaint further alleges that the Respondent\u2019s argument had not yet been addressed by the Tribunal. It also went on to refer to the allegation in these arbitration proceedings that King & Spalding had no authority to represent Claimants since their powers of attorney had lapsed or become invalid and the alleged \"apocryphal\" nature of the letters from the court-appointed receivers in evidence before the Tribunal.\n\n180.\n\nA close review of the Complaints indicates that the matters in respect of which the Treasury Attorney General\u2019s office and the PROCELAC complain and request an investigation are matters which Respondent has placed before the Tribunal in these arbitral proceedings. Respondent has alleged before the Tribunal that Claimants have attempted to mislead the Tribunal and that the purpose behind the Assignment Agreement and Funding Agreement was to exclude from the insolvency proceedings in Spain any sums possibly awarded to Claimants in this arbitration, thereby defrauding the creditors and creating the risk that Respondent would be required to pay twice. In this regard, Respondent essentially argues that the Tribunal and any eventual award in Claimants\u2019 favor will be the instrument of the fraud it alleges against Claimants.\n\n181.\n\nThe Complaints also make reference to one of Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional defences in this arbitration: that Claimants\u2019 claim is derivative and indirect and, therefore, falls outside the scope of the BIT. This is an issue that has been extensively briefed and addressed in this arbitration.\n\n182.\n\nThe Complaints also make repeated reference to the Funding Agreement (and the Assignment Agreement) which are said to be at the heart of the fraudulent scheme concocted by Claimants. These agreements have been placed before the Tribunal by Respondent as part of its defence on both jurisdiction and the merits and have been the subject of extensive evidence and argument.\n\n183.\n\nFurther, Respondent has raised the question of the alleged invalidity of the powers of attorney held by King & Spalding and their authority to represent Claimants in this arbitration. This matter has been before the Tribunal for some time and has been the subject of extensive expert evidence and argument. Respondent has also raised the same or similar arguments before both this Tribunal and in the Complaints as to the alleged motives for which Claimants and their counsel would seek to uphold the validity of the powers of attorney. Again, this is clearly a matter squarely within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to decide in its award. Finally, the allegations contained in the PROCELAC Complaint regarding the violation of Article 1 of Law 14,034 by any Argentine citizen representing Claimants in this matter also has an apparent close connection to this arbitration.204\n\nSee, generally, the table comparing the alleged offenses set out in the Complaints and the proceedings in this arbitration at slides 61-68 of Claimants\u2019 demonstrative slides used at the Hearing.\n\n184.\n\nThis brief review of certain aspects of the Complaints indicates a close relationship between them and these arbitration proceedings. Indeed, Respondent\u2019s request to admit the TAG Complaint in these proceedings was made on the basis of the close connection between the TAG Complaint and the facts at stake in this arbitration and Respondent\u2019s intention to prevent the risk of harm to it if it were ordered to pay compensation pursuant to an eventual award. As a result, it would appear that these arbitral proceedings could be seen as the motivation, at least in part, for the filing of the Complaints.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of the distinction which has been drawn by other ICSID tribunals between claims under a BIT relating to the protection of an investment and criminal prosecutions brought by a State in respect of crimes alleged to have been committed in its territory. The Tribunal is also aware of the decisions of other tribunals which have expressed the view that provisional measures are an extraordinary remedy and that tribunals should exercise particular caution when asked to restrain a sovereign State\u2019s exercise of its right to conduct criminal investigations and prosecutions relating to conduct within its territory.205 However, such powers must be exercised in good faith, respecting a claimant\u2019s rights to have its claims fairly considered and decided by an arbitral tribunal.206 These issues will be considered further below. At this stage, the Tribunal concludes that there is a direct relationship between the Complaints and the criminal investigation commenced by the Federal Prosecutor and this ICSID arbitration such that certain rights of Claimants in this arbitration may warrant protection.\n\nSee Exhibit AL RA-424: *Churchill Mining v. Indonesia*, Procedural Order No. 14, dated 22 December 2014, p 23, as cited by the Respondent in its Rejoinder, \u00b6 16. See also the other decisions cited by the Respondent to the same or similar effect.\n\nSee *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 123; *Plama v. Bulgaria*, Order, \u00b6 40; *Libananco v. Turkey*, Decision on Preliminary Issues, \u00b6 78; and *Caratube v. Kazakhstan I*, Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 31 July 2009, \u00b6 139.\n\n186.\n\nIn addition, and in any event, the Tribunal has the inherent jurisdiction and powers required to preserve the integrity of its own process and the duty to ensure that the Parties comply with their obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the decision in *Libananco v. Turkey* when it held as follows:\n\n78. These allegations and counter-allegations strike at principles which lie at the very heart of the ICSID arbitral process, and the Tribunal is bound to approach them accordingly. Among the principles affected are: basic procedural fairness, respect for confidentiality and legal privilege (and indeed for the immunities accorded to parties, their counsel, and witnesses under Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention); the right of parties both to seek advice and to advance their respective cases freely and without interference; and no doubt others as well. For its own part, the Tribunal would add to the list respect for the Tribunal itself, as the organ freely chosen by the Parties for the binding settlement of their dispute in accordance with the ICSID Convention. It requires no further recital by the Tribunal to establish either that these are indeed fundamental principles, or why they are. Nor does the Tribunal doubt for a moment that, like any other international tribunal, it must be regarded as endowed with the inherent powers required to preserve the integrity of its own process - even if the remedies open to it are necessarily different from those that might be available to a domestic court of law in an ICSID Member State. The Tribunal would express the principle as being that parties have an obligation to arbitrate fairly and in good faith and that an arbitral tribunal has the inherent jurisdiction to ensure that this obligation is complied with; this principle applies in all arbitration, including investment arbitration, and to all parties, including States (even in the exercise of their sovereign powers).207\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal has previously ordered the Parties not to aggravate or extend the dispute on a number of occasions and has the authority to ensure the respect of its orders.208\n\n*Libananco v. Turkey*, Decision on Preliminary Issues, \u00b6 78. Other tribunals have identified the same duty on the parties to an arbitration to conduct the procedure in good faith. See, for example, *Caratube v.**Kazakhstan I*, Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 117-120, as cited by the tribunal in *Caratube**International Oil Company LLP and Devincci Salah Hourani v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/13 (\"*Caratube v. Kazakhstan II*\"), Decision on Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures, dated 4 December 2014, \u00b6 113.\n\nSee Procedural Order No. 2, dated 29 April 2011; Tribunal\u2019s letter of 13 May 2011; Tribunal\u2019s letter of 1 April 2012; Procedural Order No. 4, dated 3 October 2012, \u00b6 62.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to its assessment of the various rights which Claimants allege have been threatened or breached and whether the requirements for the granting of provisional measures in respect of these have been met.\n\n**2. The Right To ICSID Arbitration Conducted In Good Faith**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent\u2019s conduct in filing the Complaints and commencing the criminal investigation breaches its duty to arbitrate in good faith and threatens the integrity of these ICSID proceedings. In essence, Claimants say that the Complaints and the criminal investigation are guerrilla tactics employed in bad faith by Respondent in order to derail this arbitration and avoid having to pay an award rendered against it. Claimants say that the facts of this case represent exceptional circumstances which justify the suspension of the criminal proceedings initiated by Respondent\u2019s authorities.\n\n189.\n\nOn the other hand, Respondent says that it has the right and duty to investigate criminal conduct where it has a legitimate basis to suspect that the same has occurred. It says that this is a sovereign prerogative and that a high threshold must be met in order to restrain a State\u2019s exercise of that power. It goes on to submit that Claimants have not met that threshold by, *inter alia*, demonstrating how the Complaints and criminal investigation have affected Claimants\u2019 right to have their claims heard before the Tribunal.\n\n190.\n\nAs has been held by a number of arbitral tribunals, Respondent clearly has the sovereign right to conduct criminal investigations and it will usually require exceptional circumstances to justify the granting of provisional measures to suspend criminal proceedings by a State. Nevertheless, where exceptional circumstances do exist and threaten the integrity of the arbitration proceedings and the principle of due process, provisional measures may be warranted.209 In addition, separate from the question of whether provisional measures are warranted, the abuse of the sovereign power of a State to pursue criminal proceedings may give rise to damage and a claim for the breach of rights protected by a BIT or international law, more generally. In addressing Claimants\u2019 Application currently before it, the Tribunal must focus on the former and restrict its inquiry to the question of whether Claimants have demonstrated that their right to continue or pursue this arbitration in procedurally fair conditions is threatened.\n\n*EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/14 (\"*EuroGas v Slovak*\"), Procedural Order No. 3 - Decision on Request for Provisional Measures, dated 23 June 2015, \u00b6 82.\n\n191.\n\nIn considering this question, the Tribunal must bear in mind the current stage of the proceedings. As indicated previously, the only remaining steps are the closure of the proceedings and the issuance of the Tribunal\u2019s award. All previous procedural steps in the arbitration, including the submission of pleadings and evidence and the conduct of an oral hearing at which all of the relevant witnesses requested by the Parties appeared to testify, have been completed. This distinguishes the circumstances of this case from those in the other arbitral decisions brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention and reduces the aspects of the arbitration in respect of which provisional measures can be sought.\n\n**3. The Right To Exclusivity Of ICSID Proceedings**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nClaimants categorize the right to exclusivity of ICSID proceedings as an aspect of the integrity of the proceedings. Claimants submit that the Complaints and the criminal investigation are intended to prevent an award in their favor on the basis of an alleged fraud and breach of the provisions of Article 1 of Law 14,034. In this regard, Claimants point to the fact that the Complaints refer to the following: Claimants\u2019 claims in the arbitration are derivative or indirect and therefore inappropriate and the fact that the Tribunal has either not decided the issue or incorrectly decided it; the alleged lack of valid powers of attorney or authority of counsel to represent Claimants; the allegation that the Assignment Agreement and Funding Agreement constitute a fraudulent attempt to exclude the proceeds of an eventual award against Respondent from the insolvency proceedings of Claimants in Spain; and the allegation that Claimants, their representatives and counsel are committing a fraud on the Tribunal. According to Claimants, these matters are all before the Tribunal and attempting to re-litigate them by way of criminal proceedings violates the exclusivity of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n193.\n\nAs has been recognized previously, the right to exclusivity of ICSID proceedings under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention can be protected by way of provisional measures.210 This right of exclusivity relates to the resolution of investment disputes only and does not include or extend to criminal proceedings which deal with criminal liability and not with investment disputes.211 As a result, in principle, the criminal proceedings commenced by way of the Complaints and the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s preliminary investigation do not address the investment dispute before the Tribunal and, therefore, do not threaten the exclusivity of these ICSID proceedings.\n\nSee *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 127; *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*, Order No 1, dated 1 July 2003, \u00b6 7.\n\nSee *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 128-131 and the sources cited there.\n\n194.\n\nNevertheless, the fact that the Complaints rely upon matters such as the indirect nature of Claimants\u2019 claims, the alleged lack of authority of Claimants\u2019 counsel, documents alleged to be part of a fraudulent scheme and the alleged misleading of the Tribunal itself, all matters which have been placed before the Tribunal by Respondent before the Complaints were filed, or the Tribunal\u2019s award is rendered, is troubling. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, these are all matters properly before it and relevant to its determination of the dispute between the Parties. These are matters which the Tribunal must and will address and determine in its award. As a result, there is some basis for concern that despite the distinction between the rights at issue in an investment dispute and criminal proceedings, the exclusivity of these proceedings is being infringed.\n\n195.\n\nHowever, on the basis of the evidence currently available, there is some doubt in this regard. This arises from the uncertainty surrounding the scope of the preliminary investigation which has been commenced by the Federal Prosecutor. As will be discussed further below, there is a debate between the Parties as to whether this investigation includes counsel for Claimants and their court-appointed receivers. Respondent argued strongly that the Federal Prosecutor in his note set the limits of his investigation, which did not include allegations against counsel or Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers (nor any allegations of breaches of Law 14,034). While Claimants dispute this, the scope of the preliminary investigation remains uncertain from the Tribunal\u2019s perspective. As a result, it is not clear whether issues such as the derivative nature of Claimants\u2019 claims and counsel\u2019s alleged lack of authority form part of the preliminary investigation.\n\n196.\n\nIn addition, it is important to recall that both Parties have repeatedly stated and accepted that the judgments of criminal courts in Spain and in Argentina do not and will not bind this Tribunal.212 As a result, even if the Tribunal were to conclude that the criminal investigation did infringe on the exclusivity of these proceedings, it is unlikely to have any effect on the continuation of this arbitration and the Tribunal\u2019s award.\n\nIn this regard, see: Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 370; Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 332; Claimants\u2019 Application, FN 41, p 11.\n\n197.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal concludes that the Complaints and the criminal investigation initiated by the Federal Prosecutor of Respondent do not sufficiently threaten the exclusivity of these ICSID proceedings such that the provisional measure requesting the suspension of the criminal proceedings should be granted.213\n\nThe Claimants listed the right to have the Tribunal determine its own jurisdiction and the merits of the case as one of the protected rights related to the integrity of the proceeding which is threatened by the Respondent\u2019s conduct. The Tribunal sees no material distinction between this right and the right of exclusivity of ICSID proceedings. Consequently, it reaches the same conclusion as expressed here with respect to the exclusivity of the ICSID proceedings.\n\n**4. The Right To The Preservation Of The** ***Status Quo*** **And The Non-aggravation Of The Dispute**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nThe right to the preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute is well established in arbitral case law.214 In addition, several tribunals, with which this Tribunal agrees, have found that preservation of the *status quo* and the non-aggravation of the dispute are self-standing rights.215 Claimants allege that by submitting the Complaints and commencing the criminal investigation, as well as publicizing these proceedings broadly, Respondent has sought to intimidate Claimants, their court-appointed receivers and all of Claimants\u2019 counsel to pressure them to either drop the arbitration or face criminal charges for pursuing it. Claimants also say that by way of the criminal proceedings, Respondent seeks to intimidate their funder, Burford, in order to cut off the funding necessary for the arbitration.216 In response, as outlined previously, Respondent says that Claimants have not demonstrated how the alleged conduct would affect Claimants\u2019 rights to continue the arbitration or provided any evidence that the Complaints and the criminal investigation have affected or threatened to affect Claimants, its representatives, counsel or funder, as alleged.\n\nSee *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 134-136; *Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11 (\"*Occidental v. Ecuador*\"), Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 17 August 2007, \u00b6 96; *City Oriente v. Ecuador*, Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 19 November 2007; *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5 (\"*Burlington v. Ecuador*\"), Procedural Order No. 1, dated 29 June 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 61-68; *Caratube v. Kazakhstan I*, Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6\u00b6 117-120, as quoted in *Caratube v. Kazakhstan II*, Decision on Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures, \u00b6 113.\n\nSee Exhibit C-547: *Burlington v. Ecuador*, Procedural Order No. 1, dated 29 June 2009, \u00b6 60; Exhibit C-550: *Ioan Micula, Viorel Micula S.C., European Food S.A., SC Star Mill S.R.L., and SC Multipack SRL v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20 (\"*Micula v. Romania*\"), Decision on Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures, dated 2 March 2011, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42; Exhibit C-543: *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, Decision on Provisional Measures, dated 26 February 2010, \u00b6 117; *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*, Procedural Order No. 1, dated 31 March 2006, \u00b6 71.\n\nSee TR, pp 26-27. In addition, Claimants claim that the Respondent seeks to unduly influence the Tribunal by claiming that the issuance and enforcement of an award would be the final element of the alleged fraud.\n\n199.\n\nClaimants have not specified how the *status quo* of their investment in Argentina would be affected by the criminal proceedings. The Argentine Airlines in which Claimants held their disputed investment has been expropriated for some time now and there was no indication how the criminal proceedings would affect this or otherwise affect the *status quo*. Accordingly, the relevant question is whether the criminal proceedings have aggravated the dispute or threatened to aggravate the dispute such that a provisional measure is warranted.\n\n200.\n\nIn this regard, there is no doubt that the criminal proceedings have exacerbated the already difficult climate in which this dispute has unfolded. This is particularly so with respect to the allegations made in the Complaints against counsel for Claimants, the court-appointed receivers and Claimants\u2019 funder. However, insofar as Claimants themselves are concerned, the Tribunal notes that the expropriation at the heart of the dispute occurred in 2008 and that since that time the Argentine Airlines have been in the hands of Respondent. Further, each of Claimants are currently in liquidation proceedings under the supervision of their court-appointed receivers and their former ultimate shareholder, Mr. D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n, as well as a number of other former shareholders or officers have been convicted of various offenses relating to the insolvency of the Marsans Group and have been sentenced to imprisonment in Spain. In these circumstances, in the absence of any specific indication of how Claimants or their officers and directors have been harassed or intimidated, there is no basis for provisional measures in that regard.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal reaches the same conclusion with respect to Burford. While it does appear that the criminal investigation includes Burford within its scope, there is no indication that this has affected, or is likely to affect, Claimants\u2019 funding. In this regard, Respondent notes that Claimants have met all requests for advances on account of costs by the ICSID Secretariat and there was no evidence that Claimants are otherwise unable to meet their financial commitments in this arbitration pending the issuance of the award.\n\n202.\n\nThe situation is quite different with respect to Claimants\u2019 counsel and their court-appointed receivers. Dealing first with counsel, the TAG Complaint and, particularly the PROCELAC Complaint, make a number of serious allegations against counsel, including participation in fraudulent activity and, in the case of Argentine counsel, a breach of Article 1 of Law 14,034. These crimes carry very serious penalties, particularly for lawyers. The simple allegation of fraud against lawyers can carry heavy consequences and cause damage to reputation as well as a lawyer\u2019s business interest. In the case of a breach of Article 1 of Law 14,034, a conviction carries with it penalties of permanent disbarment and up to 25 years in prison.217\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the PROCELAC Complaint lists every member of Claimants\u2019 counsel team in the body of the complaint, including paralegals and interns who are unlikely to have had any involvement in the Funding Agreement and Assignment Agreement which the Respondent impugns nor any substantial responsibility in the representation of Claimants. Further, it appears that at least two members of Claimants\u2019 counsel team have left King & Spalding and are now employed elsewhere.\n\n203.\n\nThe allegations in the Complaints made against Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers are also serious, particularly when one bears in mind the fact that they are appointed by the Spanish courts to serve a public function by representing the interest of the creditors in the various insolvency proceedings. They act under the authority and direction of the relevant Spanish courts. The Tribunal also notes that the court-appointed receivers were appointed some time after the Assignment Agreement and Funding Agreement were executed. Further, the evidence in the record demonstrates that both of these agreements were filed in the Spanish courts and were reviewed and approved by at least one court.218\n\nIn this regard, on 22 December 2010, the Spanish court overseeing the insolvency of Air Comet issued an order authorizing the court-appointed receivers of Air Comet to consent to the Funding Agreement: Exhibit RA-165. In their application to the court, the court-appointed receivers referred to the Assignment Agreement: Exhibit RA-164. Further, it appears that the commercial court in charge of the insolvencies of the three Claimants, Spanish Commercial Court No. 7 of Madrid, is aware of the Funding Agreement and has approved Burford\u2019s claim in the proceedings relating to Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A.\u2019s insolvency on 19 April 2012. In this regard, see Annex B-11 to Mr. Cigarr\u00e1n Mag\u00e1n\u2019s Report of 3 May 2013, p 3. See also Claimants\u2019 Application, pp 5-6 and FNs 16-18 and the sources cited there.\n\n204.\n\nOf particular concern to the Tribunal is the joint, televised press conference held by the Treasury Attorney General and the head of the PROCELAC on 14 September 2015. Claimants submitted substantial evidence in regard of that press conference, including a video posted on the PROCELAC\u2019s website, a transcript of what was said at the press conference and the slides used by the Treasury Attorney General and the head of PROCELAC in support of their comments.219 This evidence was not contested by Respondent.\n\nSee Exhibit C-1213. The Claimants also submitted a number of articles and news reports from a broad variety of newspapers, both in Argentina and overseas, including the Legal Press.\n\n205.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the threat of criminal proceedings against counsel in the circumstances of this case places substantial pressure on counsel. This, in turn, threatens to affect Claimants\u2019 right to be represented by counsel of their choice in this arbitration. Similarly, the possible prosecution of Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers places pressure on them to choose between continuing their court-mandated function of representing Claimants and pursuing the latter\u2019s claims in this arbitration and withdrawing from their role or desisting in pursuing Claimants\u2019 claims. Each of these possible threats is of concern.\n\n206.\n\nNevertheless, it is not clear whether the criminal investigation commenced by the Federal Prosecutor includes allegations against counsel or Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers. Respondent, represented by the Treasury Attorney General, argued forcefully at the Hearing that the investigation did not include within its scope the investigation of allegations against counsel or the court-appointed receivers. Claimants argue that this is not at all clear and, in any event, the Federal Prosecutor may choose to expand the scope of the criminal investigation. As a result, the situation remains uncertain.\n\n207.\n\nPossible criminal allegations against, and investigation of, Claimants\u2019 counsel and the court-appointed receivers are of considerable concern to the Tribunal. As a result, the Tribunal has decided to defer its determination on this aspect of Claimants\u2019 Application and grant Claimants liberty to bring this aspect of their Application back to the Tribunal, should it become necessary. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this is appropriate given the current uncertainty regarding the precise scope of the criminal investigation as it relates to counsel and the court-appointed receivers. It is regrettable that Respondent did not address or clarify this issue prior to the Hearing.\n\n208.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal defers its decision on Claimants\u2019 Application as it relates to the request that the Tribunal order the suspension of the criminal proceedings in regard of counsel for Claimants and Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers. Claimants shall be at liberty to bring this issue back before the Tribunal in the event there is confirmation that the criminal proceedings and investigation include the alleged crimes against counsel or the court-appointed receivers.\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal now addresses Claimants\u2019 allegation that the press conference held by the Treasury Attorney General and the head of the PROCELAC has aggravated the dispute.\n\n210.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal concludes that the uncontested evidence regarding the joint press conference held by the Treasury Attorney General and the head of the PROCELAC on 14 September 2015 reflects an aggravation of the dispute. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the matters described and commented on in the press conference and the very broad dissemination sponsored by Respondent exceeded by a wide margin any reporting which may have been appropriate. Indeed, Respondent gave no reason for holding the press conference or for its broad dissemination of the Complaints and the allegations made in them. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the press conference and the matters described and commented upon by representatives of Respondent, including details of this arbitration and the alleged conduct of counsel and the court-appointed receivers for Claimants, is inconsistent with the Tribunal\u2019s repeated orders to the Parties not to aggravate the dispute. Accordingly, a provisional measure ordering Respondent to refrain from further aggravating the dispute by publicizing the filing of the Complaints or the criminal investigation and any relation they may have to this arbitration, whether by way of the press or otherwise, is appropriate.\n\n**5. The Right To Immunity**\n----------------------------\n\n211.\n\nClaimants allege that by filing the Complaints and commencing a preliminary investigation, Respondent has breached the immunity afforded to Claimants as parties, their counsel, their court-appointed receivers and their funder. Claimants say that as a party to the ICSID Convention, Respondent is bound by Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention and that the immunity provided applies *ipso iure* without a specific order of an ICSID tribunal. Claimants also submit that a breach of Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention is justiciable as a breach of Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectation that Respondent would proceed as provided by the ICSID Convention, including its provisions on immunity.\n\n212.\n\nAs it relates to Claimants\u2019 Application, the Tribunal understands Claimants\u2019 position to be that Respondent\u2019s alleged breach of the immunity afforded by Article 22 of the ICSID Convention reflects what it says is Respondent\u2019s bad faith conduct in filing the Complaints and commencing a criminal investigation in the circumstances of this case.220\n\nTR, pp 67-69.\n\n213.\n\nRespondent does not dispute that Article 22 of the ICSID Convention provides for immunity from suit for the persons listed in it, but stresses that any such immunity applies only to acts performed by those persons in the exercise of their functions. According to Respondent, the acts or conduct in respect of which the Complaints were filed and the criminal investigation has been commenced were not performed in respect of the arbitration.221\n\nAs described previously, the Respondent\u2019s position is that immunity under Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention is functional or *ratione materiae*. The Respondent says that the Complaints are related to the Funding Agreement and the possible commission of fraud. It says that the Funding Agreement did not take place before the Tribunal and is external to these arbitral proceedings. See Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 23-32; TR, p 118.\n\n214.\n\nAs a result, the practical issue of interest between the Parties is whether the acts or conduct performed by Claimants, their court-appointed receivers, their counsel and their funder was in the exercise of their functions in the arbitration.\n\n215.\n\nRespondent submits that the Complaints and the criminal investigation relate to the Funding Agreement which it says was an agreement signed outside the scope of the arbitration and was not part of the functions of parties as referred to in Article 22 of the ICSID Convention (Claimants, as parties, counsel or Claimants\u2019 representatives). On the other hand, Claimants say that the Funding Agreement, signed between Claimants and Burford in April 2010, was executed exclusively in pursuit of this arbitration following Respondent\u2019s uncompensated expropriation of the Argentine Airlines in order to permit Claimants to pursue their claims in the arbitration.222\n\nTR, pp 64-65. As noted previously, Claimants contested that the Complaints and the criminal investigation relate only to the Funding Agreement. They say the Complaints refer, *inter alia*, to the Respondent\u2019s allegations relating the derivative nature of Claimants\u2019 claims and the alleged lack of authorization for counsel to appear on behalf of Claimants in the arbitration, and that the criminal investigation includes these allegations.\n\n216.\n\nThe question of the nature and scope of the immunity granted to parties, their counsel and the other persons referred to in Article 22 of the ICSID Convention is a complex one, particularly when one considers the various persons to whom immunities may apply in the particularly complex circumstances of this case. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, even assuming that only the Funding Agreement were relevant to the Complaints and criminal investigation, there are serious, plausible grounds on which some, if not all, of Claimants, their counsel, their court-appointed receivers and their funder are entitled to immunity under Article 22 of the ICSID Convention.223 However, the Tribunal need not decide this question at this stage.\n\nIn addition, if the investigation relates to more than simply the Funding Agreement, then the basis for the application of immunity of counsel and the court-appointed receivers becomes broader.\n\n217.\n\nIt is important to recall that this is an application for interim measures and the Tribunal\u2019s determination of whether these are warranted must focus on the effect, or the threatened effect, the Complaints and the criminal investigation may have on Claimants\u2019 rights related to this arbitration. The alleged breach of immunities afforded under Article 22 of the ICSID Convention by the filing of the Complaints and commencement of the criminal investigation may characterize or qualify Respondent\u2019s conduct in respect of which Claimants complain. However, the Tribunal need not decide whether a breach of the immunities invoked has occurred in order to decide this aspect of Claimants\u2019 Application. As mentioned previously, an application for provisional measures is not the appropriate occasion to decide this question on the merits. Rather, the Tribunal\u2019s focus must be the effect of the Complaints and the criminal investigation on Claimants\u2019 rights to pursue the arbitration.224\n\nIt is also relevant to recall that since the immunity claimed by Claimants exists independently of any declaration by this Tribunal, Claimants, their counsel, their court-appointed receivers and Burford are in a position to raise the immunities in their defence as they deem appropriate in any relevant forum. Further, a breach of the immunities provided by the ICSID Convention may give rise to a substantive claim, whether by a person directly covered by immunity, or their home State, in the appropriate forum.\n\n218.\n\nTurning to the possible effect of the criminal proceedings on Claimants and their ability to pursue the arbitration, the Tribunal notes that as far as Claimants themselves are concerned, they were represented by Messrs. D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n and Pascual Arias in the execution of the Funding Agreement. The former is currently imprisoned in Spain and the latter has been deceased for some time. Accordingly, there is no apparent additional pressure or effect which the alleged failure to respect any immunity provided by Article 22 of the ICSID Convention may have with respect to the pursuance of this arbitration by them as representatives of Claimants. The new representatives of Claimants in the insolvency proceedings, the court-appointed receivers, are considered separately, below.\n\n219.\n\nAs to Claimants\u2019 funder, Burford, as noted above, there was no indication that the Complaints or the criminal investigation had affected, or were likely to affect, Burford\u2019s willingness or ability to fund Claimants at this stage of the arbitration.\n\n220.\n\nFurther, for the purposes of Claimants\u2019 Application, the Tribunal has not been persuaded that Burford falls within the scope of the immunity afforded by Article 22 of the ICSID Convention. In this regard, the Tribunal has considered Claimants\u2019 reference to the decision in the *Libananco v. Turkey* case in which the Tribunal found that the immunity under Article 22 of the ICSID Convention applied to an escrow agent. However, as pointed out by Respondent, the escrow agent in question was part of an arrangement established by the Tribunal to permit the production and examination of share certificates relevant to the issues before the Tribunal for examination by Respondent.225 The circumstances of that case were that the tribunal made specific provision for the holding of shares to be examined for evidentiary purposes in the arbitration, which are quite different from the circumstances relevant to the Funding Agreement in this case. On the basis of the limited evidence and argument before it, the Tribunal has not been persuaded that the immunity provided in Article 22 of the ICSID Convention applies to Burford. This conclusion is for the purposes of Claimants\u2019 Application and is without prejudice to Burford\u2019s invocation of immunity elsewhere.\n\nSee *Libananco v. Turkey*, Decision on Preliminary Issues, \u00b6\u00b6 61-65 where the tribunal describes the bearer share certificates as lying at the heart of the arbitral proceedings.\n\n221.\n\nThis leaves the question of immunity as it may apply to counsel for Claimants and the court-appointed receivers. Respondent made representations to the Tribunal during the Hearing that counsel and the court-appointed receivers were not within the scope of the criminal proceedings. At this stage, there is sufficient uncertainty surrounding the scope of the preliminary criminal investigation that the Tribunal does not believe that it is in a position to make a determination as whether the investigation includes counsel or the court-appointed receivers. As a result, it is premature to consider whether the criminal proceedings breach any possible immunity and, if so, whether this contributes to a finding of an aggravation of the dispute by Respondent.\n\n222.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons set out above at paragraphs 206 through 208, the Tribunal\u2019s determination in respect of this issue is deferred, with liberty to Claimants to bring this aspect of the Application back before the Tribunal, if it becomes necessary.\n\n**6. The Right To An Enforceable Award Under Article 53 Of The ICSID Convention**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nClaimants also submit that an aspect of the integrity of the proceedings is their right to an enforceable award under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention. According to Claimants, the purpose of the Complaints and criminal investigation is to prevent the enforcement of any award rendered against Respondent by de-legitimizing this arbitration and any award.226\n\nSee TR, pp 29, 71, 73; Claimants\u2019 demonstrative slide 75.\n\n224.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that this is a right of Claimants which is threatened by the Complaints and criminal investigation for essentially the same reasons as set out above in respect of the exclusivity of ICSID arbitration. As previously noted, the purpose and scope of an arbitration relating to an investment dispute is different from that of a criminal prosecution. Further, the obligation to abide by and comply with the terms of an award is an international law obligation and both Parties have accepted that the Tribunal is not bound by the decisions of national courts.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the remaining requirements at issue for the granting of provisional measures.\n\n**7. Irreparable Harm**\n-----------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe Parties differ as to whether the threat of irreparable harm must be demonstrated in order to grant provisional measures. Claimants maintain that there is no standalone requirement to prove irreparable harm. Rather, they submit that the proper test is that the measures requested must be \"necessary\" in the sense that they are required to avoid infliction of harm upon the applicant. That potential harm is then subjected to a balancing test which considers the harm or interference the respondent may suffer if the measures requested are granted.227 Claimants submit that when the harm threatened relates to the integrity of the proceedings, then the element of necessity will be met.228 Claimants submit that the criminal proceedings and the media publicity Respondent has given to them exerts undue pressure on Claimants, their counsel, their court-appointed receivers and their funder to desist from the arbitration and from any future annulment or enforcement proceedings.229\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 63-64.\n\n*Ibid* ; *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 156. The Claimants say that harm of this nature is, in itself, irreparable in the sense that it cannot properly be compensated by damages, in any event.\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 66-72.\n\n227.\n\nOn the other hand, Respondent says that the power to issue provisional measures should only be exercised where there is an urgent need to prevent irreparable harm.230 Respondent also says that the Complaints and criminal investigation pose no risk of irreparable harm. Respondent also says that Claimants have only made general assertions and not demonstrated how the Complaints and the criminal investigation could harm Claimants\u2019 rights to pursue the arbitration at this late stage.231\n\nSee, for example, Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 41-45.\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, \u00b6 46; TR, pp 161-162. The Respondent also pointed to the guarantees of due process built in to the Argentine criminal process as well as the protection available to Claimants and their representatives and counsel in international conventions and instruments.\n\n228.\n\nAs noted previously, Claimants\u2019 Application comes late in the arbitral proceedings. Therefore, issues such as the preservation of evidence or intimidation of witnesses, which have been the subject of decisions of other tribunals which have considered provisional measures in the context of criminal proceedings, do not arise here. As the taking of evidence has been completed in this case, there is only a limited possibility that the criminal proceedings and investigation can now affect the procedural integrity of these proceedings. As a result, with one exception, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimants have, on the basis of the evidence presented to date, demonstrated irreparable harm or necessity for the granting of the provisional measures requested.\n\n229.\n\nThe exception to this conclusion is with respect to the right to counsel. Although this arbitration is nearing its conclusion, the possible need for legal representation by counsel in this arbitration, and the right to the same, continues. Until the Tribunal issues its award and concludes its mandate, Claimants, and their court-appointed receivers, may require the assistance of counsel. This is a fundamental right and the threat to it by way of criminal proceedings while the arbitration is ongoing may give rise to harm or necessity sufficient to justify the suspension of the criminal proceedings against counsel.\n\n230.\n\nAs indicated previously, there is uncertainty as to the scope of the criminal investigation commenced by the Federal Prosecutor and it is not clear whether counsel or Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers are included within the scope of the investigation. At this stage, on the basis of the evidence and arguments before it, the Tribunal is unable to determine whether there is sufficient likelihood that counsel and the court-appointed receivers are included within the scope of the criminal investigation so as to justify granting the interim measure sought in their regard. Nevertheless, this is a matter of some concern to the Tribunal and, therefore, Claimants will be at liberty to renew their application if necessary once clarification in this regard has been obtained.\n\n**8. Urgency**\n--------------\n\n231.\n\nClaimants submit that the provisional measures requested are urgently needed since they are intended to protect the procedural integrity of the arbitration and they are therefore, by definition, urgent. They also note that since the filing of the TAG Complaint, the criminal investigation is advancing at an unusually fast pace, noting that in a period of approximately seven months, the PROCELAC investigated the TAG Complaint, received reports from Respondent\u2019s Spanish counsel in the insolvency proceedings, took witness statements from one of Respondent\u2019s counsel and submitted its own complaint to the Federal Prosecutor\u2019s office. In addition, the Federal Prosecutor has requested and received the file from PROCELAC and issued requests for the production of certain evidence, including Letters Rogatory for production of a certified copy of the proceedings in this arbitration. In response to Respondent\u2019s objection that a period of four months elapsed between the filing of the TAG Complaint and the submission of Claimants\u2019 Application, Claimants say that when they learned of the filing of the TAG Complaint, they reserved their right to address the complaint and to request provisional measures once they had received a copy of the TAG Complaint. The TAG Complaint was only provided to Claimants by way of Respondent\u2019s letter of 13 May 2015.\n\n232.\n\nRespondent says that Claimants have not treated the Complaints as urgent and delayed in filing their Application. It also submits that the criminal investigation is only in the preliminary stages and will take some time. In any event, Respondent says that a decision on the criminal investigation will not be issued before the Tribunal renders its final award.\n\n233.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, for the purposes of provisional measures, the requirement of urgency is met when a question cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits.232\n\nSee *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, Decision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 66, quoting C.H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, Cambridge University Press, p 751 (Exhibit C-543); *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*, Procedural Order No. 1, \u00b6 14.\n\n234.\n\nFrom its review of Respondent\u2019s submissions relating to the steps involved in the criminal investigation and the procedural guarantees said to exist under Argentine criminal procedure, the Tribunal\u2019s view is that it will take some time before the investigation is completed and a recommendation or charge, if any, is submitted to the Federal court. While there was no specific evidence given on how much time this process can be expected to take, the Tribunal\u2019s sense is that it is likely to take several months and, therefore, formal charges are not imminent.\n\n235.\n\nNevertheless, where the integrity of the arbitral proceedings is threatened, the Tribunal believes that the need for the measures is inherently urgent. Although very few, if any, procedural steps remain in the arbitration, the Tribunal regards Claimants\u2019 access to counsel of their choice as a critical element of the integrity of the arbitral proceedings. As a result, insofar as the criminal investigation relates to counsel for Claimants, the Tribunal considers that the requirement of urgency would likely be satisfied should it be necessary to consider Claimants\u2019 Application further in regard of counsel.\n\n236.\n\nIn regard of Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers, the Tribunal defers further consideration of this issue, until it should become necessary.\n\n237.\n\nWith respect to Claimants themselves and Burford, the Tribunal has not been persuaded on the basis of the evidence currently before it that the requirement of urgency has been met.\n\n**C. Decision**\n---------------\n\n238.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal gives the following orders.\n\n239.\n\nThe Tribunal:\n\n(a) orders that Respondent refrain from publicizing the Complaints or the criminal investigation and any relation they may have to this arbitration, whether by communications to the press or otherwise;\n\n(b) defers its decision in respect of Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures as it relates to the suspension of the criminal proceedings in regard of counsel for Claimants and Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers, with liberty to Claimants to bring this Application back before the Tribunal in this respect should it become necessary;\n\n(c) reminds the Parties that they are obligated to refrain from aggravating the dispute;\n\n(d) denies the remaining aspects of Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures; and\n\n(e) reserves its decision on the costs of the procedure relating to Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures to the final award"}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2017-07-21T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion of Kamal Hossain", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2017-07-13T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Dissenting Opinion of Kamal Hossain\n-----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI regret that I am compelled to give a separate dissenting opinion. In my respectful submission my main disagreement with my colleagues centres around setting out of contentious factual positions regarding the identity of the Claimants and their investment in Argentina. These issues have remains unresolved from the Decision on Jurisdiction (when I provided a Separate Opinion) and were to be dealt with in the Award on the Merits. The Award does not deal with or settle those outstanding issues. My objections related to the preliminary, but fundamental, unresolved issues which were to be dealt with in the Award on the merits upon consideration of the evidence on record, such as the identity of the Claimants which is dealt with, but not resolved in the Award, in turn giving rise to other abnormalities.\n\n2.\n\nTo determine the identity of the Claimants, the following simple, but crucial, issues should have been resolved:\n\n- Who are the Claimants?\n\n- How and when did the Claimants invest in the Argentine Republic?\n\n- What is the \"investment\" made by the Claimants?\n\n- Does King and Spalding have a valid Power of Attorney ?\n\n3.\n\nIn the Award the term \"Claimants\" is used not only to refer to the three named Claimants - Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercanias S.A., and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. - but also to Air Comet, Interinvest, and/or other entities and individuals operating with the Marsans Group. I cannot agree with this particularly because Claimants do not spell out the ownership structure of the Marsans Group.\n\n4.\n\nIt may be useful at the outset to review the facts regarding the identity of the numerous parties involved. It is crucial that we identify the \"Claimants\" and distinguish them from other parties or non-entities. It is only the three named Claimants who can be considered as asserting their own \"rights\" and claiming their \"reliefs\" for the infringement of their rights of which only the Claimants can claim protection of the Argentina-Spain Bilateral Investment Treaty (\"BIT\" or \"Treaty\").\n\n**IDENTITY OF CLAIMANTS**\n-------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe three named Claimants have failed to establish their investment in Argentina which is protected by the BIT. The facts surrounding the identity of the Claimants are set out below.\n\n6.\n\nIn the 1980s the Government of Argentina (\"GOA\") initiated a general privatization process pursuant to which the state-owned *Aerolineas Argentinas Sociedad del Estado* (\"AASE\") was to be privatized. In 1990 AASE\u2019s assets were transferred to a newly-formed company named *Aerolineas Argentina Sociedad An\u00f3nima* (\"ARSA\") which was acquired by a group of investors including the Spanish state-owned airline *Iberia L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.* (\"Iberia\"). Iberia controlled 20% of the shares, other Spanish investors 9.5%, and Argentine investors 55.5%. Subsequently, between 1990 and 1996, the Spanish Government increased its participation in ARSA from 20% to 84%.\n\n7.\n\nIn 1971 *Austral L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas, S.A.* (\"Austral\") was formed by the merger of two privately-owned airlines *Austral Compa\u00f1\u00eda Argentina de Transportes A\u00e9reos Comercial e Industrial* and *Aerotranportes Litoral Argentino.* In 1985, Austral was purchased by *Cielos del Sur S.A.,* a holding company, which became *Austral-Cielos del Sur S.A* (\"AUSA\"). During 1991 *Iberia L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.* (\"Iberia\") a Spanish state- owned airline acquired Cielos del Sur. By 1991, the Spanish Government acquired AUSA and became a significant shareholder in both ARSA and AUSA (collectively referred to as the Argentine Airlines). It may be noteworthy that the Spain-Argentina BIT came into force on 28 September 1992.\n\n8.\n\nIn 1994, Iberia incorporated a fully-owned Argentine subsidiary, Interinvest S.A. (\"Interinvest\"), to serve as the holding company for the Spanish investments in the Argentine Airlines. As a result, Interinvest became the Argentine Airlines\u2019 controlling shareholder.\n\n9.\n\nIn 1995, the Spanish Government constituted *Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales* (SEPI) to operate as the holding company for all companies fully or partially owned by the Spanish Government. As a consequence, SEPI acquired Iberia\u2019s shareholding participation in Interinvest.\n\n10.\n\nIn 2001, the Argentine Airlines were owned by SEPI. SEPI was a holding company for all companies fully or partially owned by the Spanish government. SEPI owned the Argentine Airlines through an Argentine intermediary company called Interinvest. SEPI owned 99.2% of Interinvest, and Interinvest in turn held 92.1% of ARSA\u2019s shares and 90% of AUSA\u2019s shares.1 By mid 2001 the Argentine Airlines were experiencing financial difficulties and ARSA filed for bankruptcy reorganization. In 2001 SEPI announced it would sell its participation in Interinvest through a bidding process.\n\nEx. C-II.\n\n11.\n\nAir Comet, a Spanish company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") dated October 2, 2001 with SEPI for the purchase of shares in Interinvest for a consideration of United States Dollar One (USS 1). It is important to note that Air Comet is not a Claimant in this arbitration.\n\n12.\n\nThe changes in the shareholding of Air Comet were as follows:\n\n**2001:**  \nIn 2001 the shareholders in Air Comet were as follow:  \n*Autobuses Urbanos -* 35%  \n*Transportes de Cercanias* -35%  \n*Proturin S.A.* -29.8%  \n*Segetur S.A.* -0.2%\n\n**July 2006:** Teinver purchased the shareholding of *Proturin* and *Segetur.*\n\n**2006-2007:** There were changes in the share structure of Air Comet several times, which becomes majority shareholder of Air Comet and the shareholding in Air Comet stood as follows:\n\n**October 2, 2007:**  \n Teinver - 56%  \n Autobuses Urbanos -22%  \n Transportes de Cercan\u00edas -22%\n\n**December 31, 2007,** Teinver purchased additional shares from Transportes de Cercan\u00edas so that the shareholdings in Air Comet stood as follows:  \n Teinver - 66.67%  \n Autobuses Urbanos -22%  \n Transportes de Cercan\u00edas -11.33%\n\n**December 11 2008:**  \n Request for Arbitration was received by ICSID from the Claimants on 11 December 2008, on which date the shareholding in Air Comet stood as follows:  \n Teinver - 96.77%  \n Autobuses Urbanos -2.13%  \n Transportes de Cercan\u00edas -1.1%\n\n13.\n\nOn 30 January 2009 ICSID registered the Request and notified the parties, the case being registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1.\n\n14.\n\nTwo of the Claimants held shares in Air Comet, which was a Spanish company, when Air Comet entered into the SPA with SEPI by investing US$1 to acquire the shares of Interinvest, an Argentine company, holding shares of the Argentine Airlines. The third Claimant, Teinver, was not even a shareholder of Air Comet when Air Comet acquired the shares from SEPI through the SPA. Teinver cannot claim to have \"acquired their investment\" by way of the SPA between Air Comet and SEPI when Teinver was not even a shareholder of Air Comet. Similarly, for the other two Claimants (Spanish companies), their shareholding in Air Comet (another Spanish company) cannot constitute an \"investment\" in the Argentine Airlines under the Spain-Argentine BIT.\n\n15.\n\nSince Air Comet is not a Claimant, the burden of proof rests on the three named Claimants to prove that their \"investment\" in the Argentine Airlines, to show what liabilities were assumed, and what contributions were made by each of the Claimants to the Argentine Airlines. Claimants have not discharged this burden of proof to show that their shares in Air Comet, a Spanish limited liability company, falls within the definition of \"investment\" under the BIT. Claimants made no financial contribution (since they were not parties to the SPA) and assumed no liabilities under the SPA. The liabilities were assumed by Air Comet, and not by Claimants. The rights of Claimants do not exist independently of the rights of Air Comet. Claimants have not satisfied how their shareholding rights in Air Comet can be treated as a protected investment under the BIT.\n\n16.\n\nNo shares in Argentine Airlines were ever sold to the three named Claimants. Claimants had the burden of showing when the shares in the Argentine Airlines were sold to the three Claimants, which they have failed to do. The SPA between Air Comet and SEPI does not provide proof of acquisition of shares by the Claimants, given the fact that the Claimants were not even parties to the SPA.\n\n17.\n\nClaimants\u2019 shares in Air Comet were not shares in Argentine entities. Air Comet was a company incorporated in Spain. Claimants were all Spanish shareholders with no connection to Argentina. The Claimants\u2019 shareholding in Air Comet (under the laws of Spain) could not have been an investment \"acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of\u2019 Argentina or \"shares in Argentine entities\". The Claimants\u2019 shareholdings thus fail to meet the territoriality requirement of the BIT.2\n\nThe term \"investments\" in Article I of the BIT is defined to mean *\"any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind,*  ***acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment***  *and in particular, but not exclusively, the following:*  \n***- Shares and other forms of participation in companies;...***  \n*The content and scope of the rights corresponding to the various categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Party*  ***in whose territory the investment is situated....***  \n***4. The term \"territory\" shall mean the land territory of each Party,***  *as well as the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf beyond the limits of the territorial sea of each Party over which it has or may have, in accordance with international law, jurisdiction and sovereign rights for the purposes of prospection, exploration and conservation of natural resources.*\n\n**MARSANS GROUP**\n-----------------\n\n18.\n\nThe composition and legal character of the \"Marsans Group\" remain undefined. It is evident that the \"Marsans Group\" is not a legal entity nor can it be treated as a party to these proceedings. \"Marsans Group\" is also not party to any agreement related to the transactions involved in these proceedings. Assertions that Claimants were \"part of the Marsans Group,\"3, a Spanish consortium that was owned by the late Mr. Gonzalo Pascual Arias and by Mr. Gerardo Diaz Ferran, do not give them any *locus standi* in this arbitration. To make matters even more complex, the assets of the so-called Marsans Group, including Teinver, were sold by Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias to a Spanish entity called \"Posibilitum Business\" in July 2010.4 Mr. Pascual Arias died on June 21, 2012. Mr. Diaz Ferran was provisionally detained on December 5, 2012 in connection with the Operaci\u00f3n Crucero criminal investigation conducted in Spain, where he currently remains in detention.5\n\nRFA \u00b6 3.\n\nSee Merits Hearing p. 54. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, $ 282 (\"The transaction entailed selling assets such as ViajesMarsans and Teinver S.A., which comprise the Hotetur hotel chain, the Air Comet S.A. airline, SegurosMercurio and Newco handling company, among more than 50 travel companies.\").\n\nCM \u00b6 111; *see* Ex. RA-180, AnnexP03.\n\n19.\n\nOn April 14, 2010 Claimants entered into the \"Burford Funding Agreement\" with Burford Capital Limited (\"the Funder\" or \"Burford\"), an investment company headquartered in Guernsey, Channel Islands. The Burford Funding Agreement which concerned the financing of Claimants\u2019 litigation expenses in this arbitration. Respondent has argued that Burford is a \"vulture fund\" that will be the primary beneficiary of any ICSID award in this case.\n\n20.\n\nAccording to the Burford Funding Agreement the Funder will get the following allocations from any compensation paid to the Claimants by the Tribunal:\n\n40% of the first $100 million  \n 30% of the net recovery amount between $100 million and $500 million  \n 25% of the net recovery amount between $500 million and $800 million  \n 15% of the net recovery amount above $800 million\n\n21.\n\nThe so-called \"Marsans Group\" cannot claim to be entitled to any relief since an undefined group which was neither a party to the SPA, nor was it named as a Claimant, can clearly not be treated as Claimant. In these proceedings Claimants can only be those entities or persons who have instituted the arbitration, in other words, Claimants-on-record.\n\n22.\n\nThese Claimants on record are:\n\n*- TRANSPORTES DE CERCAN\u00cdAS S.A.*  \n*- AUTOBUSES URBANOS DEL SUR S.A.*  \n*- TEINVER S.A.*\n\n23.\n\nNone of the three Claimants nor \"the Marsans Group\", the late Mr. Gonzalo Pascual Arias, Mr. Gerardo Diaz Ferran, or Burford were a party to the SPA dated October 2, 2001. It was Air Comet which invested US$1 to acquire the shares of Interinvest in Argentine Airlines. Air Comet, however, is not a Claimant. The Claimants were not parties to the SPA and undertook no contractual responsibilities under the SPA.\n\n24.\n\nThe real identity of the \"Claimants\" is not an issue that can remain unresolved. Equally important is how and when any investment was made by the three named Claimants, which can claim to be protected under the BIT.\n\n25.\n\nThe scope of protection that can be claimed and granted to parties could be gathered from the provisions of the BIT. The BIT will have to be reasonably construed, giving due weight to the object of the BIT as set out in the following terms:\n\n*The Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain, hereinafter referred to as \"the Parties\",*\n\n*Desiring to intensify economic cooperation for the economic benefit of both countries,*\n\n*Intending to create favourable conditions for investments made by investors of either State in the territory of the other State,*\n\n*Recognizing that the promotion and protection of investments in accordance with this Agreement will encourage initiatives in this field. \"*\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimants Memorial on Merits (\"CMM\") states in paragraph 2 that \"Claimants purchased the Argentine Airlines in 2001 and operated them until the GOA nationalized them in 2008\". There are a number of statements in the CMM which instead of clarifying the identity of the Claimants obscures it by confusing references to Claimants with references to Air Comet and/or to the Marsans Group as summarized below:\n\n(a) In paragraph 34 of the CMM it is stated that out of nine offers SEPI pre-selected four bidders including the Claimants through **Air Comet** as part of the Marsans Group.\n\n(b) In paragraph 35 it is stated that \"SEPI ultimately selected **Claimants\u2019** offer.\n\n(c) In paragraph 36 it is stated that \"(a) Claimants offered certain synergies, (b) **Air Comet** was owned by the Marsans Group\" as explained by Gerardo Diaz Ferran, former co-owner of Marsans Group.\n\n(d) The Argentine Airlines was thus to become part of a larger network of companies...\". We were owners of \"Viajes Marsans, the number one travel agency in Spain... **Air** **Comet** which operated charter flights to the Caribbean, South America and Canary Island\".\n\n(e) In paragraph 40 it is stated that: \"on 2 October 2001, SEPI and **Air Comet** entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") through which the latter acquired 99.2% of the share of Interinvest while the purchase price was US$1, and **Claimants** undertook a number financial commitments:\n\n\u2022 To assume Interinvest\u2019s, ARSA\u2019s and AUSA\u2019s liabilities (ARSA\u2019s liabilities at the time were in excess of US$1 billion);\n\n\u2022 To retain ARSA\u2019s and AUSA\u2019s personnel for a period of two years;\n\n\u2022 To maintain a majority interest in the Argentine Airlines for a period of two years;\n\n\u2022 To restart flights on existing routes and develop new routes as soon as possible;\n\n\u2022 To make a US$50 million capital contribution; and\n\n\u2022 To modernize and expand the airlines\u2019 fleet.\n\n**WHAT IS THE INVESTMENT? WHO MADE THE INVESTMENTS, WHEN AND HOW?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nAs indicated above, instead of clarifying the identity of the Claimants the averments reproduced above have made this task difficult, if not impossible. This is further evident from the averments made regarding who are the investors and what investments are claimed to have been made by them and on what dates. These are summarized below:\n\n28.\n\nIn Paragraph 41 of the CMM it is stated that:\n\n(a) \"In exchange for these commitments, SEPI agreed to contribute up to US$248 million to be applied by Claimants\u2019 Air Comet in the implementation of a business plan,\n\n(b) US$300 million to be applied to the payment of specific pre-existing debts. In addition, given that the financial statements upon which SEPI launched the bidding process and Claimants made their offer were updated as of July 2001, SEPI later agreed to contribute an additional amount of US$205 million to cover the operational losses suffered by the Argentine Airlines between July and October 2001.\"\n\n29.\n\nIn Paragraph 1 of the Claimants\u2019 Post Hearing Brief (\"CPHB\"), it is stated that the Claimants rely on their memorials which are hereby incorporated by reference, and then go on to state in paragraph 7 as follows:\n\n\"7. During the merits hearing, Argentina argued that Claimants\u2019 invested \"not even one peso\" in the Argentine Airlines. But in fact, Claimants and their subsidiaries invested millions of dollars in the Argentine Airlines. Claimants made cash contributions of US$13.5 million in Interinvest, US$9.9 million in ARSA, and US$0.8 million in AUSA. KPMG confirmed it. Further, Claimants also reinvested in the Argentine Airlines the US$106 million in profits that ARSA and AUSA made during 2002, 2003, and 2004.\"\n\n30.\n\nThe averments made in the pleadings, in the CMM and CPHB somewhat disingenuously refer to Grupo Marsans as the Claimants without any attempt to define the composition and character of Grupo Marsans or to explain how an undefined consortium, embracing a large number of entities (according to one report, consisting of at least 117 companies) can be referred to as Claimants disregarding the fact that there are three named Claimants of which one (Teinver) did not even acquire any shares before 2006/2007. Example of such averments are summarized below:\n\n(a) In paragraph 4 of the CPHB the Claimants expert Ricover is quoted as saying that \"I do not see any reasons to support that Grupo Marsans was not running the Argentine Airlines efficiently\"\n\n(b) in the next paragraph 5, it is stated that \"Claimants have demonstrated that these achievements were direct consequences of their investments and sound management of the Argentine Airlines.\"\n\n(c) In paragraph 6 Grupo Marsans is indicated to have been the bidder which had entered into SPA, blatantly ignoring the fact that it was Air Comet which was bidder and party to the SPA.\n\n(d) Matters are not made clearer, by the further averments in paragraph 6 as follows: This Tribunal already acknowledged the complexity of this transaction in which Claimants and other companies of Grupo Marsans made a number of significant commitments\". It is noteworthy that Air Comet did not institute the arbitration as a Claimant.\n\n31.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention limit\u2019s the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction to the legal disputes arising \u2018directly out of an investment\u2019. While the term \u2018investment\u2019 has been construed widely, it is not without limits. The key to determining whether a activity constitutes an investment is not \"the area of economic activity covered, but the form and nature of that activity\". In *Fedax NV v Republic of Venezuela6* the basic features of an investment have been described as involving a certain duration, a certain regularity of profit and return, assumption of risk, a substantial commitment and a significance for the host State\u2019s development. Schreuer observes that the ICSID Convention \u2018does not imply unlimited freedom for parties...the term \"investment\" has an objective meaning independent of the parties\u2019 disposition\u2019.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/96/3\n\n32.\n\nThe Spain-Argentina BIT contains a definition of \u2018investment\u2019 and provides that:\n\nThe term \"investments\" shall mean any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind, acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment and in particular, but not exclusively, the following:\n\n- Shares and other forms of participation in companies;\n\n- Rights derived from any kind of contribution made with the intention of creating economic value, including loans directly linked with a specific investment, whether capitalized or not;\n\n- Movable and immovable property and real rights such as mortgages, privileges, sureties, usufructs and similar rights;\n\n- Any kind of rights in the field of intellectual property, including patents, trade marks, manufacturing licenses and know-how;\n\n- Concessions granted by law or by virtue of a contract for engaging in economic and commercial activity, in particular those related to the prospection, cultivation, mining or development of natural resources.\n\n33.\n\nThe Preamble to the Spain-Argentina BIT provides:\n\n\"The Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain, hereinafter referred to as \"the Parties\",\n\nDesiring to intensify economic cooperation for the economic benefit of both countries,\n\nIntending to create favourable conditions for investments made by investors of either State in the territory of the other State,\n\nRecognizing that the promotion and protection of investments in accordance with this Agreement will encourage initiatives in this field,\n\nHave agreed as follows:\"\n\nThe purpose of the BIT was the promotion and protection of investment and the creation of favourable conditions for investments made by investors in the territory of the host state for the \"economic benefit\" of the host state.\n\n34.\n\nThe relevant test for the Tribunal to determine whether it has jurisdiction is a \"double keyhole approach\" or a \"double-barreled\" test. Claimants have to satisfy the requirements of both the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Under the double-barreled test the activities of Claimants have to meet the definition of \"investment\" in the BIT as well as the \"objective\" criteria of an investment within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (as held in *CSOB v Slovakia7, Salini v Morocco8*, and *Joy Mining v Egypt9).*\n\n*Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, a.s. v. Slovak Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction (May 24, 1999), available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/csob\\_decision.pdf; Decision of the Tribunal on the Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction of December 1, 2000, 15 ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ 530 (2000).\n\n*Salini Construttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4), Decision on Jurisdiction of July 23, 2001, 129 Journal du droit international 196 (2002) [French original]; English translation in 42 ILM 609 (2003).\n\n*Joy Mining Machinery Limited v The Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11), Award on Jurisdiction of 06 August 2004.\n\n35.\n\nThe ICSID Convention expressly states in Article 25 clause (1):\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"\n\nFor the purpose of proper definition of \"investment\" we need to interpret Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention requires that courts and arbitral tribunals shall interpret treaties \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". The Vienna Convention specifically states that the preamble and the annexes qualify part of the text for the purposes of interpretation (Article 31(2)) and that context includes \"any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\" and \"(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable\" (Article 3 l(3)(b) and (c)). The current leading decision on the definition of \"investment\" in ICSID arbitration, *Salini v Morocco10,* has existed for more than a decade. It laid down the test that requires investment to have four elements: (i) a contribution of money or other assets; (ii) a certain duration; (iii) an element of risk; (iv) a contribution to the host State\u2019s development.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/00/4\n\n36.\n\nClaimants\u2019 had not transferred any financial resources to the host state, Argentina, when Air Comet bought shares in the Argentine Airlines for US$1. The SPA did not involve any contribution of assets by Claimants. Air Comet received payments from SEPI to meet the liabilities of the Argentine Airlines. Air Comet made a nominal payment of US$1 for the shares. There was no risk borne by Claimants. In relation to the activities or obligations undertaken by Air Comet under the SPA:\n\n- there was no transfer of financial resources from Claimants to Argentina;\n\n- the SPA involved a one-off transaction and not of any certain duration;\n\n- there was no risk borne by Claimants; and\n\n- there was no substantial commitment or significant contribution to Argentina\u2019s development.\n\n37.\n\nAcquiring of the shares by Air Comet and subsequent transfers to the three named Claimants could not properly, therefore, be treated as protected \"investment\".\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction is based on a *prima facie* assessment. The Tribunal in *Siemens AG v Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004) explained the position in the following terms:\n\n\"At this [jurisdictional] stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal is not required to consider whether the claims under the Treaty made by Siemens are correct. This is a matter for the merits. **The Tribunal simply has to be satisfied that, if the** **Claimant\u2019s allegations would be proven correct, then the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider them.\"** *[emphasis added}*\n\n39.\n\nNothing stated by the Tribunal at the jurisdictional phase is conclusive on the basic issue to whether Claimants have rights which fall under the definition of \"investments\" as contained in Article I of the BIT and in respect of which protection can be granted under the BIT.\n\n40.\n\nThe identification of the \"investment\", that is the subject matter of the present claim, and the identities of the investors, who are entitled to claim damages, are crucial issues to be determined at the merits stage. The alleged violation of the investors\u2019 rights, and the potential relief than can be awarded, will depend on the answer to the following questions:\n\n- What constituted the \"investment\"?\n\n- Who are the investors? What are the identities of the investors who can claim damages under the BIT?\n\n41.\n\nIn the present case, the identification of the \"investment\" is difficult since the investment arises from a complex transaction under which Claimants were purportedly undertaking responsibilities and risks in assuming debts and liabilities of the airlines going forward and the undertaking to maintain and expand the operations of the airlines. The questions which need to be answered at the outset are:\n\n- Which Claimant assumed what liability?\n\n- Whether Claimants assumed liabilities, by what means, and in relation to which creditors?\n\n42.\n\nRegardless of the complexity of the transactions, Claimants\u2019 \"investment\" of which they seek protection under the BIT has to be identified.\n\n43.\n\nCan the shares that Claimants held in Air Comet S.A., a Spanish limited liability company, fall under the definition of \"investment\" which states that the \"investment\" has to be ***\"acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment\"***  *and that the \"content and scope of the rights corresponding to the various categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Party*  ***in whose territory the investment is situated\"?*** Do we not need to consider under which Argentine law Claimants acquired rights which can be treated as \"investment\" under the BIT?\n\n44.\n\nIt seems disingenuous for Claimants to allege making an \"investment\" in the Argentine Airlines. The Argentine Airlines were in operation long before Claimants bought on different dates (as late as 2006 in the case of Teinver) shares in Air Comet, a Spanish company. We need to ask the further questions -\n\nWhether and how did each of the Claimants acquire shares in Air Comet? Can Claimants\u2019 acquisition of shares, in the circumstances of the case, be treated as an investment made \"in accordance with the legislation of\u2019 Argentina? What are the content and scope of the rights acquired by Claimants as determined by Argentine law?\n\n45.\n\nSince there is no evidence that Claimants made any financial contribution which can be characterized as \"investment\" in the Argentine Airlines, it is not clear how any right in respect of Claimants\u2019 shares in Air Comet can be said to be protected under the BIT.\n\n46.\n\nThe issue to be decided is whether Claimants (as shareholders of Air Comet) may claim compensation for alleged violations of the BIT when Air Comet (the company which actually held the shares in Interinvest, the holding company of the Argentine Airlines) itself does not make such claims before the Tribunal. Claimants have failed to show how their shareholder rights exist independent of the rights of Air Comet and how those shareholder rights can be treated as a protected investment.\n\n47.\n\nIt is necessary to look at the precise content and scope of the rights which Claimants allege are their investments and to consider whether these rights constitute investments which can claim to be protected by the BIT.\n\n48.\n\nThe term \"investments\" in Article I of the BIT is defined to mean\n\n*\"any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind,*  ***acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment***  *and in particular, but not exclusively, the following:*\n\n***- Shares and other forms of participation in companies;***\n\n*- Rights derived from any kind of contribution made with the intention of creating economic value, including loans directly linked with a specific investment, whether capitalized or not;*\n\n*- Movable and immovable property and real rights such as mortgages, privileges, sureties, usufructs and similar rights;*\n\n*- Any kind of rights in the field of intellectual property, including patents, trade marks, manufacturing licenses and know-how;*\n\n*- Concessions granted by law or by virtue of a contract for engaging in economic and commercial activity, in particular those related to the prospection, cultivation, mining or development of natural resources.*\n\n*The content and scope of the rights corresponding to the various categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Party*  ***in whose territory the investment is situated.***\n\n*No modification in the legal forum in which assets and capital have been invested or reinvested shall affect their status as investments in accordance with this Agreement.*\n\n*3. The terms \"investment income or earnings\" shall mean returns from an investment in accordance with the definition contained in the preceding paragraph and shall expressly include profits, dividends and interest.*\n\n*4.*  ***The term \"territory\" shall mean the land territory of each Party,***  *as well as the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf beyond the limits of the territorial sea of each Party over which it has or may have, in accordance with international law, jurisdiction and sovereign rights for the purposes of prospection, exploration and conservation of natural resources.*\n\n49.\n\nClaimants cannot claim that their rights in respect of which they claim protection of the BIT were \"acquired or affected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment\" (that is the Argentine law) since Claimants\u2019 rights are those of a shareholder of Air Comet S.A., a limited liability company in Spain.\n\n50.\n\nThe precise content and scope of the rights alleged by Claimants as being violated must be identified and the question that must be answered is whether the rights of Claimants can be treated as \"investments\" as defined in Article I of the BIT.\n\n**IV. ISSUE OF ADMISSIBILITY AND STANDING NOT ADDRESSED IN THE DECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe issue of the Power of Attorney of King & Spalding to represent Claimants arose in the context of the insolvency proceedings in respect of Claimants and of Air Comet.\n\n52.\n\nInsolvency Proceedings were commenced in respect of each of the Claimants on the dates as noted below:\n\n- Teinver in December 2010.\n\n- Transportes de Cercanias in February 2011.\n\n- Autobuses Urbanos del Sur in April 2012.\n\n- Air Comet in March 2008.11\n\nVol. 6, page 994-998.\n\n53.\n\nThe issue for this Tribunal to determine is whether King & Spalding has valid powers of attorney at the present stage of this arbitration, now that each of Claimants\u2019 administrative powers have been suspended. Claimants argue that the powers of attorney are still valid and that the Claimants\u2019 reorganization administrators are simply \"stepping into the shoes\" of Claimants for purposes of the continuation of this arbitration. Respondent argues, to the contrary, that Claimants\u2019 power of attorney was extinguished by the bankruptcy, that a new power of attorney is needed, and that a valid new power of attorney has not yet been granted to King & Spalding or anyone else.\n\n54.\n\nThe bankruptcy of Air Comet and of all three Claimants is related to certain factual and legal disputes in this case. First, Respondent has asserted that Claimants\u2019 bankruptcy terminated King & Spalding\u2019s power of attorney to represent Claimants in this case. Second, the Parties disagree on the causes of Claimants\u2019 and Air Comet\u2019s bankruptcy. Claimants, through witness Diaz Ferran, assert that the bankruptcies were the direct result of Respondent\u2019s unlawful acts and policies towards the Airlines. Respondent argues that the bankruptcies were due to reasons wholly unconnected to Respondent\u2019s actions, including Claimants\u2019 poor business management, lack of liquidity and failure to make payments. With respect to Air Comet\u2019s bankruptcy, Respondent argues that the company was in a state of bankruptcy as early as April 2008, predating the expropriation of the Airlines later in 2008. These arguments with respect to the causation of the Claimants\u2019 insolvencies are relevant to both Claimants\u2019 claims and Respondent\u2019s counterclaim.\n\n55.\n\nMoreover, Respondent argues that King & Spalding\u2019s attempts to \"ratify\" its power of attorney fail. While Claimants have produced letters written by the trustees in insolvency for each of the Claimants that purport to ratify the power of attorney, Respondent asserts that these letters are flawed. It notes that the letters are not addressed directly to ICSID but rather to the King &Spalding attorneys representing Claimants. It also notes that the letters are undated, and that they do not appear to have been notarized. Finally, Respondent notes that the letters appear to have been executed unilaterally by the trustees, and do not appear to be the result of an order from a commercial court of Madrid. According to Respondent, the trustees lack the right to ratify the acts taken by King & Spalding and to authorize the firm to carry on its activities. Respondent asserts that \"every lawyer is aware that, in order for a power of attorney to be renewed within the context of an insolvency proceeding, there must be a court order authorizing such renewal.\"\n\n56.\n\nClaimants argue that the reorganization administrators \"are not required to seek authorization from the courts hearing Claimants\u2019 reorganization proceedings,\" noting that \"[i]n accordance with Article 51(2) of the Spanish Bankruptcy Law, the court\u2019s authorization would only be required in order to withdraw, to accept a claim, in whole or in part, and to settle disputes\".\n\n57.\n\nWith respect to the power of attorney granted to King & Spalding, Claimants\u2019 expert witness Aurora Martinez Florez asserts that after the suspension of powers, the board of trustees directly steps into the shoes of the debtor in the agreements and powers of attorney granted by the debtor before the declaration of bankruptcy.\n\n58.\n\nWith respect to Article 48(3) of the Bankruptcy Law, which provides that \"Any power of attorney existing at the time of the initiation of the insolvency proceedings shall be affected by the suspension or control of financial and property-related powers,\" Martinez Florez argues that \"affected\" does not mean that powers of attorney are terminated.\n\n59.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s expert J.J. Cigaran Magan has testified that\n\nPage 987, lines\n\n12... Well, I think that in the courts, it is a\n\n13 basic, essential rule, and any attorney knows that\n\n14 they cannot go to a court without Powers of Attorney\n\n15 granted in notarial instruments.\n\n60.\n\nThe onus was on the Claimants of proving that their standing and the continued capacity of their lawyers to represent them subsisted after the commencement of the insolvency proceedings. This onus has not been discharged. The undated non-notarized letters from the trustees in insolvency which were not directly addressed to this Tribunal cannot be accepted as proof that King & Spalding fulfilled the legal requirement for representing the Claimants after the insolvency proceedings had commenced.\n\n61.\n\nThe issue is further complicated by the third party funding arrangement which exists under the Burford Funding Agreement. The Funding Agreement, with effective date April 14, 2010, is between\n\n(i) Teinver S.A.,\n\n(ii) Transportes de Cercanias S.A. and\n\n(iii) Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. (all companies incorporated under the laws of Spain and have their principal place of business in Madrid, Spain), and\n\n(i) Burford Capital Limited (described as a \"closed-ended investment company organized under the laws of Guernsey having its principal place of business at Regency Court, Glategny Esplanade, St Peter Port, Guernsey GY1 1 WW\").\n\n62.\n\nThe first point to note is that the Funding Agreement was executed by (i) Gerardo Diaz Ferran and (ii) Gonzalo Pascual Arias. These individuals are not Claimants. It is not understood how these individuals, not being Claimants, could execute the Funding Agreement which states in the recital that\n\n\u2022 Claimant \"requires funding to meet the costs of preparing, submitting and enforcing the Claim\",\n\n\u2022 Claimant \"sought to make arrangements to obtain funds\",\n\n\u2022 Claimant \"has approached the Funder\",\n\n\u2022 and Funder has a \"common legal interest\" with the Claimant.\n\n63.\n\nGonzalo Pascual Arias and Gerardo Diaz Ferran are persons against whom the Spanish authorities had initiated criminal proceedings for embezzlement, and who have since been convicted by the Spanish Courts. The criminal proceedings against Gonzalo Pascual Arias (now deceased) and Gerardo Diaz Ferran (now convicted and serving sentence in a Spanish prison) is dealt with in a separate section below.\n\n64.\n\nThe Funding Agreement was not executed by Air Comet, which was a party to the SPA and arguably may claim to have made an investment under the BIT. The reason Air Comet did not, and could not, execute the Funding Agreement was that by 14 April 2010 Air Comet was already in insolvency proceedings.\n\n65.\n\nOn January 4, 2010 ICSID informed that parties that the present Tribunal had been constituted. The Funding Agreement, by which Burford got involved in this arbitration, was executed within about four months from the constitution of the Tribunal, and well before the filing of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on Merits dated September 29, 2010.\n\n66.\n\nThe Funding Agreement states\n\n\"WHEREAS  \n (A) Burford Capital Limited is an investment company headquartered in Guernsey and publicly traded on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange.  \n (B) The Claimant requires funding to meet the costs of preparing, submitting, conducting and enforcing the Claim (as defined below). The Claimant has therefore sought to make arrangements to obtain funds for such purpose that would allow repayment of such funds to the Funder, plus consideration for the attendant risk, to be conditional upon recovery of proceeds from the Claim.  \n (C) The Claimant has approached the Funder and for this purpose. The Funder has concluded that the Claim is meritorious and the Funder has a common legal interest with the Claimant in seeing that such Claim is pursued adequately.\"\n\n67.\n\nSchedule 2 of the Funding Agreement states:\n\n\"The Recovery Amount shall be determined and distributed as follows.\n\n1. First, the Expenses paid by the Funder shall be repaid to it and the Funder shall also receive a priority return of three times the Expenses.\n\n2. Any premiums or success fees due to counsel shall be paid.\n\n3. The amount remaining after those payments shall be the \"Net Recovery Amount\" which shall be allocated as follows:\n\n3.1 In the event of a Settlement within twelve month of the Effective Date, 20% of Net Recovery Amount to Funder and the remainder to the Claimant, provided however that the total Recovery Amount payable to the Funder pursuant to section 1 and this section 3.1 shall not exceed 25% of the Award less the Expenses.\n\n3.2 Absent such a settlement,\n\n40% of the first US$100 million of Net Recovery Amount to the Funder,\n\n30% of any Net Recovery Amount between US$100 million and US$500 million to the Funder,\n\n25% of any Net Recovery Amount between US$500 million and US$800 million to the Funder, and\n\n15% of any Net Recovery Amount above US$800 million to the Funder, in each case with the remainder to the Claimant.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Funder shall be entitled [to] receive a minimum amount so as to provide the Funder with an internal rate of return of not less than 50%.\"\n\n68.\n\nClause 6 of the Funding Agreement states\n\n\"6.1 In consideration of the Funder\u2019s undertakings in this Agreement, the Claimant agrees to pay the Funder the Recovery Amount immediately following receipt of all or any part of the Award...\n\n6.2... if the Claimant comes into possession of any Award proceeds, it shall immediately pay all such proceeds immediately to the Nominated Lawyers [King & Spalding LLP] or the escrow agent. The Claimant and the Funder both direct the Nominated Lawyers or the escrow agent to pay the Recovery Amount to the Funder as soon as practicable, to pay any outstanding invoices and to pay the remainder to the Claimant.\"\n\n69.\n\nAs would be evident from the Funding Agreement (in particular clauses 6.1 and 6.2) the Funder, which is not an \"investor\" under the BIT, is intended to be the principal beneficiary, along with the Nominated Lawyers, of the proceeds of any award. The award proceeds are to be immediately paid to the Nominated Lawyers (King & Spalding LLP) or an escrow agent for payment to the Funder and payment of any outstanding invoices (including those of the Nominated Lawyers). Only the remainder will be paid to Claimant.\n\n70.\n\nDespite not being an \"investor\" under the BIT and the funds provided by Burford not being \"protected investment\" under the BIT, these proceedings have continued because Burford and the Nominated Lawyers have been assured of receiving significant amounts from any award which may be made by the ICSID Tribunal. Burford is a third party and as the Respondent states \"is abusing the ICSID system by bringing forward a claim that is contrary to the purposes and goals of the Convention in order to make astronomical profits\".\n\n71.\n\nIn addition, according to Schedule 2, paragraph 4 of the Funding Agreement, Burford is guaranteed an internal rate of return of not less than 50% on its \"investment\".\n\n72.\n\nBurford may have \"invested\" in the present arbitration proceedings by agreeing to fund the legal expenses but such an \"investment\" based on speculating on the prospect of obtaining a substantial portion the proceeds of any award resulting from a pending arbitration cannot be treated as protected \"investment\" under the BIT. The BIT guarantees the rights of \"investors\" who have made an \"investment\" in the territory of the host state. The BIT is not intended to enable payment of awards to third party funders who are not \"investors\" and who have no protected \"investment\", and who only come into the situation in the circumstances described above to advance funds in order to speculate on the outcome of a pending arbitration.\n\n73.\n\nThe practice of third party funding investment arbitration continues to be criticized by academics and professionals. The Funder\u2019s role in this case may well be characterized as \"champerty\", which has long been considered under English common law as being against public policy as it encourages vexatious litigation. A contract may be void for champerty, though it may not strictly amount to criminal offence. The purchase of a law suit by an attorney is champerty in its most odious form as has been held in a judgment of the English Chancery Division:\n\nSo odious in the eyes of the law are these contracts, that they confer no rights on the parties making them, and if one pay out money under them he cannot recover it.12\n\n*Rees v de Bernardy* [1896] 2 Ch 437.\n\n74.\n\nBurford cannot, on any reasonable construction be characterized as an investor entitled to protection under the BIT. The Tribunal cannot, in these circumstances, be considered to have jurisdiction to grant an award to a party, such as Burford, which is not an investor under the BIT and has made no \"investment\" which can claim to be protected by the BIT.\n\n75.\n\nThe questions about how any activities of the Marsans Group can be attributed to the Claimants remain pertinent.\n\n76.\n\nIt was not the Claimants but Air Comet which had entered into the SPA with SEPI. Claimants were not a party to the SPA. The Claimants\u2019 management of the Argentine Airlines is not established, nor have their claim, or what they had \"invested\". The burden of proof was on Claimants and they have failed to discharge it.\n\n77.\n\nAir Comet, the party to the SPA, received from SEPI US$300 million which was to be used for liquidating ARSA\u2019s liabilities. There is no evidence that Air Comet used the funds for the purpose stipulated in the SPA. So there can be no basis for a claim by Air Comet nor by the three named Claimants as indirect shareholders of Air Comet to be treated as an \"investor\".\n\n78.\n\nSince the Marsans Group are not Claimants and indeed the composition and status of the Marsans Group have remained undefined, no alleged contribution of the so-called Marsans Group can be treated as \"investment\" within the meaning of the BIT.\n\n79.\n\nMr Gerardo Diaz Ferran has been found criminally liable and sentenced to two years and two months\u2019 imprisonment by the Judgment of the Spanish Central Criminal Court No.l (RA 669). The judgment (RA 669) sheds clear light on how through a complex set of transactions the funds which were meant to be applied to liquidate the liabilities of ARSA (and if indeed had they been applied might be treated as an \"investment\") had in fact been misappropriated.\n\n80.\n\nThe relevant portions of the Spanish Court Judgment (RA 669) are reproduced below:\n\n***\"ESTABLISHED FACTS***\n\n*In accordance with the private agreement entered into between AIR COMET and its shareholders on 3 December 2001, which was notarially recorded on the same day, AIR COMET S.A. irrevocably agreed that*  *the claims acquired would only be used as funds of its own to increase capital or make irrevocable capital contributions to ARSA and undertook to fulfil such commitment within six months* *as from approval of ARSA\u2019s Reorganization Plan. If the claims were not used as agreed upon, SEPI would be entitled to require the parties to repay any sum that was otherwise allocated.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*In view of the fact that the claims assigned to AIR COMET remained effective,*  *AIR COMET obtained a benefit since these claims were acquired using funds provided by SEPI for no valuable consideration.*\n\nThus no investment can be said to have made by Air Comet. The Spanish Court Judgment (RA 669) further concludes:\n\n\u2026\n\n***CONCLUSIONS OF LA W***\n\n*Nonetheless,*  ***in reality, the millions of dollars given by SEPI to meet INTERINVEST\u2019s*** ***liabilities were used by AIR COMET to purchase the claims, thereby subrogating to the rights of ARSA\u2019s creditor and participating in its reorganization proceedings***  *(Report issued by the Spanish Court of Audit).*\n\n\u2026\n\n*It is thus evident that Air*  ***Comet was the only holder of the claims acquired through the USD 300 million provided by SEPI.***\n\n\u2026\n\n*In accordance with the agreement of 3 December 2001 between AIR COMET and its shareholders (Transportes de Cercanias, Busursa, Segetur and Viajes Marsans), the company* [Air Comet] *undertook to acquire a series of claims* [debts]to *be paid by ARSA, thus subrogating to the rights of the creditors.*\n\nIt may be noted that the two of the three named Claimants were not shareholders of Air Comet at the relevant time. Regarding the fraud committed by Air Comet the Spanish Court Judgment (RA 669) noted:\n\n*... The claims acquired were used to increase ARSA\u2019s capital. Therefore,*  ***AIR COMET*** ***ended up increasing its stake in ARSA by using funds granted by SEPI to INTERINVEST,***  *which were aimed at paying ARSA \u2019s liabilities.*\n\n*...In fact, since AIR COMET acquired the claims \u2014assets\u2014 without having the necessary funds to do so \u2014with funds granted by INTERINVEST\u2014*  ***this was actually an assignment*** ***for no consideration, a gift or a case of unjust enrichment,***  *if not a mere present given by the donor. The ultimate beneficiary was AIR COMET, since it was its value that increased, and this fact cannot be concealed.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*The claims were not settled. If they had, they would have produced no benefits, which is the theory advanced by the accused at trial in stating that Air Comet was \"a simple agent\". However, since those claims remained effective, Air Comet, in acquiring them, received the benefit deriving from its inclusion as a new creditor in ARSA\u2019s* *reorganization.*\n\n*...In this respect, Judgment STS 979/2011 should be highlighted, among others: \"The companies constitute a business structure that is controlled by a single person (in this case, the accused and their companies). There is no separation of assets in the conduct of their business that justifies the conclusion that they operate independently of each other. Their respective personalities are nothing but a front.*  ***There is actually a single*** ***economic structure that is used to commit fraud or to harm a third party and thus cannot enjoy the protection granted by the law***  *to an entity that has a legal personality of its own \".*\n\n81.\n\nFrom the above judgment  the following facts become clear that under the SPA by which Air Comet obtained shares of Interinvest for USD 1, SEPI had provided USD300,000 for the reduction of liabilities of Argentine Airlines and Air Comet had undertaken to utilize that amount for the specific purpose of reduction of liabilities of Argentine Airlines. This was not done.\n\n82.\n\nDespite contributions by SEPI for reducing the liabilities of ARSA the fact is that ARSA remained indebted since the obligations undertaken by Air Comet in the SPA were not fulfilled. The assertion that Air Comet \"invested\" that amount is, in fact, palpably unwarranted. The millions of dollars given by SEPI to meet Interinvest\u2019s liabilities were not so used but were used by Air Comet to purchase the claims. This cannot be treated as an investment of Air Comet in the Argentine Airlines.\n\n83.\n\nThe effect of this transaction was that the Interinvest\u2019s liabilities (and Argentine Airlines\u2019 liabilities) continued to be liabilities while Air Comet illegally acquired claims over the Argentine Airlines through fraudulent means.\n\n84.\n\nThrough the fraud so committed harm was caused to the Argentine Airlines to the extent that SEPI funds meant for reducing the liabilities of the Argentine Airlines were not so used, but were actually used to increase the share capital of Air Comet. Such a misuse of the funds which were intended to reduce the liabilities, but were misappropriated, cannot be regarded as Claimants\u2019 \"investment\".\n\n85.\n\nAir Comet\u2019s acquisition has been found by the Spanish Court to have been **\"an** **assignment for no consideration, a gift or a case of unjust enrichment\".**\n\n86.\n\nThe Spanish Court has found that in this transaction there is **\"actually a single economic** **structure that is used to commit fraud or to harm a third party [the Argentine** **Airlines] and thus cannot enjoy the protection granted by the law\".**\n\n87.\n\nIn such a situation, where a Spanish Court has found that a fraud had been committed by Air Comet and Mr Ferran to harm the Argentine Airlines, it cannot be legally tenable to treat such misuse of the funds as an \"investment\" which may seek the protection of the BIT.\n\n**ALLEGED BREACHES OF THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT PROVISION**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nMy concerns regarding the identity of the Claimants are also relevant in assessing the Memorandum of Agreement signed between the Government of Argentina and Interinvest (\"the July 2008 Agreement\").13\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit C-190.\n\n89.\n\nThe crucial issue remains that none of the three Claimants were parties to this July 2008 Agreement and thus had no rights under the July 2008 Agreement. As Professor Kinsbury has stated in his expert opinion an investor cannot invoke commitments under an agreement unless it is \"a contract between the Claimant and the Government\". I am in agreement with Professor Kinsbury and am of the view that since none of the three named Claimants were parties to the July 2008 Agreement they cannot claim for contractual breaches of that July 2008 Agreement. Further, in Professor Kinsbury\u2019s opinion a simple breach of contract cannot be regarded as a breach of the BIT.14\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, Para 134.\n\n90.\n\nThe issue is whether the Claimants can claim a treaty breach under the BIT for any violations of the July 2008 Agreement between Interinvest and the Argentine Government. If there was a breach Interinvest, being an Argentine company, could not claim under the Spain-Argentina BIT. Air Comet, the Spanish shareholders of Interinvest, did not lodge any claims before this Tribunal and are not the Claimants. I am of the view that Claimants do not have standing to bring claims for treaty breaches for any alleged violations of the contractual terms of the July 2008 Agreement by Argentina.\n\n91.\n\nThe factual and legal context of the July 2008 Agreement is important in order to assess breaches of the Claimants\u2019 treaty rights by the Respondent.\n\n92.\n\nThe July 2008 Agreement was executed between Argentina and Interinvest since a potential investor, Mr. Mena, withdrew and \"the reason Mr. Lopex Mena withdrew from the acquisition of the Airlines was that he could never have sufficient information of the economic, financial and operational situation of the Airlines because, as was said, the Marsans Group did not provide the necessary information\".15\n\nExhibit RA 555; Respondent\u2019s PHB, Para 144.\n\n93.\n\nIt is important that the July 2008 Agreement is not an agreement for sale of shares. The price of the shares which were to be transferred from Interinvest, arguably the most crucial element of any transfer of shares, remained to be agreed between Interinvest and the Respondent.\n\n94.\n\nThe main disagreement between Interinvest and Argentina that led to the failure of the July 2008 Agreement was the price valuation of the Argentine Airlines. Regardless of the price valuation, it was an agreed position that the financial condition of the Argentine Airlines was very bad - Respondent characterizes the Airlines as being \"in truly bankrupt condition\"16 and Claimants assert that by mid 2008 \"the Argentine Airline\u2019s financial condition hit its worst point since Claimants acquired them in October 2001\"17. It may be pertinent that in 2001 when the SPA was executed the valuation of the Argentine Airlines was US$1. If the financial position in July 2008 was worse than that in 2001 then it appears that the Respondent\u2019s negative valuation (as conducted by TTN) of the Airlines is more credible than the Claimants\u2019 non-independent valuation conducted by Credit Suisse.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter Memorial, Para 478; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, Para 466.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, Para 287\n\n95.\n\nSince the price of the shares was not agreed between Interinvest and the Respondent, I cannot agree with the conclusion in paragraph 782 of the Award that the July 2008 memorandum \"constituted a binding agreement between Interinvest and the Government of Argentina pursuant to which the two parties agreed to the purchase and sale of Interinvest\u2019s shares in the Airlines on the terms set out in the Agreement\". Since the price was not agreed, the memorandum of July 2008 (referred to as July 2008 Agreement) cannot be treated as a binding agreement for the sale and purchase of the Airlines. A binding agreement for sale was yet to be reached upon agreement of the price between the parties. The failure to reach an agreement cannot be treated as a breach of the treaty rights of the Claimants. There was no guarantee from the Government that the shares of the Airlines would be purchased. The July 2008 Agreement was merely an agreement to explore for a limited period of 60 days the possibility of a purchase of shares provided that the price valuation could be carried out.\n\n96.\n\nThe failure of the parties to agree to appoint an independent expert cannot be attributed as a treaty breach of the Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT by the Respondent. The Respondent has consistently held that Interinvest failed to provide financial information required under the July 2008 Agreement.18 Mr Munoz Perez also confirmed that even Credit Suisse valuation was done on the basis of a \"Business Plan\" prepared by \"the Board of Directors of the Marsans Group\".19 A credible valuation by Credit Suisse would have required the auditors to independently to verify or carry out any audit the documents. This was not done. I cannot agree with the Tribunal that Respondent\u2019s complaints regarding the Credit Suisse valuation were formal and artificial.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras 490-493; Respondent\u2019s Counter Memorial, paras 507-508; Respondent\u2019s PHB, Para 159-162.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, Para 40, citing testimony of M Perez, transcript p.489.\n\n97.\n\nI am of the view that the 2008 Agreement contained no commitments from the Respondent to the three named Claimants. The 2008 Agreement was not a binding agreement for the sale of shares but was a memorandum to explore the option of the sale of shares provided the price of the shares could be agreed at and other conditions could be met within a transition period of 60 days, which expired on 14 October 2008. For these reasons, the 2008 Agreement cannot be the basis of finding a treaty breach of obligations owed to the three named Claimants by the Respondent.\n\n98.\n\nIn conclusion, for all the reasons stated above, I consider and find that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to grant reliefs under the Argentina-Spain Treaty to the Claimants in the form of declarations set out in paragraphs 1148 (a)-(c) or the directions set out in paragraphs 1148 (d)-(g) of the majority award, as Claimants have failed to establish that they are investors entitled to protection under the Treaty or that their investments in respect of which protection was sought are protected investments under the Treaty. With due respect to my co-arbitrators, I cannot concur in the majority award and enter this dissenting opinion."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS** | |\n| **Abbreviation** | **Description** |\n| **\u00b6/\u00b6\u00b6** | Paragraph/paragraphs |\n| 2006 Agreement | Letter of Intent between the National State and Argentine Airlines S.A. and Interinvest S.A. signed on 21 June 2006 |\n| 2006 Addendum | Addendum to Letter of Intent between the National State and Argentine Airlines S.A. and Interinvest S.A. signed on 21 June 2006 |\n| AASE | Aerolineas Argentinas Sociedad del Estado |\n| ACCP | Argentina\u2019s Code of Criminal Procedure |\n| AFIP | The Argentine tax authority, *Administration Federal de Ingresos Piiblicos* |\n| APTA | Association of Aeronautics Technical Personnel |\n| Air Comet |  |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings [2006] |\n| ARSA | Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. |\n| Assignment Agreement | Credit Assignment Agreement among Teinver, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos as the assignors and Air Comet as the assignee, dated 18 January 2010 |\n| AUSA | Austral-Cielos del Sur S.A. |\n| C-[#] | Claimants\u2019 Exhibits and Legal Authorities |\n| Cl.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain on the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated October 3, 1991 (the \"Treaty\"), which entered into force on September 28, 1992, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\"). The dispute relates to Claimants\u2019 allegations that Respondent has violated the Treaty, international law, and Argentine law, as well as commitments and representations made by Respondent to Claimants, by unlawfully re-nationalizing and taking other measures regarding Claimants\u2019 investments in two Argentine airlines: Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. (\"ARSA\") and Austral-Cielos del Sur S.A. (\"AUSA\") (collectively, the \"Airlines\" or the \"Argentine Airlines\") and their subsidiaries. Respondent also makes a Counterclaim.\n\n2.\n\nClaimants are Teinver S.A. (\"Teinver\"), Transportes de Cercanias S.A. (\"Transportes de Cercanias\") and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. (\"Autobuses Urbanos\") (collectively, \"Claimants\").\n\n3.\n\nClaimants are companies incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Spain.\n\n4.\n\nRespondent is the Argentine Republic and is hereinafter also referred to as \"Argentina\" or the \"Respondent.\"\n\n5.\n\nClaimants and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\" The Parties\u2019 respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Registration of the Request for Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn December 12, 2008, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated December 11, 2008 from Claimants against Respondent (the \"Request\" or \"RFA\").\n\n7.\n\nThe RFA invoked Respondent\u2019s advance consent to ICSID arbitration contained in the Treaty, and by way of a most-favored-nation (\"MFN\") clause in the Treaty, the dispute settlement provisions in the 1991 Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment (the \"US-Argentina BIT\"), which entered into force on October 20, 1994.\n\n8.\n\nOn January 30, 2009, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Acting Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated April 3, 2009, Claimants informed the Centre that they had selected the method envisaged in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention for the constitution of the Tribunal (i.e. the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, who would be the president of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties).\n\n10.\n\nOn April 27, 2009, Claimants informed the Centre of their appointment of Mr. Henri C. Alvarez Q.C., a Canadian national, as an arbitrator. Mr. Alvarez accepted his appointment on May 4, 2009.\n\n11.\n\nOn May 12, 2009, Claimants requested ICSID to appoint the arbitrators not yet appointed and to designate an arbitrator to be the President of the Tribunal in this case, pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4(1 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\").\n\n12.\n\nOn June 1, 2009, Respondent appointed Dr. Kamal Hossain, a Bangladeshi national, as an arbitrator. Dr. Hossain accepted his appointment on June 6, 2009.\n\n13.\n\nBy letters of June 15, 2009, August 3, 2009, September 29, 2009, and November 2, 2009, the Centre consulted with the Parties in connection with the appointment of the arbitrator not yet appointed, as envisaged in Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of December 14, 2009, the Centre informed the Parties that, pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4, ICSID was to propose to the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council the appointment of Judge Thomas Buergenthal, a U.S. national, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n15.\n\nOn December 21, 2009, both Parties informed ICSID that they did not have any observations on the proposed appointment of Judge Thomas Buergenthal as President of the Tribunal.\n\n16.\n\nOn December 28, 2009, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Judge Thomas Buergenthal as President of the Tribunal. Judge Buergenthal accepted his appointment on December 30, 2009.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Thomas Buergenthal (U.S.), President, appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention; Henri C. Alvarez (Canadian), appointed by Claimants; and Kamal Hossain (Bangladeshi), appointed by Respondent.\n\n18.\n\nOn January 4, 2010, the Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1, notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Sergio Puig, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Written and Oral Phases of the Proceeding**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on March 22, 2010 at the World Bank Conference Center in Paris. The Parties confirmed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and reached agreements on several procedural matters, *inter alia,* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, and that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish. It was also agreed that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C. The agreement of the Parties was embodied in Minutes of the First Session of the Arbitral Tribunal signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal and circulated to the Parties.\n\n20.\n\nOn September 17, 2010, Claimants requested a one-week extension for the filing of their Memorial on the Merits. On September 20, 2010, Respondent informed that it had no objection to the extension requested by Claimants. As a result, Claimants filed a Memorial on the Merits, with accompanying documentation, on September 29, 2010. The accompanying documentation included the witness statements of Messrs. Gerardo Diaz Ferran, Gonzalo Pascual Arias, Carlos Bastos; and the Expert Report of Pablo Spiller and Manuel Abdala from LECG.\n\n21.\n\nBy letter of November 10, 2010, the Parties were informed that Mrs. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Counsel, would replace Mr. Sergio Puig as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n22.\n\nRespondent filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction on December 6, 2010, following the Tribunal\u2019s agreement to Respondent\u2019s extension request of November 24, 2010. The accompanying documentation included the witness statements of Messrs. Juan de Dios Cincunegui and Rafael Llorens; and the Expert Reports of Dr. Ismael Mata, and Professor Agusto Nissen.\n\n23.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction was subsequently filed on January 24, 2011, which included the Witness Statement of Vicente Munoz Perez.\n\n24.\n\nOn February 4, 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, ruling that Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections would be dealt with as a preliminary question, and that the proceeding on the merits was accordingly suspended. The Tribunal also decided that a second round of pleadings on jurisdiction would be filed.\n\n25.\n\nOn February 9, 2011, Respondent filed a request for production of documents. This was followed by Claimants\u2019 observations of February 14, 2011, Respondent\u2019s response of February 21, 2011, and Claimants\u2019 reply of February 28, 2011. On March 1, 2011, the Tribunal issued a decision on production of documents.\n\n26.\n\nOn March 10, 2011, Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction with the second witness statements of Messrs. Juan de Dios Cincunegui and Rafael Llorens; and the second Expert Report of Dr. Ismael Mata and the Expert Report of Mr. Virgilio Ivan Hernandez Urraburu.\n\n27.\n\nOn April 12, 2011, Claimants filed an application for Provisional Measures (the \"Application for Provisional Measures\" or \"the Application\"), including a request for an emergency temporary order, prohibiting the Argentine Republic from adopting certain tax measures until the Tribunal decided on the Request.\n\n28.\n\nOn April 13, 2011, the Tribunal invited Respondent\u2019s comments on Claimants\u2019 request for an emergency temporary order by April 20, 2011. The Tribunal also invited: (i) Respondent to file observations on Claimants\u2019 Request by April 27, 2011; (ii) Claimants to file observations in reply by May 4, 2011; and (iii) Respondent to file observations by way of rejoinder by May 11, 2011. The deadlines for the filings concerning the Request were later extended on April 27, 2011.\n\n29.\n\nOn April 20, 2011, Respondent submitted its Response to Claimants\u2019 Request for Urgent Provisional Measures, requesting that it should be dismissed for the reasons stated in that submission.\n\n30.\n\nOn April 27, 2011, Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, along with the second Witness Statement of Vicente Munoz Perez and the Expert Legal Opinion of Judge Stephen M. Schwebel.\n\n31.\n\nOn April 29, 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, concerning Claimants\u2019 request for provisional measures. In its Procedural Order No. 2, *\"[t]he Tribunal, after careful consideration, unanimously decided as follows:*\n\na) The Claimants\u2019 request for an emergency temporary order is denied. Having heard from both parties, the Tribunal is not persuaded, given in particular the Respondent\u2019s assertions in paragraphs 6 through 8 of its submission of April 20, 2011, that there is an urgency that would warrant such an order.\n\nb) The Tribunal notes that a hearing is scheduled to be held on May 27-31, 2011, during which, the parties will have the opportunity to fully present their arguments on this matter. The Tribunal will decide on the Claimants Application shortly thereafter.\n\nc) The parties are invited to refrain from aggravating or extending the dispute; and\n\nd) Either party may bring to the Tribunal's attention, any new, relevant, facts that may emerge fundamentally changing the current circumstances.\n\n32.\n\nAlso on April 29, 2011, Claimants renewed their request for an emergency, temporary order. In their request, Claimants submitted that their Argentine subsidiary and holder of the title to the Airlines\u2019 shares, Interinvest S.A. (\"Interinvest\"), had been served on April 28, 2011 with a notice for immediate payment of approximately USD 663,944.25 (ARS 2,706,236.90) due to the Argentine tax authority (\"AFIP\"). Claimants further indicated that such notice constituted the very subject matter of Claimants\u2019 application for an emergency temporary order and for provisional measures in this arbitration.\n\n33.\n\nOn April 29, 2011, Respondent filed its Response to Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures. This was followed by a response on May 4, 2011 to Claimants\u2019 letter of April 29, 2011. On May 6, 2011, Claimants filed Claimants\u2019 Reply in Support of their Request for Provisional Measures. Respondent subsequently filed on May 13, 2011, its Rejoinder on Claimants\u2019 Request for Provisional Measures.\n\n34.\n\nOn May 13, 2011, the Tribunal decided on Claimants\u2019 request for an Emergency Temporary Order of April 29, 2011, as follows:\n\nAfter careful consideration, and in light of the proximity of the hearing to be held on May 27-31, 2011, the Tribunal has determined that at this time there is no imminent, or no sufficiently imminent, threat between now and the hearing. Accordingly, the Tribunal has denied Claimants\u2019 request for an Emergency Temporary Order of April 29, 2011.\n\nThe Tribunal would like to once again invite the parties to (i) refrain from aggravating or extending the dispute, and (ii) bring to the Tribunal\u2019s attention, any new, relevant, facts that may emerge fundamentally changing the current circumstances.\n\n35.\n\nA hearing on Jurisdiction and Provisional Measures was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. from May 27-31, 2011. In attendance were the three members of the Tribunal, Judge Thomas Buergenthal, Mr. Henri C. Alvarez and Dr. Kamal Hossain. In the absence of Ms. Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, Mr. Gonzalo Flores, and Ms. A. Catherine Kettlewell, Counsel, ICSID, were in attendance for the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n36.\n\nPresent at the hearing were:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| For Claimants: |  |\n| Mr. R.

The Parties filed their answers subsequently, Claimants on June 16.2011, and Respondent on June 23, 2011. On June 30, 2011 and July 5, 2011, Claimants filed further submissions to complement their answers.\n\n39.\n\nOn August 26, 2011, Ms. Annalise Nelson was appointed Assistant to the President of the Tribunal with the agreement of the Parties.\n\n40.\n\nBy letter of August 30, 2011, Claimants informed the Tribunal of the conclusion of Aerolineas Argentinas\u2019 reorganization proceedings in Argentina. Claimants further brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention two recent ICSID decisions, which they deemed relevant to the present arbitration: the Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility issued on August 4, 2011 in the *Abaclat and others* v. *Argentina* (case formerly known as *Giovanna a Beccara and others)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/5); and an Order Taking Note of the Discontinuance of the Proceeding issued on July 11, 2011 in the *ATA Construction, Industrial and Trading Company* v. *Jordan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/2).\n\n41.\n\nOn October 26, 2011, Respondent filed a communication in response to Claimants\u2019 letter of August 30, 2011, including an expert report of Mr. Juan Antonio Cabezudo Alvarez.\n\n42.\n\nOn November 8, 2011, Claimants provided their comments to Respondent\u2019s submission of October 26, 2011, requesting the Tribunal to disregard Argentina\u2019s new arguments and expert reports, and to affirm jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n43.\n\nBy letter of December 15, 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties:\n\nThe Tribunal, having reviewed Respondent\u2019s letter of October 26, 2011 and Claimants\u2019 letter of November 8, 2011, has taken note of the arguments made therein as they relate to the pleadings on Jurisdiction, with the exception of the expert report of the Spanish attorney, Mr. Juan Antonio Cabezudo Alvarez, attached to Respondent\u2019s letter, and Respondent\u2019s arguments based thereon. The Tribunal has made this determination without prejudice to the excluded material being resubmitted to the Tribunal by Respondent at a later stage of these proceedings, if any.\n\n44.\n\nBy letter December 15, 2011, Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to file the dissenting opinions issued by Prof. Brigitte Stern, Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, Q.C. and Prof. Georges Abi-Saab in *Impregilo* v. *Argentina, Hochtief* v. *Argentina,* and *Abaclat* v. *Argentina,* respectively. Respondent argued that Claimants had not filed such opinions when they filed the *Impregilo* award, and the Decisions on Jurisdiction in *Hochtief* and in *Abaclat.* On December 20, 2011, considering that Claimants had informed the Tribunal that they had no comments on Respondent\u2019s request of December 15, 2011, the Tribunal granted Respondent\u2019s request. Respondent subsequently filed the dissenting opinions on December 22, 2011.\n\n45.\n\nOn February 17, 2012, Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to introduce into the record the recently adopted decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the case of *Republic of Argentina* v. *BG Group pic* of January 17, 2012, and in the *ICS* v. *Argentine Republic* case1. The request was granted on February 22, 2012, and the Tribunal provided Claimants with the opportunity to make a submission in response of the same length as Respondent\u2019s request. Claimants filed their response on February 28, 2012.\n\n*ICS, Inspection and Control Services Limited* v. *The Argentine Republic,* UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2010-9, February 10, 2012.\n\n46.\n\nOn March 22, 2012, the Tribunal advised the Parties that the Tribunal did not require, nor would it accept, further submissions unless specifically requested by the Tribunal.\n\n47.\n\nOn March 26, 2012, Respondent filed a request for the admissibility of new evidence relating to criminal proceedings pending in Spain. According to Respondent, such proceedings directly involved Messrs. Gonzalo Pascual Arias, Gerardo Diaz Ferran - who had stated at the hearing on jurisdiction that they were the owners of 100% of Claimants, Ivan Losada, who was present at the hearing and addressed the Tribunal in his capacity as Claimants\u2019 representative, and Vicente Munoz Perez, a witness produced by Claimants who testified at the hearing.\n\n48.\n\nAlso on March 26, 2012, Claimants filed a Second Application for Provisional Measures. In their Second Application, Claimants requested that the Tribunal issue the following measures:\n\nOrder Argentina to stop any procedures aimed at approving any formal or material changes to the financial statements of the Argentine Airlines for any year prior to 2008;\n\nOrder Argentina to stop any procedures aimed at approving the 2008 Amended Financial Statements;\n\nMake available to Claimants\u2019 representatives in Interinvest, in their capacity as shareholders of the Argentine Airlines, all information available and subject to discussion and vote in the shareholders meeting to be scheduled in this respect; and\n\nAuthorize Claimants\u2019 representatives in Interinvest to attend, participate and/or exercise their voting rights in the shareholders meeting that will presumably be scheduled in connection with the alleged \"adjustments\" to the Argentine Airlines financial statements, and in all cases free of any coercion, or physical or legal threat.\n\n49.\n\nIn their Application of March 26, 2012, Claimants further requested that the Tribunal or its President immediately issue an emergency, temporary order to preserve the *status quo (i.e.,* the situation that exists at this date) with respect to all the financial statements, until such time as it rules on this Request for provisional measures.\n\n50.\n\nBy letter of March 27, 2012, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimants\u2019 Application of March 26, 2012, for an emergency temporary order, on or before April 4, 2012. Additionally, with reference to Claimants\u2019 Second Application for Provisional Measures, and in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(4), the Tribunal fixed the time limits for the Parties to present their observations.\n\n51.\n\nOn March 28, 2012, the Tribunal invited Claimants to comment on Respondent\u2019s submission of March 26, 2012, by April 4, 2012.\n\n52.\n\nOn March 28, 2012, Respondent requested an extension of the deadlines fixed by the Tribunal on March 27, 2012. On March 29, 2012, the Tribunal invited Claimant to comment on Respondent\u2019s request; submitted to the Parties\u2019 consideration a schedule for the further submissions on Claimants\u2019 Second Application for Provisional Measures, and invited the Parties to consider the possibility of providing the translations of their respective subsequent submissions on the next day of their filing.

Ms. Goldenziel\u2019s *curriculum vitae* was attached, and the Parties were invited to inform the Tribunal by November 20, 2015, if they had any objection.\n\n136.\n\nOn November 20, 2015, both Parties expressed having no objections to the appointment of Ms. Goldenziel as Assistant to the President. As a result, by letter of November 23, 2015, the Parties were informed of Ms. Goldenziel\u2019s appointment.\n\n137.\n\nBy letter of December 1, 2015, Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had recently learned that ARSA\u2019s CEO had called for a shareholders\u2019 meeting on December 9, 2015, in order to consider, among other issues, the transfer of the shares to the National State. In their letter, Claimants noted that, as already explained, the expropriation proceeding in Argentina had not ended, because Interinvest had not been notified of the alleged rejection of its pending appeal before the Supreme Court. Accordingly, in Claimants\u2019 view, Interinvest continued to hold and should continue to hold title to the shares of both ARSA and AUSA.\n\n138.\n\nOn December 2, 2015, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimants\u2019 communication of December 1, 2015 by December 7, 2015.\n\n139.\n\nOn December 4, 2015, Respondent responded to Claimants\u2019 communication of December 1, 2015.\n\n140.\n\nOn December 9, 2015, the Parties were informed that the Tribunal was in receipt of both Claimants\u2019 communication of December 1, 2015, and Respondent\u2019s response of December 4, 2015, and had taken note of their contents.\n\n141.\n\nOn January 4, 2016, the Secretary of the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties and to the Tribunal Members a copy of a letter from the Secretary-General of ICSID dated December 23, 2015, acknowledging receipt of a letter from the Argentine Republic of December 22, 2015, informing of the appointment of Dr. Carlos Francisco Balbin as Argentina\u2019s Treasury Attorney General, following the resignation of Dra. Angelina Maria Esther Abbona. In its communication, Argentina additionally informed that Dr. Horacio Pedro Diez and Dr. Javier Pargament Mariasch had also submitted their resignations from their positions as Deputy Treasury Attorney General.\n\n142.\n\nOn February 25, 2016, the Secretary of the Tribunal, on instructions of the President, informed the Parties that the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Claimants\u2019 Third Request for Provisional Measures was ready in its English version, which had been sent for its translation into Spanish. It was further indicated that, unless the Parties requested otherwise, the Tribunal would issue its Decision in both languages simultaneously.\n\n143.\n\nOn February 26, 2016, Claimants requested that the English version of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Claimants\u2019 Third Request for Provisional Measures be sent first, without waiting for the Spanish version. On the same date, Respondent requested that the Decision be issued simultaneously in both languages.\n\n144.\n\nBy letter of March 8, 2016, Claimants brought to the Tribunal\u2019s attention a new development, the signing by the Argentina\u2019s President of Decree 294/2016 of February 2, 2016, derogating the cap on domestic airfares (that is, the maximum airfare), requesting the Tribunal to take this new development into account when rendering the award and in allocating the costs of this arbitration.\n\n145.\n\nOn March 9, 2016, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimants\u2019 letter of March 8, 2016 by March 16, 2016.\n\n146.\n\nAlso, on March 9, 2016, Respondent requested an extension of the deadline to comment on Claimants\u2019 letter of March 8, 2016, until March 21, 2016, in light of a number of submissions that it needed to make in other cases. On the same date, the Tribunal granted the extension.\n\n147.\n\nOn March 21, 2016, Respondent submitted its response to Claimants\u2019 correspondence of March 8, 2016.\n\n148.\n\nOn March 29, 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was in receipt of the Parties\u2019 recent correspondence concerning the derogation of the cap on domestic airfares in Argentina, and had taken note of their contents.\n\n149.\n\nOn April 8, 2016, the Tribunal issued its Decision of Claimants\u2019 Third Application for Provisional Measures (\"Decision on Provisional Measures of April 8, 2016\"). In its Decision, the Tribunal held the following:\n\nThe Tribunal:\n\na) orders that Respondent refrain from publicizing the Complaints or the criminal investigation and any relation they may have to this arbitration, whether by communications to the press or otherwise;\n\nb) defers its decision in respect of Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures as it relates to the suspension of the criminal proceedings in regard of counsel for Claimants and Claimants\u2019 court-appointed receivers, with liberty to Claimants to bring this Application back before the Tribunal in this respect should it become necessary;\n\nc) reminds the Parties that they are obligated to refrain from aggravating the dispute;\n\nd) denies the remaining aspects of Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures; and\n\ne) reserves its decision on the costs of the procedure relating to Claimants\u2019 Application for Provisional Measures to the final award.\n\n150.\n\nAttached to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision of April 8, 2016, was a Dissenting Opinion by Dr. Kamal Hossain. In his Dissent, Dr. Hossain expressed his disagreement around setting out of contentious factual positions, which he considered were not necessary for the order made and conveyed the erroneous impression that those issues might be treated as settled. His objections also related to some issues, which he categorized as preliminary, fundamental and unresolved, which in his view had to be dealt with in the award on the merits upon consideration of the evidence on record.\n\n151.\n\nBy letter of September 29, 2016, the Secretary of the Tribunal, on instructions of the President of the Tribunal, informed the Parties on the status of the Award:\n\nAn advanced draft of the Tribunal\u2019s Award has been under discussion. The Tribunal Members have deliberated in person and by other means, and have exchanged several thorough notes expressing their particular, and sometimes opposed views on several key issues. The Tribunal is aware that the Parties have been waiting for a long period of time for the Tribunal\u2019s Award. The Tribunal is also fully aware how important this case is for the Parties. It therefore regrets the delay very much. As the Parties know, however, this is a complicated case that requires the Tribunal to consider a vast factual background, extensive submissions, massive volume of documents and very complex legal issues in dispute.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to assure the Parties that it is doing its very best to finalize the Award as soon as possible.\n\n152.\n\nBy letter of October 4, 2016, Claimants requested that the proceeding be closed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1.\n\n153.\n\nOn October 17, 2016, Respondent filed a letter requesting leave from the Tribunal to file a document relating to the Public Prosecutor\u2019s classification of the insolvency proceedings of Transporte de Cercanias, S.A. as \"culpable\".\n\n154.\n\nOn October 19, 2016, the Tribunal invited Claimants to comment on Respondent\u2019s request of October 17, 2016, for the Tribunal to decide on admissibility of new evidence.\n\n155.\n\nOn October 24, 2016, Claimants filed observations of Respondent\u2019s request of October 17, 2016.\n\n156.\n\nOn October 26, 2016, Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to respond to Claimants\u2019 letter of October 24, 2016. The Tribunal granted this request on October 27, 2016, and Respondent submitted its response on November 1, 2016.\n\n157.\n\nOn November 4, 2016, Claimants filed a response to Respondent\u2019s letter of November 1, 2016.\n\n158.\n\nBy letter of November 11, 2016, the Tribunal provided directions to the Parties and fixed a procedural schedule for the submission by Respondent of the document in which the Public Prosecutor classifies the nature of the insolvency proceedings of Transportes de Cercanias, S.A., and for subsequent comments by Claimants. The Tribunal also acknowledged receipt of Claimants\u2019 letter of October 4, 2016, requesting that the proceeding be closed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1, a request that Claimants had ratified in their letters of October 24, 2016 and November 4, 2016. The Tribunal indicated that it would communicate separately the closure of the proceeding once it had determined Respondent\u2019s request of October 17, 2016 for the admissibility of new evidence.\n\n159.\n\nBy letter of November 16, 2016, Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had no further comments on Respondent\u2019s request and repeated their request for the Tribunal to declare the proceeding closed. This was followed by Respondent\u2019s letter of November 17, 2016, informing the Tribunal that it would transmit an English translation of the document from the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office in the next few days. The translation was filed on November 21, 2016.\n\n160.\n\nOn November 29, 2016, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of a document dated February 29, 2016, issued by the Provincial Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Madrid concerning the insolvency proceedings of Transportes de Cercanias, S.A. Having considered the document in question, and the Parties\u2019 positions on the matter, the Tribunal, informed the Parties that after due deliberation, it had decided to admit the document into the record on the basis that its relevance and weight would be assessed by the Tribunal together with all of the evidence submitted.\n\n161.\n\nIn its letter of November 29, 2016, the Tribunal also invited the Parties to advise whether they wished to submit updated statements of cost, and if so, to submit them simultaneously by December 16, 2016.\n\n162.\n\nOn December 6, 2016, both Parties expressed their wish to submit updated statements of costs. On December 16, 2016, as scheduled, each Party submitted an updated statement of costs.\n\n163.\n\nOn January 25, 2017, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1. ICSID Arbitration Rule 46 provides that \"[t]he award (including any individual or dissenting opinion) shall be drawn up and signed within 120 days after closure of the proceeding. The Tribunal may, however, extend this period by a further 60 days if it would otherwise be unable to draw up the award.\" On May 8, 2017, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 46, the Tribunal extended the period to draw up and sign the Award for a further 60 days (i.e., until July 24, 2017).\n\n**D. General overview of the Claim and Counterclaim**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants\u2019 Claim and Prayer for Relief**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThis claim is brought by Teinver, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos, all companies incorporated in the Kingdom of Spain, against the Respondent, under the Treaty. Claimants are members of a group of companies known collectively as the \"Marsans Group\".\n\n165.\n\nAs discussed in detail below,2 in late 2001, Claimants Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos, together with two other Marsans Group entities, acquired control of ARSA and AUSA, which they purchased indirectly through their subsidiary Air Comet, a Spanish company that in turn owned Interinvest, the Argentine holding company for the Airlines. In 2006, Claimant Teinver acquired the 30% shareholding in Air Comet previously held by the other two Marsans Group entities. The Claimants collectively owned 100% of the shares of Air Comet at the time of filing of their claim.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 176 to 183, below.\n\n166.\n\nClaimants\u2019 claim in this arbitration can be divided into two components. First, Claimants assert that Respondent unlawfully expropriated their investment in the Airlines at the end of 2008 through executive action and legislation that confiscated their shares in the Airlines. It is not contested by either Party that Respondent paid a symbolic ARS 1 in compensation for Claimants\u2019 shares in the Airlines. Claimants assert that Respondent\u2019s expropriation of the Airlines constitutes a violation of Article V of the Treaty.\n\n167.\n\nSecond, Claimants assert that before the formal expropriation of the Airlines took place in 2008, Respondent engaged in a series of acts that together constituted a creeping expropriation under Article V of the Treaty. Claimants allege, in particular, that Respondent maintained airfares at artificially low levels and prevented the Airlines from charging sufficient rates for airfares, resulting in a financial squeeze that damaged both Claimants\u2019 investment and the value of the Airlines. This was done, according to Claimants, in order to force a distressed sale of the Airlines. Claimants point to other alleged acts that they claim were part of a process of \"re-Argentinization\" of the Airlines\u2014acts designed to pressure Claimants into relinquishing their control of the Airlines. These acts include the following:\n\nThe maintenance in office, despite a serious conflict of interest, of an Undersecretary of Air Transportation who had formerly served as the head of a powerful air transportation union in Argentina\n\nActs taken by the \"government-supported\" air transportation unions\n\nRespondent\u2019s failure to comply with a number of agreements it entered with Claimants\u2019 subsidiaries between 2006 and 2008, including a memorandum of agreement for the sale of Claimants\u2019 shares in the Airlines to the Govermnent of Argentina\n\n168.\n\nClaimants allege that these and other acts constituted both creeping expropriation in violation of Article V of the Treaty and constituted violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard under Article IV(1 of the Treaty. Claimants also allege that Respondent failed to protect their investment in Argentina, in violation of Article III(1) of the Treaty; that Respondent took unjustified and/or discriminatory measures against Claimants, in violation of Article III(1) of the Treaty; and that Respondent\u2019s conduct amounts to a breach of the umbrella clause, invoked through the MFN clause contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty.3\n\nClaimants assert that, through this MFN clause, they are entitled to the more favorable treatment accorded to investors under Article II(2)(c) of the U.S.-Argentina BIT, which provides: \"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\" Cl. Mem. \u00b6 488, citing C-348.\n\n169.\n\nIn the prayer for relief in their June 30, 2014 Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants request the following:\n\nA declaration that Argentina has violated the BIT;\n\nA declaration that Argentina\u2019s actions and omissions at issue and those of its instrumentalities for which it is internationally responsible are unlawful, arbitrary, discriminatory, unfair and inequitable, constitute an expropriation or measures tantamount to expropriation without appropriate and timely compensation, and that the GOA [Govermnent of Argentina] failed to protect Claimants\u2019 investment and failed to fulfill obligations assumed with respect to the treatment of Claimants\u2019 investments;\n\nA declaration that the necessity defense does not apply;\n\n\u2026\n\nAn award to Claimants of restitution or the monetary equivalent of all damages caused to its investments, including historical and consequential damages;\n\nPre-and-post award compound interest until the effective date of payment; and\n\nAn award to Claimants for all costs of these proceedings, including attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\n170.\n\nIn this same prayer for relief, Claimants request compensation based on the unlawful formal expropriation of their investment, as well as on the Treaty breaches that occurred prior to formal expropriation. Claimants request a total amount of USD 1.59 billion for both Airlines combined, calculated with interest through July 31, 2013.4\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 201.\n\n171.\n\nRespondent\u2019s final prayer for relief contains, with respect to Claimants\u2019 claim, a request for the Tribunal:\n\n(a) to declare that King & Spalding lacks the necessary legal capacity to represent Claimants in this arbitration, which would result in the annulment of all actions taken, as well as to declare the forfeiture of Claimants\u2019 right to file an action;\n\n(b) to reject all of the claims put forward by Claimants;\n\n\u2026\n\n(d) to order Claimants to pay for all costs and expenses arising from this arbitration proceeding.\n\n**2. Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim and Prayer for Relief**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nOn May 6, 2013, Respondent submitted, along with its Counter-Memorial on Claimants\u2019 claim, a Counterclaim against Claimants. This Counterclaim is based on the damage Respondent alleges it has suffered due to Claimants\u2019 administration of the Airlines between 2001 and 2008, and the state of such companies as a consequence of such administration. Respondent asserts that the Airlines were in a \"state of almost total destruction and paralysation, after the stripping of assets by the Marsans Group, which made the State comptrollership necessary to make the operations of the flag carrier viable.\"5\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 890.\n\n173.\n\nIn the final prayer for relief in its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent requests this Tribunal:\n\n(c) to sustain the Counterclaim filed by the Argentine Republic, to award damages\u2014plus pre-and post-Award interest from the moment the Argentine Republic suffered the damage\u2014as well as to grant the Argentine Republic such further relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate;\n\n174.\n\nThe Argentine Republic requests damages in the amount of USD 1,636,600.000, based on its claims regarding the Airlines\u2019 non-operating liabilities at the time of expropriation, necessary investments made by Argentina to ensure operation of the Airlines and extraordinary losses following expropriation due to inoperability.6 These damages are calculated as of December 31, 2008.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 826.\n\n175.\n\nIn their final prayer for relief, Claimants request from the Tribunal a declaration rejecting Argentina\u2019s Counterclaim in its entirety.7\n\nCl. CC Rej. \u00b6148(iii).\n\n**III. PRELIMINARY ISSUES RELATED TO THE IDENTITY OF CLAIMANTS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Claimants\u2019 Ownership of the Airlines**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nIn 2001, the Airlines were owned by Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (\"SEPI\"), a holding company for all companies fully or partially owned by the Spanish government. SEPI owned the Airlines through an Argentine intermediary company called Interinvest. SEPI owned 99.2% of Interinvest, and Interinvest in turn held 92.1% of ARSA\u2019s shares and 90% of AUSA\u2019s shares.8 On October 2, 2001, SEPI entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") with the Spanish company, Air Comet, through which Air Comet acquired SEPI\u2019s full 99.2% interest in Interinvest.9 It appears that Air Comet\u2019s 99.2% interest in Interinvest, once acquired, did not change during the period between its acquisition of Interinvest in 2001 and the expropriation of Interinvest\u2019s shares in the two Airlines by Argentina at the end of 2008.10\n\nC-II.\n\nC-18.\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 letter of June 16, 2011 p. 5, in which Claimants state that \"since July 20, 2006, the three Claimants together have owned 100% of Air Comet, which in turn kept its shareholdings in Interinvest, which in turn kept its shareholdings in ARSA and AUSA.\"\n\n177.\n\nWhen the SPA was signed in October 2001, Air Comet was directly owned by two of the three Claimants, Autobuses Urbanos (35%) and Transportes de Cercanias (35%), as well as by two other Spanish companies, Proturin S.A. (29.8%) and Segetur S.A. (0.2%).11 Three of these four companies signed the SPA as shareholders of Air Comet and expressly assumed the obligations of Air Comet under the SPA.12 Another Spanish company, Viajes Marsans S.A., was named in the SPA as guarantor of certain of Air Comet\u2019s obligations under the SPA and signed the SPA in that capacity.13\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter of June 16, 2011, 5. *See also* Air Comet\u2019s Shareholders Registry Book, at 4, Ex. 5 to the RFA.\n\nThese three companies were Autobuses Urbanos, Transportes de Cercanias and Segetur. *See* Share Purchase Agreement, C-18, Article 8. Proturin S.A. does not appear to have signed the SPA.\n\n*Id.* at Article 8. Note that Claimants assert that Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos were also bound as Air Comet\u2019s guarantors *(see* Cl. Mem.\u00b6 40), although Article 8 of the SPA does not expressly indicate this.\n\n178.\n\nClaimant Teinver became a shareholder of Air Comet on July 20, 2006, when it purchased Proturin\u2019s and Segetur\u2019s entire shareholdings in Air Comet.14 At this point, Air Comet was owned entirely by the three Claimants, as follows: Autobuses Urbanos (35%), Transportes de Cercanias (35%), and Teinver (30%).\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 letter of June 16, 2011 at 5.\n\n179.\n\nFrom July 20, 2006 until the initiation of this arbitration, the three Claimants together owned 100% of Air Comet, although the distribution of shares during this period changed several times. On October 2, 2007, Teinver became Air Comet\u2019s majority shareholder, with the following distribution of shares: Teinver (56%), Autobuses Urbanos (22%) and Transportes de Cercanias (22%). Teinver purchased additional shares from Transportes de Cercanias on December 31, 2007, with the following distribution of shares: Teinver (66.67%), Autobuses Urbanos (22%) and Transportes de Cercanias (11.33%). On February 8, 2008, Claimants\u2019 respective participations shifted substantially: Teinver (96.77%), Autobuses Urbanos (2.13%) and Transportes de Cercanias (1.1%).15 This was the ownership structure in place at the time Claimants instituted this arbitration (December 11, 2008) and the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request and notified the Parties thereof (January 30, 2009).\n\n*Id.* at 5-6. *See also* Air Comet\u2019s Shareholders Registry Book, at 4, Ex. 5 to the RFA.\n\n180.\n\nOn December 10, 2009, about one year after the initiation of this arbitration, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos sold their remaining shareholdings in Air Comet to Teinver, leaving Teinver as the sole shareholder of Air Comet.\n\n181.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2008, when Air Comet owned and controlled the Airlines, each of the three Claimants Teinver, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos was \"part of the Marsans Group\"16, a Spanish consortium that was formerly owned by two Spanish nationals, the late Mr. Gonzalo Pascual Arias and Mr. Gerardo Diaz Ferran. Claimants do not spell out the ownership structure of the Marsans Group in great detail.17 Claimants depicted their share ownership in Air Comet and, indirectly, Interinvest in the following manner:\n\nRFA \u00b6 3.\n\nClaimants tend to refer to Claimants as \"part of the Marsans Group,\" without much additional elaboration. *See, e.g.,* RFA \u00b6 3; Cl. Mem. \u00b67, fn.3. Respondent\u2019s witness, Mr. Juan Jose Cigarran Magan, includes a generalized scheme of the group owned by Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias in his First Report of May 3, 2013, p. 5.\n\n182.\n\nFrom the various insolvency proceedings before the Spanish courts, the chain of ownership of what was loosely referred to as the Marsans Group appears to be as set out below:\n\n183.\n\nIt appears that the assets of the Marsans Group, including the shares of Teinver, were sold by Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias to a Spanish company called Posibilitum Business S.L. in or about June 2010.19 Mr. Pascual Arias died on June 21, 2012. Mr. Diaz Ferran was provisionally detained on December 5, 2012 in connection with the Operacion Crucero criminal investigation conducted in Spain, where he currently remains in detention (described below).20\n\n[Image]18\n\n*See* Transcript p. 54. *See also'.* Resp.

Claimants\u2019 Insolvency and Current Status**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nAll three Claimants and Air Comet initiated voluntary insolvency proceedings after this arbitration was commenced in late 2008.\n\n185.\n\nIn the case of Air Comet, the Spanish Commercial Court No. 8 issued an order declaring the initiation of Air Comet\u2019s voluntary reorganization proceeding on April 20, 2010.21 The order specified that Air Comet\u2019s powers of administration and disposition of its assets were henceforth subject to the authorization or agreement of the court-appointed reorganization administrators. On December 22, 2010, this same court ordered the suspension of Air Comet\u2019s powers of administration and disposition.22\n\nC-759.\n\nC-757.\n\n186.\n\nAs for Claimants, Teinver initiated voluntary reorganization on December 23, 2010,23 Transportes de Cercanias on February 16, 2011,24 and Autobuses Urbanos on January 28, 2011.25 Transportes de Cercanias\u2019 reorganization proceedings entered the liquidation phase on April 23, 2013.26 Teinver likewise entered the liquidation phase of proceedings on April 26, 2013.27 At this point, the powers of both companies to administer and dispose of their assets were suspended.28 It appears that Autobuses Urbanos has not entered the liquidation phase at present, but its powers of administration and disposition of assets were suspended by court order on April 10, 2013.29\n\nRA-166; Decision on Jurisdiction 240.\n\nRA-167; Decision on Jurisdiction 240.\n\nC-753, Ex.

Reply \u00b6 24.\n\nC-841.\n\n187.\n\nThe bankruptcy of Air Comet and of all three Claimants is related to certain factual and legal disputes in this case. First, Respondent has asserted that Claimants\u2019 bankruptcy terminated King & Spalding\u2019s power of attorney to represent Claimants in this case. The Parties\u2019 arguments with respect to this issue are addressed below in Section IV of this Award. Second, the Parties disagree on the causes of Claimants\u2019 and Air Comet\u2019s bankruptcy. Claimants, through Mr. Diaz Ferran, assert that the bankruptcies were the direct result of Respondent\u2019s unlawful acts and policies towards the Airlines.30 Respondent argues that the bankruptcies were due to reasons wholly unconnected to Respondent\u2019s actions, including Claimants\u2019 poor business management, lack of liquidity and failure to make payments.31 With respect to Air Comet\u2019s bankruptcy, Respondent argues that the company was in a state of bankruptcy as early as April 2008, predating the expropriation of the Airlines later in 20 08.32 These arguments with respect to the causation of Claimants\u2019 insolvencies are relevant to both Claimants\u2019 claims and Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim.\n\n*See, e.g.,* testimony of Diaz Ferran, Transcript pp. 34-36.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Resp.

Likewise, the existence of legal liability or potential legal liability on the part of any witness in this case may not, on its own, serve as a basis on which to preclude the Argentine Republic\u2019s liability under the Treaty. The Tribunal must weigh the relevance and the relative weight of all the evidence produced in this case.

It notes that the letters are not addressed directly to ICSID but rather to the King & Spalding attorneys representing Claimants. It also notes that the letters are undated,51 and that they do not appear to have been notarized.52 Finally, Respondent notes that the letters appear to have been executed unilaterally by the trustees, and do not appear to be the result of an order from a commercial court of Madrid.53 According to Respondent, the trustees lack the right to ratify the acts taken by King & Spalding and to authorize the firm to carry on its activities.54 Respondent asserts that \"every lawyer is aware that, in order for a power of attorney to be renewed within the context of an insolvency proceeding, there must be a court order authorizing such renewal.\"55\n\nResp.

Reply \u00b6 30.\n\n200.\n\nWith respect to the power of attorney granted to King & Spalding, Claimants\u2019 expert witness, Professor Martinez Florez, asserts that after the suspension of powers, the board of trustees directly steps into the shoes of the debtor in the agreements and powers of attorney granted by the debtor before the declaration of bankruptcy.63 She states that the trustees may terminate agreements with the attorneys and hire other representatives it chooses, but that to the extent the trustees do not do this, \"the attorneys-in-fact existing at the time of the suspension will continue performing the duties entrusted to them to avoid business interruption.\"64\n\nMartinez Florez Report \u00b6\u00b644-45.\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 45.\n\n201.\n\nWith respect to Article 48(3) of the Bankruptcy Law, which provides that \"any power of attorney existing at the time of the initiation of the insolvency proceedings shall be affected by the suspension or control of financial and property-related powers,\" Professor Martinez Florez opines that the \"affected\" language does not mean that powers of attorney are terminated.65 She explains that Article 51(2) of the Bankruptcy Law provides that while upon suspension the trustees replace the debtor in ongoing proceedings, this replacement \"does not prevent the debtor from retaining separate representation and defense through its own attorney and trial attorney.\"66 She takes the view, therefore, that if a debtor did in fact retain separate representation and defense, this indicates that \u00b6 the trustees had cancelled the power of attorney, since if they had not, the debtor\u2019s power of attorney would combine with that of the trustee, and 2) that such power of attorney held by the debtor did not terminate upon suspension.67\n\n*Id.* at \u00b6 30; *see also* Transcript p. 955, testimony of Prof. Martinez Florez (\"So what does it mean that they\u2019re \"affected\"?

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**The Application of Spanish law**\n----------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nRespondent bases its arguments regarding the validity of the power of attorney granted to King & Spalding on Spanish law. The Tribunal agrees that, since Claimants are Spanish nationals, issues related to their capacity, including the validity of powers of attorney granted by those entities, should be determined based on the domestic law of Spain. Respondent challenges the validity of King & Spalding\u2019s power of attorney in these proceedings and submits that continuing to act without a valid power of attorney is, in essence, a formal irregularity that constitutes \"fraud\" on this Tribunal. However, Respondent (correctly) does not take the position that this present arbitration cannot continue simply by virtue of the fact that Claimants entered voluntary insolvency proceedings after the initiation of the arbitration. Spanish Bankruptcy Law Article 52 is clear on this subject:\n\nArbitration proceedings that are pending at the time of the reorganization proceeding declaration shall continue until the award becomes final, and the rules contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the preceding article shall apply, [emphasis added]70\n\nSpanish Bankruptcy Law (C-752); English translation provided in Claimants\u2019 letter of June 16, 2011, p. 14.\n\n204.\n\nIn turn, Article 51(2), that \"preceding article,\" applies with respect to companies in a state of suspension (as each of the Claimants currently is) as follows:\n\nIn case of suspension of the debtor\u2019s powers of administration and disposition, the reorganization administrators shall, within the scope of their powers, replace the debtor in the pending legal proceedings. To that effect, the law clerk shall grant the reorganization administrators a period of five days to get acquainted with the proceedings. The reorganization administrators shall need the bankruptcy judge\u2019s authorization to withdraw, to accept the claim, in whole or in part, and to settle disputes. In every case, the law clerk shall give notice to the debtor and to those intervening parties that the judge considers should be heard on the subject.71\n\nEnglish translation provided in Claimants\u2019 letter of June 16, 2011, p. 15.\n\n205.\n\nAs applied in this case, Article 51(2) requires that Claimants\u2019 reorganization administrators replace Claimants themselves in the present proceedings. Article 51(2) also provides that Claimants\u2019 administrators do not need to seek court authorization to take on or maintain this role; court authorization is only required if they withdraw or otherwise settle this dispute.\n\n206.\n\nThe issue for this Tribunal to determine is whether King & Spalding has power of attorney at the present stage of this arbitration, now that each of Claimants\u2019 administrative powers have been suspended (in April 2013). Claimants submit that the power of attorney is still valid and that Claimants\u2019 reorganization administrators are simply \"stepping into the shoes\" of Claimants for purposes of the continuation of this arbitration. Respondent argues, to the contrary, that Claimants\u2019 power of attorney was extinguished by the bankruptcy, that a new power of attorney is needed, and that a valid new power of attorney has not yet been granted to King & Spalding or anyone else.\n\n207.\n\nRespondent argues that there is no possibility to cure this defect, and that this arbitration must be dismissed.72 In its final prayer for relief in its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent requests the Tribunal \"to declare that King & Spalding lacks the necessary legal capacity to represent Claimants in this arbitration, which would result in the annulment of all actions taken, as well as to declare the forfeiture of Claimants\u2019 right to file an action.\"\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 58; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 34.\n\n208.\n\nOrdered chronologically, the relevant facts related to this issue placed in the context of the procedure of the arbitration are as follow:\n\n\u2022 November 14, 2008: Original Representation Contract between Claimants and King & Spalding.73\n\n\u2022 November 21, 2008: Each of the three Claimants, Teinver, Autobuses Urbanos and Transportes de Cercanias granted broad Powers of Attorney to King & Spalding and other lawyers to represent them in negotiations with the government and to file and pursue arbitration proceedings against them before ICSID.\n\n\u2022 December 9, 2008: Powers of Attorney were issued by the Boards of Directors and were subsequently notarized.\n\n\u2022 December 11, 2008: Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration is submitted by King & Spalding with a number of exhibits, including the Powers of Attorney, as required by Rule 2(2) of the ICSID Rules.\n\n\u2022 January 30, 2009: ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration.\n\n\u2022 January 18, 2010: Assignment Agreement between Claimants and Air Comet (\"Assignment Agreement\").74\n\n\u2022 April 14, 2010: Funding Agreement between Claimants and Burford (\"Funding Agreement\").75\n\n\u2022 April 20, 2010: Air Comet commences voluntary re-organization procedure.\n\n\u2022 April 24, 2010: Representation Agreement between Claimants and King & Spalding (\"Representation Agreement\").76\n\n\u2022 June 21, 2010: Agreement between Air Comet and its re-organization administrators, Messrs. Mariano Hernandez, Luis Arqued and Luis Sierra.77 In this agreement, Air Comet\u2019s re-organization administrators state that they have been informed of the claim by Teinver, Autobuses Urbanos and Transportes de Cercanias at ICSID and that on January 18, 2010 these Claimants signed an agreement with Air Comet by which they assigned the net benefit which they might recover in the arbitration to Air Comet. The agreement also records that Air Comet\u2019s re-organization administrators are familiar with the funding arrangement with Burford and that they expressly agree to the provisions of the Funding Agreement and undertake to abide by the provisions of that agreement regarding the amounts provided for therein.\n\n\u2022 December 22, 2010: The Spanish court (the *Juzgcido Mercantil de Madrid,* \"JMM\" No. 8) in the Air Comet re-organization proceedings approves the terms of the Funding Agreement and authorizes Air Comet\u2019s re-organization administrators to consent to it. In its reasons, the court reviews the terms of the Funding Agreement which, in the circumstances, it concludes are justified.\n\n\u2022 December 22, 2010: JMM No. 8 suspended Air Comet\u2019s powers of administration and disposition of assets and appointed Air Comet\u2019s re-organization administrators to exercise the powers of Air Comet.78\n\n\u2022 December 23, 2010: Teinver requests voluntary re-organization proceedings before the Spanish court (JMM No. 7 of Madrid). In its record, the court records that the debtor (Teinver) conserves its faculties of administration and disposition of its assets, subject to the intervention of its re-organization administrators, Messrs. Edorta Etxarandio Herrera and Luis Arqued Alsina.79\n\n\u2022 January 28, 2011: Autobuses Urbanos requests voluntary re-organization in terms similar to those of Teinver.\n\n\u2022 February 16, 2011: Transportes de Cercanias requests voluntary re-organization which is recorded by the Spanish court (JMM No. 9 of Madrid) in terms similar to those in the case of Teinver.\n\n\u2022 May 27-31, 2011: Hearing on Jurisdiction in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u2022 June 16, 2011: Letter from Claimants responding to the Tribunal\u2019s requests set out in Procedural Order No. 3. As part of their response, Claimants supply letters from the re-organization administrators for each of the Claimants: Teinver,80 Autobuses Urbanos,81 and Transportes de Cercanias.82 In their letters, the three sets of reorganization administrators state that they are responding to the inquiry by the Tribunal to confirm that the Request for Arbitration was submitted approximately two years before the commencement of the voluntary re-organization procedures and that the decision to commence the arbitration was validly taken by the companies in question. The letters state that Spanish law does not require the ratification of the commencement of the arbitration by the re-organization administrators. With respect to the continuation of the arbitration, the letters advise that the powers of administration of the officers of the companies have not been suspended and that no further authorization is required by the re-organization administrators or the judges responsible for the respective re-organization proceedings. They also point out that Spanish law provides that pursuant to the Spanish Bankruptcy Law, arbitration proceedings commenced prior to reorganization proceedings are to continue through to the issuance of an award. The administrators advise that they have reviewed the evolution of the arbitration and confirm that they are fully aware of these proceedings and have discussed them with counsel and are in full agreement that the arbitration proceedings continue. They also add that King & Spalding are fully authorized to continue the arbitral proceedings pursuant to the Powers of Attorney previously granted to them and which remain in full force and effect. Each of these letters was dated and signed by the relevant re-organization administrators.\n\n\u2022 August 30, 2011: Claimants provide a copy of the decision of the Buenos Aires Commercial Court (of June 17, 2011) terminating the re-organization proceedings of ARSA commenced on June 22, 2001.\n\n\u2022 December 21, 2012: The Tribunal issues its Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n\u2022 April 10, 2013: Order of JMM No. 7 suspending the powers of administration and disposition of assets of Autobuses Urbanos and granting these to the re-organization administrators.83\n\n\u2022 April 23, 2013: Commencement of the liquidation proceedings of Transportes de Cercanias by JMM No. 7. The court\u2019s order states that the relevant terms of Title 3 of the Bankruptcy Law, including the suspension of the exercise by the company\u2019s officers of its powers of administration and disposal of assets, applies.84\n\n\u2022 April 26, 2013: Commencement of the liquidation proceedings of Teinver by JMM No. 7. The court\u2019s order goes on to state that the relevant terms of Title 3 of the Bankruptcy Law, including the suspension of the exercise by the company\u2019s officers of its powers of administration and disposal of assets, applies.85\n\n\u2022 August 10, 2013: With their Reply, Claimants submit three letters, one from each of the sets of re-organization administrators for Teinver, Autobuses Urbanos and Transportes de Cercanias.86 The letters are not dated, but are signed by each of the re-organization administrators. In the letters, the administrators give their names and say they are making an appearance before the Tribunal and make certain declarations, including express ratification of the powers of attorney and all acts performed on behalf of Claimants since the beginning of the arbitration.\n\n\u2022 March 4, 2014: the hearing on the merits was attended by Mr. Arqued, one of the court appointed administrators/receivers in the Teinver and the Air Comet re-organization/insolvency proceedings (for a number of days). The daily transcript of the hearing also lists Mr. Hernandez, one of the re-organization administrators of Air Comet, and Mr. Alvaro Martinez Domingo as attending the hearing as \"Claimants\u2019 Representative\".\n\n\u2022 October 22, 2015: in the course of their Third Application for Provisional Measures, Claimants submitted three public deeds executed in Spain by the court-appointed receivers acting on behalf of Claimants in the various insolvency proceedings in Spain, all before notaries public in which, among other things, they confirmed their identity and powers to act on behalf of the respective Claimant in their capacity as court-appointed receivers, and attached evidence of their appointment.87\n\n\u2022 November 3, 2015: the hearing concerning Claimants\u2019 Third Application for Provisional Measures was attended by Messrs. Arqued, Hernandez and Martinez, court appointed administrators/receivers in the various re-organization and insolvency proceedings, as well as a number of other representatives of Claimants.88\n\nReferred to inRA-162, which is the new Representation Agreement entered into on April 24.2010 after the signature of the Funding Agreement between Claimants and Burford.\n\nRA-159.\n\nRA-160.

In the event of suspension, the management and disposition powers of the administrator or liquidators shall be transferred to the trustees in insolvency. In the event of controllership, those powers shall continue to be exercised by the administrators or liquidators, under the supervision of the trustees in insolvency, who will be in charge of authorizing or validating all acts of management or disposition. Any power of attorney existing at the time of the initiation of the insolvency proceedings shall be affected by the suspension or control of financial and property-related powers.\n\n210.\n\nRespondent says that \"affected\" means that the power of attorney was extinguished or was terminated by operation of law. As a result, King & Spalding lost their procedural capacity to represent Claimants.\n\n211.\n\nRespondent also points to Article 1732(3) of the Spanish Civil Code which, according to it, provides that the declaration of bankruptcy of the principal is one of the grounds for termination of a power of attorney. Article 1732(3) of the Spanish Civil Code provides as follows:\n\nEl mandato se acaba: 1\u00b0 Por su revocation. 2.\u00b0 Por renuncia o incapacitation del mandatario. 3.\u00b0 Por muerte, declaracion de prodigalidad o por concurso o insolvencia del mandante o del mandatario. / El mandato se extinguira, tambien, por la incapacitation sobrevenida del mandante a no ser que en el mismo se hubiera dispuesto su continuacion o el mandato se hubiera dado para el caso de incapacidad del mandante apreciada conforme a lo dispuesto por este. En estos casos, el mandato podra terminar por resolucion judicial dictada al constituirse el organismo tutelar o posteriormente a instancia del tutor.\n\n212.\n\nIn addition, Respondent argues that the attempts to ratify or cure the defects in the Power of Attorney must fail. In this regard, it says that the letters produced by Claimants with their Reply are defective because they are not in a notarial instrument, which it says is required when the original power of attorney was granted by way of a notarized public document. Further, it says that the letters from the re-organization administrators are undated and are not addressed directly to ICSID or the Tribunal but, rather, to King & Spalding. Finally, Respondent says that the letters were required to have been authorized or ordered by the court and cannot simply be issued unilaterally by the trustees under their own authority.\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Respondent's objections as to the lack of standing due to the termination or extinguishment of King & Spalding's power of attorney are not persuasive for a number of reasons.\n\n214.\n\nFirst, it would seem appropriate to rely primarily on the provisions of the Spanish Bankruptcy Law as *lex specialis* rather than Article 1732 of the Spanish Civil Code.89 The Spanish Bankruptcy Law is more closely focused on what occurs with respect to the ongoing conduct of proceedings when insolvency occurs.\n\n*See* testimony of Prof. Martinez Florez Transcript pp. 970-971.\n\n215.\n\nIn this regard, Article 52(2) of the Spanish Bankruptcy Law provides that arbitration proceedings underway at the time re-organization proceedings are declared shall continue until the issuance of the award. It also provides that Articles 51(2) and (3) shall apply. It is worth noting that the Spanish Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between court/judicial proceedings and arbitral proceedings, except to the extent that it incorporates certain provisions, such as Article 51(2) and (3), in the treatment of arbitral proceedings. The latter provide that in the event of suspension of the debtor's powers of administration and disposal (which comes with the commencement of the liquidation phase), the insolvency administrators (within the scope of their competency) are substituted for the debtor. They must appear in the proceedings and then they are accorded time to become informed of the proceedings to date. In addition, Article 51(2) provides that the authorization of the judge presiding over the bankruptcy will be required for the insolvency administrators to withdraw, accept or settle claims. It does not require court authorization for any other actions taken by the insolvency administrators. In addition, Article 51(2) of the Spanish Bankruptcy Law provides that the debtor may retain/maintain separate legal representation of his own provided that the debtor provides sufficient guarantees to the court regarding payment of that representation and as to costs.\n\n216.\n\nAs set out above, King & Spalding's representation of Claimants was implemented by way of a power of attorney issued by each of the boards of Claimants, as well as a separate Retainer Agreement (the \"Retainer Agreement\"). These were submitted with Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration in accordance with Rule 2(2) of the ICSID Rules. There is no dispute that the original power of attorney and Retainer Agreement were valid and retained their full force and effect until the commencement of the liquidation phase/suspension of the powers of administration and disposition of assets of the debtor companies in April 2013. At the Tribunal's request, each of the sets of re-organization administrators confirmed the validity and effect of the original power of attorney and Retainer Agreement in June 2011. Further, after the commencement of the liquidation proceedings/suspension of Claimants' powers of administration and disposition of assets occurred in April 2013, each of the sets of re-organization administrators wrote to the Tribunal to confirm their appearance in the arbitral proceedings and to ratify and approve the actions taken by King & Spalding on behalf of Claimants.\n\n217.\n\nWhile Respondent raises formal objections relating to the letters from the re-organization administrators, for the reasons discussed below these are not convincing. Each of these sets of administrators were appointed by the court in charge of the insolvency proceedings, were fully aware of the history of the arbitration, including the Funding Agreement (and the Assignment Agreement) and have twice confirmed their agreement with the continuation of the arbitration and representation by King & Spalding. The Spanish Bankruptcy Law does not require any particular form in which the re-organization administrators must appear in arbitral proceedings or ratify the conduct of the proceedings. The only specific instances in which court authorization is required are for the withdrawal, acceptance or settlement of claims against the debtor.\n\n218.\n\nPursuant to the Spanish Bankruptcy Law, it appears that the re-organization administrators step into the shoes of the debtor upon the commencement of liquidation proceedings/suspension of powers of administration and disposition of assets. In this regard, except where specifically provided for by the Spanish Bankruptcy Law (i.e., withdrawal, acceptance or settlement of claims against the debtor), it does not appear that any special court authorization is required for the reorganization administrators to perform their task. Article 61(2) of the Spanish Bankruptcy Law provides that bilateral contracts to which the debtor is a party remain in effect despite the commencement of re-organization proceedings and their validity is not affected. Further, Article 61(2) provides that the debtor (in the case of intervention) or the re-organization administrators (in the case of suspension) may request from the court the termination of a contract if this is deemed in the interests of the insolvency proceedings. If such a request is made, the court must hear the parties before deciding whether the contract shall be terminated. In this case, the re-organization administrators have not requested the termination of the Retainer Agreement between Claimants and King & Spalding. In fact, the opposite has occurred and each set of re-organization administrators have reaffirmed King & Spalding's powers of representation and ratified the actions taken by that firm on behalf of Claimants.\n\n219.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal is persuaded by Professor Martinez Florez\u2019s opinion that Article 1732(3) of the Spanish Civil Code does not apply to contracts like the Representation Agreement.90 It would seem that the \"Contract of Representation\" between Claimants and King & Spalding is a bilateral service agreement and is different from the power of attorney, which was granted separately.\n\nMartinez Florez Report at \u00b6\u00b656-79.\n\n220.\n\nWith respect to the powers of attorney granted by Claimants to King & Spalding, Article 48(3) of the Spanish Bankruptcy Law states that such powers in existence at the time of the declaration of re-organization/insolvency proceedings shall be *\"afectados\"* (affected) by the suspension or intervention of the powers of the debtor. The article does not say that the powers of attorney shall be terminated or extinguished. Elsewhere, in Article 61(2), the Spanish Bankruptcy Law refers to the termination *(resolution)* of contracts (and also states that the declaration of insolvency proceedings, in itself, shall not affect the validity of contracts). Article 1732 of the Spanish Civil Code provides that agency agreements shall terminate as a result of death, insolvency or re-organization proceedings of the agent. It also states that the agency agreement shall be \"extinguished\" in certain circumstances. By contrast, Article 48(3) of the Spanish Bankruptcy Law states only that powers of attorney shall be \"affected\" by intervention or suspension. With the commencement of insolvency proceedings, whether by way of the voluntary or obligatory proceedings, the powers of attorney are affected in that (in the case of intervention) the actions of the debtor through its counsel/authorized representative are subject to the approval of the reorganization administrators. In the case of suspension, all actions within the scope of authority of the re-organization administrators are undertaken by them (and not the debtor itself) on behalf of the debtor. In this respect, it seems reasonable that the power of attorney is affected or limited by the exercise of the relevant powers of the re-organization administrators. However, the power of attorney is not terminated or extinguished by the commencement of insolvency proceedings. Further, the separate Contract of Representation remains in force, unless terminated by the debtor or the re-organization administrators.\n\n221.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent\u2019s objections to the ratification of the representation of Claimants by King & Spalding are highly formal and somewhat arbitrary. The three different sets of re-organization administrators have been appointed by the court and are all active in the courts\u2019 various public proceedings. In their letters, presented with Claimants\u2019 Reply in August 2013, the various sets of re-organization administrators state that they ratify all of the actions performed by Claimants in the course of the arbitration, both from its institution and after the commencement of the liquidation proceedings/suspension in April 2013 in the bankruptcy re-organization proceedings before the court.91 As they have been appointed by the court and regularly appeared before it, it is reasonable to assume that they are not likely to engage in unauthorized action, particularly with respect to the pursuance of this arbitration, which is known to the court. Further, Mr. Arqued approved the Assignment Agreement by way of the agreement between Air Comet and its re-organization trustees92 and requested and obtained the approval of the court (JMM No. 8) of the Funding Agreement. Mr. Arqued is also a re-organization trustee in the Teinver proceedings. Further, there does not appear to have been any objection by ARSA in the various re-organization proceedings - to which it is a party93 - that the re-organization administrators are pursuing the arbitration without authorization due to invalid powers of attorney.\n\nAs noted at \u00b6 208, above, and discussed in the Decision on Provisional Measures dated April 8, 2016, the court-appointed administrators also confirmed their powers in 2015. *Also see* C-1200.\n\nRA-163.\n\n*See* the testimony of Mr. Cigarran, Transcript pp. 1195-1202.\n\n222.\n\nFinally, in the circumstances of an international arbitration which has been ongoing for a number of years, one must question whether the strict application of the formalities of granting powers of attorney at Spanish law appropriately apply. The arbitration was, by all accounts, commenced on behalf of Claimants by properly authorized legal representatives. Almost five years after the commencement of the arbitration, due to the commencement of liquidation proceedings/suspension of powers of administration/disposition of assets, Respondent raises the validity of counsel's power of attorney and authorization to represent Claimants. In response, the re-organization administrators wrote to the Tribunal to confirm that they ratify the actions taken by counsel for Claimants and confirm their authorization to proceed with the arbitration. Although the letters are undated and not notarized or specifically ordered to be produced by the Spanish court, it would not seem appropriate to disregard these unless there is a valid reason to suspect that they are part of an effort to improperly create standing for the continuation of the claim. There is no evidence supporting this conclusion. Further, it should be noted that Mr. Arqued, a reorganization administrator in both the Air Comet and the Teinver insolvency proceedings, attended the hearing for some time, as did Mr. Hernandez, another re-organization administrator in the Air Comet proceedings.\n\n223.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the powers of attorney granted to King & Spalding were initially, and have continued throughout these proceedings to be, valid. Claimants have proved that there was no obligation at Spanish law to produce a new power of attorney in the circumstances of this case. The Tribunal also notes that, as a factual matter, it is satisfied that the re-organization administrators of each Claimant and the relevant Spanish courts are aware of the powers of attorney and, further, have ratified the actions taken by the attorney in this arbitration. Consequently, the Tribunal declines Respondent\u2019s request to find that King & Spalding\u2019s (alleged) lack of power of attorney \"constitutes fraud on the court\" and dismisses Respondent\u2019s request that these proceedings before ICSID be closed on the basis that the powers of attorney were invalid.\n\n**The Relevance of the Burford Funding Agreement**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nAt the merits hearing, Respondent advanced an additional argument concerning King & Spalding\u2019s power of attorney. Specifically, Respondent argued that the Burford Funding Agreement requires Claimants to use King & Spalding as their counsel, and that a \"conspiracy\" between Claimants and Burford explains why they did not seek a proper new power of attorney. Specifically, Respondent argues that Clause 6(3) of the Funding Agreement entitles Burford to terminate the funding agreement if King & Spalding\u2019s power of attorney is modified or terminated, as well as to receive substantial compensation under Clause 10.1 of the Agreement.\n\n225.\n\nThe \"Funding Agreement\" is an April 14, 2010 funding agreement made between Claimants and Burford,94 an investment company headquartered in Guernsey, which concerned the financing of Claimants\u2019 litigation expenses in this arbitration. Respondent argued during the jurisdictional phase of this proceeding\u2014and continues to argue\u2014that Burford is a \"vulture fund\" that will be the primary beneficiary of any ICSID award in this case.95\n\nRA-160.\n\nRespondent asserts that Burford \"is not an investor under the BIT, but rather a third party that is abusing the ICSID system by bringing forward a claim that is contrary to the purposes and goals of the Convention in order to make astronomical profits.\" (Resp. CM 89) Respondent also argues that the order of priority for beneficiaries of any award in this proceeding will be Castle 2003-1C (an American company with a court-ordered lien to collect on any award in this proceeding) (Resp. CM 92-94), Burford, a number of private individuals *(see* Resp. CM \u00b6 95), Air Comet, and finally Air Comet\u2019s creditors. Respondent argues that in light of the distribution of any potential award, \"[h]ardly could the case be more removed from the aim and goals of the ICSID Convention.\" (Resp. CM 96)\n\n226.\n\nClause 6.3 of the Funding Agreement provides:\n\nThe Claimant undertakes to grant to the Nominated Lawyers a full power of attorney (or local law equivalent) in the Funder\u2019s usual fonn to cause and allow any and all Award proceeds to be paid forthwith as set out above. The Parties acknowledge and agree that such power of attorney (or local law equivalent) is of the essence of this Agreement and is a condition thereof and that any variation or tennination of such power of attorney shall entitle the Funder to tenninate this Agreement pursuant to Clause 10.1.96\n\nRA-160.\n\n227.\n\nAs such, Clause 6.3 concerns a specific \"power of attorney\" to disburse payments from the Award. Schedule 3, Definitions of the Funding Agreement, in turn defines \"Nominated Lawyers\" as \"the lawyers conducting the Claim on behalf of the Claimant being specified as such in Schedule 1 or a substitute firm selected by the Claimant with the Funder\u2019s approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld).\"97\n\n*Id.*\n\n228.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent submitted as follows:\n\nIf the full powers of attorney granted to K&S in the year 2008 were affected by a declaration of bankruptcy against their clients, then the effectiveness of the Funding Agreement would come to an end and, therefore, the whole scheme would fall apart, because if K&S were granted a new power of attorney, this time by the trustees in insolvency, such power of attorney would force K&S to report to the trustees of insolvency and the respective groups of creditors in the insolvency proceedings resulting in a declaration of bankruptcy and, as a result, the private and confidential Funding Agreement would cease to have legal effect.\n\n229.\n\nRespondent says that a \"conspiracy\" between Claimants and Burford explains why Claimants did not seek to obtain a new, proper power of attorney.98\n\nRespondent\u2019s arguments are set out at \u00b6\u00b616-19 and 26-28 of Resp. PHB.\n\n230.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the powers of attorney are valid and that there was no obligation to seek a new power of attorney. In light of this finding, it is not necessary to make findings in respect of Respondent\u2019s \"conspiracy\" argument relating to the powers of attorney. The Tribunal considers it important to note that Respondent provided no evidence to support this argument, which makes serious allegations not only about Claimants, but also their counsel and third-party funders. Respondent entirely failed to substantiate its \"conspiracy\" argument and it is inconsistent with the evidence.\n\n231.\n\nFirst, regarding the notion of conspiracy, although the Funding Agreement was originally a private agreement between Claimants and Burford, it was disclosed to the re-organization administrators for Air Comet who agreed with the Funding Agreement and requested its approval by the court,99 which approved the Funding Agreement.100 By way of its court approval, the Funding Agreement became public and must have been known by the re-organization administrators for Claimants (Mr. Arqued was a re-organization administrator for both Air Comet and for Teinver). In view of the close inter-relationship between the Air Comet insolvency proceedings and those of Claimants and the Assignment Agreement, it is reasonable to assume that the re-organization administrators for each of Claimants were fully aware of the Funding Agreement.\n\nRA-164.\n\nRA-165.\n\n232.\n\nSecond, with respect to the argument that the Funding Agreement requires Claimants to retain King & Spalding as attorneys, and the fact that insolvency proceedings are a ground for termination of the Funding Agreement pursuant to Article 10.3, this argument makes little sense. Respondent's argument appears to be that if Claimants had requested a new power of attorney this would have alerted Burford to the insolvency proceedings and given the latter the right to terminate the Funding Agreement. However, it is highly unlikely that Burford was not already fully aware of Claimants\u2019 financial status and continued to monitor it closely, given its financial interest in doing so. In any event, there is no indication that Burford ever treated the insolvency of Claimants as a basis for terminating the Funding Agreement (it appears that their financial interests are well protected in that agreement). Further, the relevance of the relationship between Claimants and Burford as far as a potential termination of the Funding Agreement is concerned is unclear. The re-organization administrators were, and are, clearly aware of the Funding Agreement and have confirmed King & Spalding's authorization to represent Claimants in this arbitration because, it is logical to assume, this is in the interests of Claimants\u2019 creditors.\n\n233.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal would not vary its finding on the validity of the powers of attorney based on Respondent\u2019s additional \"conspiracy\" argument.\n\n**B. Claimants\u2019 Alleged Lack of Standing**\n------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nRespondent additionally argues that Claimants do not have standing in this arbitration because they assigned their litigation rights to Air Comet.101\n\nResp. PHB \u00b629.\n\n235.\n\nThe Assignment Agreement among Teinver, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos as the assignors and Air Comet as the assignee, was executed on January 18, 2010.102 The Agreement concerned the assignment to Air Comet of the proceeds of a potential award in this arbitration, and was addressed in some detail by this Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction in 2012. In that Decision, the Tribunal determined that the Assignment Agreement post-dated the filing of the arbitration, and did not affect Claimants\u2019 standing to bring this arbitration.103 The Tribunal noted that its conclusions were \"without prejudice to further submissions by the Parties in respect of Respondent\u2019s allegations in so far as they affect the merits of Claimants\u2019 claims, as appropriate, during the merits stage.\"104\n\nRA-159.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction 259.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction 259.\n\n236.\n\nRespondent now asserts that the Assignment Agreement constitutes a \"fraud against the creditors in the insolvency proceedings of Teinver S.A., Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. and Transportes de Cercanias S.A., since it was made at a date that is curiously close to the date Air Comet S.A.U. initiated its insolvency proceedings[\u2026]\"105 Respondent also asserts that the assignment is \"a confession of the fact that the filing of this claim before the ICSID Tribunal by the three shareholder companies\u2014in the full knowledge that the claim, if any, belonged to Air Comet\u2014was a guise and that the only reason why they devised all of this scheme was to facilitate the distribution of the slices that the various parties and participants will receive if the tribunal rules in favor of Claimants.\"106\n\nResp. CM 1\u00b680.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 44; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 41.\n\n237.\n\nRespondent also argues that the agreement is an assignment of contentious claims from Claimants to Air Comet, and not simply of the rights to the proceeds from any potential award.107 Respondent argues that \"once the assignment is made, the assignor is replaced in the proceedings by the assignee, which has not been the case in this arbitration proceeding.\"108 In other words, Respondent argues, Air Comet should have appeared in this proceeding. Moreover, Respondent argues that Argentina as the potential debtor should have been given prior notice of the assignment of its debt.109\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 41.47.\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6 30.\n\nResp. Rej.\u00b647.\n\n238.\n\nFor their part, Claimants argue that the Assignment Agreement did not transfer Claimants\u2019 rights under the Treaty, but rather transferred to Air Comet only the right to net proceeds from Argentina\u2019s payment of a potential award of damages.110 Claimants assert that there is no applicable legal standard that would prevent this Tribunal from issuing an award of damages in Claimants\u2019 favor due to the assignment agreement.111 Claimants argue moreover that the assignment to Air Comet is a perfectly valid transaction, and that at the time of the assignment neither Claimants nor Air Comet were undergoing any type of reorganization proceedings under Spanish law.112 Finally, Claimants note that Air Comet is not entitled to seek payment directly from Argentina of any damage award or recovery in connection with this arbitration; Air Comet is only entitled to receive from Claimants, not Argentina, the net proceeds of any eventual payment from Argentina to Claimants.113\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 34.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 36.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 37.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 41.\n\n239.\n\nThe terms of the assignment agreement provide as follows:\n\n1) Assignors hereby expressly agree to assign to AIR COMET S.A.U. any and all collection rights that may arise out of the claim filed with the ICSID...\n\n2) Parties hereto agree that the final amount to be assigned to AIR COMET S.A.U. shall be equal to the amount the ICSID may possibly award to the Assignors after deducting all necessary and relevant costs, as well as any and all payments due to the ICSID Tribunal. All fees and expenses related to legal advisers, consultants, expert witnesses, witnesses, experts, reports, assessments, as well the interests or commissions due to any and all institutions, companies or offices contributing to the funding of the claim shall also be deducted from the amount to be assigned. Finally, in order to fix the final amount of the collection rights to be assigned to AIR COMET S.A.U., *success fees* agreed upon in contract in favor of those intervening during the proceedings before the ICSID Tribunal shall be deducted as well, whether they are due for tasks performed prior to the filing of the formal claim, during the relevant proceedings, or during any appeal or during the enforcement thereof.114\n\nRA-159.'\n\n240.\n\nThe text of the agreement does not appear to assign Claimants\u2019 *contentious claims* in this dispute; rather, the text appears to be limited to assigning to Air Comet the proceeds from any award issued. Furthermore, the agreement contemplates that Air Comet would receive the award proceeds only after Claimants have paid the costs and fees described in item 2. As such, it does not appear that Air Comet has the right to receive payment directly from Argentina in the event of the award.\n\n241.\n\nIt should also be noted that the Assignment Agreement, which was signed on January 18, 2010, predated by three months the initiation of Air Comet\u2019s voluntary reorganization proceeding on April 20, 2010.115 It also predated the initiation of the three Claimants\u2019 voluntary reorganization proceedings by about a year. Air Comet and its insolvency administrators executed an agreement on June 21, 2010 wherein the administrators acknowledged the existence of this dispute and the Assignment Agreement.116 The Assignment Agreement was filed with the Spanish court overseeing Air Comet\u2019s reorganization.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent lias repeatedly argued that Air Comet became insolvent prior to the expropriation of the Airlines in 2008. *See, e.g..* Resp. PHB \u00b6\u00b6204-205. However, it is the date of assignment rather than the date of insolvency that is relevant for present purposes.\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 letter of June 16, 2011 at 17-18.\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Claimants did not assign their claims through the Assignment Agreement and, accordingly, that agreement can have no impact on the standing of Claimants in this proceeding.\n\n**C. Other Issues of Admissibility**\n------------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal left open certain additional issues of admissibility that were not necessary to address at that stage of the proceedings, as it had determined that the claims were admissible and that Claimants had standing, and that required further factual inquiries in order to be properly determined. At this stage, the Tribunal will return to the issues of Respondent\u2019s objections, on policy grounds, to Claimants\u2019 standing because it would allegedly upset the hierarchy of claims against the Airlines. The Tribunal will also address the question of whether, in addition to their respective indirect shareholdings in Interinvest, Claimants made other investments in Argentina that are protected by the Treaty.\n\n244.\n\nRespondent notes in its Post-Hearing Brief that this Tribunal \"postponed the analysis of certain irregularities regarding the admissibility of the submission and claims filed by Claimants for final consideration at the time of rendering the award on the merits of the case.\"117 Respondent cites to paragraph 234 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, in which the Tribunal addressed certain arguments made by Respondent with respect to the indirect nature of Claimants\u2019 shareholding in the Airlines, which were held by Claimants through two layers of subsidiaries, the Spanish Air Comet and the Argentine holding company, Interinvest.\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6 10.\n\n245.\n\nAs the Tribunal noted,\n\n... Respondent has advanced a number of policy arguments against Claimants\u2019 standing in this dispute. According to Respondent, the Claimants are upsetting the hierarchy of creditor claims against the Argentine Airlines and Interinvest, and it is inappropriate to award damages to a shareholder rather than to the company that has actually suffered injury. Respondent also expresses its concern that this suit could increase the risk that Respondent could be subjected to double-payment, because Interinvest could recover through the Argentine Courts in addition to any recovery by the Claimants under the Treaty.118\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 233.\n\n246.\n\nThe Tribunal then determined that\n\nRespondent\u2019s assertions could have relevance in the merits proceeding of this case, but Respondent fails to demonstrate why these assertions are relevant at the jurisdictional stage. Moreover, Respondent lias failed to articulate why these policy issues, as specifically applied to the facts at hand, should affect the outcome of this jurisdictional objection. Respondent lias not attempted to demonstrate the extenuating nature of the facts here, or to differentiate the facts in this case from the large number of other ICSID cases in which claimant shareholders were found to have standing.119\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6234.\n\n247.\n\nWith respect to Respondent\u2019s allegation, during the jurisdictional phase of this proceeding, that Claimants\u2019 recovery would upset the hierarchy of creditor claims against the Airlines and/or Interinvest, Respondent has not placed any evidence on the record in either the jurisdictional or the merits phase to support this contention. Indeed, it is not clear that there is, in fact, any \"list\" of creditor claims against the Airlines, which are not currently in insolvency, or against Interinvest (the current status of which has not been addressed over the course of these proceedings).120 To be sure, Respondent has addressed the \"hierarchy\" of beneficiaries with respect to any proceeds from this Tribunal\u2019s award. However, that is a different issue than the one raised during the jurisdictional phase of this arbitration in connection with Claimants\u2019 \"indirect\" interest in the Airlines.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Argentine Federal Administrative Court ruled in favour of the Argentine Republic with respect to the expropriation of Interinvest\u2019s shares in the Airlines on February 27, 2014 and the Interinvest\u2019s appeal appears to have been dismissed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Contentious - Administrative Matters. *See* 468-470.\n\n248.\n\nFor this reason, the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence to support Respondent\u2019s position that Claimants\u2019 standing is affected by policy reasons related to the hierarchy of creditors.\n\n249.\n\nWith respect to the question of whether Claimants had other investments in Argentina, at paragraphs 207 through 238 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that Claimants' indirect shareholdings constitute an investment and that Claimants have standing to bring their claims. The Tribunal's finding of jurisdiction on the basis of the ownership of shares is sufficient to found jurisdiction and is a final decision.\n\n250.\n\nAt paragraph 238 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal deferred consideration of Claimants' other investments to the merits stage of the proceedings. Now that the evidentiary part of that stage of the proceedings is complete, the Tribunal concludes that, in addition to shares in Interinvest, certain other investments identified by Claimants were also made.\n\n251.\n\nThrough their wholly-owned subsidiary, Air Comet, Claimants entered into the SPA by which they acquired the shareholdings in Interinvest, ARSA and AUSA and also undertook a number of other commitments which required the investment of funds for the benefit of Interinvest and the Airlines. Two of the three Claimants were shareholders of Air Comet and signatories to the SPA (Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos) and the third (Teinver) purchased all the remaining shares of Air Comet in 2006. As shareholders and signatories, Transportes de Cercanias and Autobuses Urbanos approved the SPA and unconditionally assumed all of Air Comet's obligations under the SPA and, in particular, the several terms of the Industrial Plan set out in Article 7 of the SPA.\n\n252.\n\nWhile the nominal purchase price under the SPA was USD 1.00, this was a much more complex agreement pursuant to which Air Comet (and Claimants) undertook several obligations, including the following:\n\n\u2022 Assumption of the assets and liabilities of ARSA and AUSA (including responsibility for all liabilities going forward from the relevant financial statements for ARSA May 31, 2001 and for AUSA fiscal year 2000);\n\n\u2022 Leading the negotiation of the Creditors Agreement/re-organization proceedings of ARSA and negotiations with the creditors of AUSA;\n\n\u2022 Commitment to maintaining the headcount of the various airlines and companies;\n\n\u2022 Maintenance and expansion of flight routes and of the fleet of the airlines; and\n\n\u2022 Contribution of capital.\n\n253.\n\nThe SPA and the other agreements related to it represent a complex transaction.121 The nominal purchase price does not reflect the complexity of the transaction. A nominal purchase price is not unusual where there are other interests and risks associated with the transaction. In this regard, see, for example, *Societe Generate* v *The Dominican Republic122* and *Bayindir* v. *Pakistan* where the funds invested in the construction project were the funds paid by the State under the relevant contract. Here, it is clear that Air Comet and its shareholders, Claimants, were undertaking significant responsibilities and risks in assuming the debts and liabilities of the Airlines going forward and the undertaking to maintain and expand the operations of the Airlines.\n\nSPA: C-18; Agreement for Capital Contributions between Interinvest and SEPI, October 15, 2001: C-584; Agreement among Air Comet, Transportes de Cercanias, Viajes Marsans and others, December 3, 2001: C-525.\n\n*Societe Generale in respect of DR Energy Holdings Limited and Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad de Este, SA.* v *The Dominican Republic,* UNCITRAL Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, September 19, 2008: C-622, \u00b636.\n\n254.\n\nFurther, pursuant to the obligations under the SPA, SEPI transferred funds to Interinvest and Air Comet in Argentina and Spain. In turn, these funds were invested in the Airlines. While the origin of the funds in question was SEPI and not Claimants, this is irrelevant, as the funds were contributed as a result of the obligations undertaken by Air Comet and Claimants under the SPA. This is consistent with other cases where tribunals have found that the actual source of the funds is irrelevant provided that these were contributed by the investor.123 While there may be some dispute as to the precise amounts contributed, there seems no doubt that a number of sums were contributed to Interinvest and the Airlines by Air Comet:\n\n\u2022 USD 300 million to acquire ARSA's liabilities as of October 2001;124\n\n\u2022 USD 248 million in accordance with the SPA - to operate and modernize the Airlines;125\n\n\u2022 USD 13.5 million in Interinvest;126\n\n\u2022 USD 8 million (ARS 6.05 million) in ARSA;127 and\n\n\u2022 USD 0.8 million in AUSA.128\n\n*See,* for example, *Saipem S.pA.* v *People's Republic of Bangladesh,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07, Decision on Jurisdiction, March 21, 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 106 and 107, AL RA-143; *Young Chi OO Trading PTE LTD* v *Government of the* *Union of Myanmar,* ASEAN I.D.

The evidence indicates that Claimants clearly contributed to the improvement of the Airlines\u2019 fleets through leasing contracts and the Airbus orders and a USD 5 million Boeing 737 flight simulator.\n\n256.\n\nFinally, Claimants also provided technical, logistical and marketing support. The evidence indicates that after the execution of the SPA and takeover by Air Comet and Claimants, the performance of the Airlines improved dramatically (until 2004/2005, when cost increases accelerated sharply and other events affected the Airlines\u2019 performance).\n\n257.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent does not seriously challenge that these additional investments were made or that Claimants operated the Airlines. Instead, Respondent\u2019s arguments focus on their dissatisfaction with how these investments were managed by Claimants. These arguments will be discussed in the context of the analysis of the merits, beginning in the following section.\n\n**D. Claimants\u2019 Investment in the Airlines, 2001 - 2008**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nAs a defense to the claims and in support of its Counterclaim, Respondent submits that \"Claimants\u2019 acquisition of the Airlines was opportunistic in order to appropriate the funds provided by the SEPI to Claimants and to the clear detriment of the Airlines.\"129 Respondent submits that the state of the Airlines at the time of expropriation was the result of the Marsans Group\u2019s behavior. As Respondent has made these submissions in support of both its jurisdictional objections130 and its position on the merits,131 the Tribunal considers it convenient to address these arguments at this point in the award, as it relates to any remaining issues of admissibility and standing and to return to these arguments, as necessary, in the determination of the merits.\n\nResp.

Claimants\u2019 Investment in the Airlines**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**History of the Airlines, the 2001 Auction of Interinvest and the Share Purchase Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nThe precursor companies to ARSA had been owned by the Argentine state since the 1950s. They were privatized and purchased by a group of investors led by Spanish state-owned airline Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana S.A. (\"Iberia\") in 1990. The precursor companies to AUSA were acquired by Iberia in 1991. Iberia incorporated a fully-owned Argentine subsidiary, Interinvest S.A., in 1994 to serve as the holding company for the Spanish investments in the Argentine airline industry. In 1995, the Spanish government constituted SEPI to operate as the holding company for all companies owned partially or fully by the Spanish Government, and SEPI acquired Iberia\u2019s holdings in Interinvest.132\n\n*See* Cl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b620-26.\n\n260.\n\nBy mid-2001, the Airlines were facing severe financial and operational difficulties. At the time, only 10% of international flights and 30% of domestic flight routes were being operated; there were delays in paying employee salaries; and there were significant labor conflicts.133 ARSA filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June 2001. That same month, SEPI announced its intention to sell its share of Interinvest in order to end contributions of Spanish public capital into the Airlines, which had been necessary over the previous decade.134 The Argentine Government followed the sale process closely, although it was not interested in aiding ARSA through any allocation of government funds.135\n\nC-9: SEPI Summary Report.\n\nSee SEPI Summary Report: C-9, which states that one of the advantages of selling SEPI\u2019s shares was that SEPI could successfully put an end to contributions of Spanish public capital which had been necessary over ten years to sustain the Airlines, and which totalled more titan USD 1,817 million of which USD 1,120 million corresponded to the period 1990-1996 and USD 697.5 million to the period 1996-2001. The SEPI Summary Report also noted that the Airlines had a loss of USD 363 million in the previous year and USD 43 million per month in 2001.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 33; *see* Carlos Bastos WS, \u00b6\u00b623-24.\n\n261.\n\nSEPI received nine offers from potential buyers, and ultimately selected Air Comet\u2019s offer. At the time, after assessing all of the offers, SEPI determined that Air Comet\u2019s offer had several advantages over other offers.136 In particular, SEPI noted that a sale to Air Comet would permit SEPI to address the principal problems currently before the companies, including the reestablishment of routes, punctual payment of salaries and maintenance of the workforce and updating the outdated and limited fleet. Air Comet\u2019s offer included financial guarantees from members of the Marsans Group, a superior business plan, and \"valuable synergies\" from the Marsans Group network of air transport and tourism.137 It is not disputed that at the time SEPI sold its share of Interinvest to Air Comet, the Airlines were in dire financial condition and required significant investment in terms of both capital and operational commitment.\n\nSEPI Summary Report: C-9.\n\n*See* C-9; Cl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b635-36.\n\n262.\n\nThe SPA was signed on October 2, 2001 between Air Comet and SEPI.138 Air Comet acquired SEPI\u2019s 99.2% share in Interinvest, and Interinvest in turn held 92.1% of ARSA and 90% of AUSA. Air Comet paid a symbolic price of USD 1 and undertook the following commitments: \u00b6 to assume Interinvest\u2019s, ARSA\u2019s and AUSA\u2019s liabilities, and to lead the negotiation of the reorganization for ARSA, 2) retain the Airlines\u2019 personnel for two years, 3) maintain a majority interest in the Airlines for two years, 4) restart flights on existing routes and develop new routes, 5) make USD 50 million capital contribution, and 6) modernize and expand the Airlines\u2019 fleet.139 It is not disputed that Air Comet assumed the Airlines\u2019 liabilities and led the reorganization for ARSA; retained personnel for two years; maintained a majority interest in the Airlines beyond two years; and restarted flights on existing routes and developed new routes. Air Comet\u2019s fulfillment of the obligations to make capital contributions and modernize and expand the Airlines\u2019 fleet will be described in the following subsection.\n\nAs noted previously, the SPA was also signed by three of Air Comet\u2019s shareholders and by Marsans Group as guarantor.\n\nSPA: C-18, Art. 7(A)-(F).\n\n**Air Comet\u2019s Performance under the Share Purchase Agreement**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nRespondent repeatedly asserts that under the Share Purchase Agreement, Claimants purchased the Airlines for only one US dollar.140 Respondent also asserts that Claimants failed to contribute \"even one peso\" into the Airlines.141\n\n*See, e.g.,* Resp. CM \u00b6\u00b6199, 860; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 613; KPMG ER2 \u00b6 2.2; Resp. PHB \u00b6 2.\n\nTranscript pp. 1720, 1782.\n\n264.\n\nMoreover, Respondent argues that Claimants did not comply with the terms of the SPA, to the detriment of the Airlines as well as of the Government of Argentina\u2019s own shareholding in the Airlines.142 In particular, Respondent argues that Air Comet diverted the funds it received from SEPI from their intended purposes under the SPA, and asserts that Claimants\u2019 goal \"was not the efficient management of the Airlines, but to appropriate [t]he sum of USD 753 million that SEPI had given them.\"143\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 227-228.\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6 175.\n\n265.\n\nThe SPA contemplates that SEPI would make three sets of payments to Air Comet to be used for the following purposes:\n\nTo pay off liabilities of the Airlines up to USD 300 million, in accordance with a list of liabilities to be determined by SEPI. (SPA Article 9)\n\nTo pay for economic commitments resulting from the execution or implementation of the Industrial Plan, in an amount of up to USD 248 million. (SPA Article 9)\n\nTo pay for \"any deviations in the [Airlines\u2019] assets and liabilities between July 31, 2001 and the closing.\" (SPA Article 11) The amount to be paid by SEPI was not specified at the time of the SPA, although Respondent puts the final amount at USD 205 million.144\n\n*See, e.g.,* Respondent\u2019s Opening, Transcript pp. 224, 228.\n\n266.\n\nThe SPA also contemplates that Air Comet would make a financial contribution of its own, in the amount of USD 50 million, to be paid within nine months of the closing of the SPA.145\n\n*See* SPA Article 7(c) (\"By means of a timely increase of capital, BUYER shall admit new institutional partners within a term of NINE MONTHS since the CLOSING, and undertakes to make such a capital increase during that term of at least USD $50,000,000 (or its equivalent in Pesos argentinos). BUYER undertakes that at least 15% of the new partners shall be Argentine eligible investors. Such capital increase could be made as a one-time contribution or by installments during the above mentioned period. Compliance with this capital increase is guaranteed by a penalty clause of THREE MILLION (3,000,000) United States Dollars (USD) to be paid by BUYER to SELLER, upon SELLER\u2019S mere demand, without BUYER\u2019S right to claim any exception, as soon as it is proved that BUYER has defaulted in its obligation and such default is not cured within a term of 4 months.\").\n\n267.\n\nIt is worth first considering the general relevance of these commitments and their alleged breach to this arbitration. The Tribunal determined in its Decision on Jurisdiction that to the extent any of the alleged breaches of the SPA did occur, they could not affect jurisdiction because they would have only occurred subsequent to Claimants\u2019 acquisition of the investment.146 For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal considers that any acts or contributions made by Air Comet to the Airlines are acts or contributions made by Claimants. This follows from the fact that Claimants have demonstrated that they have collectively maintained majority ownership of Air Comet from the time that the Airlines were purchased from SEPI through to the commencement of the arbitration, albeit in varying proportions.147 The Tribunal notes that this is consistent with the approach taken by Respondent in its submissions and throughout the proceedings of referring to Claimants as part of the Marsans Group.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6324-328.\n\n*See* paragraphs 176 to 181, above.\n\n268.\n\nWith respect to the relevance of these alleged breaches on the merits, Respondent now argues that the diversion of the funds from SEPI \"translates into clear and obvious breaches of both domestic and international law.\"148 Specifically, Respondent asserts that the Marsans Group\u2019s conduct was contrary to the principle of good faith that is part of Argentine, Spanish and international law.149 Respondent also argues that the alleged diversion of funds \"marks the beginning of a pattern that the Group would follow regarding the Airlines through its management\" and that consists of \"absorb[ng] as much liquidity as possible, both from SEPI\u2019s funds and from the Airlines\u2019 administration[\u2026]\"150\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 189.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 191.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 186.\n\n269.\n\nIn response, Claimants assert that Air Comet complied with the terms of the SPA. Claimants request that the Tribunal dismiss Argentina\u2019s arguments that Claimants did not invest in the Airlines and that Claimants\u2019 investment was inadequate or unlawful. Claimants further request the Tribunal to find that Argentina\u2019s false allegations are irrelevant to either a finding of liability or the determination of quantum in this arbitration.151 Each of these individual allegations, as they relate to admissibility and standing, will be discussed in the following sections.\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 12.\n\n***SEPI\u2019s Payment of USD 300 million for the Cancellation of Debts***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nRespondent\u2019s allegations regarding Claimants\u2019 misuse of the SEPI funds focuses most intensely on the use of the USD 300 million SEPI provided to cancel ARSA\u2019s debts. The Parties largely agree that Air Comet used the majority of these designated funds to buy or subrogate ARSA\u2019s existing debts from its current debt holders.152 ARSA\u2019s liabilities were then transferred from Air Comet to Interinvest, which turned them into capital contributions that accordingly increased Interinvest\u2019s stockholdings in ARSA.153\n\nResp.

It appears that the Parties agree that after Air Comet subrogated the above-mentioned debts, it converted them into an increased shareholding. *See* Resp. CM \u00b6 232 (\"Due to the diversion of funds. Air Comet became the main creditor in the insolvency proceedings and, thereafter, it not only became the majority shareholding, but it could dilute the State interest in ARSA.\").\n\n271.\n\nRespondent argues that these actions violated the terms of the SPA, Article 8, which earmarked those funds for paying off the Airlines\u2019 liabilities.154 According to Respondent, the subrogation benefited Air Comet to the detriment of both ARSA and the Government of Argentina, which held shares in ARSA.\n\nResp. Rej. 195, 200. Respondent also argues that Air Comet\u2019s acquisition of ARSA\u2019s liabilities breached Argentine insolvency law, although these arguments are far from clear. *See* Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 214-218.\n\n272.\n\nWith respect to ARSA, Respondent argues that \"it is reasonable to suppose that the financial evolution (and other aspects) of the Airlines would have been different if the funds in question contributed by SEPI had been applied to the cancellation of debts, as stated in the Share Purchase Agreement. However, through the Marsans Group\u2019s manoeuvre [sic], after the funds have been contributed by SEPI, the Airlines still owed said debts, but to a new creditor: by chance, the Marsans Group (which in turn acquired the claims without paying anything, due to the diversion of SEPI\u2019s funds).\"155\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6210;Resp. CM \u00b6 248.\n\n273.\n\nWith respect to the Government of Argentina\u2019s own shares in ARSA, Respondent argues that since said claims were ultimately contributed to ARSA\u2019s capital, Air Comet obtained the additional benefit of holding a higher proportional interest in ARSA\u2019s capital, with the other shareholders\u2019 interests being reduced accordingly.156 Respondent asserts the Argentine Republic\u2019s interest was reduced from 5.34% to 1.34% by this measure.157 Respondent notes that since the government retained less than 2% of the share capital required by the Argentine Corporations Law No. 19,550 to request information and to have reports filed with the Audit Committee investigated, it was reduced to the role of \"a passive shareholder at the mercy of the Marsans Group\u2019s shareholders.\"158\n\nResp.

In their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, they described precisely how these transactions were structured, based on the SPA and two subsequent agreements dated October 15, 2001159 and December 3, 2001:160\n\nThese agreements provided as follows: (i) Air Comet would acquire credits against ARSA directly from ARSA\u2019s creditors; (ii) Air Comet would lead the renegotiation with ARSA\u2019s creditors and reorganization proceeding; (iii) Air Comet would subrogate in ARSA\u2019s creditors\u2019 rights to facilitate ARSA\u2019s negotiation with its creditors in the reorganization proceedings, and (iv) Air Comet would then transfer those credits to Interinvest, which would make a capital increase in ARSA, and consequently, increase Interinvest\u2019s stockholdings in that airline.161\n\nC-584.\n\nC-525.\n\nCl. Rej. on Juris. \u00b6 204.\n\n275.\n\nClaimants submit that Air Comet\u2019s subrogation to ARSA\u2019s creditors\u2019 rights was done with SEPI\u2019s consent. ARSA\u2019s liabilities were ultimately transferred to Interinvest and contributed to ARSA\u2019s capital, thereby increasing Interinvest\u2019s stockholdings and reducing ARSA\u2019s debt.162 Claimants assert that \"[t]his subrogation was done in accordance with the SPA, Spanish and Argentine law, and with the approval of SEPI, and it is specifically provided for in the December 2001 Agreement\" concluded subsequent to the SPA.163 While Claimants concede that the Argentine Republic\u2019s shareholdings in ARSA decreased, Claimants argue that the alleged \"dilution\" was not detrimental to ARSA itself, and that Respondent was presented with the opportunity to match Interinvest\u2019s capital contribution, but opted not to do so.164\n\nCl.

They note that only three years after their acquisition of the Airlines, 97 percent of ARSA\u2019s Settlement Agreement had already been paid.165\n\nTranscript pp. 1627-1628.\n\n277.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed the evidence and concludes that, despite Respondent\u2019s allegations, Air Comet\u2019s use of the USD 300 million did not violate any of its agreements, nor did Respondent prove that it violated any laws.\n\n278.\n\nPursuant to Article 9 of the SPA, SEPI assumed responsibility for debts and liabilities pre-July 2001. To meet that obligation, in part, SEPI undertook to transfer USD 300 million, which were to be allocated to the payment of the liabilities/debts of Interinvest or the Airlines. The money was to be transferred at closing *(formalizacion)* pursuant to certain instructions and priorities set out in Article 9. The article also says that the parties will agree to the procedure for delivery of the funds prior to closing.166\n\nC-18: SPA between SEPI and Air Comet dated October 2, 2001.\n\n279.\n\nInterinvest and SEPI entered into a subsequent agreement,167 in which Interinvest stated that it had the intention of purchasing outstanding credits owed by it, ARSA and AUSA to a list of creditors listed in its Annex A. It goes on to state that in order to do so, Interinvest has requested from SEPI the contribution of funds. In turn, SEPI states that it intends to contribute the funds subject to their return if the acquisition of the debts does not proceed. The agreement then goes on to record that SEPI gives to Interinvest USD 300 million for the purpose of purchasing debts owed by Interinvest and the Airlines in the amount of USD 319.51 million. The creditors listed from whom the debts were to be purchased included ABN Bank, SEPI itself, and Repsol. The agreement is signed by both parties and the copy in evidence bears a stamp showing it has been produced from a central archive.\n\nC-584: Agreement for Capital Contributions between Interinvest and SEPI dated October 15, 2001.\n\n280.\n\nThe evidentiary record also contains a further agreement relating to the acquisition of certain debts of ARSA, specifically debts owed to ABN Bank, SEPI, Indra and Repsol. This agreement dated December 3, 2001 is between Air Comet and Transportes de Cercanias, Busursa (Autobuses), Segetur and Viajes Marsans (the \"December 3, 2001 Agreement\").168 This agreement records that Air Comet is obliged to use the credits/debts purchased as its own funds in order to contribute irrevocably as capital or contributions to ARSA in the manner which is most fiscally convenient to it. This obligation was to be realized within six months of the approval of the agreement of the creditors to ARSA\u2019s re-organization proceedings (Point II). In the event the credits purchased were not used as agreed, the signatories to the contract conferred to SEPI the irrevocable right to demand from any of them payment of the amounts at issue (approximately USD 300 million) (Point III).\n\nC-525: Agreement between Air Comet and Transportes de Cercanias, Busursa, Segetur and Viajes Marsans December 3, 2001.\n\n281.\n\nPoint IV of that agreement records that Air Comet, as the shareholder of Interinvest, which was the controlling shareholder of ARSA, was obliged to send to SEPI a copy of the certificates issued by the auditors of ARSA recording the destination of the credits purchased by Air Comet (pursuant to Point II). The parties also declared that a copy of the contract would be notified formally by a notary to SEPI for its knowledge, approval and acceptance of the rights accorded to it under the contract. It appears that on the same date, December 3, 2001, this contract was \"elevated\" to public status before a notary who also confirmed that he had been requested to officially notify a copy to SEPI. The notary goes on to state that a copy was notified to SEPI. The record indicates that on December 5, 2001, another notary attended at the offices of SEPI and met with the Secretary General of that company who declared before the notary that he was familiar with the contract being \"elevated\" to public status and that he accepted expressly the rights conferred upon SEPI in the contract and that he reviewed the documents and approved and signed them. Thus, the Tribunal notes that although SEPI is not a signatory to this agreement, it does appear that SEPI was familiar with it and formally agreed to it; the contract bears a number of stamps and seals, notably an apostille dated July 1, 2003.\n\n282.\n\nThe record also indicates that the Spanish *Tribunal de Cuentas,* which reviews on an annual basis various activities of public sector enterprises, audited these particular agreements and transactions. There are a number of audit reports in evidence that disclose an ongoing review of this, and other, investments. Report No. 705 sets out in considerable detail the lengthy history of the Spanish government\u2019s/public sector\u2019s involvement in the Argentine airlines and how SEPI came to purchase the actions it held in Interinvest.169 The court reviewed in some detail the various provisions of the SPA and the contracts described above. It reviewed the transfer of the USD 300 million from SEPI to Air Comet170 and noted that USD 27 million were transferred from Interinvest\u2019s blocked account (into which USD 300 million had been transferred) to pay a shortterm loan owed to ABN Bank.171 It also reviews the irrevocable contribution agreement of October 15, 2001 and the agreement between Air Comet and its shareholders of December 3, 2001 (described above). The court then examined the purchase of the debts from the various creditors rather than their payment. In reviewing what occurred, the *Tribunal de Cuentas* set out in detail SEPI\u2019s explanations: SEPI believed that the purchase (and subrogation right) as opposed to payment of the debts was permitted by the SPA. The report also makes it plain that SEPI was fully aware of the contract and approved it.\n\nRA-77: Spanish State Audit Court\u2019s Report, No. 705, dated March 16, 2006 at p. 72 *et seq.* (Spanish version).\n\nRA-77 commencing at p. 107 (Spanish version).\n\nRA-77 commencing at p. Ill (Spanish version).\n\n283.\n\nIn its conclusions to Report No. 705, the *Tribunal de Cuentas* stated the following:\n\nSEPI contributed USD 300 million to Interinvest which pursuant to the contract had to be used to pay debts. From this amount, USD 273 million were used by Air Comet to purchase those debts, leaving it subrogated in the position of the creditors against ARSA in order for it to intervene in the re-organization proceedings of ARSA. All of this was with the consent of SEPI which even sold to Air Comet one of its own credits owed to it by ARSA. Air Comet undertook to capitalize ARSA\u2019s credits within six months from the date on which the Argentine judicial authority approved the rearrangement plan. That deadline elapsed on 26 June 2003 and to date it is unknown whether the contributions to ARSA\u2019s capital were made.172\n\nRA-77, Clause Twenty Second at p. 167 (Spanish version). Tribunal\u2019s translation.\n\n284.\n\nIn its recommendations, the *Tribunal de Cuentas* states that SEPI\u2019s conduct should comply with the concrete terms of the privatization authorization and comply with the formal procedures for any modifications. It also recommended that SEPI should require strict compliance with the obligations assumed by Air Comet which remained outstanding at the time, taking into account, in any event, the protection of the economic interests of the public sector. Finally, it also recommended that as a general matter in privatization processes where obligations are to be performed after the closing of the transfer contract, the privatization consultative committee be involved until all obligations have been performed in their entirety. However, the *Tribunal de Cuentas* did not recommend challenging the contract or invalidating it or any of the steps taken by SEPI.\n\n285.\n\nClaimants\u2019 investment was also the subject of further review by the *Tribunal de Cuentas.* In Report No. 765 dated July 19, 2007, the court again addressed the transfer of the USD 300 million and the various other post-closing obligations contained in the SPA.173 In its conclusion, the court noted that SEPI had submitted a number of other documents, which did not fully demonstrate that the debts had been finally contributed to ARSA. This appears to have lead the court to again address this subject in its next report (No. 811), discussed below. The court did note that SEPI had submitted documentation demonstrating that other requirements under the SPA, such as Air Comet\u2019s capital contribution of USD 50 million to ARSA, had been performed.174\n\nC-585: The Spanish State Audit Court\u2019s Report, No. 765, dated July 19, 2007.\n\nC-585, p. 13, which says that although seven months late, the contribution had been made and that, in fact, 25% (USD 13.45 million) had been paid out pursuant to the requirements at Argentine law.\n\n286.\n\nA further report dated October 30, 2008 (Report No. 811) also addressed these issues. Report No. 811 again referred to the agreements related to Claimants\u2019 investment recording that Interinvest and SEPI entered into the agreement of October 15, 2001 in which it was agreed that Interinvest would purchase the liabilities (of Interinvest and the Airlines), rather than pay the liabilities as provided for in the SPA.175 It also records that, subsequently, on December 3, 2001, Air Comet and its shareholders signed an agreement pursuant to which Air Comet undertook to acquire ARSA\u2019s credits and that Air Comet would become the creditor of Interinvest/the Airlines. Report No. 811 also recorded, as described above, that the agreement of October 15, 2001 was recorded with a notary public and notified to SEPI for its knowledge and consent. It went on to find that Air Comet then proceeded to purchase the credit/liabilities in December 2001 and June 2002.\n\nC-527: The Spanish State Audit Court\u2019s Report, No. 811, dated October 30, 2008.\n\n287.\n\nReport No. 811 also discussed the delays in SEPI providing the court with documentation reflecting the use of the funds provided by SEPI.176 The report states that in view of the documentation eventually received, one could understand that the commitment undertaken by Air Comet in the December 3, 2001 Agreement to contribute all acquired credits to ARSA\u2019s own funds had been accomplished, albeit more than four years late on November 21, 2007. The court mentions that Air Comet obtained the additional benefit of receiving a larger pro rata share in ARSA\u2019s capital, which resulted in a reduction in the other shareholders\u2019 interests.177 As a result, the report states that the money contributed, in principle, by SEPI to assist the Argentine company could be seen as giving rise to a benefit for the purchasers (Air Comet/Claimants). The court stated that, although this could be justified by the modifications introduced in the December 3, 2001 Agreement (the irrevocable contributions agreement, which had been notarized), this had not been provided for in the SPA, as the latter had been authorized by the Council of Ministers.178\n\nC-527 at pp. 14-15 (Spanish version).\n\nC-527 at p. 15 (Spanish version).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that although the report referenced other disputes between SEPI and Air Comet relating to certain contingencies that had arisen after the execution of the SPA, there is no indication of a dispute between SEPI and Air Comet relating to the contribution or use of funds paid by SEPI under the SPA *(i.e.* the USD 300 million or the USD 248 million for the implementation of the Business Plan).\n\n288.\n\nIn its conclusion, Report No. 811 states as follows:\n\n2. SEPI contributed USD 300 million to Interinvest that, under the Agreement, should have been allocated to the payment of liabilities of the Argentine group. From that amount Air Comet used 273 million with SEPI\u2019s consent, to purchase those liabilities and undertook to capitalize the credits in ARSA by June 26, 2003. The documents finally furnished by SEPI with its allegations evidence that the liabilities were ultimately contributed to ARSA\u2019s capital, although with more than four years\u2019 delay.179\n\nC-527 at p. 18 (Spanish version) and at p. 14 (English version).\n\n289.\n\nAlthough Respondent argues that the purchase of ARSA\u2019s debt and subrogation to ARSA\u2019s creditor\u2019s claims was not in compliance with the terms of the SPA,180 the references above indicate that SEPI was, indeed, aware of the purchase of the debt and subrogation by Air Comet and consented, as found by the Spanish audit court. In these circumstances, it appears that while the acquisition and subrogation may not have been in accordance with the SPA as originally contemplated, the parties subsequently agreed to a different handling of the USD 300 million contributed by SEPI. There is no indication that SEPI ever complained of this or that it sought to annul the SPA on this basis. In fact, SEPI\u2019s position before the *Tribunal de Cuentas* was that this was permitted by the SPA. In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that there is no basis to conclude that the alleged non-compliance with the terms of the SPA has been made out nor that any deviation from the original terms of the SPA would provide a basis for finding that the transaction was illegal or would justify declining jurisdiction on the basis that the investment was not made \"in accordance with [Argentina\u2019s] legislation\".181\n\n*See* Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 200-210.\n\n*See* BIT, Article III.\n\n290.\n\nRespondent also alleges that the acquisition of ARSA\u2019s debt and subrogation by Air Comet was in breach of Argentine law.182 The Tribunal notes that these arguments were not very well developed. Despite this, the Tribunal has considered these arguments and notes that the Argentine courts reviewed the handling of ARSA\u2019s re-organization proceedings and approved of the various steps throughout.\n\n*See* Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6214-218.\n\n291.\n\nThe re-organization proceedings of ARSA were finally concluded by the Argentine courts in June 2011.183 The Tribunal agrees with Claimants\u2019 submission that the ARSA re-organization proceedings were the proper place to raise any alleged illegality or impropriety related to the investment and the record appears to indicate that Respondent did not do so at the time. The Tribunal has taken into account Respondent\u2019s assertion that the termination of ARSA\u2019s reorganization proceedings in the Argentine courts in no way prejudges the legality of Claimants\u2019 actions during the reorganization proceedings.184 However, Respondent has failed to establish in this arbitration any basis on which the Tribunal could find that the acquisition of ARSA\u2019s debt and subrogation by Air Comet in and of itself was in breach of Argentine law.\n\n*See* C-768: the decision of the Buenos Aires Commercial Court of June 17, 2011 terminating the re-organization proceedings of ARSA, commenced on June 22, 2001, submitted with Claimants\u2019 letter of August 30, 2011; *see also* C-771 - the decision of the Buenos Aires Commercial Court of August 15, 2011, submitted with Claimants\u2019 letter of November 8, 2011, where the court formally resolved to consider the re-organization plan to have been complied with and the re-organization proceedings of ARSA to have been completed, subject to the final assessment and payment of costs and payment to the last remaining creditors.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of October 26, 2011, p. 3.\n\n292.\n\nRespondent\u2019s arguments regarding the effect of the Spanish criminal court proceedings relating to the tax treatment of Air Comet\u2019s acquisition of ARSA\u2019s liabilities will be addressed below.185\n\n*See* Section IV.E, below.\n\n293.\n\nRespondent further argues that Air Comet\u2019s acquisition of ARSA\u2019s debt and subrogation and Interinvest\u2019s subsequent capitalization of the credits contributed by Air Comet unduly diluted its holdings in ARSA and AUSA.186 As noted above at paragraph 273, Respondent asserts the Argentine Republic\u2019s interest was reduced from 5.34% to 1.34%, which it says resulted in it being reduced to a \"passive shareholder\". Respondent has not explained how this effect of the treatment of ARSA\u2019s debt was improper. Claimants admit that the capitalization of credits resulted in the reduction in Respondent\u2019s shareholding and note that Respondent was offered the opportunity to make capital contributions at the time, which would have avoided the dilution in its shareholding, and declined to do so. The dilution of Respondent\u2019s shareholding was the consequence of the capitalization and Respondent could have avoided that consequence by making its own capital contribution. Having determined that the capitalization was not improper, it follows that the resulting capital contribution and dilution of Respondent\u2019s shareholding was also not improper. Respondent has failed to demonstrate how simply reducing its proportionate shareholding was contrary to any law or harmful to ARSA itself.\n\n*See* Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 211-213.\n\n***SEPI\u2019s Payment of USD 248 million for Air Comet\u2019s Industrial Plan***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nRespondent argues that Air Comet did not properly use the USD 248 million in funds from SEPI to enact its Industrial Plan. Respondent argues that these funds were to be used for \"a) optimizing the network and routes by improving the fleet, b) improving business management efficiency, and c) rationalizing the costs and processes through initiatives not involving payroll reduction.\"187 Respondent argues that the certifications Air Comet obtained to prove the use of the funds only support the bank fund movements, not the destination of the funds for specific purposes.188 Instead, relying on its expert, KPMG, Respondent argues that these funds were used to pay for daily operations of the Airlines.189 Respondent\u2019s primary issue appears to be whether these funds were properly contributed to \"executing, or for the purpose of implementing the Industrial Plan\" of the Airlines, as well as salaries.190 In this regard, it relies on KPMG\u2019s analysis that approximately 80% (USD 203 million) was earmarked for operating expenses.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 250. The Tribunal notes that while the SPA refers to an Industrial Plan as the basis of Air Comet\u2019s obligations under the SPA (designated \"Exhibit I\" in the SPA), the Industrial Plan is not attached to C-18, and it is not clear whether this document lias been produced elsewhere on the record. As the Parties\u2019 arguments focused on the obligations under the SPA, the Tribunal lias, like the Parties, approached these arguments through the language of the SPA itself.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 221-223.\n\n*See* KPMG ER2. \u00b6\u00b6 3.4.1 *et seq.* (in particular \u00b6 3.4.6).\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 218-226.\n\n295.\n\nClaimants argue that they applied the USD 248 million SEPI funds in accordance with the SPA. According to Claimants, SEPI, Air Comet and Interinvest agreed that these moneys would be transferred to Interinvest as follows: (i) USD 128 million in October 2001 after the SPA notarization, and (ii) once Interinvest had spent and certified the use of the first USD 100 million, SEPI would transfer to Interinvest four contributions of USD 30 million each, thus totaling the USD 248 million committed in the SPA. SEPI would release each transfer only after receiving from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) a certification confirming that the previous transfer was spent in accordance with the SPA.191 Claimants state that Interinvest then transferred most of these amounts directly to the Airlines to be used to pay for, inter alia, their leasing installments, fuel, salaries, repairs, airport fees, advances on purchases and taxes.192 For each of these payments, PwC issued a certificate justifying the use of the funds.193\n\nCl. Rej. on Juris. \u00b6 208.\n\nCl. Rej. on Juris. \u00b6\u00b6 209-211, citing C-586-C-596.\n\n*Id.; see* also Cl. Reply \u00b6 107.\n\n296.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent has not proved that Claimants\u2019 use of the USD 248 million was improper or illegal and, in any event, what effect any improper or illegal use of funds would have on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n297.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 9 of the SPA provides:\n\nBUYER may allocate the amount of USD D 248,000,000 to the payments or investments to be made by the CORPORATIONS or the COMPANY in favor of the CORPORATIONS executing, or for the purpose of implementing, the INDUSTRIAL PLAN.\n\n\u2026\n\nIf the auditor\u2019s certificate shows that amounts were used other than for making payments or investments to be made by the CORPORATIONS or the COMPANY in favor of the CORPORATIONS executing, or for the purpose of implementing, the INDUSTRIAL PLAN, BUYER shall reimburse such amounts, although SELLER may offset them against pending payment obligations. No reimbursed amounts may be requested again by BUYER; therefore, it will be deemed that SELLER\u2019S primary obligation lias been reduced accordingly.194\n\nC-18, Article 9.\n\n298.\n\nLike the use of funds to acquire ARSA\u2019s debts, the issues related to the use of the USD 248 million was also the subject of investigation by the *Tribunal de Cuentas.* The *Tribunal de Cuentas* found that the USD 248 million were contributed to Interinvest and the Airlines, although the SPA contemplated their contribution to the Industrial Plan, including the expansion of the Airlines\u2019 fleet and development of new routes. In its Report No. 705, the *Tribunal de Cuentas* reviewed the use of these funds and found that the majority of the funds were contributed to meet operating expenses.195 It noted that in response to inquiries from SEPI, Air Comet responded that if it had not acted to invest the funds in operating expenses it would have been impossible to avoid the bankruptcy since a number of the planes would have been unable to fly and salaries had to be paid. All of this would have had a very negative effect on the implementation of the Industrial Plan.196 The *Tribunal de Cuentas* also reviewed the various responses provided by SEPI, which while continuing to follow up and obtain further information from Air Comet, defended the use of the funds by Air Comet and continued to advance funds until the full USD 248 million had been transferred to Air Comet.197\n\nRA-77 at pp. 120-135 and 167-168.\n\nRA-77 at pp. 123-124.\n\nThe record also indicates that in the context of a legal proceeding before the Court of Preliminary Investigations in Madrid SEPI provided a report documenting the certifications made by PwC for the use of the USD 248 million. *See* document KPMG Supp. 3-4, p. 3, referencing *\"B) Documentation relative a la justification del destino de los 248,000,000 USD entregados a AIR COMET, S.A. para ejecucion del Plan Industrial.\"*\n\n299.\n\nIn its Report No. 765, the *Tribunal de Cuentas* concluded that Air Comet had demonstrated the contribution of 22 of the 23 additional planes which it had undertaken to supply in the SPA.198 Further, the *Tribunal de Cuentas* noted that SEPI penalized Air Comet in the amount of USD 86,957 for not supplying the last plane, as contemplated in Article 9 of the SPA set out above. Article 7 of the SPA refers to certain specific undertakings contained within the \"Plan Industrial\", which include the maintenance of the employee headcount, contribution of USD 50 million to capital, maintenance of a majority interest in airlines, the expansion of the routes of the Airlines and the expansion of the fleet by a total of 23 airplanes.\n\nC-585 at Article 7(f), although 8 of the planes in question were delivered after the deadline.\n\n300.\n\nAs in the case of USD 300 million, the evidence indicates that SEPI was aware of how Air Comet was using the USD 248 million intended for the execution or implementation of the Industrial Plan. Apart from applying a penalty of USD 86,957 for failure to supply one airplane, SEPI does not appear to have invoked any contractual remedies against Air Comet for the possible failures to comply with the terms of the SPA. Nor did SEPI or the Spanish government seek to revoke the agreement on the basis of possible non-compliance by Air Comet. As a result, there is no basis for the Tribunal to find that Claimants\u2019 use of the USD 248 million was illegal or improper.\n\n***Claimants\u2019 own USD 50 million Capital Contribution***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nUnder Article 7(c) of the SPA, Air Comet was obligated to contribute USD 50 million as follows:\n\nBy means of a timely increase of capital, BUYER shall admit new institutional partners within a term of NINE MONTHS since the CLOSING, and undertakes to make such a capital increase during that term of at least USD 50,000,000 (or its equivalent in Pesos argentinos). BUYER undertakes that at least 15% of the new partners shall be Argentine eligible investors. Such capital increase could be made as a one-time contribution or by installments during the above mentioned period. Compliance with this capital increase is guaranteed by a penalty clause of THREE MILLION (3,000,000) United States Dollars (USD) to be paid by BUYER to SELLER, upon SELLER\u2019S mere demand, without BUYER\u2019S right to claim any exception, as soon as it is proved that BUYER lias defaulted in its obligation and such default is not cured within a term of 4 months.\n\n302.\n\nRespondent asserts that Air Comet did not comply with its contribution requirement, arguing that Air Comet only paid USD 13.5 million of the total required amount and that it did so seven months later than the time period set forth in Article 7(c) of the SPA.199\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 230; *see also* Transcript p. 1454 (KPMG).\n\n303.\n\nFor their part, Claimants submit that, through Air Comet, they made a total cash contribution of USD 24.2 million over the course of their management of the Airlines.200 This amount includes cash contributions of USD 13.5 million to Interinvest,201 USD 9.9 million to ARSA202 and USD 0.8 million to AUSA.203 Claimants do not assert that they paid in full the USD 50 million amount required by Article 7(c).\n\nCl. Rej. on Juris. \u00b6 215; Cl. Reply \u00b6 107 (in particular, fn. 239); Cl. PHB \u00b6 7.\n\nClaimants reference Interinvest's Citibank account statement, January 2, 2004: C-597 and Interinvest's 2004 Financial Statements: C-598.\n\nClaimants reference the following documents: SWIFT Message, 4.4 million Wire Transfer from Air Comet to ARSA, Feb. 7, 2008: C-599; SWIFT Message, 3,285 million Wire Transfer from Air Comet to ARSA, Feb. 7, 2008: C-600; SWIFT Message, 0,315 million Wire Transfer from Air Comet to ARSA, Feb. 15, 2008: C-653; Letter from Air Comet to Banco Santander ordering a 1.9 million (ARS 6.05 million) wire transfer to ARSA, July 4, 2008: C-601; and Air Comet\u2019s Bank Statement, July 29.2007, confirming a 1.9 million (ARS 6.05 million) wire transfer to ARSA: C-654.\n\nClaimants reference a USD 800,000 Wire Transfer from Viaies Marsans S.A. to AUSA, November 11, 2008: C-602.\n\n304.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that neither Party indicates that Air Comet was ever found to be in default of its obligation to make the USD 50 million investment, nor that SEPI took any steps under the SPA or otherwise in this regard. The obligation to contribute USD 50 million to capital was also the subject of review by the *Tribunal de Cuentas.* In its Report No. 765, the Spanish Audit Court concluded that Air Comet had complied with its obligation to increase the capital of ARSA by USD 50 million (albeit somewhat late).204 The *Tribunal de Cuentas* determined that Air Comet paid in cash approximately 25% of the amount on February 19, 2003 and the balance by February 11, 2005.205\n\nC-585.\n\nC-585 at p. 21. In support of its finding that the balance had been paid by February 11, 2005, the Audit Court refers to a document issued by an Argentine public auditor certifying that Air Comet had paid USD 45.7 million on that date by way of delivery of a banker\u2019s cheque *(see* page 13).\n\n305.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has failed to demonstrate the alleged breach of the SPA and that Claimants made additional capital contributions to the Airlines after their initial investment.\n\n**2. Subsequent Investments made by Claimants**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s claims that Claimants did not invest even one peso in the Airlines, Claimants assert that in addition to the cash contributions they made (described above), they also reinvested into the Airlines the USD 106 million in profits that the Airlines made during 2002, 2003 and 2004.206 As discussed further below, Claimants point to two key aspects of their investment in the Airlines. First, they assert that Air Comet and the other companies of the Marsans Group brought significant \"synergies\" to the Airlines. Second, they point to their improvement of the Airlines\u2019 fleet and their \"massive\" order of additional aircraft.\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 7; Cl. Mem. \u00b6 48.\n\n**\"Synergies\" Contributed by the Marsans Group**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nClaimants assert that under their control, the Airlines became \"part of a larger network of companies specializing in air transportation and tourism, and comprising over 11,000 employees.\"207 Claimants describe these synergies:\n\nAs any well-managed entities within an integrated group of companies, ARSA and AU S A were able to benefit from the other companies\u2019 activities (including sales of Viajes Marsans\u2014the largest Spanish travel group\u2014or Astra\u2019s negotiating) and resources (Air Comet\u2019s Madrid hub to Emope, Viajes Marsans\u2019 access to Amadeus and IATA, to cite a few). Claimants\u2019 management allowed the Argentine Airlines to double-down on their strengths (in the maintenance area, for instance) and to mitigate their liabilities (in part by sending aircraft to Air Comet).208\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 36; *see also* Diaz Ferran WS \u00b6 6.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 67.\n\n308.\n\nClaimants point in particular to the following benefits received by the Airlines: the channeling of Marsans Group sales towards ARSA and AUSA; negotiating discounted rates for Marsans Group companies; unified booking, airfare clearing and revenue management systems; unified flight operations; unified aircraft maintenance; intercompany aircraft leasing and reassignment and chartering; and unified aircraft purchasing.209 Claimants assert that the Marsans Group gave the Airlines preferential treatment among the Marsans companies, including the rebooking of passengers from other Marsans Group airlines onto ARSA\u2019s Madrid-Buenos Aires flights, the conclusion of an agreement to use Air Comet\u2019s fleet, the provision of free managerial advice and assistance, and the use by other Marsans Group airlines of ARSA\u2019s maintenance facilities in order to generate additional revenue for ARSA.210\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 61.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 62.\n\n309.\n\nRespondent discounts Claimants\u2019 so-called synergies. First, Respondent asserts that Claimants have submitted no evidence of the alleged discounts received by the Airline through its connection to the Marsans Group.211 And to the contrary, the Report of Respondent\u2019s expert, Oliver Wyman, emphasizes the negative impact of the \"synergies.\" The Wyman Report notes in particular the relatively high marketing and sales costs due to reliance on indirect sales channels, which meant higher agency commissions, increased booking fees and a costly web booking engine.212\n\nResp.

Respondent discounts the testimony of Mr. Pascual de Riva.\n\nWyman ER, \u00a7 6.3.4-6.3.4.4.\n\n310.\n\nSecond, Respondent argues that Claimants\u2019 alleged \"synergies\" amounted to no less than asset-stripping by the Marsans Group. Arguing that \"Claimants had nothing to offer the Airlines,\"213 Respondent asserts that \"[i]n general, what Claimants describe as \u2018benefits\u2019 for the Airlines were basically benefits for the Marsans Group (for example, the use of the hotels of the latter by the crew of the Airlines, etc.).... [I]n reality, the Marsans Group acted as a parasite of the Airlines, taking advantage of them, extracting all it could from them, and leaving them in appalling conditions and at the doors of bankruptcy.\"214\n\nResp.

They assert that the Airlines \"added\" 50 airplanes between the end of 2001 and the end of 2008, although it is not entirely clear from this whether all of these planes were purchased or leased.215 Claimants note in particular that ARSA signed a USD 557.8 million leasing contract for Boeing aircraft in 2004, \"which enabled the airline to operate more long-distance flights and to increase its passenger capacity on domestic and international routes.\"216 In 2006, Marsans Group concluded a Memorandum of Understanding with Pratt & Whitney to equip part of the Airlines\u2019 fleet with new engines and provide maintenance services.217 Claimants also purchased a Boeing 737 flight simulator that they assert provided significant advantages to the Airlines.218\n\nCl.

The Marsans Group incorporated old aircrafts and models different than those typified in the purchase agreement. If it had incorporated the models established in that contract in 2001, by 2004 the airlines would have had 12 Airbus 320/321, seven Airbus 340-200/300 and another four aircrafts of other types, a fleet that would have meant a completely different operating situation for the airlines.229\n\nResp.

As determined in the Decision on Jurisdiction, Claimants have met the threshold of proving an investment. The Tribunal does not find that any of the additional evidence led by Respondent on the merits affects this conclusion. If anything, the Tribunal has been provided with more detailed proof that, as outlined above, qualifying investments were made.\n\n315.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in any event, when Air Comet took over the operation of the Airlines, they had all but completely stopped operations and were on the verge of bankruptcies. But for Claimants\u2019 investment, that would have been the end of the Airlines. Rather than completely ceasing operations (or being taken over by Respondent and operated by it), the evidence indicates that the Airlines went back into operation and performed quite well for a number of years. The evidence indicates that Air Comet did, in fact, invest in the Airlines by reinvesting profits, expanding the fleet and giving the Airlines access to various benefits through the Marsans Group\u2019s sales and booking systems, management systems and aircraft leasing and purchasing. The Tribunal finds that Claimants also made additional investments in the Airlines. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent\u2019s arguments in response to these items really go to the value of the Airlines and what compensation, if any, is due for their expropriation. Accordingly, the question of whether or not Claimants reinvested profits and contributed synergies are relevant to the value of Claimants\u2019 investment and not its existence and will be discussed, as necessary, in the discussion of the merits, below. For the sake of good order, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has failed to prove its contention that Claimants\u2019 investment was entirely opportunistic in the sense that the investment was made in order to misappropriate the funds provided by SEPI; the evidence clearly demonstrates that Claimants operated the Airlines for a number of years and contributed funds provided by SEPI, as well as its own funds, to retire the debt owed to the Airlines\u2019 creditors at the time of investment and to the Airlines\u2019 ongoing operations thereafter.\n\n**E. Court Proceedings Involving the Marsans Group**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nRespondent has briefed in its pleadings a number of legal proceedings involving Claimants and the Marsans Group in Spain and Argentina. Respondent addressed most of these cases at the jurisdictional stage of these proceedings, arguing that Claimants\u2019 investment was therefore illegal. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, this Tribunal rejected Respondent\u2019s objection on the grounds that these alleged illegalities occurred after the investment was made,230 although the Tribunal noted that \"certain of the allegations raised under this objection may affect the merits of the claim\" and that \"it will be open to the Parties to make further submissions in respect of these allegations as appropriate during the merits stage of the Arbitration.\"231\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 318.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6331.\n\n317.\n\nRespondent has referred to at least seven different proceedings and investigations taking place within the Spanish courts and at least three different proceedings pending before Argentine courts. A brief description of each proceeding, as characterized by the Parties, is set out below.\n\n**1. Spanish Legal Proceedings**\n--------------------------------\n\n**Proceedings before Central Court for Investigative Proceedings No. 6**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nIn its objections to jurisdiction, Respondent asserted that under the terms of the 2001 Share Purchase Agreement, SEPI was to provide funds to Air Comet, a portion of which was to be used to cancel ARSA\u2019s debts. According to Respondent, instead of complying with the terms of the SPA, Air Comet used these SEPI funds to purchase the outstanding debt from the existing creditors, thereby subrogating the claims.232 For Claimants\u2019 part, they have asserted that Air Comet\u2019s acquisition of liabilities, the subsequent transfer of the credits to Interinvest, and the capital increase in ARSA were all lawfully conducted.233\n\n*See, e.g.,* Resp.

Diaz Ferran, Pascual Arias and Mata Ramayo. The Parties agree that these allegations were dismissed on September 7, 2011, with the exception of one remaining allegation.234 As described by Claimants, the allegations that were dismissed include the following: crimes of falsification of Air Comet\u2019s financial statements or books, unlawful exaction of money, procedural fraud, and misappropriation of public funds.235 The remaining claim concerned a crime against the Spanish Public Treasury on the basis of Air Comet\u2019s non-payment of corporate tax, committed with the participation or involvement of Messrs. Diaz Ferran, Pascual Arias and Mata Ramayo.236\n\nRA-172ter; Claimants\u2019 letter of November 8, 2011, p. 4; Cl.

Diaz Ferran and Mata Ramayo guilty of corporate tax evasion with respect to Air Comet\u2019s failure to report the benefit it received from the subrogation of ARSA\u2019s debt.237 Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Mata Ramayo were each sentenced to two years and two months of prison and a euro 99 million fine (which reflected the amount of tax payable by Air Comet). On May 23, 2014, the Central Court of Criminal Matters of the National Court of Spain dismissed the appeal of this judgment and issued an order enforcing the sentences of Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Mata Ramayo.238\n\nRA-669. This judgment only addressed claims that Messrs. Mata Ramayo and Diaz Ferran, as shareholders and directors of Air Comet, committed crimes against the Spanish Treasury by failing to pay taxes on Air Comet\u2019s increase in value related to the subrogation of ARS A\u2019s debt. The Court considered the proper tax treatment for this transaction and determined that Air Comet had failed to report a taxable benefit. The Court found Messrs. Mata Ramayo and Diaz Ferran criminally liable for tax fraud (an offence against the Spanish Treasury). The judgment makes no finding of fraud or harm, as it relates to the actual use of the funds Air Comet received from SEPI, to the Airlines, its creditors or otherwise. As discussed at paras. 274-289, above, SEPI was aware of and consented to Air Comet\u2019s use of the funds to subrogate ARSA\u2019s debt rather than to pay it off directly.\n\nRA-682. It appears that Mr. Diaz Ferran may have fried an appeal before the Spanish Constitutional Tribunal: *see* Claimants\u2019 letter of July 2, 2014, p. 3.\n\n**Proceedings before Central Court in Charge of Preliminary Investigations No. 1 of Madrid**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThis criminal proceeding concerns allegations of embezzlement by Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias as administrators of Viajes Marsans S.A., and Mr. Ivan Losada as administrator of Teinver.239 For their part, Claimants argue that this event is totally unrelated to both the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and the subject matter of this arbitration.240 Claimants also note that the court\u2019s order of February 2, 2012 was to conduct a preliminary investigation against the named individuals.241 Neither Party gave any additional information about the nature of the investigation, the timing of the alleged embezzlement, or the nature of Claimants\u2019 involvement in the allegations.242\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated March 26, 2012, pp. 3-4 and Annex II; Resp.

Respondent argues that the false document relates to Dr. Mata Ramayo\u2019s attempt to mislead the Spanish criminal judge into concluding that Royal Romana Playa had only acted on behalf of Air Comet, and not as the assignee of Air Comet\u2019s creditors against ARSA.248\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter dated July 4, 2013, pp. 4-5.\n\n*Id.,* referencing Decision of the Criminal Court for Investigation Proceedings No. 35 of the City of Madrid, Spain, May 17, 2013, at 4 (Annex II).\n\n325.\n\nClaimants assert that this preliminary investigation is irrelevant because it is a Spanish proceeding under Spanish law, and the validity of the document at issue has already been decided in Argentine courts during ARSA\u2019s reorganization proceedings, which are now final.249\n\nCl.

Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias starting in 2008, and it appears that the allegedly illegal activities may have extended after the purchase of the Marsans Group companies by Posibilitum Business S.L. in 2010.251 Mr. Diaz Ferran was provisionally detained in connection with this investigation on December 5, 2012, with a bail set at 30 million euros.252 On April 29, 2014, the Court set the various charges for oral trial proceedings against Mr. Diaz Ferran and others before the Criminal Division of the National Court of Spain.253\n\n*See* Resp.

Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias, and Posibilitum Business S.L. be found liable in connection with their acts as the reorganization administrators of Viajes Marsans S.A., Viajes Crisol S.A.U., Rural Tours S.A.U., and Tiempo Libre S.A.U.257 According to Respondent, on June 13, 2013, the Spanish judge characterized the insolvency proceedings of Viajes Marsans, S.A. as culpable.258 In its judgment, the court concluded that Viajes Marsans, S.A. had committed accounting irregularities, in particular by failing to make provision for debit balances of Teinver and Air Comet, and that \"... substantial sums of money were withdrawn from the insolvent debtor VIAJES MARSANS, S.A., *mainly to be transferred to TEINVER, S.E\u2019s account,* which led to the lack of liquidity that caused the insolvency situation.\"259 The court decided that Mr. Diaz Ferran, the estate of Mr. Pascual Arias and Posibilitum Business, S.L. were covered by the declaration of culpable insolvency. In that regard, Mr. Diaz Ferran was prohibited from administering third party assets or third party entities for 15 years, his rights as a creditor were forfeited and he was found to be jointly and severally liable for the debts and liabilities of Viajes Marsans, S.A. not covered by the liquidation proceedings.\n\nResp.

In its letter. Respondent notes that the court found that a substantial part of the conduct of Viajes Marsans S.A. should be attributed to Posibilitum Business S.L., which had purchased the shares of Viajes Marsan S.A. and other companies of the Marsans Group, including Teinver (which, in turn, held 100% of the shares of Viajes Marsan S.A.). See the court\u2019s judgment: Exhibit DUP004 at pp. 37-39 (English version): attached to Respondent\u2019s letter dated July 4, 2013.\n\n329.\n\nAs characterized by Claimants, this dispute is not a criminal proceeding, but rather was a matter before a commercial court.260 Claimants also note that the parties to this proceeding are not parties to the present arbitration.261 Further, Claimants maintained that were the Tribunal to consider the merits of the court\u2019s decision and Respondent\u2019s submissions, these show that Claimants\u2019 bookkeeping was properly maintained during the life-span of Claimants\u2019 investment. Claimants say that the role of Air Comet in the acquisition of the liabilities of the Airlines, the subsequent transfer of the credits to Interinvest and the capital increase in ARSA were all lawfully conducted as confirmed by the decision of the Spanish Central Court for Investigative Proceedings No. 6.262\n\nCl.

Claimants add that the only remaining claim relates to Air Comet\u2019s non-payment of corporate tax. In this regard, *see \u00b6* 318-320, above.\n\n330.\n\nOn September 24, 2014, Commercial Court No. 12 issued a judgment classifying the insolvency proceedings of Tiempo Libre S.A.U. as culpable.263 In its judgment, the court concluded that Tiempo Libre S.A.U.\u2019s insolvency should be classified as culpable on the basis, *inter alia,* of: serious accounting irregularities, including the failure to provide for debit balances owed to Tiempo Libre S.A.U. by Air Comet, Viajes Marsans S.A. and Teinver; improper use of the Marsans Group\u2019s cash pooling system to provide funds to Viajes Marsans S.A., Teinver and other affiliates; a culpable delay in filing insolvency proceedings; and failure to cooperate with the trustees in bankruptcy. The court held that Mr. Diaz Ferran, the estate of Mr. Pascual Arias and Posibilitum Business S.L. were affected by the classification of the insolvency proceedings as culpable. The court went on to disqualify Mr. Diaz Ferran and Posibilitum Business S.L. from administering third party assets or any third parties for a period of 15 years and forfeited any rights and interests held by them as creditors of Tiempo Libre S.A.U. Further, the court held that Mr. Diaz Ferran, the estate of Mr. Pascual Arias and Posibilitum Business S.L. were jointly and severally liable to pay for the liabilities of, and all claims against, the insolvency estate of Tiempo Libre S.A.U.264\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s letter dated December 15, 2014, pp. 4-8; RA-684: Judgment of Commercial Court No. 12 for Madrid, dated September 24, 2014. The insolvency proceedings of Tiempo Libre S.A.U. had been conducted together with those of Viajes Marsans S.A. The court\u2019s judgment records that Tiempo Libre S.A.U. operated a retail travel agency. Its shares were held 100% by Viajes Marsans S.A. whose shares, in turn, were held by Teinver. *See* RA-685 (English version), p. 15 (Item Ten), p. 21 (Item Sixteen).\n\nRA-685 (English version) pp. 23-24. The court found that Posibilitum Business S.L. became liable as of the time it purchased the shares of Teinver in June 2010 and thereby became the *de facto* manager and responsible for the administration of Viajes Marsans S.A. and Tiempo Libre S.A.U.\n\n331.\n\nRespondent says that this decision, together with the several other decisions of Spanish courts in the record, are consistent with the irregular and illegal conduct which it alleges against Claimants in this case.265 Claimants say that Tiempo Libre S.A.U. is not a claimant in these proceedings and its insolvency proceedings are unrelated to the facts underlying Claimants\u2019 claims in this arbitration. They argue that Respondent cannot prove its allegations in these proceedings by reference to the court\u2019s judgment in the Tiempo Libre S.A.U. insolvency proceedings and that Respondent has not explained why or how the findings of the Spanish court in that matter have any bearing on the claims in this arbitration.266\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter dated December 15, 2014, p. 8.\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter dated January 7, 2015, p. 7. Claimants refer to the Decision on Jurisdiction at \u00b6\u00b6 324-328 and argue that Respondent lias not established the irregularities that it alleges in these proceedings and that no Argentine court has found any irregularities, fraud or other form of criminal conduct regarding their investment in or management of the Airlines in the time since their investment in 2001.\n\n**Insolvency Proceedings of Transportes de Cercanias S.A.**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nIn February 2016, the Provincial Prosecutor\u2019s office of Madrid submitted a request to Commercial Court No. 7 for Madrid to have the insolvency proceedings of Transportes de Cercanias S.A. declared culpable.267 The basis for the Provincial Prosecutor\u2019s application appears to be the transfer of funds received for the sale of the concession owned by Transportes de Cercanias S.A. on or about January 29, 2010 to other companies alleged to be managed by Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias (including Teinver and Viajes Marsans S.A.), leaving debts of Transportes de Cercanias S.A. unpaid. In addition, there is an allegation that Transportes de Cercanias S.A. had not produced accounting books and audits since the last fiscal report for 2008. Respondent says that the Provincial Prosecutor\u2019s classification of the insolvency proceedings as culpable updates reports of one of its witnesses, Dr. Cigarran, and is relevant.\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s letter dated October 17.2016 and the application of the Provincial Prosecutor\u2019s office of Madrid, dated February 29, 2016.\n\n333.\n\nClaimants argue that the Provincial Prosecutor\u2019s allegation refers to facts and allegations unrelated and immaterial to the merits of this arbitration. They say that the events referred to in the Provincial Prosecutor\u2019s application all occurred after the expropriation of the Airlines and are irrelevant to the issues before the Tribunal. Further, Claimants argue that they have been in court-supervised insolvency proceedings for several years and have been managed only by the receivers appointed by the competent Spanish courts. Neither the founders of the Marsans Group, nor those who later acquired the companies of the Marsans Group, have had any involvement in the management of Claimants\u2019 business or the arbitration for a number of years.268 Claimants say that what the Spanish prosecutors may be considering in regard of the former executives of the Marsans Group is irrelevant to the matters in dispute in this arbitration.269 No order or decision of Commercial Court No. 7 in charge of the insolvency proceedings of Transportes de Cercanias S.A. was submitted in evidence.\n\nClaimants\u2019 letter dated October 24, 2016, pp. 1-2.\n\n*Id.* Claimants say that the arbitration is being conducted by the court appointed receivers for the benefit of the creditors of the bankruptcy estates.\n\n**Insolvency proceedings of Seguros Mercurio, S.A.**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n334.\n\nRespondent reports that the Court of Commercial Matters No. 9 of Madrid found Messrs.

Tribunal\u2019s Analysis: Relevance of these Domestic Court Proceedings to the Present Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n343.\n\nIn the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal dismissed Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction that Claimants\u2019 investment was not protected by the Treaty because of alleged illegalities connected to that investment.284 In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that the relevant time at which to consider the alleged illegality of an investment under the Treaty is the time of the entry into the investment: in this case, primarily the acquisition of the shares of Interinvest through Air Comet in October 2001.285 The Tribunal also found that the relevant law is the law of the state receiving the investment: in this case, the law of Argentina.286 The Tribunal went on to find that Respondent had failed to discharge the onus of demonstrating, as a factual matter, that Claimants had committed illegalities in acquiring their investment in the Airlines. In this regard, the Tribunal found that a number of Respondent\u2019s allegations were based on Spanish law, while others related to performance of the terms of the SPA or other events which occurred after the execution of the SPA by which Claimants acquired their investment.287 The Tribunal reached a similar conclusion with respect to Respondent\u2019s allegation that Claimants had breached principles of good faith when Air Comet subrogated ARSA\u2019s creditors\u2019 claims and when it failed to declare this subrogation to the responsible Spanish tax authorities.288\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 277-331. At \u00b6 331, the Tribunal noted that certain of the allegations raised by Respondent may affect the merits of Claimants\u2019 claims and that it would be open to the Parties to make further submissions in respect of these allegations, as appropriate, during the merits stage of the arbitration. The Tribunal considers any relevant submissions in this regard as part of its analysis of the relevant claims.\n\n**7ri., \u00b6\u00b6** 318-322.\n\nId. \u00b6 323.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 324-328.\n\n*Id.,\u00b6\u00b6* 329-330.\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s review of Respondent\u2019s additional submissions and the various court decisions and documents submitted in this merits phase of the arbitration, together with Claimants\u2019 responses, confirms the conclusions it reached in the Decision on Jurisdiction. In this regard, Respondent\u2019s allegations, for the most part, continue to refer to either proceedings under Spanish law or events which occurred after Claimants\u2019 acquisition of their investment in the Airlines and do not affect the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the basis that the relevant investments were not made in accordance with Argentine law. The Tribunal comments on the various proceedings referred to by Respondent in the following paragraphs.\n\n**Spanish Legal Proceedings**\n-----------------------------\n\n345.\n\nAs described above, for the purpose of Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction in this arbitration, the relevant law is the law of Argentina. Accordingly, Spanish law and Spanish law proceedings are of limited, if any, relevance. Further, many of the proceedings raised by Respondent do not address the legality of the acquisition of Claimants\u2019 investment at the time it was made, but, rather, subsequent [unrelated] events.\n\n***Proceeding before Central Court for Investigative Proceedings No. 6***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nAs noted above, Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Mata Ramayo have been found guilty of corporate tax evasion with respect to Air Comet\u2019s failure to report the benefit it received from the subrogation of ARSA\u2019s debt. This conviction relates to the treatment under Spanish corporate tax law of the benefit Air Comet received from the subrogation of ARSA\u2019s debt after the execution of the SPA and the transfer of funds from SEPI to Air Comet. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this does not affect the legality of Claimants\u2019 investment under Argentine law.\n\n347.\n\nFurther, as discussed above, the legality of the SPA and the various related agreements has not been challenged in the Spanish courts, or elsewhere. As also described previously, SEPI was aware of and consented to the subrogation of ARSA\u2019s debt and the agreements concluded in that regard. In addition, the Spanish Tribunal de Cuentas audited these particular agreements and transactions and did not recommend challenging the SPA or invalidating it or any of the steps taken to implement it.289\n\n*See* above at \u00b6\u00b6282-289.\n\n348.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that all of the other allegations submitted to preliminary criminal investigation in this matter against Mr. Diaz Ferran and others were dismissed.\n\n***Proceedings before Central Court in Charge of Preliminary Investigations No. 1 of Madrid***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n349.\n\nAs discussed previously, very limited evidence relating to these proceedings were submitted in evidence. It appears that the alleged illegal conduct occurred well after Claimants\u2019 investment and, indeed, after the expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment in 2008.\n\n***Investigations before the Audiencia Nacional Espanola and the Court in Charge of Preliminary Investigations No. 8 of Madrid***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nEach of these matters appears to consist of preliminary investigations relating to alleged events occurring during the course of insolvency proceedings after Claimants made their investment. Neither Party described the nature or the timing of these investigations nor the connection of the investigations to Claimants.\n\n***Proceeding before the Court in Charge of Preliminary Investigations No. 35 of Madrid***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nThis proceeding relates to an allegation that Dr. Mata Ramayo, a former Officer and Executive Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of ARSA, sought to improperly introduce a false document into the record of ARSA\u2019s insolvency proceedings in Argentina. Respondent alleges that the document in question relates to an aspect of an investigation before the Argentine courts, discussed below.290 In both cases, the investigations appear to be ongoing and there was no evidence of a final decision in either case.\n\nMata Ramayo y otros s/ Defraudacion por Administracion Fraudulenta, described at \u00b6\u00b6 336-337, above.\n\n352.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal notes that the proceedings in ARSA\u2019s bankruptcy were concluded and declared terminated in June and August 2011.291\n\nAt the request of the debtor, ARSA, the Argentine Commercial Court No. 15 ordered the conclusion of the reorganization proceedings: C-768. On August 15, 2011, the court declared that the reorganization plan had been complied with and that the reorganization proceedings of ARSA had been completed: C-771.\n\n353.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to reach any firm conclusion on the status of the allegations being investigated in the Spanish and Argentine courts. Further, on the basis of the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal is unable to determine what effect, if any, the allegations in question would have on the insolvency proceedings of ARSA or the legality of Claimants\u2019 investment in this dispute.\n\n***Investigation before the Central Court in Charge of Preliminary Investigations No. 6 of Madrid - \"Operacion Crucero\"***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nThis matter concerns an investigation which has been set for trial in respect of charges relating to illegal concealment or disposal of assets in order to avoid the claims of creditors. The claims are brought against Messrs. Diaz Ferran, Pascual Arias, de Cabo, Losada and a number of others. The investigation appears to have been commenced in 2012 and was set for trial by way of an order dated April 29, 2014.292 The timeframe during which the alleged crimes were committed is not clear from the evidence presented, although it appears that the relevant events occurred in 2010 when Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias are alleged to have created a plan to remove and hide their personal assets as well as those of various companies under their control with the assistance of Mr. de Cabo.293 From this, it appears that the events giving rise to the charges occurred well after Claimants\u2019 investments were made and were expropriated in 2008.\n\nRA-683.\n\nRA-180, Document P-01, pp. 1-2.\n\n355.\n\nAlthough Mr. Diaz Ferran was provisionally detained in connection with these proceedings, there does not appear to have been any conviction or final decision rendered in this matter.\n\n***Insolvency Proceedings of Viajes Marsans, S.A. and Related Companies before Commercial Court No. 12***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nAs described above, these proceedings involve the insolvencies of Viajes Marsans, S.A. and Tiempo Libre, S.A.U., both of which have been declared culpable and affect Mr. Diaz Ferran, the estate of Mr. Pascual Arias and Posibilitum Business, S.L. The Tribunal was not made aware of any appeals from these decisions or relevant developments other than those described above.294\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 328-331.\n\n357.\n\nIt appears that the relevant events giving rise to the declaration of a culpable insolvency commenced with what the court classified as \"serious accounting irregularities\" which reflected a false view of the solvency of Viajes Marsans, S.A. in the company\u2019s annual accounts for 2008/2009, approved on December 30, 2009. This indicates that the conduct at issue commenced approximately one year after the formal expropriation of the shares in the Airlines. Further, the proceedings do not involve as parties any of the Claimants. As a result, the classification of the insolvency of Viajes Marsans, S.A. cannot have affected the legality of Claimants\u2019 investment in the shares of the Airlines. The same is true with respect to the insolvency of Tiempo Libre, S.A.U.295\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 328-331.\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal reaches the same conclusion with respect to the Provincial Prosecutor\u2019s request to have the insolvency proceedings of Transportes de Cercanias declared culpable.296 As described above, the basis for this request appears to be the sale of Transportes de Cercanias\u2019 concession to a third party on or about January 29, 2010. By that time, Transportes de Cercanias had sold all its remaining shares in Air Comet to Teinver (which occurred on December 10, 2009). Again, it also appears that the events in question occurred after the making of Claimants\u2019 investment and after its expropriation. Finally, there does not appear to have been any decision made by Commercial Court No. 7 of Madrid in respect of the request to have the insolvency proceedings of Transportes de Cercanias declared culpable.\n\n*See* above at \u00b6\u00b6332-333.\n\n359.\n\nAccordingly, these proceedings are also irrelevant to the question of the legality of Claimants\u2019 investment in the Airlines.297\n\nThe Tribunal reaches the same conclusion with respect to the insolvency proceedings of Seguros Mercurio, S.A. While the court in that case, Commercial Court No. 9 of Madrid, declared the insolvency of Seguros Mercurio, S.A. to be culpable, there does not appear to be any connection with Claimants\u2019 investment in Argentina and the Airlines. Further, it appears that the relevant events giving rise to the classification of the insolvency as culpable occurred well after Claimants\u2019 investment in the Airlines and after its expropriation. *See* C-891.\n\n**Argentine Legal Proceedings**\n-------------------------------\n\n***Mata Ramayo y otros s/Defraudacion por Administracion Fraudulenta***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nAs described above, this matter involves an ongoing criminal investigation which concerns the alleged fraudulent diversion of funds provided by SEPI to Air Comet, in breach of the SPA, the approval of the Airlines\u2019 2001 balance sheet containing allegedly false entries and the alleged misuse of monies contributed by a third party in the case of claims held by two creditors against ARSA and which are said to be assigned to Royal Romana Playa.298 The relevant underlying facts are disputed by the Parties.\n\n*See \u00b6\u00b6* 336-337, above, and the sources cited there.\n\n361.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the investigation in this matter was commenced in February 2002 and is still pending. It appears that investigative interviews or depositions were taken from several witnesses in 2010.299 However, no decision of the court appears to have been rendered and no further materials in respect of this proceeding were submitted in evidence.\n\n*See* RA-70.\n\n362.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the fact that an investigation has been ongoing before an Argentine court since 2002, and the materials submitted in evidence, are of little assistance in determining whether Claimants\u2019 investment was made in accordance with Argentine law and, consequently, entitled to protection under the Treaty. As indicated previously, where a *prima facie* showing of the legality of an investment is made, the onus is on the respondent to demonstrate that the investment was not made in accordance with the legislation of the state receiving the investment. As the Tribunal found in the Decision on Jurisdiction, Respondent has not discharged this burden.\n\n363.\n\nAs the Tribunal also found in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the SPA and other agreements between Air Comet and SEPI were governed by Spanish law and there has been no finding of breach or invalidity of those agreements by the Spanish courts, or otherwise. In these proceedings, as described above in Section D, the Tribunal has found that Claimants did, in fact, make various investments and has found these sufficient to ground its jurisdiction. In addition, also as pointed out in the Decision on Jurisdiction, non-compliance with performance requirements under the SPA, which arise after the Agreement was executed, may affect certain aspects of the merits of the dispute, provided they are adequately demonstrated. However, they do not retroactively invalidate or render illegal the binding nature of the SPA, nor the investment it conveyed.\n\n***Marsans Group, Aerolineas Argentinas y otros s/Defraudacion por Administracion Fraudulenta***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThis investigation concerns alleged overbooking of tickets by the Airlines in July 2008. For the reasons described previously, any finding that the alleged offences had occured would not affect Claimants\u2019 acquisition of their investment. Rather, if proved, the alleged overbooking of tickets could be relevant to the financial position of ARSA and AUSA and affect the merits of Claimants\u2019 claim in so far as it was shown to affect compensation or some other relevant aspect of the claim on its merits.\n\n365.\n\nFurther, and in any event, each Party must prove the facts upon which it relies in these proceedings. While evidence of domestic court proceedings, including criminal proceedings, may be of some relevance or assistance in proving a fact, it is common ground that the decision of domestic courts are not binding on this Tribunal. In any event, the Tribunal notes that these proceedings have been pending since November 2008 and no decision has been rendered or submitted in these proceedings. Accordingly, the Tribunal will consider Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Airlines engaged in overbooking of tickets, to the extent it is relevant, later in this Award.\n\n***Criminal Case Concerning Document Forgery before Criminal Court No. 27***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal has addressed this issue above at paragraphs 341 and 342. As the Tribunal has noted, this is an ongoing investigation which appears to not have been concluded. Further, in light of the termination of ARSA\u2019s reorganization proceedings in 2011, the Tribunal is not pursuaded that this investigation is relevant to the question of the legality of Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n***Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion on the Various Court Proceedings***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n367.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed all of the voluminous materials relating to the various court proceedings in Spain and Argentina, the Tribunal concludes that none of these proceedings proves any illegality of Claimants\u2019 investments at the time they were made or that they were not made in accordance with the legislation of Argentina such that they should be denied protection under the Treaty pursuant to Article 11(2), or otherwise.\n\n368.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal addresses another aspect of the court proceedings set out above upon which Respondent relies. In this regard, Respondent says that \"the events in Spain constitute the same manoeuvres performed at the Airlines\" and that \"criminal and insolvency proceedings in Spain prove that fraudulent concealment or disposal of assets have been usual practice, a *modus operandi,* of the business group to which the Claimants belong.\"300 Respondent suggests that this conduct demonstrates that the same conduct occurred in the facts of this case. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this is not correct. It would be inappropriate to attribute to Claimants evidence of \"similar fact\" based on findings of courts in other proceedings, involving different parties, facts and circumstances. This is particularly the case where the various criminal allegations relate to events alleged to have occured well after the relevant period of Claimants\u2019 investment in Argentina. Each Party must prove the facts it alleges before this Tribunal and the findings of other courts or tribunals will only be of limited, if any, assistance in that regard.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 238. *See also* Resp. Rej. \u00b6 285 where Respondent suggests that in view of the conduct described in the various court proceedings, it is not difficult to understand that such facts also occurred at the Airlines under Claimants\u2019 management, including alleged stripping of assets and the Airlines\u2019 critical financial situation.\n\n369.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to address the merits of the Parties\u2019 claims.\n\n**V. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n-------------------------\n\n370.\n\nIn 1990, the Government of Argentina conducted an international privatization of Argentina\u2019s official, state-owned carrier, Aerolineas Argentinas Sociedad del Estado (\"AASE\"), whose assets were transferred for that purpose to a newly formed company named Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. (\"ARSA\"). The winning bidder was a group of investors led by the Spanish state-owned airlines, Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana S.A..301 By way of Decree 2,201 of October 19, 1990 and the General Transfer Contract authorized by that Decree, all of AASE\u2019s assets, concessions and permits were sold and transferred to ARSA.302 At approximately the same time, the investor group led by Iberia acquired 85% of the shares in ARSA with Iberia itself controlling 20% of the shares.303 By 1996, Iberia had increased its holdings in ARSA to 84%.304 By 2001, that shareholding had further increased to approximately 92.1%.\n\nCl.

As of that time, Interinvest became the controlling shareholder in the Airlines. Subsequently, in 1995, the Spanish government constituted SEPI to hold corporate shares owned by the Spanish government and, as a result, SEPI acquired Iberia\u2019s shareholding in Interinvest. In June 2001, SEPI owned 99.2% of Interinvest which, in turn, held 92.1% of ARSA\u2019s shares and 90% of AUSA\u2019s shares.\n\n372.\n\nAustral-Cielos del Sur S.A. (\"AUSA\") was formed by two private companies which merged in 1971 to form Austral Lineas Aereas, S.A. (\"AUSTRAL\"). It was subsequently nationalized in 1980 and then privatized in 1985 when it was purchased by Cielos del Sur, S.A.305 In 1991, Iberia acquired AUSA.306 As a result, by 1991, the Spanish government, through Iberia was a significant shareholder in the Airlines.\n\nC-10: AUSTRAL Corporate History.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 24; C-14, p. 209.\n\n373.\n\nBy June 2001, both Airlines were in serious financial difficulties. ARSA was under reorganization proceedings, had liabilities exceeding USD 1 billion and forecasted operating losses for the current year in excess of USD 350 million. It had also suspended flights to all but one international destination. AUSA was also in difficult financial circumstances.307\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 28; Cl. Reply, \u00b6 45; Cl.

After conducting preliminary discussions with various potential purchasers and a preliminary evaluation of initial offers, SEPI preselected four bidders and ultimately selected the offer made by Air Comet.308\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 34-35; SEPI Summary Report: C-9, pp. 4-5.\n\n375.\n\nThe Government of Argentina appears to have monitored the sale process of SEPI\u2019s participation in Interinvest. The then Argentine Minister of Infrastructure, Mr. Carlos Bastos, was responsible for various areas of activity, including the Subsecretariat of Commercial Air Transportation. In that capacity, he was charged with overseeing the problems arising from ARSA\u2019s insolvency. He held several meetings with representatives of SEPI as well as with representatives of the Spanish government from May to September 2001. At those meetings, Minister Bastos explained the Argentine government\u2019s position that it was interested in keeping the Airlines in operation but that the Argentine government was not, in any event, willing to assist the Airlines with an allocation of public funds. Minister Bastos also met with representatives of the Marsans Group, including Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias.309\n\nBastos WS, \u00b6\u00b6 20-28. Mr. Bastos testified that he met with his Spanish counterpart in Madrid in September 2001 and agreed that the process to sell the stock in the Airlines would move forward and that the sale would be politically supported. Mr. Bastos also testified that in his capacity as a minister, he publicly endorsed the transaction: Bastos WS, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 24 and 28.\n\n376.\n\nOn October 2, 2001, SEPI and Air Comet entered into the SPA, pursuant to which Air Comet acquired 99.2% of the shares of Interinvest which, in turn, held 92.1% of ARSA\u2019s shares and 90% of AUSA\u2019s shares.310 At that time, the Government of Argentina held approximately 5.34% of ARSA\u2019s shares.\n\nC-18: Share Purchase Agreement, signed October 2, 2001 and notarized on October 15, 2001.\n\n377.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the SPA, Air Comet paid a purchase price of USD 1 for the shares of Interinvest.311 Under the SPA, Air Comet agreed, in accordance with the industrial plan it created for the Airlines, to assume the assets and liabilities of the Airlines, to retain airline employees for two years, to make a USD 50 million capital increase, to maintain its majority interest in the corporations, to service specified flight routes, and to expand aircraft fleets.312 For its part, SEPI agreed to assume the Airlines\u2019 liabilities up to USD 300 million, and to assume commitments resulting from the implementation of the industrial plan up to USD 248 million.313 SEPI later agreed to contribute an additional USD 205 million to cover the operational losses suffered by the Airlines between July and October 2001.314\n\nC-18, section 2.\n\nC-18, section 7.\n\nC-18, section 9.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 **41.**\n\n378.\n\nPursuant to a number of subsequent contracts, Air Comet purchased and subrogated ARSA\u2019s creditors\u2019 claims rather than paying off the debts directly. ARSA\u2019s liabilities were then transferred to Interinvest and contributed to ARSA\u2019s capital. As described previously, this was done with SEPI\u2019s knowledge and agreement.315\n\nC-584: Agreement for Capital Contributions between Interinvest and SEPI, dated October 15, 2001; C-525: Agreement between Air Comet and Transportes de Cercanias, Bursura Segetur and Viajes Marsans, dated December 3, 2001. This Agreement was provided to an authorized representative of SEPI by a notary public on December 5, 2001.

In December 2002, ARSA and the majority of its creditors agreed on a plan of debt restructuring, which was approved by the court in charge of ARSA\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.316 By the end of 2004, ARSA had repaid the majority of its debt and was relieved from its obligations under its reorganization proceedings.317 On June 17, 2011, Commercial Court No. 15 ordered the conclusion of ARSA\u2019s reorganization proceedings in Argentina and, on August 15, 2011, declared the termination of ARSA\u2019s reorganization proceedings.318\n\nC-526: Judgment of Commercial Court No. 15 dated December 26, 2002. According to the debt restructuring plan, ARSA was obliged to repay only approximately 40% of the amounts owed prior to the conclusion of the SPA and it was allowed to make payment in Argentine Pesos. *See* Diaz Ferran WS, \u00b6 12. *See also* C-530: court judgment of March 25, 2003; C-531: court judgment of November 30, 2005. *See also* C-24: Dow Jones International News, October 29, 2002.\n\nC-25: La Nacion, December 27, 2004; Diaz Ferran WS, \u00b6 12.\n\n*See* C-768: decision of June 17, 2011; C-771: decision of August 15, 2011.\n\n380.\n\nDespite challenging conditions, including the events of September 2001 and the economic crisis and subsequent devaluation in Argentina, the revenues and market share of the Airlines increased substantially between 2002 and 2004. In this regard, the Airlines\u2019 share of the Argentine air transportation market increased from 32% in 2001 to 81% in 2004. In addition, the Airlines\u2019 combined revenues reached ARS 2.6 billion in 2004. Further indications of the improvement in the Airlines\u2019 economic and financial indicators included: constant increase in revenue for both airlines between 2002 and 2004, improving from substantial negative net income in 2001 to positive net income of USD 12 million for AUSA and USD 32 million for ARSA;319 the continuous increase in the number of passengers transported as well as the domestic and international revenues per passenger and per kilometre for both airlines;320 and the fact that the Airlines recommenced operation of all previously abandoned routes both domestically and internationally.321\n\nCl.

ARSA\u2019s domestic passengers increased from approximately 1 million passengers in 2001 to 1.5 million in 2002 and 2.3 million in 2005. ARSA\u2019s international passengers increased from 0.9 million passengers in 2001, to 1.2 million in 2002, 1.8 million in 2004 and 1.9 million in 2005.\n\nCl.

Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.\n\n382.\n\nAs mentioned, the economic situation of the Airlines improved from 2002 to 2004 despite the challenging economic conditions in Argentina at the time. These included the devaluation of the Argentine peso in 2002, which produced a steep decline in the value of peso-denominated airfares while the vast majority of the Airlines\u2019 costs were denominated in US dollars. In addition, there was a substantial increase in the price of jet fuel, which accelerated substantially as of mid-2004. The combination of these conditions gave rise to a series of requests by the Airlines, some of which were made in conjunction with other airlines, for increases of the airfare caps set under the Air Transportation Regulatory Regime.323 In response to the many requests made, during the period between May 2002 and July 2008, a total of four airfare tariff increases were granted.324 Since July 2008, i.e. after Respondent expropriated the Airlines, Respondent increased airfare tariffs nine times from November 2009 to May 20 1 3.325\n\nCl.

Claimants say that the tariff increases were insufficient to address the significant cost increases faced by the Airlines and that two of the increases came very late, in April and May 2008 and were too late to be of assistance to Claimants.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 148 and the sources cited there.\n\n**The Regulatory Framework**\n----------------------------\n\n383.\n\nThe applicable legislation governing commercial air transportation, including the granting of airline concessions, conditions to operate and airfares, are the *Aeronautics Code* and the *Air Business Law*,326 The *Aeronautics Code* provides that the Government of Argentina, through the Transportation Secretariat, is responsible for setting airfares.327 The *Air Business Law* addresses airfares. In respect of domestic airfares, it provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n**Section 42 -** Airfares shall be established taking into consideration the interests of the Nation, of the users and of the operators, in accordance with the concept of an economically reasonable airfare for each route and each segment.328\n\nC-60; C-61.\n\nC-61/C-859, Article 109. Pursuant to *Aeronautics Code,* Article 133 and Decree 326/1982, Article 24: C-860, application of the airfare tariffs or bands was mandatory and subject to substantial fines for non-compliance. *See also* C-80: Decree 1654/2002, Article 9 and C-83: Decree 1012/2006, Article 8. This appears to have changed with respect to maximum airfares with the adoption of Decree 294/2016 in February 2016, referred to above.\n\nAir Business Law, Section 42. Section 22 of the law addresses international airfares and provides as follows: \"airfares for international air transport services operating in the Argentine Republic shall be set by the competent national authorities taking into consideration the interests of the Country, of the users and of the Argentine operators\". The Parties are in agreement that airfares for international flights were not regulated by the Government of Argentina: Resp. CM \u00b6 389; KPMG ER1 \u00b6 11.2.7; Cl. Reply, \u00b6 114 and fn. 256. Rather, it appears that airfares on international routes were governed by bilateral agreements in force between Argentina and the respective country.\n\n384.\n\nThe *Air Business Law,* in Section 6, provides for the subsidization of national carriers rendering regular air services where losses are caused by non-economically-reasonable-airfares *(tarifas-no-retributivas)* (\"TER\") for scheduled air services on routes declared of general interest by Government of Argentina.\n\n385.\n\nArticle 3 of Decree 6875/1971, implemented in the same year as the *Air Business Law,* addressed the content of economically reasonable airfares or the *tarifa economica retributiva* (\"TER\") in more detail as follows:\n\n**Section 3 -** The administrative authority [i.e. the Secretary of Transportation] shall perform the necessary technical and economic studies to determine the economically reasonable airfare for passengers [flights] in all the routes and segments of routes, based on the load factor approved by the administrative authority. The airfare shall cover the direct and indirect exploitation costs for each route or segment of route, to which an additional amount approved for each company shall be added to account for financial costs and a margin of return.\n\n**Section 4** - The direct costs shall be calculated based on the inputs required to perform a correct and efficient operation (fuel and lubricant, air personnel, maintenance, insurances and devaluation). The indirect costs shall globally consist of a percentage of the direct costs, set by the application authority [i.e., the Secretary of Transportation], compatible with the national market, the characteristics and evolution of the specific company and pro-rata according to each route or segment of route.\n\n**Section 5** - The additional amount to cover financial costs and profitability shall result from the following:\n\na) As financial cost: interest accruing on the fixed assets allocated to the service after deducting amortization and the company\u2019s own capital stock, using updated values in all cases, plus interest on the current assets based on a percentage of the updated fixed assets allocated to the service, as fixed by the enforcement authority;\n\nb) As profitability: interest on the Company\u2019s own capital stock used for the operation.\n\nThe interest rates fixed by the administrative authority shall in all cases be consistent with the characteristics of the market providing the capital.\n\nThe additional amount shall be pro rata each service rendered on routes or parts of routes.329\n\nC-62: Decree 6875/1971. While Decree 6875/1971 regulates uneconomical and unprofitable routes. Claimants say that this decree sets forth the methodology that the regulator must follow when setting TER-compliant airfares for every domestic route. They say that the methodology is not specific to uneconomical or unprofitable routes and provides the criteria for the calculation of economically reasonable airfares for all domestic routes. In this regard. Claimants refer to what Respondent\u2019s Expert, KPMG, says about the Decree at KPMGERl, \u00b6 11.2.9. *See* Cl. PHB, \u00b6\u00b630-31. *See also* the reports of the Parties\u2019 respective experts, Messrs. Bianchi and Mata, who agreed that the principle of \"fair and reasonable\" public service tariffs is embodied in the concept of economically reasonable airfares in Article 42 of the Air Business Law. They agreed that the applicable tariffs must allow the concessionaire, when operating efficiently, to obtain proceeds in an amount adequate to cover costs of the operation, maintenance and expansion of services, as well as a business profit: *see* Cl. PHB \u00b6 29 and the sources cited there.  \n Respondent disagrees with Claimants\u2019 interpretation of Decree 6875/1971 and its relevance. Respondent, and its expert, Ms. Donato, say that Decree 6875/1971 applies only in the case of economic subsidies provided for in Article 6 of the Air Business Law and has no application or relevance in this case since Claimants did not request the subsidization of any particular routes of special interest. *See* Resp. Rej. \" 371-374; Donato ER2,\u00b6\u00b6 18-21, 23.\n\n386.\n\nAlso of relevance is that in 1990, when AASE was privatized and ARSA was created, the General Transfer Contract provided as follows with respect to airfares:\n\nthe Argentine State warrants [to ARSA] that the domestic flights\u2019 airfares will be set according to the provisions of Law No. 19,030 |. J/r *Business Law]* (Articles 42 [;>., the concept of an economically reasonable airfare], 43, 44.45 and 46) and the resolution SETOP No. 357/78, and that international flight [airfares will be set] according to Articles 22 to 27 of the referred Law; or in accordance with [the laws and resolutions] that eventually replace the ones mentioned, although guaranteeing as appropriate the same objectives as the provisions mentioned.330\n\nC-63: General Transfer Contract, Art II(3)(m) p. 1075, signed on November 20, 1990, between the Government of Argentina, ARSE, ARSA and Iberia. Reference to economically reasonable airfares (TER) has been made in several decrees and resolutions since that time.\n\n387.\n\nIn 1987, the Government of Argentina had introduced some flexibility into the airfare structure by substituting an airfare band regime for the previous fixed airfare system. The new airfare band system was introduced by Resolution No. 275/85 and later developed by Decree 2186/92. Initially, the airfare bands permitted a 20% variation in domestic passenger fares below and above a base or reference airfare. This was later increased to 60% and then reduced to 35%.331 The use of airfare bands required the approving authority (the Transportation Secretariat) to approve a base airfare or *tarifa de referenda* and airfares which were required to fit within the bands set by the base airfare.\n\n*See* C-65: Resolution No. 275/87; Ex. C-66: Decree 2186/92, Article 2(c), Annex II; Ex. C-67: Resolution SST No. 264 dated November 16.1990. The 60% air bands remained in place at the time Claimants made their investment. However, by way of Resolution 42/2001 of December 15, 2001, the bands were reduced to a variation of 35% below and above the base airfare. See C-81.\n\n388.\n\nIn October 2001, when the SPA was concluded, the airlines providing domestic services in Argentina were engaged in an airfare war, offering very low prices in order to capture business in a depressed market. In light of this, the Association of Argentine Airlines, (Camara de Lineas Aereas de la Republica Argentina) (\"CLARA\"), wrote to the then Sub-Secretary of Transportation to request the modification of the airfare bands regime to protect the industry from predatory airfares and fostering an increase in demand.332 In its letter, CLARA noted that there was an oversupply of airplanes to serve the domestic market and that costs had increased significantly due to taxes, the privatization of airports and the increase in the costs of supplies and materials. This situation had been aggravated by the state of the air transportation market after September 11, 2001. CLARA went on to request a modification of the airfare bands regime to limit maximum tariffs to a band of 40% above the referenced tariff (to increase demand) and minimum tariffs of 30% below the reference tariff (to protect against predatory pricing).\n\nRA-538: letter of October 12, 2001 from CLARA.\n\n389.\n\nBy way Resolution MTCyD No. 47/2001, bands of 35% above and below the reference airfares were established. In addition, the Resolution provided that in the case of tourist packages and excursion tickets subject to certain conditions, the minimum band below the reference airfare could be decreased up to 45%.333\n\nRA-333.\n\n390.\n\nIn 2002, after the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, Dinar S.A., another airline operating in the domestic market, wrote to the Secretariat of Transportation requesting an average increase of 73% with a narrowing of the airfare bands to 25% above or below the reference tariff.334 On May 17, 2002, in response to Dinar S.A.\u2019s proposal, which appears to have been circulated by the Secretariat of Transportation, the Airlines wrote to the Secretary to provide their views. The Airlines stated that Dinar S.A.\u2019s proposal was not commercially viable and proposed, instead, gradual increases in the airfares until a balanced fare structure was achieved. The Airlines went on to propose a table of airfares which appear to have provided for an average increase of approximately 34% with respect to maximum airfares.335 In addition, the Airlines expressed the view that airfares were better regulated by the market and that there should be a gradual removal of tariffs as was the case in international transportation and in the majority of developed national markets.\n\nRA-334: letter from Dinar S.A. to the Secretariat of Transportation dated May 13, 2002.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 337; RA-335.\n\n391.\n\nSubsequently, the Government of Argentina approved four increases to the base airfare between 2002 and 2008. The first of these occurred in September 2002 with the enactment of Decree 1654/02.336 In that decree, the government declared a State of Emergency in the air transport sector, noting the costs of the commercial air transport sector, including a high percentage of imported inputs and the increase in domestic inputs such as fuel and the need to adopt policies designed to offset existing imbalances so that airlines could continue to operate. The decree went on to provide for a nominal increase in the airfare caps for domestic flights by approximately 41% and to re-establish the airfare bands at approximately 60%.337 In addition, Decree 1654/2002 instructed the Ministry of Economy to submit to the Executive Branch, for submission to Congress, a bill covering a variety of measures intended to assist air transport operators, including a cut in the value-added tax (VAT) for fuel, an exemption from VAT on insurance contracts, and a number of other exemptions and flexibility to permit the use of VAT to cover other costs. It does not appear that the said bill was ever adopted by Congress or that the measures it contained were ever implemented.\n\nC-80.\n\nC-80: Decree 1654/2002, Article 4 and Annex I. Claimants say that the percentage of 41% does not reflect the actual situation since in December 2001 the scope of the airfare bands had been reduced from 60% to 35% by way of Resolution No. 47/2001: Ex. C-81. Claimants also say that the effect of Decree 1654/2002 was to restore the airfare band inforce prior to their reduction by way of Resolution No. 47/2001 and to provide, on top of that a modest increase of 20%. According to Claimants, this was insufficient to account for the consequences of the devaluation and the increased costs of the airlines. *See* Cl. Mem., \u00b6 117; Cl. Reply, \u00b6 153.\n\n392.\n\nBy way of Decree 71/2003, dated May 29, 2003, Mr. Ricardo Cirielli was appointed Undersecretary of Air Transportation. Among his duties, the Undersecretary of Air Transportation was responsible for overseeing and regulating all matters pertaining to the air transport industry and reported directly to the Secretary of Transportation at the time, Mr. Ricardo Jaime. At that time, and since 1992, Mr. Cirielli had been the Secretary General of one of the larger labor unions in the Argentine air transportation sector, the Association of Aeronautics Technical Personnel (\"APTA\").338 As the head of APTA, Mr. Cirielli had opposed the investment by Spanish companies in the Airlines and Air Comet\u2019s then President, Mr. Antonio Mata Ramayo.339 Upon his appointment as Undersecretary of Air Transportation, Mr. Cirielli went on an unpaid leave of absence from his position as Secretary General of APTA.340\n\nSee C-88: Decree 71/2003, May 29, 2003; C-89: Decree 65/2003, May 28, 2003; C-90: Mr. Cirielli Resume.\n\n*See* C-91-C-95: APTA press communication, October 15.2001. *See* also C-96: Anti-Corruption Office Resolution No. 111/06, March 29, 2006.\n\nC-l 10: APTA press communication. May 28.2003. In his press release, Mr. Cirielli noted that while he temporarily left his functions as Secretary General of APTA and president of another union, OSPTA, this did not mean in any way that he would stop following closely all decisions and actions taken by APTA or that he gave up in any way his personal concern for the future of APTA.\n\n393.\n\nBy way of Resolution ST No. 369 dated June 7, 2004 and Resolution ST No. 102 dated March 3, 2005, the Secretariat of Transportation renewed for a period of 15 years the concessions for many of ARSA\u2019s national and international routes which were about to expire.341 The renewal of the remaining routes was deferred since the concessions for these routes remained in force for a number of years.\n\nRA-360; RA-361.\n\n394.\n\nThe continuous increase in the costs faced by air carriers operating in Argentina led to a written request on October 4, 2004 by the Airlines to the Argentine Secretary of Transportation for an airfare increase. In their request, the Airlines cited the steady increase in the price of crude oil and jet fuel which, at that point, accounted for 36% of ARSA\u2019s costs. Due to these costs, according to the Airlines, the fares and rates charged by them were out of step with the cost increases and did not comply with the economically reasonable airfare (TER) principle established in the *Air Business Law.* As a result, the Airlines requested an increase of 8% to the reference rates and/or cap rate upon which they were required to base their fares.342\n\nC-71. In their letters, the Airlines stated that the request for increase was made without prejudice to other rate related matters that needed to be addressed in due course.\n\n395.\n\nOn December 28, 2004, the Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Jaime, rejected the Airlines\u2019 request for a fare increase. This decision was based on two technical reports issued by the Office of the Undersecretariat of Aerocommercial Transportation, and the recommendation of Mr. Cirielli, who, in turn, based his recommendation to deny the requests on the same reports.343 While the technical reports on which the recommendation and decision to deny the price increase were based acknowledged the increase in the price of fuel, they concluded that an airfare increase was not warranted because the Airlines had increased certain airfares since the enactment of Decree 1654/02 and achieved positive operating results for 2003 and 20 04.344 The Airlines appealed the decisions to reject their request for an airfare increase. These appeals were denied in March 2005 on the basis of reports prepared by the Office of the Undersecretary of Aerocommercial Transportation.345\n\nC-82.\n\nC-82: technical reports, p. 10 of 7 [sic]. The technical reports concluded, in part, as follows:  \n [The] increases in the price of oil cannot be deemed to be permanent, at least for the time being, and, accordingly, it appears to be inadvisable to authorize permanent rate increases that are inflexible to a decrease just to account for temporary cost increases.  \n Moreover, the cost increases we have analyzed do not seem to disrupt the company\u2019s economic equation, which yields considerable positive margins in the domestic market.\n\nRA-338, Cl Reply \u00b6177. The report concluded, in relevant part as follows:  \n Finally, it must be noted that the need for an airfare review arises from the fall in the company\u2019s profitability, and not out of an increase in the cost of one production supply only [...].  \n The results indicate that, since the macroeconomic collapse in early 2002, the c[Argentine Airlines\u2019] operating profits from domestic flights have experienced -according to [their] own data - a substantial recovery of around 38%.  \n Such recovery is mostly due to three main factors:  \n (a) increases in maximum allowed airfares (Decree 1654-/2002);  \n (b) a higher concentration of airfares in the upper end of the authorized airfare band, and;  \n (c) the substantial increase in demand associated with the economy\u2019s recovery.  \n Claimants maintain that the denial of the airfare increase requested was in contravention of the regulatory framework on the basis that airfares were required to be set by the Secretariat of Transportation taking into account: direct costs (including the price of fuel and salaries); indirect costs (calculated as a percentage of direct costs); financial costs; and a margin of return for operators. According to Claimants, if an air carrier\u2019s revenues increased or if it had achieved a profit, this did not disentitle it to an airfare increase on the basis of increases in costs. *See* Cl. Reply \u00b6 177-179.\n\n396.\n\nIn 2005, the Airlines\u2019 fuel and other costs continued to increase. In addition, the Airlines suffered a series of strikes by APTA and the Air Pilots Union.346\n\nClaimants contend that although Mr. Cirielli was on a formal unpaid leave of absence from his position as Secretary General of APTA as of his appointment as Undersecretary of Air Transportation, he maintained close ties with APTA and was involved in those strikes: *see* Cl. Mem. \u00b6 169-171; Cl. Reply \u00b6 192-197.\n\n397.\n\nOn November 15, 2005, the Federal Court of Appeal in contentious-administrative matters for the city of Buenos Aires found that Mr. Cirielli had a conflict of interest with respect to a number of matters concerning ARSA.347 This decision was the result of an administrative motion which ARSA had filed with the Secretary of Air Transportation requesting that Mr. Cirielli recuse himself with respect to the matters in question involving ARSA. The Secretary of Air Transportation denied the request and the matter proceeded through the courts by way of a judicial complaint. This decision was followed by a decision on March 29, 2006 by the Anti-Corruption Office of the Argentine Ministry of Justice and Human Rghts, issued in response to a complaint filed by ARSA in 2003. The Anti-Corruption Office found that Mr. Cirielli had a conflict of interest vis-a-vis ARSA and held that he was required to \"refrain from any direct or indirect involvement in any cases in which...ARSA has any interest.\"348 Mr. Cirielli remained in his position as Undersecretary of Air Transportation until December 2007.\n\nC-123.\n\nC-96: Anti-Corruption Office Resolution No. 111-06, March 29, 2006. *See also* Cl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 172-177 and the sources cited there.\n\n398.\n\nIn November 2005, APTA and the Air Pilots Association, APLA, organized a strike which lasted nine days. Although the strike affected all airlines operating in Argentina, it appears to have affected the Airlines particularly severely. At the request of the Government of Argentina, Mr. Diaz Ferran travelled to Buenos Aires to negotiate a resolution to the strike. A series of meetings occurred between Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Alberto Fernandez, the President\u2019s then Chief of Staff, and President Kirchner. According to Mr. Diaz Ferran, he told Mr. Fernandez that it would not be possible to increase salaries unless the government immediately increased airfares which had not had any increase in three years. Again, according to Mr. Diaz Ferran, at the President\u2019s request, the leaders of the two unions, APTA and APLA, joined the meetings, and a provisional agreement was reached that the government would provide increases in airfares and fuel subsidies and the unions would moderate their wage demands. Final wage increases would then be negotiated and become effective when the fare increases promised by the government became effective.349 Subsequently, Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias met with the President\u2019s Chief of Staff, Mr. Fernandez, and the Argentine Minister of Economy, Ms. Felisa Miceli, who were in Madrid for an official visit. During the course of the meeting, according to Mr. Diaz Ferran, Mr. Fernandez confirmed the Government of Argentina\u2019s commitment to increase the airfares and to provide subsidies for jet fuel in early 2006.350\n\n*See* Diaz Ferran WS \u00b6\u00b6 30-35; C-144: *Acta Acuerdo* dated December 2, 2005 and ratified by Resolution SS.

It also noted that the impact was even more dramatic in Argentina given the effect of the exchange rate following devaluation. It went on to note that the price of jet fuel had increased by 97% since 2002, shortly after the implementation of Decree 1654/2002, and by 42.11% between September 2004 and the end of 2005. It also noted that, as a result, based on data supplied by a company that provided almost exclusively domestic flight services, the share of \"fuels\" in that company\u2019s \"costs of services provided\" had increased from 26.47% in 2002 to 37.85% in 2003 and 41.47% in 2004.352\n\nC-862. The report was authored by the same economist who had prepared the reports in response to the Airlines\u2019 request for an airfare increase in 2004, described above at \u00b6 395. The report goes on to state that it has taken into account the evolution of certain variables, including the price of jet fuel. It also notes that since Decree 1654/2002, the air transport companies had requested increases in the air tariffs on various occasions in October 2004. In that regard, the report indicates that it lias attempted to evaluate changes since that time as well.\n\nC-862, pp 1-2. The report also noted that price levels in economy, such as salaries, had increased between 18% and 57% since the implementation of Decree 1654/2002 and between 10% and 26.8% since October 2004 to date. The report concluded that in light of the cost increases reviewed, the costs structure of the air transport companies could be expected to have been affected.\n\n400.\n\nBy the end of March 2006, no airfare increases or fuel subsidies had been implemented. At that time, a number of reports appeared in the media describing the President\u2019s alleged plan to take over the Airlines.353\n\n*See* C-146: *El plan secreto para quedarse con AEROLINEAS EDICION i,* March 29, 2006.\n\n401.\n\nIn May 2006, faced with the unions\u2019 demands for wage increases and no increase in the airfares, Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias requested a meeting with the Argentine government to address the situation. Meetings were then held with the President of Argentina, his Chief of Staff, Mr. Fernandez, and others. According to Mr. Diaz Ferran, the President and Mr. Fernandez again confirmed their undertaking to increase airfares but that they required a solution to the dispute with the unions first. The Airlines then negotiated and concluded an agreement with APTA and APLA including significant wage increases of approximately 25%.354\n\nDiaz Ferran WS \u00b6 42; C-147: Resolution S.R.L.

As mentioned previously. Respondent says that the contribution of the claims purchased by Air Comet to ARSA\u2019s capital gave Air Comet a higher proportional interest in ARSA\u2019s capital and diluted Respondent\u2019s interest. Claimants submit that there was no basis for the challenge to the financial statements, which caused the Airlines harm by affecting their ability to obtain credit. They also allege that the challenge to the financial statements was part of Respondent\u2019s hostile treatment in support of its plan to \"re-Argentinize\" the Airlines. Respondent, on the other hand, argues that Air Comet\u2019s purchase of ARSA\u2019s debt and subrogation to ARSA\u2019s creditors\u2019 claims and capitalization of the credits, with the resulting dilution of its interest in ARSA from 5.34% down to 1.34%, was a maneuver to deprive it of rights as a shareholder: Resp.

After what appear to have been hectic and controversial last-minute negotiations, an agreement entitled \"Letter of Intent between the National State and Argentine Airlines S.A. and Interinvest S.A.\" (the \"2006 Agreement\") and an Addendum (the \"2006 Addendum\") were signed on June 21, 2006.357\n\nAccording to Mr. Diaz Ferran, during these negotiations Secretary Jaime informed him that the Government of Argentina would increase the airfares and withdraw judicial challenges against ARSA\u2019s financial statements only if the govermnent was allowed to increase its control and shareholding participation in ARSA. *See* Diaz Ferran WS, \u00b6 44. Respondent maintains that there was no link between the 2006 Agreement and the increase in airfares provided for in Decree 1012/2006 of August 7, 2006. *See* Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 439-440.\n\nC-134. Although both the 2006 Agreement and the 2006 Addendum bear the date June 21, 2006, it appears that the 2006 Addendum was only signed two days after the signature of the 2006 Agreement. This was due to a dispute between the Parties in respect of the language of one of the 2006 Agreements\u2019 provisions (Section l(c)(ii)) which addressed certain voting privileges attached to the Government of Argentina\u2019s increased shareholding of 5% provided for in the 2006 Agreement. *See also* Diaz Ferran WS, \" 50-66; Cl.

The 2006 Agreement reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n1. It is the parties\u2019 intention to discuss the following agenda at the next Annual/Special Meeting of the Stockholders of Aerolineas Argentinas S.A.:\n\n(a) Approval of the Financial Statements for fiscal year 2005.\n\n(b) Increase or modification of the capital stock, in an amount such that the Class \"A\" share of the total capital stock will, including the existing stockholdings, reach at least five percent (5%) and up to twenty percent (20%) thereof. This increase or, as the case may be, modification will be paid in or implemented at par value, through the capitalization of claims held by the State against AAS A, cash contributions, and such other methods as the parties may agree upon, in accordance with the applicable legal provisions.\n\n(c) Amendment of AASA\u2019s Corporate Bylaws in order that said instrument shall make provision for and reflect the following:\n\n(i) the holders of class \"A\" stock will have the right to appoint one (1 regular and one (1 alternate member of the Statutory Audit Committee and, in addition, two (2) regular directors and two (2) alternate directors. The number of Class \"C\" directors would be set at nine (9); and\n\n(ii) the favorable vote of Class \"A\" shares-and, when required, the favorable vote of the two Directors appointed at the Class \"A\" shares proposal-shall be necessary for the adoption of any strategic decision such as: (1 significant capital increases, (2) strategic alliances or operations that affect the national flag carrier or that ought to be in line with the Argentine commercial air transportation policy, (3) deciding the elimination or reduction of commercial air transportation domestic services.\n\n(iii) the modification of the capital stock as provided for in Section 1(b).\n\n2. Once the agreements between the parties are completed and once the points referenced to in Article 1 of the present agreement are approved in the Meeting of Shareholders, the National State will relinquish the legal proceedings brought against AASA challenging the validity of the approbation by AASA Board of Financial Statements corresponding to the fiscal years ending 31.12.2002, 31.02.2003, and 31.12.2004; all of this would be done upon AASA\u2019s consent, and the brief or briefs to be filed by the attorneys for the State of Argentina and the AASA would state that each party would pay for its own costs in all the aforementioned proceedings.\n\n3. The increase in the Class \"A\" share of the total capital up to twenty percent (20%) of the Capital Stock may be made at Stockholders\u2019 Meetings taking place after the Meeting referred to in Section 1 hereof.\n\n4. The parties hereby state their intention to file all the required paperwork and take all steps required for the public offering of AASA\u2019s stock. The State of Argentina and Interinvest will independently determine the timing and the portion of their stake each of them will set for the public offering, as the case may be.\n\n405.\n\nThe 2006 Agreement addressed and resolved a number of disputes between Respondent and ARSA and Interinvest, including the Government of Argentina\u2019s complaints regarding the dilution of its shareholding in ARSA and its challenge of ARSA\u2019s financial statements for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004. It also provided an option to the Government of Argentina to increase its shareholding in ARSA to 20%. Although not referred to in the 2006 Agreement, it was followed shortly by an increase in airfares of approximately 20%, as described below.\n\n406.\n\nThe Addendum reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n1. Section 1 is hereby amended to read as follows: \"The parties have agreed to discuss the following agenda at the next Annual Stockholders Meeting.\n\n2. Section l(c)(ii) shall read as follows: \"the favorable vote for Class \"A\" shares or the favorable vote of the two Directors appointed at the proposal of Class \"A\" shares - as the case may be-shall be necessary for the adoption of the following decisions: \u00b6 Significant capital increases of the Corporation, except in the case in which such capital increase was needed in order to ensure the normal operation and development of the Corporation; 2) Entering into alliances with other international airlines of the type of \"One World\" \"Star Alliance\"; 3) Elimination or substantial reduction of the commercial air transportation domestic services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Director representing the class \"A\" shares were against the aforementioned elimination or substantial reduction, shall ensure the compliance with the application of the economically reasonable airfare (art. 42, Law No. 19,030).\n\n3. As regards Section 3, the State of Argentina hereby reserves a period of one year to make such a decision.\n\n407.\n\nThe signature of the 2006 Addendum resolved a dispute relating to the text of Section 1 (c)(ii) of the 2006 Agreement. Claimants allege that Secretary Jaime had modified the text of the 2006 Agreement in a manner inconsistent with what they say had been the agreement negotiated between Mr. Diaz Ferran and Secretary Jaime relating to certain rights which would attach to Respondent\u2019s increased shareholdings of 5% in ARSA.358 According to Claimants, the 2006 Addendum reflects the original agreement reached between Mr. Diaz Ferran and Secretary Jaime.359 Amongst other things, the 2006 Addendum modified the text of the 2006 Agreement to require the favorable vote of Respondent\u2019s Class A shares by its two appointees to the Board of ARSA only in the case of elimination or substantial reduction of commercial air transportation domestic services. Further, it provided that if Respondent\u2019s representatives voted against the elimination or substantial reduction of services, the Government of Argentina would be required to ensure compliance with the application of the economically reasonable airfares pursuant to Law 19,030, Article 42 in respect of unprofitable routes. The 2006 Addendum also deleted the requirement for the favorable vote of the government\u2019s shares in order to approve the adoption of any strategic decision of the company and limited the decision on which a favorable vote of the government\u2019s shares would be required to the specific decisions listed.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 200-209.\n\nDiaz Ferran WS \u00b6 66. It appears that Mr. Diaz Ferran complained to Secretary Jaime regarding the change in the text and that, with the assistance of the Spanish govermnent, the 2006 Addendum was negotiated and signed: *see* Diaz Ferran WS \u00b6\u00b6 61-66.\n\n408.\n\nOn August 7, 2006, the Government of Argentina adopted Decree 1012/2006. In that Decree, the government recognized the very difficult circumstances (\"State of Emergency\") in the air transport sector and provided for a number of measures to address this, including an increase in airfares of approximately 20%, the preparation of a bill proposing cuts in VAT for fuel, a VAT exemption for aircraft purchased or leased with a purchase option, and a VAT exemption applied to insurance policies purchased outside Argentina. It also provided for a subsidy for fuel costs for domestic air transportation. Decree 1012/2006 reads in relevant part as follows:\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n...Specifically, the causes of the deep-rooted crisis of this sector are, among others, the tight credit that prevents airlines from securing financing, the increase in the price of aviation fuel, the higher insurance costs, and the direct incidence of leasing costs when it is impossible to buy new aircraft, the increase in the price of spare parts, and the tax compliance burden to companies.\n\n...Therefore, it lias become necessary to reformulate the state of emergency of the air transport sector within the framework of Law No. 25,561, as amended, and to adopt policies designed to offset existing imbalances that airlines need to continue operating and growing...\n\n...In that scenario, it is considered advisable to adopt tax measures that might help the companies in the commercial air transport sector to mitigate the effects of cost increases due to structural changes within Argentina, the changes that the September 11.2001, events brought about, and the consequences of hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, all of which had an impact on the price of aviation fuel.\n\n...The changes in the way airlines get new aircraft have resulted in the increased importance of leasing to the detriment of purchasing. Hence, both methods should be treated equally for tax purposes, since those changes are more based on swings in the market than on decisions made by airlines.\n\n...The impact of aviation fuel on the companies\u2019 cost structure and the increases in costs make it advisable to apply a differential tax treatment, exempting sales of imported aviation fuel from the payment of Value Added Tax.\n\n...Finally, to the high cost of aviation fuel, it is advisable to adjust the base airfare set by Decree No. 1654/02, which is used to determine the prices charged to the public by operators of scheduled domestic air transport services for passengers, and maintain unchanged the price range established by Decree No. 1654/02. The increase will be considered for the purposes of the economically reasonable airfare as set forth by Section 42 of Law No. 19,030, to be authorized in future by the OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT under the MINISTRY OF FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND SERVICES, as Enforcement Authority.\"\n\n...Both the legal system and current economic reality are obviously different from those existing at the time the Aeronautical Code was enacted. Law No. 17,285 (Aeronautical Code) and the Argentine Commercial Air Transport Policy Law No. 19,030 are currently being revised.\n\nNow therefore,\n\nTHE PRESIDENT OF ARGENTINA\n\nORDERS THE FOLLOWING:\n\n**Section 1** \u2014A continued State of Emergency is hereby declared with respect to Commercial Air Transport throughout Argentina by Argentine operators subject to the National Authority established in Section 1 of Decree No. 1654, dated September 4, 2002.\n\n**Section 2 \u2014** Under the state of emergency declared in the previous Section, the exemption allowing Argentine airlines to take out commercial air insurance in Argentina, as provided in Sections 2 and 3 of Law No. 12,988 (as restated in Decree No. 10,307, dated June 11, 1953), is hereby ratified.\n\n**Section 3 \u2014** An Aviation Fuel Subsidy Scheme (RCCA) is hereby established for scheduled domestic air transport services for passengers, to supplement the benchmark airfare set in Exhibits I and II, as approved by Section 6 of this Decree.\n\n**Section 4 \u2014** The OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT of the MINISTRY OF FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND SERVICES shall regulate the implementation of the subsidizing scheme, the conditions to be met by the beneficiary airlines, and the need for its continuity. If applicable, it shall also favour the inclusion of the scheme set in Section 3 hereof into the budget estimates for allocation to its activities for Fiscal Year 2007.\n\n**Section 5 \u2014** The MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND PRODUCTION and the MINISTRY OF FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND SERVICES are hereby instructed to submit to the OFFICE OF THE HEAD OF THE CABINET OF ARGENTINA, within THIRTY (30) days from publication of this Decree, a bill proposing the approval of the following action:\n\na) Use of any technical and/or freely available balances of Value Added Tax to which operators of scheduled domestic air transport services for passengers are entitled for paying any other federal tax, as well as their contributions to the Social Security System (Sistema Unico de la Seguridad Social).\n\nb) Exemption from Value Added Tax of the insurance contemplated in Section 2 hereof.\n\nc) Exemption from Value Added Tax of the purchase of aviation fuel by operators of scheduled domestic air transport services for passengers.\n\n**Section 6 \u2014** The operators of scheduled domestic air transport services for passengers are hereby authorized to apply, as from 00.00 a.m. of the day following that of publication of this Decree, the airfares included in the price range between the benchmark airfare and the highest airfare for each of the points of origin/points of destination described in Exhibit I, and to apply, as from the THIRTIETH (30th) calendar day from the publication hereof, the airfares listed in Exhibit II. Both Exhibits are an integral part of this Decree.\n\nThe increase set forth in the preceding paragraph shall be considered on account of the economically viable [reasonable] fare determined by Section 42 of Law No. 19,030 to be authorized in future by the OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT under 'the MINISTRY OF FEDERAL PLANNING, PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND SERVICES, as Enforcement Authority...360\n\nC-83. According to Claimants, only the increase in airfares and the subsidy on aviation fuels (RRCA) were implemented. No tax bills were approved by Congress. Claimants say that the increase in airfares of approximately 20% was inadequate to account for rising costs and did not meet the requirements for providing an \"economically reasonable airfare\" under the terms of the Air Business Law. *See* Cl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 213-214. Claimants also say that the 20% increase was not what had been promised in the negotiations leading up to the 2006 Agreement. With respect to the subsidy on air fuel. Claimants say that it accounted only for 4.5% of the Airlines\u2019 fuel costs for domestic routes: Cl. Mem. \u00b6 147, fn. 163.\n\n409.\n\nFollowing the adoption of Decree 1012/2006, the Airlines wrote to the Secretary of Transportation in August and October 2006 to explain, *inter alia,* that the increase in airfares provided by Decree 1012/2006 was insufficient to allow the Airlines to obtain economically reasonable airfares.361 In its letter of August 18, 2006, ARSA requested that domestic tariffs be fixed pursuant to the applicable provisions of the *Air Business Law* and Resolution SETOP No. 357/78 and the General Transfer Contract. It also requested that the tax measures provided for in Decree 1012/2006 be implemented, noting that similar measures contained in Decree 1654/2002 had never been implemented.362 In their letter of October 20, 2006, the Airlines advised the Secretary of Transportation that the fuel subsidy (\"RCCA\") to be implemented by way of Resolution No. 812/2006 was insufficient to cover the economic effects of an economically reasonable airfare and the increase of costs, particularly with respect to fuel, and the effects of the devaluation of 2001/2002. As a result, the Airlines requested, amongst other things, the reconsideration and increase of the jet fuel subsidy (RCCA) implemented by Decree 1012/2006 and Resolution No. 812/2006.363\n\n*See.* C-72 (August 2006) and C-73 (October 2006). The Airlines also requested the implementation of the subsidy of air fuels (RCCA) provided for in Decree 1012/2006.\n\nC-72, pp 1-2. The letter also indicated ARSA\u2019s agreement with the reference in Decree 1012/2006 to a bill for the updating of the Aeronautical Code (adopted in 1967) to reflect changes in the industry since that time and international developments.\n\nC-73.\n\n410.\n\nIn November 2006, the Government of Argentina increased its participation in ARSA from 1.2% to 5%. As had been agreed in the 2006 Agreement, Interinvest transferred to the government 3.8% of ARSA\u2019s shares.364 In addition, amendments to the by-laws of ARSA to permit the appointment of one regular and one alternate member of the statutory audit committee and two regular directors and two alternate directors were approved and the members of the audit committee were appointed. It appears that Respondent\u2019s representatives on ARSA\u2019s Board of Directors attended and actively participated in meetings and that Respondent was also represented at shareholders\u2019 meetings.365\n\n*See* ARSA\u2019s minutes of the Shareholders\u2019 meeting of November 23, 2006: C-224; ARSA\u2019s minutes of the Board meeting of October 27, 2006: C-225. *See also* press reports at C-154; C-155; C-156; and C-157.\n\n*See,* for example, ARSA\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 Minutes of May 29, 2008, approving unanimously the Airlines\u2019 letter of April 29, 2008 to Secretary Jaime complaining of the losses suffered by the Airlines due to the lack of economically reasonable airfares and other measures: C-86. *See also* ARSA\u2019s Board of Directors\u2019 minutes of October 27, 2006: C-225; and ARSA\u2019s board of Directors\u2019 minutes of November 29, 2007: C-226. *See also* the minutes of ARSA\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meetings of November 23, 2006 and July 25, 2007: C-224; C-534.\n\n411.\n\nIn December 2006, the Government of Argentina withdrew its complaints challenging ARSA\u2019s financial statements for 2002, 2003 and 2004.366 In addition, Respondent\u2019s representatives on the Board of Directors voted to approve ARSA\u2019s financial statements for the fiscal year end of December 31, 2005.367 After certain rectifications made to the draft financial statements, the 2005 financial statements were formally approved.368\n\nResp.

The Airlines again suffered a series of strikes related primarily to demands for wage increases.369\n\nPascual Arias WS \u00b6 55.\n\n413.\n\nIn April 2007, representatives of the Airlines again met with Secretary Jaime to discuss the need to revise airfares for domestic flights. In their letter of April 4, 2007, the Airlines again submitted that the airfares provided for in Decree 1012/2006 were far from allowing the Airlines to achieve the economically reasonable airfare referred to in the Decree. The Airlines went on to point out that in addition to other steadily increasing costs, the salary demands (in the neighborhood of approximately 24% increases) from the various unions which represented the Airlines\u2019 employees substantially affected their overall cost structure. The letter requested a minimum airfare increase of 15%, which would allow them to address increases in certain costs and salary increases, but would still leave the Airlines far from achieving economically reasonable airfares.370 This letter was followed by a series of letters from the Association of Major Airlines Operating in Argentina, CLARA.371\n\nC-74.\n\n*See* C-75: CLARA\u2019s letter to the Secretary of Transportation dated May 2. 2007 submitting a cost analysis study reflecting the current situation of airline business costs. *See also* C-76: CLARA\u2019s letter of September 12, 2007 following up on its letter of May 2, 2007 to which it had received no reply and stating that the increasing costs faced by airlines and regulated tariffs were preventing its member airlines from covering their costs. This letter requested measures permitting the Airlines to increase their revenues from domestic air transportation, including, in the short term, an increase in the minimum and maximum airfare bands approved under Decree 1012/2006 and, in the medium term, a progressive deregulation of the domestic air transportation market. CLARA recognized that the mismatch between costs and airfares could not be cured by simply increasing airfares since this would affect demand. In this regard, it requested the implementation of the tax measures covered by the bill to be prepared pursuant to Decree 1012/2006. *See also* C-77: CLARA\u2019s letter of November 8, 2007 requesting an immediate increase of air fares of 40% and the implementation of the tax measures set out in Decree 1012/2006. The letter also stated that if this were not done, the Airlines would not be able to cover their costs, much less consider investing in more aircrafts or their modernization.\n\n414.\n\nIn September 2007, it was reported that the Airlines had suffered approximately 20 strikes during the course of the year, or approximately a strike every 15 days.372 In addition, j et fuel prices continued to rise. By the end of 2007, ARSA\u2019s financial condition had further deteriorated: EBITDA for 2007 was USD 4 million, net losses were USD 116 million and there had been an increase in the company\u2019s accounts payable of USD 34 million over 20 06.373\n\nC-230: Clarin, September f 5, 2007; Pascual Arias WS \u00b6 55. Claimants allege that Mr. Cirielli was against Spanish ownership of the Airlines and had confirmed that position publicly on a number of occasions: *see* Cl. Mem. \u00b6 221 and the sources cited there. In addition. Claimants say that the head of APLA, Mr. Jorge Perez Tamayo, who was also the preferred pilot for Presidential flights, was opposed to Spanish ownership of the Airlines: *see* Cl. Mem. \u00b6 220 and the sources cited there.\n\nC-40: ARSA\u2019s 2007 financial statements. AUSA\u2019s EBITDA reduced to USD 4 million, net losses for the year were USD 21 million and accounts payable were increasing (by USD 20 million between December 2007 and June 2008). C-33: AUSA\u2019s 2007 financial statements.\n\n415.\n\nDuring the course of the Iberia-American Summit in Chile in November 2007, Mr. Diaz Ferran and Mr. Pascual Arias met with Mr. and Mrs. Kirchner and President Jose Luis Zapatero to discuss the state of the Airlines.374 According to Claimants, during that discussion, Mr and Mrs. Kirchner indicated that the Government of Argentina had no interest in buying out the Airlines and that they were content with the companies\u2019 business plan which they would support to resolve the Airlines\u2019 problems.375\n\nPascual Arias WS \u00b6 66; C-169: El Pais, November 10, 2007; C-169: Clarin, November 11, 2007.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 227; Pascual Arias WS \u00b6 66.\n\n416.\n\nIn November 2007, the Government of Argentina gave notice of its intention to exercise its option to purchase an additional 15% of ARSA\u2019s shares.376 However, it does not appear that the option was ever exercised or implemented.\n\nC-226: ARSA\u2019s Board meeting minutes of November 29, 2007; Llorens WS4 \u00b6 12. The Board minutes go on to note that the State\u2019s exercise of their option to increase its shareholding would significantly increase ARSA\u2019s capital and resolve certain issues relating to the possible reduction of ARSA\u2019s capital pursuant to Article 206 of Law No. 19,550, the Commercial Companies Law *(Ley de Sociedades Comerciales).*\n\n417.\n\nIn January 2008, Mr. Pascual Arias and Mr. Diaz Ferran were contacted by Mr. Manuel Vazquez, who told them that he represented a group of investors interested in purchasing ARSA and AUSA.377 Eventually, after various exchanges and negotiations, an offer was made to Air Comet to purchase its shares in Interinvest for the amount of USD 150 million. This offer was rejected as too low.378\n\nPascual Arias WS, \u00b6 68; Diaz Ferran WS, \u00b6 73. According to Claimants, Mr. Vazquez was an advisor to the Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Jaime. According to Mr. Pascual Arias, Mr. Vazquez told him that his approach had been approved by the Argentine government. *See* also Munoz Perez WS1, \u00b6 6,710. *See* also C-170: extract from Case No. 2, 160/09, Criminal Court No. 11, April 21, 2010 in which Mr. Vazquez is recorded as having testified that he had acted as an advisor to Minister Jaime.\n\nC-171; C-172 dated April 2 and 3, 2008, respectively. In his response of April 3, 2008 to the offer from the group of investors, Mr. Munoz Perez, on behalf of Grupo Marsans, stated that the value of Interinvest at the time was of a minimum of USD 265 million. He went on to state that in normal circumstances, in which the activities of the Interinvest Group were not impeded by the current operational and legal circumstances, the estimate of Interinvest\u2019s value was approximately USD 700 million: C-172, pp. 1-2.\n\n418.\n\nIt appears that, in parallel, discussions regarding airfares had been continuing between the Airlines and the Secretary of Transportation. On March 26, 2008, ARSA wrote to the Secretary of Transportation to provide information requested by the Secretariat in the course of recent meetings in respect of the possible impact of measures being considered by the Secretariat.379 In this regard, ARSA stated its understanding that the measures in question were an airfare increase of approximately 30% and the fixing of the maximum price of jet fuel at ARS 1.80 per liter in all airports in the country and went on to list the monthly increase in flights to various destinations that the implementation of such measures would permit. It also provided information on increased flights in the event that the Secretariat also updated the index in the RCCA regime (dealing with subsidization of jet fuel). The letter also went on to state that despite the measures proposed by the Secretariat, for a number of other destinations, increasing, or even maintaining, flight schedules was not economically viable in light of the costs and low occupancy rates for those destinations. In regard of these, ARSA stated that in order for it and AUSA to be able to assure the proposed increases in flight frequencies throughout the country and to ensure a minimum of one flight daily to the majority of destinations, Government of Argentina would have to pay for empty seats to economically unviable destinations. ARSA noted that without payment for empty seats on flights to the destinations in question, the other measures proposed by the government would not be sufficient to cover the cost of increased flight frequency requested by the Secretariat nor to maintain the current flight frequencies. ARSA also stated that it was important that the measures provided for in Decree 1012/2006 be implemented since these had not, to date, been adopted by the Argentine Congress.\n\nC-78.\n\n419.\n\nOn April 11, 2008, the Secretary of Transportation issued Resolution No. 257/2008 which increased airfares by approximately 18% for economy-class fares.380 Resolution No. 257/2008 reads, in relevant part, as follows:\n\nWHEREAS, pursuant to Decree No. 1012/06, Section 6, the air fare increase thereby authorized is to be deemed an increase authorized towards such remunerative fare as, in accordance with Law No. 19,030, Section 42, the MINISTRY OF FEDERAL PLANNING PUBLIC INVESTMENT AND SERVICES\u2019 OFFICE OF TRANSPORTATION may authorize in the future, in its capacity as the Enforcing Authority for commercial air transportation.\n\nWHEREAS, subsequently to the issue of said Decree, the airlines\u2019 costs have materially and repeatedly increased, in particular jet fuel costs - as a result of international and local contingencies - as well as payroll costs, which rose as a result of salary adjustments.\n\nWHEREAS, in combination with the steady increase in the cost of aircraft leases, spare parts, insurance and IT services, this situation warrants a revision of the fares currently charged for domestic flights.\n\nWHEREAS, various government authorities and institutions from several provinces have expressed to us their concerns over the need to increase the offering of flights to the provinces, as the number of flights has declined as a result of the state of emergency that was declared by means of Decree No. 1654/02.\n\nWHEREAS, accordingly, the economic-financial situation needs to be adjusted with a view to achieving equilibrium at acceptable occupancy rates for said services.\n\nWHEREAS, given the complexity inherent in the determination of air transportation costs, the fact that such costs are dependent upon international and local variables, and the fact that they have considerable weight in the definition of a satisfactory adjustment procedure that can continue to be applied over time, external technical assistance has been sought to determine the remunerative fares for Argentina\u2019s commercial air transportation market.\n\nWHEREAS, accordingly, until such time as that lias been achieved, the applicable increase is to be supplemented with the scheme established by Decree No. 1012/06, Section 3, which scheme shall be deemed to be supplementary and applied towards future fares, entirely in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of the aforementioned Decree.\n\nWHEREAS, in accordance with Annex I, Section 6(a) - AIR FARES FOR DOMESTIC TRANSPORTATION of Resolution No. 1532, issued on November 27, 1998 by the MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND PUBLIC WORKS AND SERVICES, the fares applicable to any type of commercial air transportation of passengers are the ones notified by the carrier to the relevant authorities and/or approved by the latter, as published and in force as of the issue of the air carriage contract.\n\nWHEREAS, considering the above, the commercial airlines shall submit for approval the air fares to be applied to such differential intermediate or business class services as they may offer for regular domestic flights, and the Enforcing Authority shall reserve the right to define the regulatory aspects that are to apply at the time of assessing said fares for approval.\n\nWHEREAS, for such purpose, in its capacity as the Enforcing Authority for Decree No. 1012/06, this OFFICE OF TRANSPORTATION shall use international custom and usage and the rules set by the INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION (IATA) as reference.\n\n\u2026\n\n**Section 1.** The operators of regular domestic air passenger transportation services are hereby authorized to apply, effective at 00:00 on the day following the day of publication of this Resolution, the economy-class fares in the fare brackets between the reference rate and the maximum fare for each of the points of origination-destination described in Annex I, which is an integral part hereof.\n\nThe increase provided for in the preceding paragraph shall be supplemented with the scheme established by Decree No. 1012/06, Section 3 and shall apply on account of such fare as may be established, as a result of bringing it in line with the provisions of Law No. 19,030, Section 42.\n\n\u2026\n\nSection 2. Commercial airlines shall submit for approval by this OFFICE OF TRANSPORTATION the air fares to be applied to such differential intermediate or business class services as they may offer for regular domestic flights, and this authority shall reserve the right to define the conditions that will apply to services of this sort.381\n\nC-181/RA-341: Resolution No. 257/2008. It appears common ground that the airfare increase granted was in the approximate amount of 18%. The same is true with respect to Resolution No. 315/2008 dated May 16, 2008: C-182/RA-342.\n\nC-181 (English translation)/RA-341.\n\n420.\n\nIt appears that the first time a distinction was made between economy and business class in legislation relating to airfares was in Resolution No. 257/2008. After Resolution No. 257/2008 subsequent resolutions all made the same distinction and adopted the same language as used in the Resolution.382 There is a dispute between the Parties as to whether Resolution No. 257/2008 deregulated airfares for business class such that these fares were no longer subject to the airfare caps as of the date of the Resolution or whether, according to Respondent, the regulation of tariffs only ever applied to economy-class fares.383\n\n*See* Cl.

Later, in May 2008, Mr. Gutierrez introduced Mr. Lopez Mena, a successful Argentine-Uruguayan entrepreneur, as an interested purchaser.385\n\nPascual Arias WS \u00b6 69. According to Mr. Pascual Arias, Mr. Gutierrez informed him that he had been asked by the Government of Argentina (Mr. and Mrs. Kirchner) to mediate between the Airlines and the government in order to achieve the entry of Argentinian shareholders into ARSA and the increase in the share capital held by Argentina.\n\nPascual Arias WS \u00b6 74; Cl. Mem. \u00b6 238. Mr. Lopez Mena is an Argentine-Uruguayan national with substantial investments in Argentina, including the main ferry company operating between Argentina and Uruguay, Buquebus. *See also* C-177; C-373.\n\n422.\n\nIn the meantime, the financial condition of the Airlines had continued to worsen. On April 29, 2008, the Airlines wrote to the Secretary of Transport, Mr. Jaime to request urgent measures to ensure the continuity of flight services by the Airlines. That letter reads in relevant part as follows:\n\nThe purpose of this letter is to make the Secretary of Transportation aware of the circumstances that have prejudiced the Company and could lead to a standstill of operations, resulting from noncompliance with the provisions of Executive Orders No. 1654/2002 and 1012/2006 that declared a state of emergency for commercial air transport in Argentina.\n\nIn 2007, though with partial reductions in flight frequencies, Argentine Airlines\u2019 operations covered the whole of the country. However, as shown by studies conducted by your Office and recent Resolution 257/2008, we are operating many of our routes at a loss. Of course, there are no other airlines providing flight services on loss-making routes.\n\nSo far in 2008, the price of fuel lias increased in excess of 40%, deteriorating even more ARSA\u2019s income vs. cost ratio. In spite of that, the Argentine Airlines continued providing regular services throughout the country.\n\nPlease find below a more detailed description of the events that have been affecting us in the last few months, which we request to be urgently attended to in order to prevent further deterioration.\n\nAlso, we need an urgent solution to the problems we are having with YPF to supply the fuel needed for our aircraft, since we are not receiving the funds committed to us.\n\nFailure to approve the Set of Measures requested before, that were to be implemented last January 1 but became gradually delayed as time went on, resulted in Aerolineas Argentina showing a loss in excess of USD 100,000,000 in net income and expenses during the first quarter of 2008,\n\nAfter the issue of Resolution 257/08 last April 14, no progress was made in establishing an average reference price for domestic fuel. If a price similar to that of August 2006 had been fixed in the first quarter of this year, our cost of fuel would have been reduced by an amount slightly over USD 30,000,000,\n\nFurthermore, there lias been no rise in air fares truly reflecting the rise in costs since August 2006, the date of the last increase. Although the Office of the Secretary of Transportation recognized a 70% gap between them, no more than an initial 18% increase was granted, far from the minimum 33% planned under the Set of Measures. It should be taken into account that the company\u2019s traffic demand rose to a peak between January 1 and April 14 this year, for which reason income lost on a monthly basis is fairly higher than the annual average.\n\nShould the 33% increase had been approved last January 1, the company would have made, approximately, USD 45,000,000 more than it billed for the period.\n\nAerolineas Argentinas and Austral would have had USD 17,000,000 more at their disposal if laws on VAT exemption for fuel, insurance and aircraft leasing had become effective last January 1. as provided for in Executive Order 1012/06 of August 2006.\n\nFailure to update the Aviation Fuel Subsidy Scheme for destinations where the airfare is below the cost per kilometer resulted in the company not receiving USD 10,000,000 in additional subsidies during the first quarter of 2008.\n\nFrom the USD 50,000,000 loan agreed upon with Banco de la Nacion Argentina there are still USD 18,000,000 pending disbursement. We request the Secretary to take action so that the balance is disbursed as soon as possible.\n\nSo far we have described the USD 102,000,000 shortfall in the first quarter of this year. If the provisions of Executive Order 1012/2006 had been applied since it was issued, that is to say, since September 2006 through April 2008, the relevant figures would range between USD 390,000,000 and USD 450,000,000, depending on the minimum prices (ARS 2.28 or 1.85 set per liter of aviation fuel. The Secretary [of State] surely understands that, without that money, the project of both the workers and the shareholders of Aerolineas Argentinas and Austral is not feasible.\n\nIn view of the above, I emphasize the urgency of dealing with the matters affecting the Aerolineas Argentinas Group, which require vour support and urgent attention. Lack of action shall, against our will, have an immediate impact on air connections within Argentina, that is to sav. flights to certain destinations will be suspended, and on the chain of payments of the domestic air industry. That, because of the lack of measures to provide an economic basis for the normal operation of the company, as acknowledged in Executive Orders 1654/2002 and 1012/2006, and, more recently. Resolution 25 7/20 08.386 [Emphasis in original]\n\nC-79. The translation quoted was submitted with the Spanish original of C-79. The previous month, the Airlines had informed the Secretary of Transport that if no airfare increase was granted, they would have to stop serving certain unprofitable routes: C-371: ARSA\u2019s letterto Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Jaime, dated March 26, 2008. *See also* C-69: ARSA\u2019s 2008 financial statements; C-70: AUSA 2008 financial statements.\n\n423.\n\nIn May 2008, Mr. Lopez Mena agreed with Mr. Pascual Arias as representative of the Air Comet - Interinvest Group to enter into due diligence regarding both ARSA and AUSA.387\n\n*See* C-312: letter from Mr. Lopez Mena to Mr. Pascual Arias, dated May 7, 2008; C-175: letter from Mr. Pascual Arias to Mr. Lopez Mena, dated May 8, 2008.\n\n424.\n\nOn May 15, 2008, the Government of Argentina and the shareholders of the Air Comet/Interinvest Group and the Airlines signed a framework agreement *(Acuerdo marco)* relating to the viability of the Airlines and the allocation of their capital stock (the \"May 2008 Agreement\"). The May 2008 Agreement reads in relevant part as follows:\n\nThe first party acts for and on behalf of the Office of the Secretary of State for Transport of the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services of Argentina, and of the Ministry of Economy, respectively (hereinafter, the \"Argentine State\").\n\nThe second party acts for and on behalf of Air Comet S.A. and Interinvest, both companies being representatives of the majority shareholders of Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. and Austral Lineas Aereas - Cielos del Sur S.A. (hereinafter, the \"Shareholders\").\n\nBoth parties acknowledge each other\u2019s full legal capacity to assume the undertakings set forth in this Master Agreement\".\n\n**WHEREAS**\n\n**ONE:** The Shareholders and the Argentine State are aware of the serious situation confronting Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. (hereinafter, \"AEROLINEAS\") and Austral Lineas Aereas - Cielos del Sur S.A. (hereinafter, \"AUSTRAL\"), and wish both of them a future committed to providing better quality and more efficient services to the Argentine market, for the benefit of the employees of both AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL.\n\n**TWO:** The Shareholders and the Argentine State are aware that, in order to make AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL viable, it is essential that both companies reach the stability necessary to provide a safe, reasonable operation of the services for the benefit of the passengers and the Argentine air traffic. It is necessary to establish social and labor conditions for the different categories and, particularly, for the group of pilots, similar to those applied by world leading airlines, so that the Aerolineas Argentinas Group is able to compete in the global aviation market.\n\n**THREE:** The Shareholders and the Argentine State are aware of the difficulties faced by AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL, and believe that a new allocation of the capital stock and the enforcement of measures intended to streamline transportation costs and taxes, as contemplated in this Master Agreement, could bring about a solution to those difficulties.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, in order to fulfill the above purposes, the Shareholders and the Argentine State, acting willingly and in good faith hereunder, agree to perform the Following\n\n**TERMS AND CONDITIONS:**\n\n**ONE: Reallocation of the Capital Stock of AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL.**\n\n1.1. AEROLINEAS\n\nThe Shareholders and the Argentine State undertake to take all such steps as may be necessary to reallocate the shares, for the primary purpose of reaching the necessary stability to make AEROLINEAS viable. For that purpose, the reallocation of shares mutually agreed by the parties shall be as follows:\n\n\u2022 The Argentine State will increase its direct interest from the current 5% to a minimum 20% of the capital stock of AEROLINEAS; the employees may hold a maximum 10% of the capital stock. The Argentine State may modify these percentage interests in order to admit interested Provinces as new shareholders.\n\n\u2022 The private sector shall hold 70% of the capital stock of AEROLINEAS through an intermediary Argentine company in which the Shareholders will directly or indirectly hold 48% of the capital stock, and a local group made up of various Argentine private companies will hold the remaining 52%.\n\n\u2022 To fix the price to be paid for the increase in the public sector\u2019s interest and in the Argentine private company\u2019s interest in the capital stock of AEROLINEAS, the average of the appraisals conducted by three consulting firms with expertise in international quality appraisals selected by the Shareholders with the approval of the Argentine State shall be used, and the consulting firms will be provided updated information and a projection for the next FIVE (5) years.\n\nOnce the capital is structured as indicated herein and simultaneously with the implementation of that structure, the Shareholders shall have the option to sell, which the Argentine State and the remaining direct or indirect holders of the AEROLINEAS\u2019 capital stock shall accept, the 48% of the capital stock directly or indirectly held by them in the intermediary company that directly holds 70% of the AEROLINEAS\u2019 capital stock, to be exercised within a term of THREE (3) years as from the date of execution of the transaction that will determine the new capital structure of AEROLINEAS as agreed herein, at the minimum price to be determined at the time of execution of the transaction agreed herein.\n\n1.2 AUSTRAL\n\nPrior to the execution of the transaction agreed upon in paragraph 1.1 hereof, the Shareholders and the Argentine State undertake that AEROLINEAS shall purchase 100% of AUSTRAL\u2019s capital stock from its current owners, at a price to be determined by the average of the appraisals conducted by three first rate, internationally recognized entities specializing in the purchase and/or appraisal of international companies in this industry, selected by the Shareholders with the approval of the Argentine State, which are PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and Morgan Stanley.\n\nAEROLINEAS shall provide the private and public funding required for undertaking all of the transactions contemplated in this Master Agreement for the purchase of AUSTRAL, pro rata the percentage interest proposed for each of the Parties. If applicable, the Central Bank of Argentina will be requested to consider the possibility that 30% of the funding coming from abroad be exempted from the deposit obligation.\n\nIt is of the essence of this Master Agreement that the proceeds from the agreed upon transactions be allowed to be remitted abroad, in accordance with the legislation applicable as of the date hereof, without any exception or additional limitation or restriction.\n\nPayment in full of the undertaking between the Argentine State and the Shareholders in this paragraph 1.2 shall be a condition for carrying out the agreement described in paragraph 1.1 hereof.\n\n**TWO: Viability Measures for AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL.**\n\nIn addition to the agreements described in Clause One above, the Shareholders and the Argentine State undertake to promote such action and formalities as are required to improve the economic viability of AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL, as specified below:\n\n2.1 To grant an 18% increase in the prevailing price range of the domestic flights market.\n\n2.2 To establish that commercial air transportation companies shall pay a maximum fuel price of 1.85 Argentine Pesos per liter.\n\n2.3 To implement a policy of routes and frequencies to regulate new entrants to this market. To optimize and improve the quantity and quality of the domestic network, the Aerolineas Argentinas Group shall meet the needs established for the next TEN (10) years on an exclusive basis.\n\n2.4 To promote distribution and feeding traffic through the major hubs (Center, South and North) of the country.\n\n2.5 To exempt operators from value added tax levied on fuel, aircraft leasing, insurance and purchase of spare parts.\n\n2.6 To make the technical balance of value added tax freely available for use.\n\n2.7 To exempt operators from income tax on Foreign Beneficiaries for the leasing of aircraft and payment of ticket reservation services. Exemption from minimum presumed income tax.\n\n2.8 To request Provincial Governments to exempt the international transportation industry from the tax on gross income.\n\n2.9 To establish an international commercial air transportation policy that allocates routes to the Aerolineas Argentinas Group as the flag carrier airline, and try to balance services abroad so that Argentina can play the role to which it aspires.\n\n2.10 To renew the fleet and grant fiscal facilities for that purpose on a case-by-case basis.\n\n2.11 To resolve the problem of AEROLINEAS\u2019 cumulative indebtedness.\n\nGiven that the above listed measures require, as the case may be, to be enacted by law, the Argentine State and the Shareholders undertake to make their best efforts to expedite them and allow for the full performance of the covenants contained in this Master Agreement.\n\n**THREE: Simultaneous and Interdependent Undertakings between the Shareholders and the Argentine State.**\n\n3.1 The Shareholders and the Argentine State hereby execute this mandatory Master Agreement as an expression of their commitment to behave with the utmost good faith to make the future of AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL viable, in support of the market and tourism development in Argentina, and for the benefit of the staff of AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL.\n\n3.2 Compliance with the commitments of the Shareholders and the Argentine State shall be simultaneous and interdependent, in the understanding that a chronological order will be followed, so that the transaction contemplated in paragraph 1.2 of Clause ONE shall be carried out prior to the transaction contemplated in paragraph 1.1 thereof, although it is of the essence that the action contemplated in Section TWO be taken simultaneously for the full performance of this Master Agreement.\n\n**FOUR: Negotiation of this Master Agreement.**\n\nThe Shareholders and the Argentine State represent that the covenants contained herein may not be conditioned or substantially changed, nor deferred in time due to circumstances which were not, nor cannot be, negotiated or agreed upon by both Parties.\n\n**FIVE: Applicable Law and Jurisdiction.**\n\nThe Shareholders and the Argentine State, in its capacity as shareholder, agree that any dispute or conflicting interpretation shall be governed by the private civil law of Argentina and be subject to the rules of international arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\") based in Paris, and both undertake to comply with and perform the arbitration award.\n\nThe arbitration procedure shall be conducted by three (3) arbitrators, in Spanish, to facilitate understanding by the Parties.\n\nIn witness whereof, this Master Agreement is signed ad referendum by Julio Miguel DE VIDO, Minister of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services, in two counterparts, in the City of Buenos Aires on the date first above written.388\n\nC-180. Mr. Lopez Mena attended the signing ceremony for the May 2008 Agreement: C-176.\n\n425.\n\nPursuant to Article 1.2 of the May 2008 Agreement, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and Morgan Stanley provided the appraisals of 100% of AUSA\u2019s capital stock. The valuations conducted averaged USD 392 million for 100% AUSA\u2019s stock.389\n\n*See* C-375: Deloitte\u2019s May 2008 Valuation; C-376: Morgan Stanley\u2019s May 2008 Valuation; C-377: PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 May 2008 Valuation. The results of the valuations were as follows:  \n 1. Deloitte\u2019s DCF valuation of AUSA resulted in an equity value of USD 476 million.  \n 2. Morgan Stanley\u2019s May 2008 valuation of AUSA resulted in an equity value between USD 450 and USD 550 million based on a DCF valuation (which ranged between USD 611 and USD 737 million) and a multiples valuation which ranged between USD 237 and USD 692 million.  \n 3. PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 valuations of AUSA resulted in an equity value of between USD 303 and USD 381 million using a DCF methodology and USD 130 and USD 369 million using a multiples valuation.  \n There is a dispute between the Parties regarding the nature of the valuations performed.\n\n426.\n\nThe new corporate structure envisaged by the May 2008 Agreement was as follows:390\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 242.\n\n427.\n\nAs described above, in April 2008, the Secretary of Transportation had issued Resolution ST No. 257/08 by which it granted an 18% increase in airfares.391 In addition, after the May 2008 Agreement was signed and as contemplated by Article 2.1 of that agreement, the government granted a second airfare increase of 18% by way of Resolution ST No. 315/08.392\n\nC-181.\n\n*See* C-182.\n\n428.\n\nMr. Lopez Mena did not proceed with the investment to purchase a controlling share in ARSA\u2019s new holding company under the structure established in the May 2008 Agreement. Accordingly, the transaction envisaged in the May 2008 Agreement failed.393\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 250-251; Cl. Reply \u00b6 283. Claimants suggest that the reason Mr. Lopez Mena did not proceed to invest as foreseen was his concern that the Government of Argentina would not proceed with its various commitments under the May 2008 Agreement. *See* Cl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 281-283; C-183: La Nacion, May 9, 2008, *Lopez Mena Pide One Se Le Garanticen Subsidiosv Tarifas.* Respondent maintains that Mr. Lopez Mena did not make any commitment to proceed with the investment under discussion and decided not to proceed because he had not received enough information from the Marsans Group. *See* Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 458-464; C-312; RA-555.\n\n429.\n\nFollowing the failure of the May 2008 Agreement, a number of meetings and negotiations between representatives of Interinvest and the Government of Argentina took place regarding the sale of the Airlines to the government. Negotiations were tense and difficult. The Spanish Ambassador to Argentina and embassy assisted Claimants and it appears that the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs interceded on behalf of Claimants.394\n\n*See* C-184-C-189. *See also* Munoz Perez WS1 \u00b6\u00b6 13-15; Munoz Perez WS2 \u00b6 55; Transcript pp. 452-457; Llorens WS2 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n\n430.\n\nAt the same time, the financial condition of the Airlines continued to deteriorate. It appears that there was some concern that the Airlines would be unable to meet their payroll and social security contributions. As a result, a number of the unions who represented the employees of the Airlines made a submission in the insolvency proceedings of ARSA (which had been commenced in 2001 and had not yet been concluded) advising of the difficult economic and operational circumstances of ARSA and requesting measures to ensure that sums owing to the employees would be paid.395 This led to an agreement between the Ministry of Labor and the Secretary of Transportation and various unions pursuant to which the latter agreed to ensure continuing service for a period of 60 days.396 On July 11, 2008, the Ministry of Federal Planning, the Ministry of Labor and the Secretary of Transportation also made a submission in ARSA\u2019s insolvency proceedings requesting various interim measures.397\n\nRA-459: Decision of July 18, 2008 by the court overseeing the insolvency proceedings, p. 1.\n\nLlorens WS3 \u00b6 17; RL-06; Resp.

On June 19, 2008, the Secretary of Transportation entered into an agreement with YPF, Shell and Esso pursuant to which they would supply jet fuel at the subsidized price of ARS 1.85 per liter for all airlines providing domestic passenger air transport.398 The agreement set out the volume of jet fuel to be supplied and provided that Government of Argentina would pay the supply companies the difference between the subsidized price and the current price of jet fuel.\n\nRA-375.\n\n432.\n\nOn July 10, 14 and 31, 2008, the Secretary of Transportation adopted resolutions providing for the payment of various sums to the Airlines in order to pay wages and operating expenses to maintain the operations of the Airlines.399\n\nRA-556: Resolution No. ST471; RA-557: Resolution No. ST500; RA-558: Resolution No. ST521; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 471; Llorens WS3 \u00b6 28. In the resolutions, the Secretary of Transportation identified the alleged deficient management by Grupo Marsans as the cause of the financial situation of the Airlines. In the resolutions, the Secretary of Transportation stated that the financial and operational circumstances of the Airlines had been communicated and confirmed to the Secretariat by the members of the Board of Directors of ARSA appointed by Argentina. In total, the three resolutions provided for the transfer of ARS 201,000,000. On July 4, 2008, Air Comet transferred USD 1.5 million to ARSA: C-601.\n\n433.\n\nThe ongoing negotiations between representatives of Interinvest and representatives of the Government eventually led to the signature of an agreement between the Government of Argentina and Interinvest on July 17, 2008 (the \"July 2008 Agreement\").400 In addition, a list of noncontractual arrangements *(Listcido de Acuerdos Extracontractuciles,* the \"Side Agreement\") was attached to the July 2008 Agreement.401\n\nC-190. The July 2008 Agreement was signed by Secretary Jaime on behalf of Respondent and by a representative of the \"Interinvest S.A. Group\".\n\nC-190, p. 5. It appears that the Side Agreement was signed on July 16.2008. There is a dispute between the Parties regarding the status of the Side Agreement. Respondent says that the Side Agreement, submitted by Claimants as C-190, did not form an integral part of the July 2008 Agreement signed by it. It says that although Claimants maintain that the alleged Side Agreement was signed by Mr. Gutierrez as the State\u2019s representative, Mr. Gutierrez was not and had never been an officer of the Government of Argentina and could not act on its behalf: *see* Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 474-475; Llorens WS4 \u2018 22. Respondent says that the July 2008 Agreement consists only of what it submitted as RA-559.  \nClaimants, on the other hand, say that the Government's representatives agreed with their representatives to the Side Agreement during the course of negotiating the July 2008 Agreement. They say that the Side Agreement was signed by Respondent and Claimants\u2019 representatives on July 16, 2008. They maintain that the rest of the July 2008 Agreement was signed the following day, July 17, 2008: Cl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 255-258; Pascual Arias WS \u00b6 81; Cl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 297-298 where Claimants say that the Side Agreement was signed by Respondent\u2019s agent, Mr. Enrique Gutierrez. Claimants maintain that Mr. Gutierrez acted as Respondent\u2019s *de facto* representative in both the May 2008 and July 2008 Agreements.  \n The Tribunal notes that RA-559 submitted by Respondent attaches a copy of the Side Agreement. The copy of the Side Agreement bears only two signatures or initials, whereas the July 2008 Agreement bears five signatures and appears to have been initialled on all of its pages.\n\n434.\n\nThe July 2008 Agreement was formally ratified on July 21, 2008.402\n\nC-190. It appears that the ratification was by Argentina\u2019s Minister of Federal Planning, Mr. De Vido; Spain\u2019s Ambassador to Argentina, Mr. Estrella and Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias.\n\n435.\n\nThe July 2008 Agreement reads in material part as follows:\n\nWHEREAS, the Parties are aware of the serious situation that, as is publicly and widely known, AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL find themselves in, and their wish is for both airlines to have a future providing the most-efficient, best quality service to the Argentine market, also for the sake of the employees of both AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL.\n\nWHEREAS, [INTERINVEST] intends to sell its entire stock interests in AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL, as it hereby expressly represents.\n\nWHEREAS, given its obligation to guarantee the provision of the air transportation services, the STATE OF ARGENTINA intends to purchase the entire stock interests held by [INTERINVEST] in both airlines, as it hereby expressly represents.\n\nWHEREAS, the Parties have agreed on a period of SIXTY (60) days as from the execution hereof to take all corporate and statutory steps required to formalize the purchase and sale transaction; during said period, approval shall be obtained at the relevant stockholders\u2019 meetings and the STATE OF ARGENTINA shall put in motion all legal steps required for such purpose. The 60-day period until the date of actual transfer of the stock shall be hereinafter referred to as the \"Transition Period.\"\n\n**NOW, THEREFORE, THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:**\n\n**ARTICLE** 1: [INTERINVEST] shall provide the STATE OF ARGENTINA with all documents required to formalize the transfers provided for in this agreement.\n\n**ARTICLE 2:** The STATE OF ARGENTINA shall take all steps legally required for the purchase of [INTERINVEST]\u2019s entire stockholding in AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL.\n\n**ARTICLE 3:** The Parties hereby agree to set up a TRANSITION BOARD to be in charge of managing the operations of AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL throughout the Transition Period. The Board shall be made up of two (2) representatives of the STATE OF ARGENTINA and two (2) representatives of [INTERINVEST], The STATE OF ARGENTINA shall appoint the General Manager of AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL for the 60-day Transition Period, and [INTERINVEST] hereby agrees to accept such appointment; said General Manager shall be in charge of monitoring the airlines\u2019 operations and of their daily management on the express instructions of the TRANSITION BOARD.\n\nThe TRANSITION BOARD shall manage AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL during the 60-day Transition Period up to the stock transfer; it shall take such actions as may be necessary for the timely and adequate performance of Article 4 hereof.\n\n**ARTICLE 4:** In order to perfect the purchase and sale of the stock that is the subject-matter of this Agreement, the Parties shall have a period of sixty (60) days to secure:\n\n(a) The legal and corporate instruments required to formalize the sale of the stock to the STATE OF ARGENTINA;\n\n(b) An itemized report on the condition of all material assets of AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL, stating the operating condition of the assets and the services required for the operation of property and equipment, in general, assets located in Argentina and abroad, aircraft, engines, motor vehicles, inventory, and other assets.\n\n(c) An itemized report on the status of contracts and purchase orders in place at AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL.\n\n(d) Reports on and status of bankruptcy claims and post-bankruptcy claims due and payable, enforceable against AEROLINEAS, and of AUSTRAL\u2019s liabilities.\n\n(e) Reports on and status of labor contracts and administrative structure.\n\n(f) Reports on and status of concessions, authorizations and guarantees in place.\n\n(g) Such other necessary information, sufficient to assess the value of AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL, as the STATE OF ARGENTINA may require.\n\n**ARTICLE 5:** In the 60-day Transition Period, the Parties shall prepare an income statement and balance sheet of AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL as of July 17, 2008, which is the date on which the TRANSITION BOARD will come into operation. The purpose of this shall be to preserve the rights and interests of the STATE OF ARGENTINA, stockholders, directors, managers and employees, creditors and customers of ARGENTINA and AUSTRAL.\n\nOnce the income statements have been prepared and audited, within the aforementioned 60-day period and pursuant to the applicable standards and regulations, the Parties shall review and approve: (i) the financial and management statements of AEROLINEAS as of December 31, 2007; and (ii) the special-purpose financial statements and management statements of AEROLINEAS as of July 17, 2008.\n\nAs regards AUSTRAL, the Parties shall review the financial statements as of the dates stated in (i) and (ii) above.\n\nSaid financial statements shall be approved by the stockholders of AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL via the relevant statutory procedures.\n\n**ARTICLE 6:** The prices for the purchase of the stock interests in AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL shall be determined as follows:\n\n(i) The purchase price for AUSTRAL\u2019s stock interest shall be determined based on the valuation provided by a valuation entity to be appointed therefor by [INTERINVEST] and the valuation to be performed at the request of the STATE OF ARGENTINA.\n\n(ii) The purchase price for AEROLINEAS\u2019 stock interest shall be determined based on the valuation provided by a valuation entity to be appointed therefor by [INTERINVEST] and the valuation to be performed at the request of the STATE OF ARGENTINA.\n\nThe STATE OF ARGENTINA shall seek the abovementioned valuations from the Appraisal Board, which agency shall assess the value of the airlines as a whole.\n\nShould the valuations thus performed yield different results and/or if an agreement cannot be otherwise reached as to the price of the two stock interests, a third valuation shall be sought from an impartial local or foreign entity of international renown specialized in the purchase and sale and/or valuation of international airlines; the valuation thus obtained shall be final and definitive as between the Parties.\n\nThe valuation shall be performed using the discounted cash flow method. Such future cash flows shall be calculated using the following assumptions: (i) the cost of fuel at its current subsidized value of D 1.85 (one Argentine peso and eighty-five cents) per liter plus VAT; said price is to be changed using reference prices and proportionately to price variations in the market; and (ii) the current fare for domestic flights, modified proportionately to any changes projected for all other costs.\n\nPayment of the purchase prices for the stock of AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL referred to in this Agreement shall be effected upon transfer of the stock, via a bank transfer of freely and readily available funds into such foreign accounts as [INTERINVEST] shall indicate in writing prior to the date of payment.\n\nArbitration shall be conducted in Spanish for easier understanding by both Parties.\n\nIn witness whereof, subject to subsequent approval by Mr. Julio Miguel DE VIDO, Minister of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services, and Messrs. Gerardo Diaz Ferran and Gonzalo Pascual, in their capacity as majority stockholders of Aerolineas Argentinas, S.A. and Austral Lineas Aereas - Cielos del Sur, S.A., this Memorandum of Agreement has been executed in two original counterparts constituting one and the same agreement, in the city of Buenos Aires, on Monday, July 21, 2008.403\n\nC-190 (emphasis added).\n\n436.\n\nThe Side Agreement provided as follows:\n\nLIST OF NON-CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS\n\n(i) Stay of all court actions. Immediate\n\n(ii) Upon the signing of the agreement, all court actions will be dropped.\n\n(iii) Signing of the Agreement: On Monday 21, before the ambassador to Spain (who will also be signing), the Argentine Minister, and the executing parties.\n\n(iv) Oral agreement that there will no political, media or court persecution and that upon the execution of all final documents, the broadest statutory guarantees will be given.\n\n437.\n\nOn July 18, 2008, the court hearing the applications of the unions and the Government reviewed the difficult circumstances faced by the Airlines, including the number of operational aircraft, the significant liabilities of the Airlines and the fact that the Secretary of Transportation had adopted measures to pay wages owing for the month of June as well as critical operational expenses. The judge noted that the original agreement with ARSA\u2019s creditors had been performed and practically concluded and had been approved (homologated). Accordingly, ARSA\u2019s remaining obligation was to fully complete the approved agreement with creditors. In these circumstances, the judge appears to have concluded that his remaining jurisdiction did not include the various protective measures recently requested by the unions and Government of Argentina, particularly where Government of Argentina had exercised its authority to ensure the ongoing operation of the Airlines by way of its relevant entities.404\n\nRA-459: Decision of July 18, 2008, pp. 5-6. The judge went on to note the seriousness of ARSA\u2019s situation and that he had found that ARSA had not been as diligent as he would have expected with respect to its obligation to collaborate and provide information to the court until the conclusion of its bankruptcy proceedings: *see* RA-459, pp. 6-8. As a result, the court required ARSA to provide information, including its plan to re-establish normal operations within 10 days.\n\n438.\n\nOn July 24, 2008, the Government of Argentina submitted the July 2008 Agreement for approval by the Argentine Congress. This was done by way of a bill for the \"repossession\" *(fresccite\")* of the Airlines by the purchase of their shares. The bill was also accompanied by a Presidential message.405\n\nEx. 12 to Munoz Perez WS2: President\u2019s letter of submittal, dated July 24, 2008.\n\n439.\n\nOn July 29, 2008, Interinvest wrote to Argentina's Minister of Federal Planning, Mr. De Vido to complain about a number of statements made in the Presidential message which, according to Interinvest, were unnecessary, inaccurate and in breach of the Agreement reached on July 21, 2008 to avoid unjustified accusations.406\n\nC-197. The letter was copied to the Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Jaime, the Spanish Ambassador to Argentina and the Spanish Minister of Industry, Tourism and Commerce.\n\n440.\n\nOn August 6, 2008, Secretary Jaime appeared before the Argentine National Congress during the debate of the Repossession Bill.407\n\n*See* C-196: transcript of Secretary Jaime\u2019s Statement before the National Congress, August 6, 2008. In his appearance before Congress, Secretary Jaime stated, *inter alia,* the following:  \n My opinion, or at least what we expressed, is that the National State through the relevant agencies must fix the price of the shares which is related to the assets and liabilities of both companies. The business group presents its valuation on both companies. Obviously if there is no agreement, we will elevate the matter to Congress for its consideration. The Executive Power and the company have recourse to a third valuation, which will be presented to Congress for its approval.  \n That is to say, the final valuation which is done by the third company, (p. 42 of 49)  \n \u2026  \n I repeat that the methodology is that the National State determines the value through the relevant agencies. I clarify that as the National State there is no other way of determining value. Of course we can permit the company which wishes to sell to determine the value. And finally, if there is no coincidence nor agreement, there would be recourse to a third valuation by international entities. Surely we would look at entities such as, for example, the Organization for International Civil Aviation - OACI. But that would be determined in the case that there was no coincidence, (p. 43 of 49) [Tribunal\u2019s translation]\n\n441.\n\nOn September 1, 2008, Mr. Munoz Perez appeared before the Argentine Senate to address the purchase and sale of the Airlines and questions regarding the management of the Airlines.408\n\nC-l 104. In his comments, Mr. Munoz Perez stated, *inter alia,* that Interinvest had agreed to sell the Airlines since it was impossible to continue managing the companies in the face of the permanent situation harassment by the trade union leadership, whose agenda was for Marsans to leave the country, and the absence of an adequate State Aero-commercial Policy. *See* C-l 104, p. 2.\n\n442.\n\nOn September 18, 2008, the Argentine Congress enacted Law 26,412 which approved the \"repossession\" *(rescate)* of the Airlines (and their subsidiaries, Optar S.A., Jet Paq S.A. and Aerohandling S.A.) by way of a purchase of their shares. The Law provided that compensation would be calculated by the *Tribunal de Tasaciones de la Nacion* (\"TTN\"). Law 26,412 provided in relevant part as follows:\n\n**SECTION 1** - In order to guarantee the public service of commercial air transport for passengers, mail and cargo, the Argentine State shall redeem the shares in Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. and Austral Lineas Aereas - Cielos del Sur S.A, and any other company owned by them (Optar S.A., Jet Paq S.A., Aerohandling S.A.), by purchasing their capital stock.\n\n**SECTION 2 -** The National Valuation Office shall assess the companies Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. and Austral Lineas Aereas - Cielos del Sur S.A, pursuant to Section 1 hereof. Valuations will be carried out taking into consideration the values prevailing as of July 1, 2008. The Joint Committee of the House and the Senate for State Reform and Privatization Follow Up created under Section 14 of Law 23,696, shall supervise valuations, ensuring that they take into account the companies\u2019 actual Shareholders\u2019 Equity and that they are in keeping with the technical criteria governing the activities that those companies are engaged in.\n\n**SECTION 3** - The price determined shall be submitted to the Honourable Argentine Congress for approval.\n\n**SECTION 4** - The assignment is hereby authorized of up to TEN PER CENT (10%) of the capital stock of the companies Aerolineas Argentinas Sociedad Anonima and Austral Lineas Aereas - Cielos del Sur Sociedad Anonima, to be respectively transferred to the staff of those companies pursuant to the Employee Stock Ownership Plan.\n\n**SECTION 5 -** The Executive Branch of the Federal Government may implement any and all mechanisms as may be necessary to provide for financial needs resulting from any operational shortfalls in the companies Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. and Austral Lineas Aereas - Cielos del Sur S.A. until December 31 (thirty first), 2008, shall make pertinent budget adjustments, and shall report such transfers to the Joint Committee of the House and the Senate for State Reform and Privatization Follow Up.\n\n**SECTION 6 -** The financial aid amounts, whether granted or to be granted by the Executive Branch of the Federal Government in compliance with the above Section, shall be taken a capital contributions and/or credits owed to the Argentine State, and the relevant budget adjustments shall be made.\n\n**SECTION 7 -** The Joint Committee of the House and the Senate for State Reform and Privatization Follow Up created under Section 14 of Law 23,696 shall exercise the duties set forth in the above law, to which effect it will be briefed about any actions taken.\n\n**SECTION 8** - For the purpose of ensuring transparency in procedures, thus facilitating the review, evaluation and supervision of the proper enforcement of this law, the Auditor General shall take such action as is necessary; reports may be requested by any other agency of the Argentine State.\n\n**SECTION 9** - The Argentine State shall in no case assign or waive its majority shareholding in the company, the power to take strategic action or the right to veto decisions.\n\n**SECTION 10 -** This Law is in the public interest and shall become effective on the date of its publication in the Official Bulletin.\n\n**SECTION 11 -** This Law is to be forwarded to the Executive Branch of the Federal Government.409\n\nThe law made no mention of the July 2008 Agreement nor of the valuation methodology provided for in that Agreement.\n\nC-388.\n\n443.\n\nOn September 19, 2008, Interinvest submitted detailed response to the letter of submittal of the bill to Congress.410\n\n*See* C-198 and Ex. 13 to Mr. Munoz Perez WS2 \u00b6 30.\n\n444.\n\nIn October 2008, valuations of the Airlines were prepared by Credit Suisse on behalf of Interinvest, and the TTN. Credit Suisse\u2019s aggregate valuations for the Airlines ranged between USD 330 and USD 540 million.411 The TTN\u2019s valuation concluded that the Airlines had a negative value of ARS 2,540,338.289 (approximately USD 832 million at the time).412\n\n*See* Credit Suisse valuation, dated October 12, 2008: C-201, p. 7. *See also,* letter from Interinvest to the Argentine Secretary of Transportation of October 14.2008, copied to Minister De Vido and the Spanish Minister of Industry and the Spanish Ambassador to Argentina: C-205.\n\n*See* C-204: the TTN\u2019s Valuation dated October 10, 2008. This valuation was on a \"substantive patrimonial value\" or asset value basis. In addition, the valuation report records that the TTN had also performed a valuation on a DCF basis which also yielded a negative value (ARS -1,897,854/USD -622,235,362). The TTN\u2019s alternative valuation was conducted making different assmnptions, including five years of cash flows and no terminal value for the Airlines. It also applied discount rates in pesos to cash flows in U.S. dollars and did not adjust airfares in proportion to cost increases. *See* Transcript pp. 683-687; Martin WS Ex. 19, pp. 1939-1940, 1945-1946, 1953. In his testimony before the Argentine Congress, Mr. Martin explained that the valuation conducted by the TTN was different from the one agreed in the July 2008 Agreement: *see* C-1092 pp. 58-65.  \n The TTN also confirmed its initial valuation of October 2008 in a supplementary report dated November 12, 2008. In that report, the TTN also responded to comments made by Interinvest in a letter dated October 23, 2008 (C-380). In January 2009, the TTN prepared a second valuation report for the expropriation process commenced pursuant to Law No. 26,466 (C-379). This valuation valued the Airlines at ARS 3,087,748.413 (USD 894,999,525).\n\n445.\n\nIt appears that the TTN and Credit Suisse met on a number of occasions with respect to the valuation of the Airlines.413\n\n*See* C-1092: the statement of Mr. Martin before the Argentine Congress on October 28, 2008, at p. 64.\n\n446.\n\nOn behalf of the Federal Ministry of Planning, Mr. Rafael Llorens raised a number of issues regarding the authorship and formal presentation of the Credit Suisse report and requested additional information which he said was required to adequately assess Credit Suisse\u2019s valuation.414\n\n*See, inter alia,* C-206: letters from Mr. Llorens dated October 23, 24, 28, 30 and November 7, 2008.\n\n447.\n\nOn October 29, 2008, Mr. Llorens, the Legal Sub-Secretary of the Ministry of Planning, and Mr. Martin, a member of the TTN, met with a representative of Interinvest and representatives of Credit Suisse from New York. During the course of their discussion, Credit Suisse\u2019s representative, Mr. Buenaventura, confirmed that he was a representative of Credit Suisse who authored the report and that, normally, Credit Suisse does not sign the reports it prepares. He also confirmed that the Credit Suisse report valued the two Airlines, adding that the report should not be considered an independent valuation, as it was based on financial information provided by management.415\n\n*See* C-208: minutes of the October 29, 2008 meeting.\n\n448.\n\nOn the same date, Interinvest wrote to Ministers De Vido and Jaime to complain about what it referred to as the government\u2019s formalistic requirements that Credit Suisse\u2019s valuation report had to be signed, accredited and notarized. Interinvest noted that it was customary practice for international valuation firms to identify their valuations by way of their letterhead without a formal signature or other formalities. Interinvest also responded to the government\u2019s suggestions that the additional information submitted with Credit Suisse\u2019s valuation was insufficient. Interinvest expressed the view that the supplementary documentation supplied was more voluminous than the details supplied with the TTN\u2019s valuation. In addition, the Interinvest representatives noted that despite the exchange of supplementary information, there had been no agreement on the transfer price for the shares in the Airlines. The letter went on to request the selection of a third-party valuator, pursuant to the terms of the July 2008 Agreement.416\n\nC-209.\n\n449.\n\nIn early November 2008, there were a number of exchanges between Interinvest and Mr. Llorens regarding the government\u2019s request that all documents and reports mentioned in Credit Suisse\u2019s valuation report and supplementary documents be produced to it. In his correspondence, Mr. Llorens stated that Interinvest had failed to produce information and documentation requested by him and listed a number of other questions and information he maintained were needed.417\n\nC-206: Mr. Llorens letter of November 7, 2008.\n\n450.\n\nIn its response of November 10, 2008, Interinvest stated that the formalities that had been requested by the Government had not been agreed and were not required pursuant to the terms of the July 2008 Agreement. Interinvest went on to state that it had produced the information and documentation requested of it although it had not been agreed or required to be produced. Interinvest also confirmed that it had provided to the government a signed and apostilled copy of the Credit Suisse valuation report.418 In response to the additional request for information, Interinvest stated that the period for discussions between the Parties of the price for the shares of the Airlines on the basis of the valuations exchanged had expired. It went on to request, on an urgent basis, an answer in which the government identified a third-party valuator for the purpose of valuing the Airlines pursuant to the terms of the July 2008 Agreement.419\n\nC-886; Llorens WS2 Ex. 24.\n\nC-886. In its letter, Interinvest also addressed a number of other issues raised by Mr. Llorens regarding access to information relating to the Airlines and the approval of the financial statements of the Airlines at July 17, 2008.\n\n451.\n\nOn November 12, 2008, Interinvest wrote to Secretary Jaime to request that the Transition Committee established in the July 2008 Agreement meet since, as of October 8, 2008, Argentina\u2019s representatives on the Transition Committee had not attended any of the committee\u2019s weekly meetings. As a result, the general manager appointed under the terms of the July 2008 Agreement (Mr. Julio Alak) was managing the Airlines without the guidance of the Transition Committee.420\n\nC-210. In addition, Interinvest again requested that Argentina provide a response to its request to appoint a third-party valuator. *See also* C-212, pp. 29-33: minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors of ARS A on November 19, 2008.\n\n452.\n\nOn November 21, 2008, Interinvest was served with a Notice of Preliminary Injunction obtained by the Government of Argentina. The Preliminary Injunction ordered that there should be no change in the membership of the Board of Directors of the Airlines nor in the role of Mr. Alak in his roles as a Director and the General Manager of the Airlines. In addition, a court officer was appointed to report to the court about the operation of the Airlines.421\n\nC-213.\n\n453.\n\nOn the same date, a draft bill of a law expropriating the shares of the Airlines was submitted to the Argentine Congress.422\n\nC-214. On the same date, an alternative bill proposing the expropriation of the assets of the Airlines was also submitted: C-1041.\n\n454.\n\nOn December 17, 2008, the Argentine Chamber of Deputies adopted Law 26,466 which authorized the expropriation of Interinvest\u2019s shares in the Airlines.423 Law 26,466 provided in relevant part (in Spanish) as follows:\n\n**ARTICLE** 1 \u2014 In compliance with Article 1 of Law No. 26,412, the shares of Aerolineas Argentinas Sociedad Anonima and Austral Lineas Aereas Cielos del Sur Sociedad Anonima, as well as those of Optar Sociedad Anonima, Jet Paq Sociedad Anonima and Aerohandling Sociedad Anonima as subsidiaries thereof, are hereby declared to be in public interest and subject to expropriation, pursuant to [Argentine] Law No. 21,499.\n\nThe shares held by the State and workers of such companies are exempted from the foregoing provision.\n\nThe expropriator in the terms of Law No. 21,499 shall be such body as the Argentine Executive Branch may appoint to such effect.\n\nThe [TTN] shall act as valuator, as provided by Article 13 of Law No. 21,499 for real property, and as the relevant technical office as provided by Law No. 21,626 (2001 consolidated text) for personal property.\n\n**ARTICLE 2 \u2014** In furtherance of the continuity and safety and the public service of commercial air transportation of passengers, mail and cargo; the maintenance of sources of employment; and the safeguard of the property owned by the companies mentioned in Article 1 hereof, in the terms of Articles 57 and 59 of Law No. 21,499, the Argentine Executive Branch, by means of such body as may be appointed thereby, shall exercise all such rights as the shares to be expropriated may confer thereupon as soon as this Law becomes effective.\n\n**ARTICLE 3 \u2014** In order to ensure the provision, extension and improvement of the services, the Argentine Executive Branch shall implement such mechanisms as may be necessary so as to meet the financial needs arising from the companies mentioned in Article 1 hereof, in accordance with Article 26 of Law No. 26,422 on the National Public Administration Budget.\n\nThe transactions and budgetary adjustments to be made to such effect shall be reported to the Congressional Bicameral Commission for State Reform and Privatization Follow-Up.\n\nFor the purpose of revamping and improvement of the services, within the term of one hundred and eighty (180) days, such body as may be appointed and composed on a federal basis shall formulate a medium and long-term General Business Plan that is both strategic and operational. Such Plan shall be reported to the Congressional Bicameral Commission mentioned supra.\n\nThe Plan shall have special regard for the needs of such regions of Argentina as may depend mainly on air transportation.\n\n**ARTICLE 4 \u2014** There being no agreement, the Office of the Public Prosecutor for the Argentine Treasury shall initiate such expropriation proceeding as may be applicable.\n\n**ARTICLE 5 \u2014** The assignment of the shares of stock to workers of Aerolineas Argentinas Sociedad Anonima and Austral Lineas Aereas Cielos del Sur Sociedad Anonima, as well as those of the subsidiaries thereof, up to ten percent (10%) of their blocks of shares, is hereby authorized, as per the Employee Stock Ownership Plan.\n\n**ARTICLE 6 \u2014** The Argentine Executive Branch shall implement all such mechanisms as the Law may provide in order to discriminate liabilities arising from the ordinary course of business of the companies mentioned in Article 1 hereof from those arising from fraudulent transactions or as a consequence of administrators\u2019 mismanagement.\n\nIn addition, it shall appear in all criminal cases in which such crimes as may have been committed by current majority shareholders, the administrators of such companies or even third parties to the detriment of the company\u2019s assets are being investigated; and shall report the wrongful acts of which it may learn on account of such management.\n\nFor the purpose of recovering such assets as may have been affected by the administrators\u2019 mismanagement, fault or negligence, it shall bring such civil and commercial actions as may be applicable.\n\n**ARTICLE** 7 \u2014 This Law is a public policy act and shall become effective on the date of publication thereof in the Official Gazette.\n\n*See;* RA-314; LEGC-08. The law was approved by the Senate on December 22, 2008. As in the case of the bill submitted on November 21.2008, Law 26,466 makes no mention of the July 2008 Agreement, which had been referred to in the original bill submitted to the Argentine Congress on July 24, 2008.\n\n455.\n\nOn December 30, 2008, the President adopted Decree 2347/2008 creating an administrative entity under the auspices of the Secretariat of Transportation and the Ministry of Planning to exercise all the rights of the shares in the Airlines until the expropriation process under Law 26,466 was completed.424\n\nC-217.\n\n456.\n\nOn January 15, 2009, the Government of Argentina sent to Interinvest the TTN\u2019s valuation of the Airlines\u2019 shares in the negative amount of ARS 3,087,748.413 and requested that Interinvest inform it whether it accepted that valuation.425\n\n*See* C-215: Resolution 36/09 and C-379: the TTN\u2019s Valuation of January 12, 2009. Resolution 36/09 stated that the valuation had been prepared in accordance with Laws 21,499 and 26,466 and Decree 2347-08. The valuation was performed exclusively on the substantive or patrimonial value method, provided for in Article 10 of Law No. 21,499.\n\n457.\n\nOn January 21, 2009, Interinvest rejected the TTN\u2019s valuation, referring to what it stated had been Argentina\u2019s confiscatory process. Interinvest also repeated its previous objections to the TTN\u2019s valuations.426\n\nC-216: Interinvest\u2019s letter of January 21, 2009. In its letter, Interinvest states that the valuation of the Airlines set out in Resolution 36/09 did not reflect the fair market value of the shares of the Airlines and did not compensate for the harm it maintained that Argentina's previous conduct had caused to the airlines. The letter then went on to state that in order to obtain full compensation, Teinver, Autobuses Urbanos and Transportes de Cercanias would continue with the international arbitration commenced before ICSID. In this regard, Interinvest had submitted to the Argentine government a letter from the three Claimants advising of their decision to submit their dispute to the ICSID pursuant to the Treaty. *See* C-265. On November 27, 2008, the Government of Argentina had responded to Claimants' letter requesting that Interinvest's representative submit documentation sufficient to prove his capacity as a representative of Claimants, noting that this response did not imply Argentina's consent to the applicability of the Treaty, the alleged capacity as foreign investors of Claimants, the admissibility of the claim or any of the statements made in Claimants' letter. *See* C-266.\n\n458.\n\nAs Claimants rejected the TTN\u2019s Valuation, the Government of Argentina commenced an expropriation lawsuit against Interinvest (the \"Expropriation Lawsuit\"). In the meantime, the administrative entity created by Decree 2347 had been appointed to exercise all rights granted by the shares of the Airlines.427\n\nC-570: Expropriation Claim of February 2009.\n\n459.\n\nCommencing in November 2008, representatives of Interinvest and of Respondent had discussed the possible settlement of the disputes between them. Pursuant to the discussions between the parties and the drafts exchanged, Interinvest would agree to the sale of the shares of the Airlines for a nominal price of 1 Peso in exchange for the Government of Argentina taking steps to acquire 35 of the aircraft that ASTRA had previously committed to purchase from Airbus, plus various additional concessions.428 These discussions took place from November 2008 through February 2009. The first draft of the agreement under discussion was dated December 1, 2008.\n\n*See, inter alia,* C-221; C-223; C-229; C-232; C-233 and C-235.\n\n460.\n\nOn January 21, 2009, Secretary of Transport Jaime wrote to Airbus to indicate the Government of Argentina\u2019s interest in purchasing 35 aircraft that ASTRA had ordered from Airbus. Mr. Jaime\u2019s letter added that the Government of Argentina\u2019s interest in the aircraft was related to the delivery dates or slots for aircraft to be delivered to ASTRA and asked that Airbus do what it could to expedite discussions and negotiations with all parties involved so that the acquisition could take place as soon as possible.429\n\nC-229.\n\n461.\n\nFollowing this, on January 24, 2009, Airbus\u2019 Contracts Division prepared a draft Memorandum of Agreement between it and the Argentine Federal Ministry of Planning which provided that the Government of Argentina committed to purchase and take delivery of 35 specified aircraft and make an initial payment in an amount which would cover pre-delivery payments plus an additional USD 150 million.430\n\nC-231, Article 7. The draft Memorandum of Agreement provided that the pre-delivery payments (\"PDP\") portion of the initial payment would be used to satisfy Argentina\u2019s PDPs due upon the signature of a purchase agreement. The remainder of the initial payment (USD 150 million) was to be used by Airbus to obtain the release by ASTRA of all its rights in respect of the aircraft subject of the Memorandum of Agreement, including payment of a tennination fee, settlement of capital and financing costs and other costs incuned by ASTRA. The draft was exchanged between lawyers for the parties and a copy of the draft Memorandum of Agreement was sent to Mr. Manuel Vasquez, the advisor to Secretary of Transportation Jaime, on January 26, 2009.\n\n462.\n\nOn February 8, 2009, a new draft of the agreement Interinvest and Respondent had been negotiating was produced. It was retitled \"Draft Agreement for the Implementation of Law No. 26,466\" (the \"Draft Agreement\") and appears to have been initialed.431\n\n*See* C-235: *Acuerdo para el cumplimiento de la Ley 26,466.* The agreement, which remained in draft form, was initialled by Mr. Munoz Perez on behalf of Interinvest and, it is alleged, Mr. Manuel Vasquez. *See* Pascual Arias WS \u00b6 88. As discussed below, there is a dispute between the Parties as to the initials alleged to have been added to the draft on behalf of Respondent.\n\n463.\n\nIn the recitals at the beginning of the Draft Agreement, the parties make reference to the adoption of Law No. 26,466 for the expropriation of the shares of the Airlines, the fact that pursuant to Decree 2347, the Federal Ministry of Planning had been designated as the expropriating entity and instructed to proceed with the expropriation and that the controlling shareholders of Interinvest had commenced an arbitration against Argentina pursuant to the terms of the Treaty. It also stated that in view of these circumstances, the parties had reached an agreement for the implementation of Law No. 26,466. Pursuant to the terms of the Draft Agreement, Interinvest agreed to the transfer of all of its shares in the Airlines in exchange for the payment of 1 Peso. For its part, Government of Argentina agreed to certain additional obligations *(compromises ctdicionctles),* including the acquisition and acceptance of ASTRA\u2019s rights and obligations in respect of 35 aircraft ordered from Airbus for delivery within certain slots. In that regard, the Draft Agreement included an obligation on the part of the Airlines (then owned by Government of Argentina) to conclude a purchase agreement with Airbus within 30 days of the conclusion of the Draft Agreement. Further, the purchase agreement between the Airlines and Airbus was required to provide full and final release of all of ASTRA\u2019s obligations under its contracts with Airbus in respect of the aircraft in question.432\n\nC-235, Articles 2.1 and 2.2. It appears to be common ground between the Parties that had the Draft Agreement been signed and implemented, this would have resolved the dispute between them in respect of the expropriation of the Airlines. *See* the testimony of Undersecretary Llorens: Transcript pp 619-620, 654-655; CI. PHB \u00b6 156-157.\n\n464.\n\nThe Draft Agreement was never signed nor implemented. It appears that the Government of Argentina was having difficulty securing financing for the purchase of the aircraft from Airbus. Although discussions and negotiations continued for some time, the projected transfer of ASTRA\u2019s rights to purchase the aircraft from Airbus was delayed and, eventually, abandoned.433 ASTRA and Airbus reached a contractual arrangement to assist ASTRA to finance the purchase of certain aircraft (Airbus A33Os) which the Government of Argentina was to undertake to purchase in the Draft Agreement. Pursuant to this arrangement, ASTRA and Airbus agreed to the termination of various purchase agreements in order to reallocate the Pre-delivery Payments (PDPs) that ASTRA had paid pursuant to purchase agreements for A3 80s, A320s and A3 50s to the payment of outstanding obligations in respect of the A3 3 Os which had been purchased. As a result, all sums invested by ASTRA in the A320s, A3 50s and A3 80s were applied to finance the purchase of the A330s.434\n\nIt appears that the Government of Spain sought to assist by making financing available to the Government of Argentina. *See, inter alia,* C-236: letter from the Spanish Ambassador to the Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs dated April 30, 2009; C-237; C-238; C-240: email from Mr. Manuel Vasquez to Mr. Vicente Munoz Perez dated June 16, 2009, attaching terms of a possible restructuring of debt payments from Argentina to Spain; C-383; C-384: email on behalf of the Argentine Ambassador to Spain to Mr. Vicente Munoz Perez dated June 24, 2009.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 296-299 and the sources cited there.\n\n465.\n\nOn July 10, 2009, ASTRA and Airbus also concluded a Supplemental Agreement which provided for the payment of a fee from Airbus to ASTRA upon the completion of an agreement between Airbus and the Government of Argentina for the purchase of the aircraft identified in the proposed draft Memorandum of Agreement between Airbus and the Argentine Ministry of Planning.435\n\n*See* C-244: Supplemental Agreement between ASTRA and Airbus dated July 10, 2009; C-245: email from Mr. Benoit de San Exupery to Mr. Vicente Munoz Perez dated June 17, 2009 regarding ongoing discussions between Airbus and Argentina regarding the draft Memorandum of Agreement between them.\n\n466.\n\nAlthough discussion continued between representatives of the Argentine Secretary of Transportation and the Ministry of Planning, Interinvest and Airbus for some months, no firm agreements were concluded. In November 2009, Airbus informed ASTRA that it was ready to deliver the first A330 aircraft it had purchased. ASTRA was not in a position to purchase the aircraft and, in December 2009, one of its creditors exercised its rights to take delivery and ownership of the aircraft. In due course, ASTRA lost its right to purchase the A3 30 aircraft from Airbus as well as any right to recovery of any sums paid in advance as deposits. The last contact between Interinvest and Respondent regarding the possible purchase of the A330 aircraft took place in January and February 2010.\n\n467.\n\nAs described above, Air Comet initiated voluntary reorganization proceedings on April 20, 2010. This was followed by the commencement of voluntary reorganization proceedings by Teinver on December 23, 2010, by Autobuses Urbanos on January 28, 2011 and by Transportes de Cercanias on February 16, 2011.436\n\n*See* Part III.B, above.\n\n468.\n\nOn February 27, 2014, the Argentine Federal Administrative Court rendered its decision on the expropriation of Interinvest\u2019s shares in the Airlines (the \"Expropriation Judgment\").437 In its judgment, the court accepted the valuation of the TTN, noting that it was of decisive importance. It noted that the TTN had applied the \"substantive value or patrimonial value *(valor sustantivo o patrimonial)\"* and considered the market value of the assets of the Airlines, using comparative or depreciated replacement cost methodologies. It held that the discounted cash flow methodology did not apply since it was inconsistent with the Application of Article 10 of the National Law on Expropriation (Law No. 21,499) which provides that indemnification shall only consist of the objective value of the asset and the damages which are the direct and immediate consequence of the expropriation. According to the court, under the Expropriation Law hypothetical earnings, increased value from use of the asset and *lucro cesante, inter alia,* are not to be taken into account. The court held that the discounted cash flow method is based principally on projections of a company\u2019s performance in the future and discounting present values from future revenues for losses and operating costs. As a result, the discounted cash flow methodology proposed by Interinvest was based on forecast hypothetical earnings and costs and its application implied ignoring the Expropriation Law.438\n\nC-1197.\n\n*Id.,* pp. 9-10. The court also noted that the TTN\u2019s valuation had been adopted unanimously, in the absence of a technical representative of Respondent, which Interinvest chose not to appoint. The court also noted that Interinvest had not proved that the method of discounted cash flow was the valuation method for an ongoing aviation services company - without prejudice to the issues which had been raised with respect to the allegation that the Companies were not going concerns but, rather, in the process of dissolution for loss of share capital - w hich, according to the court, was more consistent with the provisions of Article 10 of the *Expropriation Law.* The court also mentions that Interinvest did not question the constitutionality of the Expropriation Law. However, Claimants say that Interinvest did challenge the constitutionality of Law No. 26,466 (which is the law which directed the expropriation of Interinvest and not the general Expropriation Law): *see* Cl. Reply \u00b6 324 and C-887, p. 5: Interinvest Pleading of June 2, 2010 in the Expropriation Lawsuit. Claimants also submit that the judge in the first instance proceedings acted arbitrarily by preventing Interinvest from submitting key valuation issues and by not permitting Interinvest more than five days to challenge a new report by the TTN. *See* Cl. Reply \u00b6 327; C-888; C-889; and RA-408.\n\n469.\n\nInterinvest appealed the first instance decision in the Expropriation Lawsuit on May 23, 2015. In April 2015, the Federal Court of Appeal in Contentious-Administrative Matters rendered its judgment, dismissing the appeal and confirming the first instance decision (the \"Expropriation Appeal Judgment\").439 In its reasons, the Court of Appeal held that the TTN had opted for valuing all the current and non-current assets and liabilities of the Airlines and that this was correct since the companies were facing a loss-making economic and financial condition and, therefore, were not in a condition to continue operating in the immediate future. The court also held that Interinvest had not provided any evidence that the application of the discounted cash flow methodology would or could have resulted in a positive valuation.440\n\nRA-690.\n\n*See* RA-690 (English version), pp. 7-11. The court states that the appellant only referred in a vague manner to the failure to assess the value of intangible assets and did not offer any evidence that had any such assets been taken into account, the result of the valuation would have been different. The court refers to the \"...huge indebtedness of the companies [and] the inability to face such debts on the basis of the earnings derived from the exploitation thereof.. The court also noted that the TTN had requested a discounted cash flow analysis from the School of Economics of the University of Buenos Aires and that according to the latter\u2019s analysis the application of the DCF method also resulted in a negative result.\n\n470.\n\nThere is a dispute as to whether Interinvest appealed the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision to the Argentine Supreme Court. In a letter dated December 1, 2015, Claimants submitted that the expropriation proceeding in Argentina had not ended since it had not been notified of the rejection of its pending appeal, as alleged by Respondent.441 In submissions made during the course of Claimants\u2019 Third Application for Interim Measures, Respondent submitted that Claimants had not submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court and, therefore, the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision had become binding.442 In the end, the evidence on this issue was not entirely clear. The Tribunal notes that no copy of an appeal to the Supreme Court or further evidence of the filing of an appeal was tendered by Claimants. In these circumstances, it appears that no further appeal from the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was taken.\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 letter dated December 1, 2015.\n\nResponse of the Argentine Republic to Claimants\u2019 Third Application for Provisional Measures, August 12, 2015, \u00b6\u00b6 63-71; Republic of Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder on Claimants\u2019 Third Request for Provisional Measures, October 23, 2015,\u00b6\u00b6 56-57. *See also* Ex. RA-689 winch appears to indicate that the Federal Court of Appeals in Contentious -Administrative Matters dismissed Interinvesf s appeal by way of its judgment of May 26.2015 and that the Resolution dismissing Interinvesf s appeal was communicated to Interinvest on June 1, 2015. *See also* Respondent\u2019s letter dated December 4, 2015.\n\n471.\n\nAfter July 2008, the Argentine Secretary of Transport issued a series of resolutions increasing airfares in November 2009, June and July 2010, March and May 2011, February, June and November 2012, and May and December 20 1 3.443 On February 2, 2016, Decree 294/2016 was issued; this decree removed maximum airfare caps for domestic air transportation.444\n\n*See* C-863: Resolution 227/2009; C-864: Resolution 118/2010; C-865: Resolution 210/2010; C-866: Resolution 64/2011; C-867: Resolution 112/2011; C-868: Resolution 23/2012; C-869: Resolution 49/2012; C-870: Resolution 778/2008; C-871: Resolution 265/2013; C-966: Resolution 1595/2013. *See also* Cl. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 38-40. According to Claimants, these airfare increases amount to an increase of 127% of the average airfare in five years. Claimants say that if the airfare increases granted in April and May 2008, shortly before the July 2008 Agreement was concluded, were included in the total, then the increase of the average airfare as of April 2008 amounted to 163%. Claimants contrast this increase with the airfare increases granted during Claimants\u2019 ownership period of almost seven years, which Claimants say was for a total of approximately 40%. *See* Cl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 148-149.\n\n*See* Decree 294/2016, dated February 2, 2016. Available at:  \n http://servicios.infoleg.gob.ar/ infolegIntemet/anexos/255000-259999/258356/nonna.htm. The Decree states in part that maximum tariffs had hindered the development of commercial air transportation and that it was appropriate to update the airfare regime and to maintain only reference fares on base airfares for domestic economy class. *See also* Claimants\u2019 letter of March 8, 2016 in respect of this Decree and Respondent\u2019s response of March 21, 2016.\n\n472.\n\nThe Airlines continued to operate throughout 2008 and remain in operation to date.\n\n**VI. APPLICABLE LAW**\n----------------------\n\n473.\n\nIn their Request for Arbitration, Claimants allege that Respondent violated the Treaty, international law and Argentine law. Specifically, Claimants allege that Respondent breached the following obligations and standards with respect to their investment in Argentina:445\n\n(a) Article V of the Treaty by having nationalized, expropriated or otherwise appropriated through measures tantamount to expropriation the Claimants\u2019 investment without satisfying the conditions for a lawful expropriation;\n\n(b) Article IV(1 of the Treaty by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to Claimants\u2019 investment;\n\n(c) Article II(2)(c) of the US-Argentina BIT, to which protection Claimants say they are entitled pursuant to the MFN clause in the Treaty (Article IV(2)), by failing to observe obligations Respondent entered into with regard to Claimants\u2019 investment;\n\n(d) Article III(1) of the Treaty by impairing by unjustified or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, disposal or liquidation of investments made in Argentina by Claimants; and\n\n(e) Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT, through operation of the MFN clause in the Treaty (Article IV(2)), by failing to accord full protection and security and the treatment required by international law.\n\nRFA \u00b6 11.\n\n474.\n\nThe Parties consented to ICSID arbitration to resolve the investment dispute. Article 42(1 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nThe Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n475.\n\nThe *Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain on the Promotion and Protection of Investments* was signed on October 3, 1991 by both parties and entered into force on September 28, 1992 (the \"Treaty\").446 The Treaty is *lex specialis* between Respondent and Spain, as it governs investments made by nationals of one State in the territory of the other. The Treaty forms the legal basis for Claimants\u2019 claims against Respondent in this arbitration.447 Thus, the provisions of the Treaty supersede principles of customary international law unless those principles are general principles of international law in the nature of *jus cogens,448*\n\nAgreement between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (C-l).\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 335 *et seq.*\n\n*Amoco Int\u2019l. Fin.* v. *Islamic Rep. of Iran,* 27 I.L.M. 1314, 1338 (1988) (\"Amoco\") (C-277).\n\n476.\n\nRegarding applicable law, Article X (5) of the Treaty provides:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall make its decision on the basis of tins Agreement and, where appropriate, on the basis of other treaties in force between the Parties, the domestic law of the Party in whose territory the investment was made, including its rules of private international law, and the general principles of international law.449\n\nC-l.\n\n477.\n\nAs an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"Vienna Convention\") applies to the interpretation of the Treaty.450 The Vienna Convention confirms that every treaty in force is binding upon the parties and obliges parties to perform them in good faith.451 Further, parties to treaties \"may not invoke the provisions of [their] internal law as justification for [their] failure to perform a treaty.\"452 Accordingly, Respondent may not avoid its treaty obligations owed to Claimants by relying on its compliance with its internal laws, regulations or administrative acts.\n\n1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Art. 1 and 2(1)(a) (\"Vienna Convention\") (C-285).\n\nVienna Convention, Art. 26.\n\nVienna Convention, Art. 27.\n\n478.\n\nArticle 31 of the Vienna Convention provides the Tribunal with the general rules of interpretation:\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty winch was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument winch was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty winch establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n479.\n\nWith respect to certain claims, Respondent has stated that it is not liable for certain acts, as they cannot be attributed to Respondent. In the context of these particular defenses, the Articles on State Responsibility will also be relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.\n\n480.\n\nAccordingly, the claims and Counterclaims in this arbitration are governed by the ICSID Convention, by the Treaty and, where the Tribunal considers appropriate, the law of Argentina and general principles of international law. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis in the subsequent sections of this Award will be guided by these sources and discussed in more detail in the context of each of the claims and Counterclaims.\n\n**VII. THE CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS - OVERVIEW**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n481.\n\nAs has been set out in considerable detail in the previous sections of this Award, Claimants invested in Argentina in 2001 through their indirect through Air Comet purchase of Interinvest, which, in turn, owned the majority of the shares of the Airlines and operated the Airlines until 2008 when the Government of Argentina formally expropriated the shares of the Airlines. At the time of Air Comet\u2019s initial investment, the Airlines were in dire financial condition. During Air Comet\u2019s ownership, the financial condition of the Airlines initially improved and positive returns were realized before the Airlines began to again experience financial difficulties. It is undisputed that at the time of expropriation in 2008, the Airlines were again insolvent and the Government of Argentina intervened to assist in providing funds for expenses in order to keep the Airlines in operation.\n\n482.\n\nClaimants allege that the declining financial condition of the Airlines and their ultimate return to insolvency was a result of Argentina\u2019s measures, which they assert amount to breaches of the Treaty. Claimants complain specifically about Argentina\u2019s refusal to increase domestic airfares or provide other relief to ensure economically reasonable airfares; Argentina\u2019s interference with the management of the Airlines in pressuring the Airlines to increase wages in response to union demands; the acts of the Undersecretary of Air Transportation; Argentina\u2019s unjustified challenge of the Airlines\u2019 financial statements; Argentina\u2019s pressure on Claimants to sell their interest in the Airlines to an Argentine purchaser; Argentina\u2019s breach of agreements reached with respect to the sale of the shares and their value; and, ultimately, Argentina\u2019s valuation of those shares when it decided to expropriate them in 2008.\n\n483.\n\nArgentina, instead, maintains the position that Claimants made no real investment in Argentina at all and that their mismanagement of the Airlines was the cause of their demise. Argentina submits that it had no choice but to expropriate the Airlines in order to maintain the vital public service of connectivity within the country and that it was justified in paying nothing for the shares, as the Airlines had a negative collective valuation at the time of expropriation. Further, Argentina makes a Counterclaim in this arbitration for what it says are its losses related to Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n484.\n\nRespondent states that Claimants\u2019 entry into the Airlines and their management of the Airlines was ill-conceived, \"parasitical\"453 and self-serving. Respondent asserts that Claimants chose voluntarily to enter the Argentine air industry at a particularly inauspicious period that coincided with the events of September 11, 2001 and the Argentine economic crisis.454 One of the airlines, ARSA, was in the midst of bankruptcy proceedings at this time.455 Further, Respondent argues that Claimants failed to undertake a proper due diligence of the Airlines before entering the 2001 Share Purchase Agreement with SEPI, and then failed to invest in the Airlines as it was required to do pursuant to the terms of that agreement.456\n\n*See, e.g.,* Resp. Rej. \u00b6 73.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Resp. CM \u00b6 155.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*See, e.g.,* Resp. CM \u00b6 155.\n\n485.\n\nThus, Respondent argues that it was Claimants\u2019 management of the Airlines that led to their grave financial and operational condition by 2008, and not State policy. In that respect, Respondent asserts, as a defense to Claimants\u2019 claims, that:\n\nIt has been demonstrated that the state of the Airlines by mid-2008 was not a consequence of the actions of the Argentine State. On the contrary, the situation is attributable to the management of the Marsans Group. It was the lack of diligence and commitment in the acquisition and management of the Airlines, coupled with disrespect for applicable rules, that impacted on the viability of the Airlines.457\n\nClaimants attempt to have the Tribunal assume that a company in such situation, which was later put in the hands of a group that collapsed all over the world, amidst scandals, management disasters and fraud, would have been successful if it had not been because of the measures adopted by the Argentine Government. But nobody could reasonably assume that that could have happened.458\n\n... the manoeuvres of the Marsans Group led the Argentine Airlines to a situation in which the public service of airtransport of passengers, mail and cargo was jeopardized.459\n\nIndeed, in 2008, the Airlines where [sic] in the same\u2014or even worse\u2014economic situation they were in 2001, as a consequence of the inefficient management of the Marsans Group. Claimants\u2019 allegation that this was the result of the airfares applied is false since, as has been explained by KPMG, during the relevant period, the airfares affected by the regulation increased more than costs.460\n\nRespondent\u2019s Skeleton Submission \u00b6 86.\n\nResp.

ALLEGED BREACHES OF FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nAt the core of Claimants\u2019 case are the allegations that Argentina treated Claimants\u2019 investment unfairly and inequitably and, ultimately, expropriated it without paying any compensation. Claimants allege that Respondent failed to provide fair and equitable treatment to their investment, in violation of Article IV(1 of the Treaty. Claimants asserted that the following acts allegedly taken by Respondent constituted FET violations:\n\n(a) The \"airfare squeeze\"461\n\n(b) The maintenance of Undersecretary Cirielli in office462\n\n(c) Respondent\u2019s unjustified challenge of ARSA\u2019s financial statements463\n\n(d) Respondent\u2019s acts with respect to the June 2006 agreement, including Respondent\u2019s coercion of Claimants to obtain additional shares at no cost, its unilateral modification of the text of the June 2006 Agreement, and its breach of the June 2006 Agreement by failing to set TER-compliant airfares and failing to comply with its promised 15% stock option of ARSA by invoking the corresponding cash contributions464\n\n(e) The breach of the May 2008 Agreement465\n\n(f) The breach of the July 2008 Agreement and the subsequent *de facto* expropriation of the Airlines466\n\n(g) Respondent\u2019s failed promise to subrogate Claimants\u2019 Airbus orders467\n\nCl.

The Tribunal has already determined that Claimants had protected investments in Argentina.468 Respondent\u2019s specific defenses to the FET claims will be discussed in the following sections.\n\n*See* Section IV.D and in particular, \u00b6 315, above.\n\n**A. Positions of the Parties on the Content and Scope of the FET Obligation**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n490.\n\nClaimants assert that the FET standard contained in Article IV(1 of the Treaty\n\n...is not a single monolithic standard, but encompasses several categories of conduct. Specifically, fair and equitable treatment comprises, *inter alia,* the following obligations: (i) to provide investors with a stable and predictable legal and business enviromnent; (ii) not to frustrate an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations; (iii) to act transparently and consistently towards investors and their investments; (iv) to act in good faith; (v) to refrain from coercion or harassment; and (vi) to promote and protect investment.469\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 466.\n\n491.\n\nClaimants stress, in particular, that case law overwhelmingly demonstrates that the FET standard prohibits host States from engaging in conduct that frustrates the legitimate expectations of investors.470 They also stress that legitimate expectations can arise from contracts and specific representations, such as in the case of Respondent\u2019s promised subsidies and tax relief, as well as in the case of the June 2006, May 2008 and July 2008 Agreements.471 Claimants have summarized the fair and equitable treatment standard as follows:472\n\n\u2022 The fair and equitable treatment standard requires the State to be \"just, even-handed, unbiased, legitimate.\"\n\n\u2022 The fair and equitable treatment standard should be ascertained in light of the object and purpose of the treaty, which, in this case are in part to \"intensify economic cooperation for the economic benefit of both countries\" and \"to create favorable conditions for investments.\"\n\n\u2022 The fair and equitable treatment standard obligates the State to respect the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations. Furthermore, through its laws, regulations, policies and statements, a state creates certain expectations about the treatment that an investor may anticipate.\n\n\u2022 The fair and equitable treatment standard requires the State to protect the stability of the legal and business environment of the investment. When a state abrogates its commitments and thereby violates an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations, it creates an unstable and unpredictable legal and business environment.\n\n\u2022 The fair and equitable treatment standard requires the State to refrain from conduct that is inconsistent or lacks transparency. Thus, a state\u2019s conduct should be free from ambiguity or uncertainty. Accordingly, \"all relevant legal requirements for the purpose of initiating, completing and successfully operating investments made, or intended to be made, under the Agreement should be capable of being readily known\" by the investor.\n\n\u2022 A finding of bad faith is not required to conclude that a state violated its obligation to treat the investments fairly and equitably.\n\n\u2022 The fair and equitable treatment standard requires the State to conform its measures and conduct to a standard of good faith.\n\nCl.

Reply \u00b6 479; Cl. PHB \u00b6 176.\n\n493.\n\nClaimants also assert that Respondent failed to act transparently and consistently toward Claimants and their investment through the following alleged conduct:\n\n(a) its groundless excuses not to appoint a third independent valuator under the July 2008 Agreement;\n\n(b) its pressure on Claimants to conclude the June 2006 and May 2008 Agreements, in exchange for airfare increases it had to grant anyway;\n\n(c) its persistent refusal to calculate the Economically Reasonable Airfare between 2002 and 2008, but granting insufficient increases \"on account of\u2019 it;\n\n(d) the Government of Argentina\u2019s May 29, 2008 acknowledgment of damages (in the range of USD 390-450 million) due to its failure to implement tax benefits and subsidies that it had promised to Claimants since 2002;\n\n(e) its appointment of Mr. Cirielli as Undersecretary of Air Transportation notwithstanding his evident bias against Claimants, and his maintenance in office notwithstanding the existence of court and administrative rulings acknowledging his conflict of interest with Claimants;\n\n(f) the filing of groundless challenges to ARSA\u2019s financial statements to then withdraw them with prejudice when receiving a percentage of ARSA\u2019s stockholding per the June 2006 Agreement,\n\n(g) its *ad hoc* use of *de facto* representatives (such as Mr. Vazquez and Mr. Gutierrez) for making low-ball offers to purchase the Airlines;\n\n(h) its threats to Claimants\u2019 representatives (such as Mr. Munoz Perez); and\n\n(i) its *de facto* control of the Airlines in violation of the July 2008 Agreement.474\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 177.\n\n494.\n\nRespondent asserts, in response, that the expression \"fair and equitable treatment\" as used by Article IV(1 of the Treaty refers to the minimum standard under customary international law. Under this standard, acts that give rise to a FET breach are those that \"fall below the internationally acceptable levels and which, when weighed against the given factual context, amount to manifest arbitrariness, discrimination, a gross denial of justice, or a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.\"475 Respondent asserts that none of the acts described by Claimants rise to this level.\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6 232.\n\n495.\n\nRespondent argues further that the concept of \"legitimate expectations\" referenced by Claimants appears nowhere in the Treaty or other BITs concluded by Argentina. Nonetheless, even if this standard did apply to the circumstances, Claimants failed to take into consideration the dismal condition of the Airlines in 2001, and failed to conduct any due diligence analysis.476 The Treaty cannot be read to grant foreign investors immunity from business risks or to offer them any guarantee of profitability.477 Respondent asserts that, far from this being a situation where a State changed the domestic legal framework to the detriment of the investor, it is Claimants here who complain that they were not able to modify the existing legal framework to their own advantage.478\n\nResp.

The \"Airfare Squeeze\"**\n----------------------------\n\n498.\n\nClaimants contend that the Airlines, as airlines operating in Argentina, had the right under Argentine law to charge an \"economically reasonable airfare\" (\"TER\") the acronym for the Spanish *tarifa econdmica retributiva)* for domestic flights. Claimants allege that Argentina failed to set airfares in accordance with the TER principle, and that the airfares set were too low for Claimants to make the reasonable return to which they were entitled. Claimants argue that over the period of their control of the Airlines (2001-2008), and in the wake of the Argentine financial crisis and devaluation of the peso, their costs rose sharply relative to the airfares they could charge. They argue that despite their numerous requests, Respondent failed to raise the airfares sufficiently to reflect cost increases, which \"severely harmed, and ultimately financially choked the Argentine Airlines.\"479\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 142.\n\n499.\n\nClaimants say that the airfare squeeze breached numerous obligations owed by Respondent under the Treaty. Claimants assert that Respondent\u2019s failure to provide economically reasonable airfare levels constitutes a breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) obligation set forth in Treaty Article IV(1.480 Claimants also allege that the airfare squeeze constitutes a part of Respondent\u2019s indirect or \"creeping\" expropriation of the Airlines in violation of Treaty Article V.481 Finally, Claimants assert that Respondent\u2019s failure to provide a TER constitutes a breach of Argentina\u2019s failure to protect Claimants under Treaty Article III(1).482 The Tribunal will review all of Claimants\u2019 arguments as they relate to the airfare squeeze in this section of the Award and return to its findings, as necessary, in subsequent sections.\n\nCl.

Third, it will address the Parties\u2019 quantitative arguments with respect to the airfares. The Tribunal will then examine whether the alleged airfare squeeze gave rise to a breach of the FET standard under the Treaty.\n\n**1. The Regulatory Structure**\n-------------------------------\n\n501.\n\nClaimants request the Tribunal to find that Respondent was required under Argentine law to set economically reasonable airfares for domestic routes, i.e., at levels that would have permitted the Airlines to recover their direct, indirect and financial costs and to obtain a reasonable profit.483 Claimants further request that the Tribunal find that Argentina, by contemporaneous conduct and representations, acknowledged Claimants\u2019 right to economically reasonable airfares as well as its own failure to set airfares for the domestic passenger market in compliance with the TER-standard from 2002 up until expropriation of the Airlines.484\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 36.\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 54.\n\n**Laws and regulations**\n------------------------\n\n***Scope of regulations***\n--------------------------\n\n502.\n\nAirfares are regulated by the Argentine government via the Air Business Law, Law No. 19,030. Argentine regulations require Respondent to approve a base airfare or *tarifa de referenda.* Argentine regulations also set both a ceiling and a floor (\"airfare bands\") with reference to the base airfare, usually by a set percentage below and above the base fare, so that the air carriers can freely price each available seat within the upper or lower band.\n\n503.\n\nIt is undisputed by the Parties that these regulations concern only airfares for domestic flights.485 As such, Claimants\u2019 allegations of the \"airfare squeeze\" are limited to Respondent\u2019s actions with respect to these domestic airfares. The regulations are further limited in scope because they only apply to domestic tickets that are purchased *within* Argentina. Respondent argues, therefore that airfare regulation in Argentina affected only \"a small portion of the revenues of the Airlines.\"486\n\nFares for international flights are regulated via bilateral agreements; *see* Resp. Rei. \u00b6 355.\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6 77.\n\n504.\n\nThe scope of operations of the two Airlines was different. AUSA flew almost exclusively domestic routes and its revenues generated from those routes represented 98% of its total revenues. On the other hand, ARSA operated a substantial number of international routes as well as domestic routes and revenues generated from its domestic routes represented approximately 25% of its total revenues.487\n\nCLEX ER3 \u00b6 64. The figures are averages for the period of 2002-2008.\n\n505.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether domestic business class fares were subject to these same airfare regulations during the 2001-2008 period of Claimants\u2019 management of the Airlines.\n\n506.\n\nClaimants assert that any premium or business class airfares were regulated until 2008, and that business fares were only deregulated as part of the April 2008 fare increases granted by the Secretariat of Transportation.488\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 79; Transcript pp. 1374-1375 (testimony of Dr. Spiller/CLEX).\n\n507.\n\nST Resolution No. 257 of April 2008 is entitled \"A resolution authorizing the operators of regular domestic air passenger transportation services to apply economy-class fares in certain fare brackets. Effectiveness.\" It provides, in relevant part:\n\n**Section 1.** The operators of regular domestic air passenger transportation services are hereby authorized to apply, effective at 00:00 on the day following the day of publication of this Resolution, the economy-class fares in the fare brackets between the reference rate and the maximum fare for each of the points of origination-destination described in Annex I[\u2026]...\n\n**Section 2.** Commercial airlines shall submit for approval by this OFFICE OF TRANSPORTATION the air fares to be applied to such differential intermediate or business class services as they may offer for regular domestic flights, and this authority shall reserve the right to define the conditions that will apply to services of this sort.489 (emphasis added)\n\nC-181.\n\n508.\n\nClaimants note that all resolutions relating to fare increases enacted after this resolution likewise specify that the fare caps apply only to economy class. ST Resolution No. 315 of May 2008, for example, is entitled *\"Servicios regulares de transporte aereo interno depasajeros. Tarifas clase economical* and does not make any reference to \"executive\" or \"business class\" fares.490 Claimants also note that the resolutions on airfares that were enacted during their control of the Airlines prior to April 2008 did not distinguish between \"economic\" and \"business\" class fares or otherwise exclude business class fares.491\n\nC-182; Cl.

In its first expert report, it noted that \"Later on, in April and May 2008, ST Resolutions No. 257 and 315, respectively, further increased reference and maximum airfare twice by 18% for economy class, deregulating prices to be charged for business class.\"496 During the hearing, however, KPMG asserted that \"in late January 2008, the standard or the rule allow[ed] for the deregulation of the Business Class, but this is something that had already been done in the past,\"497 and that \"only the domestic airfare was regulated for the economy seating in Argentinean pesos and sold to Argentinean residents.\"498\n\nResp.

PHB \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.\n\n*See* Donato ER2, \u00b6 25 (\"This airfare-band system only governs economy class airfares for regular domestic passenger air transport; and executive class airfares, non-regular air services, postage and cargo air transport and international air transport are not subject to these limitations.\"); testimony of Professor Keifman, Transcript p. 1093 (it is \"absolutely false\" that business fares were only deregulated beginning in April 2008); testimony of KPMG, Transcript p. 1476 (\"only the domestic airfare for the economic fare type is regulated point of sale in Argentina.\").\n\nKPMG ER1, \u00b6 2.6.5.\n\nKPMG Testimony, Transcript p. 1478.\n\nKPMG Testimony, Transcript p. 1393.\n\n511.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s review of the regulatory framework indicates that no distinction was made between economy and business class airfares until ST Resolution No. 257/2008. Prior to that time, all the relevant legislation and decrees relating to airfares simply referred to the airfares and bands in question without differentiating between economy and business class or exempting business class from the application of the relevant airfare caps. The Tribunal notes that it was not until Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits that it raised the argument that domestic business class airfares were unregulated during the period of 2002 to 2008. In addition, Respondent\u2019s expert, KPMG, identified ST Resolution Nos. 257 and 315 as new regulations which deregulated airfares for business class.499 The Tribunal is not persuaded by KMPG\u2019s explanation in cross-examination that although the first decree to de-regulate business class airfares was adopted in April 2008, in practice these airfares had already been deregulated.500\n\nKPMG ER1 \u00a7\u00a7 11.4.11, 2.6.5.\n\nTranscript pp. 1477-1479. Read in context, KPMG\u2019s expert report indicates that business class airfares were first deregulated in April and May 2008 and KPMG criticized the CLEX report for not reflecting this change in its damage calculations. Further, KPMG did not offer any support for its statement at the hearing that business class airfares had previously been deregulated.\n\n512.\n\nClaimants\u2019 experts, Messrs. Abdala and Spiller, testified that business class airfares were not deregulated and that the airlines were not free to charge business class airfares or to redesignate economy class seats as business class seats without the Secretariat of Transportation\u2019s authorization.501 There was some indication that airlines reached informal, oral agreements with the Secretariat of Transportation to sell a limited number of seats as \"business\" or \"gold\" seats at a premium. However, that premium was limited to the maximum airfare chargeable for the equivalent regular, economy seats. As a result, the ability to convert regular seats into \"business\" or \"gold\" seats was still limited by the maximum airfare set by decree and, therefore, was revenue neutral.502 As a result, to the extent there may have been some limited, informal practice of rebranding seats, as permitted by the Secretariat, this practice was revenue neutral and did not affect Claimants\u2019 experts\u2019 yield calculations.\n\nTranscript pp. 1374-1378.\n\n*lb.*\n\n513.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes for all intents and purposes, until the adoption of ST Resolution No. 257/2008 in April 2008, all domestic airfares, including for \"business\" or \"gold\" seats, were regulated and subject to the reference airfares and the approved maximum airfare caps and bands contained in the regulations.503\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal finds Respondent\u2019s position that business class seats were unregulated prior to April 2008 and that the airlines could have freely charged business class airfares to maximize revenue unconvincing. If this were case, one would have expected ample evidence of the charging of substantially higher premium prices for business class. There was no such evidence. Rather, the evidence indicates that all of the airlines operating in Argentina repeatedly requested airfare increases throughout the period from 2004 to 2008. This included LAN Argentina, which requested airfare increases, both in its own name and as a member of CLARA: C-75; C-76; C-77; C-967 (report of LAN\u2019s Board of Directors dated May 21, 2008) C-1045 (LAN\u2019s letter of March 11, 2008 to the Secretariat of Transportation).\n\n514.\n\nFinally, the Parties disagree as to whether the Airlines were required to serve specific, less profitable routes. Claimants assert, for example, that while their domestic competitor, LAN Argentina \"was able to select the densest and most profitable routes to serve,\" the incumbent airlines, ARSA and AUSA \"were effectively required also to serve the less desirable routes that LAN was able to avoid.\"504 Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Ricover, testified that while \"there is no legal source\" for this obligation placed on the Airlines, \"[n]ot everything in Argentina is written on paper. Some commitments and some responsibilities are political. And I can tell you for sure that, even if there were no specific requirements on paper, it doesn\u2019t mean that there were not requirements.\"505 Mr. Ricover\u2019s position is supported by the contemporaneous correspondence between the Airlines and Respondent.506\n\nCl.

PHB \u00b6 93, citing Testimony of Professor Donato, Transcript pp. 676-678.\n\n516.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s review of the regulatory framework for domestic airtransport in Argentina indicates that there was no formal requirement on the Airlines to fly specific routes. Accordingly, when applying for concessions, it appears that airline companies could request the specific routes they wished to serve. Further, the regulations permitted competition between airlines on the same routes such that the granting of a particular concession does not appear to have granted any form of monopoly. There was no evidence regarding the conditions under which concessions would be granted and whether servicing other routes was a condition of approval for the granting of a concession. However, the evidence did indicate that ARSA was considered the national flag carrier at the time of privatization and that as part of the privatization process, the Argentine State, as a shareholder, was granted a right of veto over the elimination or substantial reduction of transportation services operated by the company at the time of the public tender.510 It appears that under Iberia\u2019s and SEPI\u2019s control of the Airlines, the latter operated a broad range of routes throughout Argentina. These were covered by concessions which remained with the Airlines in 2001 when Claimants acquired the shares of Interinvest from SEPI. As indicated previously, in 2005 the Secretariat of Transportation renewed ARSA\u2019s concessions to operate a number of routes and deferred the renewal of other concessions which still had a number of years to run.\n\n*See* the By-laws *(Estatuto Social)* of ARSA adopted by Decree 220/90, Anexo 1, \u00a7 VII, \u00b6 34(b): C-6. *See also* the General Transfer Contract *(Concesiones v Autorizaciones)'.* C-63 pp. 1071-1072.\n\n517.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that in 2007 and 2008, the Secretariat of Transportation raised with the Airlines the need to provide and increase the frequency of air transportation to a number of destinations within Argentina.511 It appears to be common ground that the Executive Branch of the Government never made a declaration that any scheduled air services on certain routes or route segments were of special interest to the Nation pursuant to the Air Business Law, Article 6 and Decree 6875/1974, Article 2. Nor did the Airlines request payment of subsidies or compensation pursuant to Article 6 of Law 19,030 and Decree 6875/1971.\n\n*See* C-78/371: letter from the Airlines to the Secretariat of Transportation dated March 26, 2008; C-79: letter from the Airlines to the Secretariat of Transportation dated April 29, 2008. In their letter of March 26, 2008, the Airlines refer to recent meetings with the Secretariat of Transportation over the past few weeks and the Secretariaf s request that the Airlines provide details of the positive impact of the Secretariaf s proposed measures on the maintenance and frequency of various routes.\n\n518.\n\nHowever, in their letters of March 26 and April 29, 2008, the Airlines did advise the Secretariat of Transportation that a number of their routes were unprofitable and that they would be unable to maintain certain routes or the frequency of service of certain routes requested by the Secretariat absent an increase in airfares and other relief, including in certain cases payment for empty seats by the Secretariat.512 The Tribunal also notes that pursuant to ARSA\u2019s by-laws, adopted by Decree 220/1990, and the terms of the 2006 Agreement and Addendum, Respondent, as a shareholder of ARSA, had the right to veto the elimination or substantial reduction of domestic air transportation services.513 Further, and in any event, Claimants\u2019 complaint regarding the uneconomically low airfares relates to fares for all domestic routes during the relevant period, not just to certain specified routes. Respondent\u2019s argument amounts to saying that the Airlines were free to decide to stop operating all of their routes or relinquishing their concessions. In the circumstances, this was not possible. The relevant issue is whether under the domestic legal framework, the Airlines were entitled to charge airfares which would allow them to recover their costs and obtain a reasonable margin of return.514\n\nC-78/371; C-79.\n\nC-6, Annex 1, \u00a7 VII, \u00b6 34(b); C-134.\n\nCl.

(Claimants\u2019 translation)515\n\nC-60.\n\n521.\n\nClaimants interpret Article 42 as establishing a right to charge airfares consistent with the TER.516 As they interpret the language of Article 42, \"after the balancing of all relevant interests (\u2018taking into consideration\u2019), airfares must in all cases be set \u2018in accordance with the concept of an economically reasonable airfare... \"\u2019517 To Claimants, the TER is \"not simply another \u2018interest\u2019 to balance against the interests of the nation, the users and the operators; instead, Article 42 ensures air carriers that the airfares set by the regulator shall not fall below that standard.\"518\n\n*See, e.g..* Cl. Reply \u00b6 119, arguing that not only does Argentine law \"guarantee that airfares are to be set in accordance with the right to an Economically Reasonable Airfare, but it also provides for a methodology by which the regulator is required to calculate airfares in accordance with that overarching right.\"\n\nCl. CC Rej. \u00b652.\n\nCl.

First, it argues that the TER is not a \"right\" that guarantees a particular level of return.522 It asserts that Article 42 provides no guarantee of profitability, let alone a guarantee of a constant total or unitary gross margin in dollars.523 Second, Respondent interprets the specific language of Article 42 as *balancing* the interests of three different elements: \"a) the interests of the country (more access by users, connectivity, the promotion of tourism, etc.), (b) the interests of users (who want a better service price/quality ratio), and (c) the interest of the companies providing the services (who seek to improve their profitability).\"524 It submits as well that Article 42, as properly translated, does not contain the phrase \"in accordance with,\" as Claimants have posited.525\n\nResp.

The Aeronautics Code had been adopted in 1967 and the Air Business Law and Decree 6875/1971 were both adopted in 1971.526 The basic, general provision governing domestic airfares is Article 42 of the Air Business Law which, unlike other laws and regulations governing other regulated services such as gas distribution, water and sewer services, did not provide for a detailed mechanism for the calculation of tariffs and their periodic revision. Further, as Respondent notes, the air transport sector permitted competition and free entry by competitors, unlike other regulated sectors in which a monopoly or oligopoly of regulated services existed.527 While, as discussed below, Decree 6875/1971 provides some guidance on the calculation of economically reasonable airfares (the TER), this is not immediately apparent and its provisions are not entirely clear. The Tribunal also notes that by 2007, the prevailing conditions in the domestic air transportation market had changed such that the regulatory and tax regime was acknowledged to have become antiquated and airfare tariffs had become outdated.528 In addition, it appears that by 2008, due to the complexity inherent in the determination of air transportation costs, the Secretary of Transportation sought external technical assistance to determine the economically reasonable fares for Argentina\u2019s domestic air transportation market.529\n\nRA-2/C-61; RA-304/C-60; C-62.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 375-376.\n\n*See* Bill No. 4982-D-2007, October 23.2007: RA-325 pp. 2/3-3/3. *See also* Decree 1012/2006 which states, in the recitals, that the legal system and the current economic reality were obviously different from those existing at the time the Aeronautical Code was enacted and that both the Code and the Air Business Law were being revised. *See* C-83.\n\n*See* ST Resolution No. 257/2008 of April 11, 2008: C-181/RA-341.\n\n525.\n\nTurning to Article 42 of Law 19,030, the Tribunal finds that the plain language of the text provides that airfares shall be set in accordance with, or by way of the concept of, an economically reasonable tariff (the TER) for each route or route segment. The Tribunal is unable to accept Respondent\u2019s interpretation that the TER is only one of various interests to be considered pursuant to Article 42 of Law 19,030. Rather, the plain meaning of Article 42 of Law 19,030 is that airfares shall be established by way of, or in accordance with, the concept of an economically reasonable tariff which is required to be set in consideration of the interests of the nation, the users, and the operators in respect of each route and route segment. Further, Article 42 of Law 19,030 does not establish any hierarchy between the various interests to be consulted. While Respondent submitted that, properly translated, Article 42 of Law 19,030 does not contain the phrase \"in accordance with\" the concept of an economically reasonable tariff, it does not offer, nor justify, a different translation.\n\n526.\n\nThis interpretation is consistent with the evidence of Claimants\u2019 legal expert, Dr. Bianchi, and Respondent\u2019s legal expert, Dr. Mata, in respect of Argentine administrative law relating to public services, pursuant to which public service tariffs must be \"fair and reasonable\".530 According to Dr. Mata, the \"...tariffs charged must allow the concessionaire, when operating efficiently, to obtain proceeds in an amount adequate to cover the costs of operations, maintenance and expansion of services, as well as for a business profit.\"531\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 28-29 and the sources cited there.\n\nMata ER3 \u00b6 33. *See also* the decision of the Argentine Supreme Court in *Re Maruba,* Bianchi ER2, Ex. 110.\n\n527.\n\nIn addition, the conduct of the Parties also reflects this interpretation. In this regard, the General Transfer Contract, Article II(3)(m) contains a guarantee by Government of Argentina that tariffs for domestic flights would be set according to Articles 42-46 of the Air Business Law.532 Further, in the 2006 Agreement, the Parties agreed that the Government of Argentina, through the exercise of the votes attached to its Class A Shares in ARSA, would have the right to object and block the elimination or substantial reduction of domestic air transportation services provided that compliance with the application of the economically reasonable tariff (Article 42, Law 19,030) was ensured.533\n\nC-63 p. 1075. In addition, the same provision of the General Transfer Contract also provided that in the event the Air Business Law were replaced, the same objectives as those in Articles 42-46 of Air Business Law would be assured.\n\nC-734, quoted above at \u00b6\u00b6 404-406.\n\n528.\n\nFurthermore, a review of the various decrees and resolutions adopted by the Government of Argentina, as well as the bills it submitted to Congress, reflect the obligation to set domestic airfares pursuant to the TER. For example, Decree 1012/2006 expressly provided that the tariff increases granted to update the tariffs set in Decree 1654/2002 were to be considered \"on account of the economically viable [reasonable] fare determined by Section 42 of Law No. 19,030.\"534 Similar references were made in ST Resolution No. 257/2008 and ST Resolution No. 315/2008.535 Finally, the repeated request from the Airlines and from the Airlines Chamber (\"CLARA\") referred to the need for tariff increases in order to achieve an economically reasonable airfare.536\n\nC-83, quoted above at \u00b6 408.\n\nC-181; C-182. Note also C-856, a report prepared for the Secretariat of Transportation, amongst others, regarding the calculation of tariff increases, dated March 25.2008 (the \"MarchReport\"). The March Report qualifies its findings by stating that the study undertaken does not imply that the economically reasonable airfare corresponding to each route or route segment, as identified in Article 42 of Law No. 19,030, lias been identified since, in order to achieve this, the assistance of a team of experts would be required. *See* C-856 p. 2.\n\n*See,* in this regard: the Airlines\u2019 letter of October 20, 2006: C-73; the Airlines\u2019 letter of April 4, 2007: C-74; CLARA\u2019s letter of November 8, 2007: C-77.\n\n529.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the legal regime governing domestic airfares in Argentina, and specifically Article 42 of Law No. 19,030, provided that airfares were required to be set in accordance with the concept of economically reasonable airfares. This concept is consistent with and reflects the Argentine administrative law principle which requires that public service tariffs shall be \"fair and reasonable\".\n\n**(ii) The calculation of the TER**\n-----------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nThe Parties also disagree on the means by which the TER is to be determined. Claimants assert that TER is \"explained\" in Decree 6875/1971, which, according to them, implements the Air Business Law.537 Claimants refer to Article 3 of Decree 6875/1971, which provides that:\n\nThe administrative authority [i.e. the Secretary of Transportation] shall perform the necessary technical and economic studies to determine the economically reasonable airfare for passengers [flights] in all the routes and segments of routes, based on the load factor approved by the administrative authority. The airfare shall cover the direct and indirect exploitation costs for each route or segment of route, to which an additional amount approved for each company shall be added to account for financial costs and a margin of return.538\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 75-77.\n\nC-62.\n\n531.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Articles 4 and 5 of the Decree further specify the mechanism by which the \"four items\" on which the TER is based are to be calculated. Article 4 describes the calculation of \u00b6 direct and 2) indirect costs, while Article 5 describes the calculation of 3) financial costs and 4) the margin of return for the airline.539 Claimants also assert that this decree requires Respondent to conduct annual airfare reviews to ensure that the airfares in force implement the airlines\u2019 right to a TER (Art. 10). Respondent is also permitted to modify airfares between annual reviews if certain changes in costs occur (Art. 6).540\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 117-118. Article 4 provides that \"The direct costs shall be calculated based on the inputs required to perform a correct and efficient operation (fuel and lubricant, air personnel, maintenance, insurances and devaluation). The indirect costs shall globally consist of a percentage of the direct costs, set by the administrative authority [i.e., the Transportation Secretariat], compatible with the national market, the characteristics and evolution of the specific company and pro-rata according to each route or segment of route.\" Article 5 provides that \"The additional [airfare] amount [i.e., in excess of direct and indirect costs] to cover financial costs and profitability shall result from the following: a) As financial cost: interest accruing on the fixed assets allocated to the service, after deducting amortization and the company\u2019s own capital stock, using updated values in all cases, plus interest on the current assets based on a percentage of the updated fixed assets allocated to the service, as fixed by the administrative authority; b) As profitability: interest on the company\u2019s own capital stock [i.e., equity] used for the operation.\"\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 86-87; Cl. Reply \u00b6 128. Claimants note that additional criteria for calculating fair and equitable airfares are set forth in Resolution 357/78 (1978). (Cl. Mem. \u00b6 89; C-64) It is unclear, however, how this Resolution fits with the mechanism described in Decree 6875/1971, or whether the Resolution is still applicable today, 35 years later (the legal distinction between decrees and resolutions is also not entirely clear). The Resolution notes the importance of determining fair and equitable fares, as well as having a methodology to reliably calculate airline costs, and then requires airlines to report their costs using a reporting system. The Resolution requires the Airlines to temporarily use a different cost reporting system in light of their higher costs, and states that these higher costs will be factored into their average fares.\n\n532.\n\nRespondent disagrees with Claimants\u2019 assertion that Decree 6875/1971 applies generally to airfares on all routes. Instead, Respondent asserts that the Claimants confuse the TER concept under Article 42 of the Air Business Law with the concept of economic supplementation or subsidization for unprofitable routes under Article 6 of that same law.541 According to Respondent, Decree 6875/1971 *only* regulates the special circumstances of Article 6 and *not* the general circumstances of Article 42.542 As Respondent explains Article 6 and Decree 6875/1971:\n\n[I]n the event that unreasonable airfares are charged for regular air transport services which are of special interest to the Nation in routes or portions of routes declared to be of general interest, the so-called economic compensation provided for in Article 6 of Law No. 19,030 applies. For the purpose of determining whether the economic compensation should be granted. Article 6 provides that the benefits obtained by domestic carriers in rendering the rest of the regular air transport services awarded, as a result of charging fares that are higher than the reasonable airfare, will offset the economic compensation to be granted. Presidential Decree No. 6875/1971 regulates the method for determining such economic compensation, which is not granted at will, but is subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions[\u2026]543\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 371, 373. The full text of Article 6 is as follows: \"The Executive Branch of the Federal Government shall subsidize national carriers rendering regular air services, thus covering any losses caused by non- Economically Reasonable Airfares for scheduled air services of special interest to the Argentine State, carried out in routes declared of general interest. Profits made by operating the remaining scheduled air services, with higher airfares, will offset any subsidized amounts.\"\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 372; Donato ER2 \u00b6 17.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 641.\n\n533.\n\nIn other words, according to Respondent and its experts, Article 6 is a specialized provision of the Air Business Law by which the Argentine government will subsidize airlines that fly unprofitable routes declared to be of special interest to the state, unless the airline is able to offset any such losses through its other, profitable routes.544 It says that, Decree 6875/1971 supplies the mechanism for determining only that subsidy. Respondent argues, moreover, that carriers are not under a duty to provide services to these unprofitable routes, and they are only entitled to compensation if they meet the necessary conditions under the terms of Article 6.545 Respondent argues that if Claimants considered that the airfares for internal regular air transport services for passengers on certain routes or route segments were unprofitable, they should have requested a subsidy according to the established procedures and conditions.546 Respondent points out that Claimants did not seek \"supplementation\" or \"subsidization\" for specific unprofitable routes, nor did they ever refer to Article 6 or Decree 6875/1971 in their requests for airfare increases.547\n\n*See* Testimony of Professor Marina Donato, Transcript pp. 859-860 (\"One mustn\u2019t confuse this guidance or this mandate that Article 42 gives with what is provided for in Article 6, which refers exclusively within the law that I\u2019ve mentioned.

PHB \u00b6 91.\n\n534.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s arguments on the relevance of Decree 6875/1971, Claimants acknowledge that \"Decree No. 6875/1971 implements the economical compensation mechanism set forth in Article 6 of the Air Business Law\" and that Article 6 of the ABL provides for compensation \"in cases where [the Airlines] sustain losses caused by uneconomical or unprofitable routes, i.e., routes subject to *tarifas no retributivas* or below the TER-standard that are declared by the Government to be of \u2018special interest to the nation[\u2026]\"\u2019548 Claimants then argue that\n\n[T]he effect of Article 6 and Decree No. 6875/1971 as part of the regulatory framework applicable to airfares is twofold: i) these instruments confirm that the right to Economically Reasonable Airfares [ERA] is an overarching right applicable to all routes flown by air carriers, i.e., the economic compensation mechanism derives from the application of the right set forth in article 42 of the Air Business Law [ABL]; further, ii) Decree No. 6875/1971 explains in detail the methodology according to which the regulator must set airfares for them to comply with the [ERA] standard, i.e., it spells out the scope of the right to [ERA] by providing that airfares must cover costs and allow for a fair margin of return in order to meet the legal standard.549\n\nCl. CC Rej. \u00b6 53.\n\nCl. CC Rej. \u00b6 56.\n\n535.\n\nThe heading and preambular language of Decree 6875/1971 indicate that the decree specifically regulates Article 6\u2019s routes of \"special interest\" and the provision of subsidies when these routes incur losses:\n\nSection 6 of the Commercial Air Transportation Policy Law No. 19,030 determines the basic conditions for the Executive Branch\u2019s economic subsidies to domestic air carriers.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe system to be implemented by this regulation should refer to scheduled air services meeting the public interest requirement set forth in Section 6 of Law No. 19,030.\n\nConsidering that its aim is to offset operating losses resulting from air fares approved by the Executive Branch for social or political interests at stake, or from insufficient traffic potential, the economic subsidy system should be timely applied and cover all aspects to ensure the day-to-day operations of the public service concession holders.550\n\nC-62.\n\n536.\n\nTitle II of the Decree, to which Claimants primarily refer, is entitled, in translation: \"Method to Determine the Subsidy for Companies Providing Scheduled Passenger Services.\" The word \"subsidy\" (Respondent translates this as \"supplementation,\" and the term in the original Spanish is *complementation econdmica)* invokes the idea of compensation. However, the language of Article 3, within Title II, does appear to refer to *all* routes, and not only those that are unprofitable or of \"special interest\" and that therefore require subsidization or supplementation:\n\nArticle 3 \u2014 The administrative authority [i.e. the Secretary of Transportation] shall perform the necessary technical and economic studies to determine the economically reasonable airfare for passengers [flights] *in all the routes and segments of routes,* based on the load factor approved by the administrative authority, [emphasis added]\n\n537.\n\nArticles 4 and 5 describe the costs and profitability measurements that are to be considered in determining the TER. Article 6 indicates when the Secretary of Transportation may review the TER during the fiscal year. Only in Article 7 is specific reference made to unprofitable routes: \"The State shall grant subsidies *(complementation econdmica)* to offset the economic losses of public service concession holders arising from fixed fares lower than the economically [reasonable airfare] *(tarifa econdmica retributiva)* for the services set out in Title I hereof.\" Article 7 therefore indicates that in the event that the fixed fare for a given route is set lower than the TER that has been normally calculated for that route, subsidies or compensation may be granted to the airline.\n\n538.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that while Respondent and its expert, Professor Donato, have asserted that a company seeking a subsidy under Decree 6875 must request it after meeting the specified conditions, Decree 6875 seems to call for a slightly different procedure. In Title III of Decree 6875, Rules for Granting an Economic Subsidy, Article 10 provides that:\n\nBefore December 1 of each year the State shall review the fare structure to become effective the following year, taking into account any proposals made by the companies providing the services, which should aim towards becoming self-sufficient. Thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of each period of operation, the administrative authority shall determine the services per routes or route segments for which, in view of the public interest, it is advisable to set a fare lower than the economically reasonable airfare. The companies shall be notified, on the same date, of the aggregate preventive subsidy that will be granted to each of them upon application of the method described under Title II. They may fde their comments within the following fifteen (15) days, and the administrative authority shall issue a final decision.\n\n539.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s review of the relevant provisions of the Air Business Law and Decree 6875/1971 together with the evidence of the Parties\u2019 legal experts indicates that the TER is the fundamental principle applicable to all domestic air routes and is the standard against which Decree 6875/1971 determines whether subsidies or supplementation of airfares declared to be of special interest to the Government of Argentina is warranted. In order to achieve this, Decree 6875/1971 sets out the components of the economically reasonable tariff and provides direction on how those components should be calculated.\n\n540.\n\nPursuant to Article 6 of the Air Business Law, the Government of Argentina is required to subsidize or compensate carriers rendering regular domestic transportation services for losses caused by the application of airfares which are not economically reasonable *(tarifas no retributivas)* or below the TER standard and which have been declared to be of special interest to the Government of Argentina. Decree 6875/1971 implements Article 6 of the Air Business Law and sets out the mechanism for doing so, including the determination of the economically reasonable tariff against which the non-economically reasonable airfare *(tarifas no retributivas tarifas fijadas, que sean inferiores a la tarifa econdmica retributiva)* are measured in order to determine the subsidy or supplementary compensation due (Art. 6 of the Air Business Law and Art. 7 of Decree 6875/1971). As noted above, Article 3 of the Decree provides that the regulatory authority (the Secretariat of Transportation) is directed to undertake the necessary technical and economic studies to determine the TER for passengers [flights] for all routes and route segments. This direction is not specifically directed to non-economical routes of special interest to the Government of Argentina, but appears to apply generally to all routes and route segments. This appears logical since without determining the TER for a given route, it would appear difficult to determine whether the fare for that route was lower than *(inferior)* to the TER.551 Article 3 then goes on to provide that the said airfare (the TER) *(Dicha tarifa)* shall cover the indirect and direct costs of operating the routes or route segments and add an amount for financial costs and an approved margin of return for each operator.\n\nKPMG\u2019s review of the regulatory framework and Decree 6875/1971 is consistent with this. *See* KPMG ER1 \u00b611.2.9.\n\n541.\n\nArticles 4 and 5 of the Decree describe how the direct and indirect costs of operation are to be determined, notably providing that direct costs shall be calculated based on the necessary inputs (fuel, lubricant, air personnel, maintenance, insurance and devaluation) for the correct and efficient operation of the services. The Tribunal notes that this is consistent with Dr. Mata\u2019s evidence on the nature of the TER when he states that the airfare \"must allow the concessionaire, when operating efficiently, to obtain proceeds in an amount adequate to cover the costs of operation, maintenance and expansion of services, as well as allow for a business profit.\"552\n\nMata ER3 \u00b633. This is consistent with the Argentine jurisprudence on the principle of \"just and reasonable tariffs\" in the case of public service concessions. In this regard, *see* Cl. CC. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 58 and the sources cited there.\n\n542.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that while Decree 6875/1971 addressed and implemented the specific regime created by Article 6 of the Air Business Law relating to subsidies for losses incurred by the application of non-economically reasonable airfares on routes declared of special interest to the Government of Argentina, it also sets out the components of the TER and how it should be calculated. It also required the Secretariat of Transportation to conduct the necessary technical and economic studies to determine the TER for all routes and route segments. This is consistent with the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion set out above that under the regulatory framework governing domestic airfares, the TER applies to all domestic routes.\n\n543.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s review of the evidence indicates that the Secretariat of Transportation did conduct a number of studies of airfares during the period from 2001 to 2008, often in response to requests from the Airlines for fare increases and other relief. These will be addressed separately, below. However, there was no evidence that the Secretariat of Transportation, or other governmental agencies, determined the TER for each domestic route or route segment on an annual or regular basis. Further, there was no evidence regarding whether such reviews were carried on at any time prior to 2001.\n\n544.\n\nIn addition, as previously noted, no specific declaration that particular routes were of \"special interest to the Nation\" was made by the Secretariat of Transportation. Further, although the Airlines made repeated requests for increases in the airfares and other forms of relief, there was no evidence that the Airlines, Interinvest or Claimants ever made an application for the granting of subsidies or supplementary compensation pursuant to Article 6 of the Air Business Law and Decree 6875/1971.\n\n***Airfare bands***\n-------------------\n\n545.\n\nAn additional component of Claimants\u2019 arguments on the alleged airfare squeeze is that the airfare band permitted by Argentine regulations during 2001 - 2008 was too narrow, preventing Claimants from implementing an effective yield management strategy. According to Claimants, the airfare band system was implemented in Resolution 275/87, providing a \"base\" or reference airfare and permitting a ceiling above and a floor below this base by a fixed percentage.553 Claimants maintain that while the airfare bands did not permit fully open competition, these measures were designed to permit some degree of competition and to increase management\u2019s ability to make short-term and long-term strategic decisions for the companies.554\n\nC-65; C-66.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 92-95; Cl.

However, Respondent says that the airfare band system existed well before 2001 and continued to apply beyond the period of 2001 to 20 08.557 Further, Respondent says that the existence of the airfare band system did not grant operators the right to demand a certain band width; instead this was within the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation.558 In addition, Respondent says that the airfare band width ratio remained practically the same from the end of 2001 and denies that the band width was expanded after the expropriation of the Airlines.559 According to Respondent, the airfare bands established under the regulatory framework allowed the implementation of yield management strategies in order to obtain the greatest value for each seat.

Respondent maintains that the bad revenue management it alleges was confirmed by the fact that revenue management results were poor inboth domestic flights and international flights which were not subject to airfare bands. Respondent also disputes Claimants\u2019 comparison between the airfare bands in the Argentine regulatory framework to the rates derived from the deregulated Chilean and Peruvian markets.\n\n548.\n\nAs noted previously, the airfare band system was introduced in 1987. Further, the initial airfare bands of a 20% variation were subsequently increased to 60%, briefly reduced to 35% and then re-established at approximately 60% by way of Decree 1654/2002.561 There was no indication that the widths of the airfare bands were subsequently modified by way of resolution or decree until 2012 with the adoption of Resolution No. 23/2012 which introduced an expanded maximum airfare for flights booked less than 10 days before departure. As a result, the Tribunal understands Claimants\u2019 complaint to be based primarily on the lack of an appropriate benchmark or reference tariff *(tarifa de referenda)* rather than a narrowing of the airfare bands as such.\n\n*See* \u00b6387 above and the sources cited there.\n\n**C.

Claimants assert that these numerous requests to increase fares, which they made both on their own and as part of the Argentine airline industry, demonstrate that the fares were set below the TER standard and impeded the Airlines\u2019 ability to cover costs and obtain a fair margin of return.567 Claimants\u2019 expert, Compass Lexecon, says that the fare increases were \"arbitrary in light of the regulatory framework, as none of these increases were based on an estimate of the TER.\"568\n\nCl.

A month later it established a floating exchange rate, and the value of the peso immediately fell on the open market.578\n\nLaw No. 25,561: C-68.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 103.\n\n558.\n\nOn September 4, 2002, Decree 1654/02 Declaring a State of Emergency for Commercial Air Transport provided for the first airfare increase.579 In that decree, the Government of Argentina described the following:\n\nThe costs of the commercial air transport sector include a high percentage of imported inputs; also, the cost of domestic inputs, such as fuel, has also increased.\n\nSpecifically, the causes of the deep-rooted crisis of this sector are, among others, the tight credit that prevents airlines from securing financing, the increase in the price of the type of fuel used, the higher insurance costs, and the direct incidence that exchange rate fluctuations have on the air transport sector. Therefore, it is necessary to expressly declare the emergency of the air transport sector within the framework of Law No. 25,561, to adopt the policies designed to offset existing imbalances that airlines need to continue operating, and, as a result, providing services to users and preserving jobs.\n\nExcessive supply in a market depressed by recession, on the one hand, and prices misaligned with the operational costs of companies, on the other, may give rise to market predatory practices likely to lead to an absurd price-based competition, which in turn may prevent a business from operating safely and profitably, during a reasonable period of time. As a consequence of the above, it is advisable to adjust the current airfare benchmark and price ranges used to determine the prices charged to the public by operators of scheduled domestic air transport for their services, in order to make them consistent with the current costs of the industry.\n\nC-80.\n\n559.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the measures contained in this Decree had been requested by another domestic airline, Dinar, which had requested an average increase of 73% on the maximum fares.580 Respondent notes that ARSA had proposed only smaller increases averaging 34.5%, and that ARSA had critiqued Dinar\u2019s request, \"alleging that such request was not financially viable, and that for increases on current levels to be accepted by users, gradual amendments had to be considered.\"581 According to Respondent, the Government of Argentina ultimately granted an increase of 41% in maximum airfares, and of 45% in minimum airfares.582\n\nRA-334.\n\nResp.

However, it does not appear that this cost index was actually used to assess the fare increase that was ultimately issued in the 2002 Decree (nor, for that matter, is it even clear that Argentina applied this cost index in determining the next fare increase in August 2006 that followed the February 2006 Report).\n\n561.\n\nIn addition to its provisions on airfares, the 2002 Decree also included provisions for the preparation of a bill proposing measures to cut the value-added tax for fuel by 50%, create a VAT exemption for aircraft leased with a purchase option, to permit airlines to use VAT surpluses to pay any other taxes and Social Security obligations, and create a VAT exemption for insurance policies purchased outside Argentina. The Parties appear to agree that these tax provisions were never implemented; their arguments regarding these provisions are addressed below.\n\n***2004: Claimants\u2019 requests denied***\n--------------------------------------\n\n562.\n\nRespondent points out, and Claimants do not refute, that Claimants did not request an additional airfare increase until 2004, two years later.586 In October 2004, Claimants wrote to the Office of Transportation requesting a rise in the reference or cap rate of 8% to account for the increase in the price of fuel.587 This request was rejected in December 2004 on the basis of two Technical Reports (one for each airline) dated October 28, 2004, that were issued by the office of Undersecretary Cirielli.588\n\nResp.

They argue, however, that Argentina wrongly focused on the Airlines\u2019 increased revenues in 2003 rather than their increased costs. Claimants argue that this focus was wrong because \"costs to be taken into account for the purpose of setting the airfares are beyond the airlines\u2019 control, whereas the revenues are at least partially a function of the efficient management of the company,\" and that considering revenues would \"indirectly punish efficient management of airlines and reward or subsidize inefficient management practices.\"589 Claimants argue that such an analysis is \"in clear contravention of the regulatory framework in place.\"590 According to Claimants, Respondent is required to set airfares taking into account the four factors listed in Decree 6875/1971: i) direct costs, ii) indirect costs, iii) financial costs and iv) a margin of return.591 They argue that \"[t]he ability of air carriers to make a reasonable margin of return is one of the objectives of the regulatory framework[\u2026]\"592 Claimants also argue that it was a mistake for Respondent to focus only on the period preceding the request, rather than trending current and future increases in fuel prices.593\n\nCl.

The Reports also found that the cost increases did not affect the financial equation of the companies, which had larger positive margins on the domestic market.594\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 398.\n\n565.\n\nRespondent notes that the Secretary of Transportation prepared two new technical reports, one for each airline, in March 2005 in response to a motion for reconsideration that had been filed by Claimants. These reports concluded that the Airlines had achieved a major recovery in operating profitability.595\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 400; RA-338. In its conclusions, this report stated that the basis for the requested adjustment of the airfares was not only an increase in costs but also a decrease in profitability (p. 3/4).\n\n***2005-2006: Strikes, Government pressure, the June 2006 Agreement and a fare increase***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n566.\n\nAccording to Claimants, two labor unions of the Airlines held a major strike at the end of November 2005. According to Mr. Diaz Ferran, this strike that lasted nine days, \"almost completely shut down the Argentine Airlines,\" and further destabilized the already precarious financial position of the Airlines.596 In this context, say Claimants, the Airlines met in December 2005 with President Nestor Kirchner, Secretary of Transportation Ricardo Jaime and the President\u2019s Chief of Staff to again request an increase in fares.597 According to Mr. Diaz Ferran, the Chief of Staff promised an increase in fares in the first quarter of 2006.598 By March 2006, the fares had not increased. Around this same time, according to Claimants, one Argentine publication reported on the government\u2019s \"secret plan\" to get a hold of the Airlines, and asserted that the government was delaying fare increases in order to further pressure Claimants.599\n\nDiaz Ferran WS \u00b6 28.\n\nCl.

The Parties strenuously disagree on the issue of Respondent\u2019s \"restoration\" of its 5% share in ARSA. See Section 4 for additional information on these arguments.\n\n568.\n\nThe June 2006 Agreement between the Airlines, Interinvest and the Government of Argentina will be discussed further in Section VIII D.4., below. For present purposes, it suffices to note that Claimants consider the \"core\" of their negotiations on this agreement to concern an increase in airfares in exchange for increased Government of Argentina participation and withdrawal of judicial proceedings against ARSA\u2019s financial statements.603 In response, Respondent argues that neither the June 2006 Agreement nor its addendum contained any stipulation regarding a commitment of airfare increases.604 A review of the text of the Agreement and Addendum reveals that neither document addresses airfares or the TER.605\n\nCl.

Claimants also noted in this letter that \"[i]f the provisions of Executive Order 1012/2006 had been applied since it was issued, that is to say, since September 2006 through April 2008, the relevant figures would range between USD 390,000,000 and USD 450,000,000.\" They say that at the May 29, 2008 meeting of ARSA\u2019s Board of Directors, the Government of Argentina\u2019s representatives confirmed the accuracy of the facts described and damages detailed in the April 29, 2008 letter, and stated that \"the National State is aware of this situation.\"619\n\nCl.

Directors Julio Alak and Vilma Castillo took the floor and stated that, because the letter was sent to the Secretary of Transportation on April 29, it can be said that the measures that were therein requested were being gradually implemented, given the synergy between their issue and implementation. They further stated that the Federal Government was aware of the situation and that the ratification took place after the letter had been sent, as a result of which, in their capacity as Directors appointed by the Federal Government, not only were they not unaware of the factual situation but they knew that efforts were being made in that regard.\n\n574.\n\nAround this same time, in March 2008, a report assessing airfares was prepared for the Secretary of Transportation.620 This report was prepared at the request of the Secretary of Transportation in order to provide information in relation to a possible increase in domestic airfares. It reviews the cost increases of the Airlines between August 2006 and December 2007 and notes that it does not estimate the economic retributive tariff [TER] \"corresponding to each route and route segment, as provided in Article 42 of the Law No. 19,030 [Air Business Law], since that requires the assistance of a team of experts that defines the model air carrier for the domestic market.\"621\n\nC-856.\n\nCl.

However, the Tribunal has found that it is based on evidence in the record and admissible.\n\n580.\n\nIn response to this point, Respondent notes that \"increases after July 2008 continued with the [Government of Argentina\u2019s] policy of accompanying cost evolution.\"631\n\nResp.

Under no circumstances did these instructions constitute binding promises.\"635 Argentina notes that several other bills were also proposed concerning the tax benefits mentioned in those decrees.636 Respondent argues that as the decrees themselves indicate, changes on tax matters must be made by Congress, and the executive branch lacks the powers to enact them.637 Finally, Respondent notes that it provided other benefits, including an exemption from the obligation to take out insurance in the country638 and an Aviation Fuel Subsidy Scheme (RCCA) established in 1012/2006 Decree, which led to disbursements in the form of subsidies between August 2006 and February 2008, 95% of which went to the Airlines.639\n\nResp.

CM \u00b6 423.\n\n584.\n\nThe language of the Decrees as it relates to the tax measures is indeed precatory. In this regard, the 2006 Decree states \"[i]t is, therefore, recommended,\" \"[i]t is also considered advisable to authorize,\" \"[t]he impact of aviation fuel on the companies\u2019 cost structure and the increases in costs make it advisable to apply a differential tax treatment[\u2026]\"640 The 2006 Decree also notes that \"[s]ince the recommended tax measures require the enactment of a law, the Ministry of Economy and Production and the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services should be instructed to submit to the Office of the Head of the Cabinet of Argentina within thirty (30) days a bill proposing the approval of such measures, for the Head of the Cabinet to coordinate the action to be implemented as from the issue of this Decree.\"641 As a result, the provisions relating to the preparation of bills regarding tax measures do not amount to a commitment by the Government to implement such measures. However, the repeated measures proposed in addition to airfare increases do reflect that the airfare increases granted were not sufficient, on their own, to permit the Airlines to cover their costs and earn a reasonable margin.\n\nC-83.\n\n*Id.*\n\n585.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the evidence indicates quite clearly that airfare increases did not match increases in the Airlines\u2019 costs. This is usefully demonstrated by Claimants\u2019 experts, Compass Lexecon, in the figure set out below:642\n\nCLEX ER Supp. \u00b6 26. A comparison of this figure with the evolution of the Airlines\u2019 main costs drivers for the period 2008-2013 in CLEX ER3 \u00b6 29 indicates how tariff increases between 2002 and 2008 were insufficient to cover the increase in the Airlines\u2019 costs during that period whereas tariff increases granted from 2009 to 2013 covered and eventually exceeded the increase in the Airlines\u2019 costs for that period.\n\n586.\n\nAccording to Claimants\u2019 experts, over the period between 2001 through to April 2008, costs increased by 182%, but maximum airfares increased by only 43%, when measured in ARS. When measured in USD, the Airlines\u2019 costs fell by only 10.9% while airfares decreased by 36.9%.643 The Tribunal finds this evidence persuasive and is unable to accept Respondent\u2019s position that airfare increases exceeded, let alone covered, the costs of the Airlines during the period in question.644\n\nTranscript p. 1272; CLEX Presentation Slides Nos. 5-6, 25; CLEX ER3 \u00b6\u00b6 36-38. The Tribunal notes that if the April and May 2008 increases are included in the comparison, airfares increased by 100% by the time of expropriation. Claimants say that the increases which took place in April and May 2008 came too late to be of assistance to the Airlines before the July 2008 Agreement.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal accepts the position of Claimants\u2019 experts that Respondent\u2019s analysis is flawed for a number of reasons, notably by estimating the increase in maximum airfares in ARS while representing the evolution of the Airlines\u2019 domestic costs in USD. Claimants\u2019 experts note that over the relevant period, the ARS depreciated by approximately 216%. *See also* Compass Lexecon\u2019s critique at CLEX ER3 \u00b6\u00b6 36-47.\n\n587.\n\nFurther, several of the decrees and resolutions adopted by the Government of Argentina and the Secretary of Transportation reflected an awareness that airfares needed to be increased in order to cover the Airlines\u2019 increasing costs and to meet the TER standard, particularly from 2005 forward. A number of these are referred to above in Section V.645 Further, the provisions in the relevant decrees requesting the preparation of bills on tax matters for submission to Congress reflects the need to adopt measures in addition to airfare increases in order to cover the increasing costs of the industry.646\n\nThe Tribunal notes here the following: Decree 1654/2002; Decree 1012/2006; Decree 257/2008; Decree 315/2008; the Secretariat of Transportation\u2019s Technical Report dated February 16, 2006: C-862; and the March 2008 Report: C-856.\n\nIn this regard, *see* the draft bills of March 19.2003, August 21.2003, March 11.2004, March 14.2004, and October 23, 2007 (RA-322 - RA-327). The latter (RA-325) refers, amongst other tilings, to the important increase in costs, in particular of jet fuel, an antiquated tax and regulatory regime that discouraged investment and outdated airfares, as well as \"...the losses incurred by all domestic flight carriers in Argentina, as a result of regulated airfares, continuous cost increases, poor airfare regulation, etc.\".\n\n588.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes the repeated requests by both the Airlines and CLARA, including its member LAN Argentina, for airfare increases, commencing soon after the airfare increase provided for in Decree 1012/2006 through mid-July 2008. These demonstrate that all of the operators in the air transport industry requested airfare increases and other measures in order to cover their costs and obtain a fair margin of return.647 In this regard, the Tribunal notes in particular the Airlines\u2019 letter of April 29, 2008 to the Secretary of Transportation urging the adoption of airfare increases and other measures and detailing the lost revenue alleged to have flowed from the failure to grant adequate increases and to adopt other proposed measures (C-79). The minutes of the ARSA Board meeting of May 29, 2008 indicate that the government representatives on the Board were aware of the dire economic circumstances of ARSA and approved the text of the letter of April 29, 2008.648\n\nThe various requests for airfare increases and other measures are set out in \u00b6 382 and footnotes 323, and 371 \u00b6 572 and footnote 615, above.\n\nC-86. The minutes record that the Government of Argentina\u2019s representatives stated that the State was aware of the situation. The Tribunal returns to the significance of the April 29, 2008 letter and the Board minutes of May 29, 2008 below.\n\n589.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the domestic airfares regulated by the Secretary of Transportation did not permit airlines operating in the domestic passenger transportation sector to cover their costs and earn a reasonable margin of return. The Tribunal now turns to the question of what effect this had on the Airlines.\n\n590.\n\nRespondent raised a number of arguments to the effect that the airfares in place during Claimants\u2019 ownership of the Airlines between 2001 and 2008 were reasonable and did not detrimentally affect the Airlines. For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal is not persuaded by these arguments.\n\n591.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that the Airlines\u2019 domestic operations, which were the only ones covered by the airfare regime, were healthy and yielded positive results in the period between 2001 and 2008. According to Respondent, the true cause for the Airlines\u2019 losses was their international operations.649 Claimants say that the analysis conducted by Respondent and its experts is flawed for a number of reasons including analyzing the costs and revenues of the two Airlines on a combined basis and over estimating the relevance of international operations thereby overallocating estimated costs and losses to the international operations.650 As a result, Claimants say that Respondent and its experts are wrong in maintaining that the Airlines\u2019 domestic operations cross-subsidized international operations and that their experts significantly inflated losses incurred by the international operations.\n\nResp.

PHB 58-72; CLEX ER Supp. 42-43 and Appendix A; CLEX ER3 42-47. Claimants and their experts also maintain that Respondent\u2019s experts relied on the unaudited financial statements provided by Respondent, whereas Claimants relied on the audited financial statements to the end of 2007.\n\n592.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s review of the detailed expert reports and the relevant evidence leads it to prefer Claimants\u2019 position and the evidence of its experts. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, in examining these questions it is important to distinguish between the data for ARSA and AUSA and analyze their data separately, particularly in light of the fact that AUSA operated almost exclusively domestic routes and that domestic revenues represented approximately 98% of its total revenues. Further, the Tribunal is persuaded by Claimants\u2019 argument that Respondent\u2019s experts, KPMG, did not adequately allocate certain categories of costs and/or revenues to domestic operations but, rather, allocated them entirely to international operations.651 The Tribunal agrees that this affects a fundamental element of Respondent\u2019s experts\u2019 analysis and renders it unreliable.652 As a result, the Tribunal finds Claimants\u2019 expert\u2019s analysis more persuasive and accepts it. In this regard, the Tribunal accepts that AUSA\u2019s costs consistently exceeded revenues for all years in question except 2003 and 2004.653 As a result, the Tribunal concludes that, insofar as AUSA is concerned, domestic revenues did not exceed domestic costs and it does not appear that domestic operations cross-subsidized international operations (which were minimal for AUSA).\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 60-69; CLEX ER Supp.\u00b6 159; CLEX ER3 42-47.\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 62. Claimants give three examples of why the improper allocation of the entirety of three categories of costs/revenues to international operations (\"contracts\"; \"non-commercial\" and \"unassigned\") leads to unreliable results. The Tribunal finds each of these persuasive. It also notes that these examples highlight the importance of analyzing ARSA and AUSA\u2019s costs and revenues separately. In this regard, the Tribunal finds that Respondent\u2019s reasoning that domestic airfares accounted for only 30% of the Airlines\u2019 revenues both irrelevant and misleading. Since AUSA\u2019s domestic revenues represented 98% of its total revenues, the statement that only 30% of revenues for both Airlines combined does not apply to AUSA and is irrelevant. In so far as ARSA is concerned, the statement is inaccurate and irrelevant.\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 67; CLEX ER3 \u00b6\u00b6 44-45. The Tribunal notes that according to CLEX, the positive difference between AUSA\u2019s revenues and costs in USD for 2003 and 2004 is not a direct consequence of adequate level of airfares. Rather, they say that the reason for the positive difference is that AUSA\u2019s load factors from the very low levels of 2001 (58%) increased to the more reasonable levels in 2003 and 2004 (76% and 79%, respectively).\n\n593.\n\nIn respect of ARSA\u2019s costs and revenues, it appears that neither ARSA\u2019s financial statements nor the financial data used by Respondent and its experts permit the reliable allocation of certain categories of revenues and costs between domestic and international operations. In these circumstances, it appears that Respondent\u2019s expert, KPMG, allocated all of these \"unassigned\" categories of revenues and costs to the international segment of ARSA\u2019s business.654 On the other hand, Claimants\u2019 expert, CLEX, maintained that a number of costs and revenues were tagged or identified with the destination of flights and, therefore, could be allocated to either domestic or international segments of ARSA\u2019s business. It goes on to note that other categories of revenues and costs are more difficult to allocate and concludes that it would be reasonable to infer that ARSA\u2019s profitability in the domestic market \"cannot be too dissimilar from what we observe in the case of [AUSA], given the similarities between [ARSA/AUSA]\u2019s domestic operations.\" From this, Claimants\u2019 experts conclude that KPMG\u2019s opinion that the domestic segment of ARSA\u2019s business cross-subsidized international operations was unsupported and inaccurate.655\n\nCLEX ER3 \u00b6 47.\n\nCLEX ER3 \u00b6 47; Cl. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 70-71. In the circumstances. Claimants argue that AUSA\u2019s financial information is the best proxy available to analyze ARSA\u2019s domestic operations in this respect.\n\n594.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Claimants\u2019 expert\u2019s evidence is persuasive and their suggestion that AUSA\u2019s financial information relating to the profitability (unprofitability) of its domestic operations serves as a reasonable proxy for ARSA\u2019s domestic operations is reasonable. As a result, the Tribunal is unable to accept Respondent\u2019s argument that the Airlines\u2019 domestic operations yielded positive results for the period between 2001 and 2008 or that the cause of losses on domestic operations was ARSA\u2019s international operations which were subsidized by the Airlines\u2019 domestic operations.\n\n595.\n\nRespondent also argued that domestic airfares were not uneconomically low because the Airlines did not charge the maximum airfares but, rather, charged airfares which were, on average, 14% below the maximum airfare.656 Claimants say that the fact that not all passengers paid the maximum airfare does not prove that airfares were set at adequate levels in compliance with the TER. Claimants maintain that the fact that airfares charged were, on average, only 14% below the maximum cap, demonstrates the opposite of what Respondent argues.657\n\nResp. CM. 1(406; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 326; KPMGER1 \u00b611.5.11.\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6\u00b674-77.\n\n596.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Claimants\u2019 position is correct. Claimants\u2019 experts demonstrated by way of a mathematical exercise that if the average airfare was 14% below the maximum cap, then the proportion of travelers purchasing flights at the maximum fare was 70%.658 According to Claimants\u2019 experts, the ratio of 70% (or 75%) is significantly above what could be considered a typical proportion of passengers with a high willingness to purchase a ticket at the highest unrestricted fare. They contrasted the high ratio of passengers in Argentina paying the maximum fare to the ratio of 15% in Peru and Chile.659 While the Tribunal accepts that the airfare regimes in Peru and Chile were different during the relevant period, the comparison is instructive. Further, the Tribunal accepts Claimants\u2019 experts\u2019 evidence that a low maximum airfare will prevent an airline from collecting a much higher airfare from those passengers who are prepared to pay a much higher airfare for the convenience of traveling at short notice.660 As a result, the Tribunal cannot accept Respondent\u2019s argument that since average domestic airfares were approximately 14% below the maximum cap, airfares were not uneconomically low.\n\nCLEX ER Supp. \u00b637 and footnote 44. Assuming that all travelers paid either the maximum or the minimum fare. Claimants\u2019 experts calculated that 70% of all passengers would have had to pay the maximum fare in order to achieve an average fare of 14% below that cap. Claimants\u2019 experts compared this figure with the figure of 75% provided by the Argentine Chamber of Commerce in a 2010 study: *see* CLEX ER Supp. \u00b6 37 and the source cited at footnote 46 (LECG Ex. 67, CLEX-06).\n\nCLEX ER Supp. \u00b637 and Figure IV.\n\nTranscript pp. 1280-1281; CLEX Presentation Slide 11.\n\n597.\n\nRespondent also argued that since business class airfares were not covered by the domestic airfare regime, the Airlines could have converted their economy class seats into business seats to maximize revenue, thereby avoiding any constricting effect of maximum economy class fares. For the reasons set out above at paragraphs 505-513 the Tribunal has found that this was not a realistic possibility since business class or premium class seats were included within the airfare regime and maximum airfare caps until the adoption of ST Resolution No. 257/2008.661 As a result, there is no basis to argue that the Airlines could have created a business class with disproportionately higher airfares prior to April 2008 and thereby maximized revenues to offset the effects of the maximum airfare caps.\n\nFurther, to the extent that an informal practice permitting the conversion of economy class seats into business class seats existed, the evidence indicates that it was revenue neutral. Further, there was no indication that this was a wide spread or that it represented a material portion of the Airlines\u2019 domestic seats or revenues. Further, in the context in which all air carriers in Argentina had repeatedly requested airfare increases, it seems highly unlikely that they would have had available the option of creating full business class seats in order to avoid the maximum airfares.\n\n598.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal has considered Respondent\u2019s arguments relating to the efficiency and profitability of the Airlines\u2019 competitor, LAN, as compared to those of the Airlines in order to demonstrate that in the case of an efficient operator the airfares were adequate and permitted a reasonable margin of return.662 In response to this argument, Claimants say that LAN Argentina was not more efficient than the Airlines and that its net income and operating margins were negative for the years 2005 to 2007. They also say that it was only in 2008 that LAN\u2019s net income became positive. Claimants note that 2008 was an exceptional year for the Airlines and that they were only under the Claimants\u2019 control for part of that year. Claimants say that AUSA\u2019s financial performance was, on average, substantially better than that of LAN for the years 2005 through 2008 (even including all of 2008). Relying on their experts, Compass Lexecon and Mr. Ricover, Claimants also maintain that LAN\u2019s business model was different from that of the Airlines in that LAN was able to select the densest and most profitable routes to serve.\n\nTranscript p. 1259; Resp. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 116-119.\n\n599.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent has not demonstrated that LAN Argentina was more efficient than the Airlines nor that it was able to operate more efficiently than the Airlines. In this regard, the Tribunal believes that the proper comparison is between LAN Argentina and AUSA, both of which operated almost exclusively domestically.663 The evidence indicates that from 2005 to 2007, LAN Argentina had negative income and negative operating margins and that it was only in 2008 that these turned positive (net income of USD 13,503,000 and operating margin of 8%).664 Further, from 2005 to 2007, AUSA\u2019s ratio of operating costs to revenues was substantially better than that of LAN Argentina. The Tribunal accepts that 2008 was an exceptionally difficult year for the Airlines and that they were only (fully) managed by the Claimants until the July 2008 Agreement. As a result, some allowance must be made in considering 2008. In addition, the Airlines, as flagship carriers, served a broad range of domestic routes. Further, elimination or substantial reduction of those routes was restricted by Decree 6875/1971, at the time of privatization, and the 2006 Agreement. On the other hand, when LAN entered the Argentine market in 2005, it decided to focus almost exclusively on the ten densest routes.665\n\nAs described above, AUSA operated almost exclusively domestically and 98% of its revenues were generated from domestic flights.\n\nCLEX ER Supp. \u00b6\u00b6 49-50 and Table IV.\n\nCLEX ER Supp. \u00b651 and Table IV. Compass Lexecon states that the Airlines served more than 30 domestic routes (CLEX ER1 \u00b6 45). As also described above, the Government of Argentina exerted some pressure on the Airlines to maintain all their routes, particularly those to more remote regions, and to increase frequency of flights.\n\n600.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that LAN also requested increases of the airfares, both on its own and as part of CLARA.666\n\nC-75; C-76; C-77; C-1045 pp. 40-41. In its letter of March 11, 2008, LAN appears to respond to requests from the Secretary of Transportation to provide information on its operations for 2008 in light of airfare increases being considered by the Secretariat. In commenting on the contemplated increases, LAN stated that the airfare increases should be substantially higher than the proposed 20% to 24% increase of the maximum airfare plus fuel subsidies in order to truly permit the airline industry to achieve growth and coverage adequate to the size of the country and in line with the increase with Argentine GDP over the past few years. LAN also stated that while permitting greater revenues for the airline companies was vital for their survival, it was also necessary to address the fundamental issues faced by the industry, including the adoption of the bills specified in Decree 1012/2006, amongst other tilings.  \n*See also* C-967: Report of LAN Argentina\u2019s Board of Directors dated May 21, 2008. In that report, LAN\u2019s Board of Directors stated that the airfare increases granted in April and May 2008 were not sufficient to achieve sustainable profitability in the long term and that the Board had worked with the Argentine authorities to design an additional package of measures, both of regulatory and tax nature, which would permit the improvement of the economic situation of the airline industry which, to date, had not been implemented. *See* p. 2 of the Board\u2019s report to shareholders.\n\n601.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal is not persuaded that LAN\u2019s activity in Argentina between the years 2005 to 2008 demonstrates that it operated more efficiently than AUSA or that the airfares in place at the time permitted an efficient operator to cover its costs and generate a reasonable profit.\n\n602.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to examine Respondent\u2019s other argument that Claimants\u2019 alleged mismanagement of the Airlines was the cause of their poor performance and the dire situation in which they found themselves in July 2008.\n\n**2. Claimants\u2019 Management of the Airlines**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n603.\n\nRespondent makes a number of arguments with respect to Claimants\u2019 management (or alleged mismanagement) of the Airlines during the 2001 to 2008 period of their ownership. Respondent\u2019s arguments appear to be directed towards three key contentions: first, that far from investing in the Airlines, Claimants damaged the Airlines almost to the point of irreparability; second, that Respondent was forced to intervene and take control of the Airlines because a vital public interest was imperiled; and third, the airfares were fair and reasonable and that it was due to Claimants\u2019 inefficiency and poor management that the Airlines lost money and were in a dire condition in July 2008.\n\n604.\n\nThe first contention is closely linked to Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim, in which Respondent claims damages for the alleged harm done to the Airlines as the result of Claimants\u2019 deficient management. Respondent argues that Claimants\u2019 business management of the Airlines was \"predatory\"667 and that the Marsans Group \"acted as a parasite of the Airlines, taking advantage of them, extracting all it could from them, and leaving them in appalling conditions and at the doors of bankruptcy.\"668\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 263.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 73.\n\n605.\n\nThe second contention is closely linked to Respondent\u2019s defense to Claimants\u2019 Claim, particularly with respect to Respondent\u2019s arguments regarding the legality of its expropriation of the Airlines. Respondent asserts that Claimants \"did not comply with the Argentine regulatory and company laws by engaging in a conduct that was terribly detrimental to the Argentine Airlines.\"669 As a result, the Argentine State was forced \"to take control of an airline that was totally abandoned, which, in turn, implied a risk for the country\u2019s connectivity.\"670\n\nResp. CM \u00b6264.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 266.\n\n606.\n\nThe third contention relates to Respondent\u2019s defense to Claimants\u2019 claim that the airfares set during the relevant period were not in compliance with the TER standard and hindered the Airlines\u2019 ability to operate efficiently and earn a reasonable margin.671\n\nResp. CM \u00b6269; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 80 and 834.\n\n**General arguments regarding Claimants\u2019 performance**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n607.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants neglected the Airlines during their tenure \"to such an extent that they are almost irreparable.\"672 Respondent points to a variety of practices it alleges led to the Airlines\u2019 poor condition by July 2008, including inefficient fleet maintenance, an aging and heterogeneous fleet, asset-stripping, cannibalism of aircraft, obsolete computer systems, a lack of revenue management policies, and isolation from global strategic alliances systems, among other practices.673\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 268.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6269; Resp. Rej. \u00b680.\n\n608.\n\nRespondent asserts that far from providing valuable \"synergies\" through the network of Marsans Group companies, \"Claimants had nothing to offer to the Airlines.\"674 Respondent argues that the improved results of the Airlines between 2002 and 2005 were absolutely unrelated to Marsans\u2019 management. Rather, according to Respondent, the positive results during that period were caused by the cost dilution resulting from the devaluation, the disappearance of two competitors, and the recovery of the local domestic market.675\n\nResp.

The Tribunal will return to these arguments, to the extent necessary, below, when it addresses Claimants\u2019 expropriation claim and Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim.\n\n**Fleet management practices**\n------------------------------\n\n612.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the management of the Marsans Group was characterized by a complete lack of investment in the fleet and poor maintenance of it.685\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b681.\n\n613.\n\nFirst, Respondent argues that Claimants acquired obsolete aircraft for the Airlines\u2019 fleet. Consequently, asserts Respondent, the Airlines had the oldest fleet in the market, with an average age of 20 years, thus doubling the age of the aircraft of other companies in the market, the average age of which was between five and ten years.686 Respondent asserts that Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Ricover, who asserted that the Airlines\u2019 fleet age was comparable with other large legacy airlines, wrongly cherry-picks the data. It asserts that in reality, the average age of the fleet of British Airways and United Airlines is lower.687 Respondent argues that the acquisition of old aircraft resulted in higher fuel consumption, higher maintenance costs and inventory problems, among other inefficiencies.688\n\nResp.

Rej. \u00b6 101-102, citing KPMG ER2,\u00b612.1.12; Wyman ER, \u00b62.7.\n\n614.\n\nSecond, Respondent asserts that the Airlines\u2019 fleet included different types and subtypes of aircraft, which resulted in an inefficient management of the company, as well as in higher maintenance, crew and other costs.689 It notes that by 2008, the Airlines had eight different types of aircraft.690 Respondent argues that fleet heterogeneity entails higher costs because a larger aeronautical material stock variety is required to maintain it, given the diversity of parts of the different aircraft. It also asserts that crew expenses are greater given that it is impossible to use the same crew on different fleets.691 Finally, Respondent asserts that although the Airlines had the same number of \"cockpit commonalities\" as United Airlines and American Airlines, these latter airlines have much larger fleets than the Airlines.692\n\nResp.

PHB \u00b6187.\n\n615.\n\nThird, Respondent asserts that Claimants engaged in \"cannibalizing\" the Airlines\u2019 fleet. \"Cannibalization\" is the practice of dismantling aircraft and using the parts on other aircraft in the fleet. Respondent argues that rather than streamlining inventory pools and planning carefully, the Airlines\u2019 maintenance practices involved finding and using parts off of existing aircraft and engines. As such, engines were in storage for months waiting for overhaul.693 Respondent asserts that in 2008 half the fleet was out of service due to cannibalization.694\n\nWyman ER \u00b6 **6.54.**\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b684, 91.\n\n616.\n\nFourth, Respondent asserts that the Airlines took poor care of the planes they leased. According to Respondent, this made it impossible for them to return to the lessor.695 Respondent argues that the leased airplanes not only failed to meet the required technical conditions, but also had unpaid rent and penalties, which made their redelivery impossible. Respondent asserts that even airplanes in good technical condition had incurred such a degree of contractual infringement due to unpaid rent that lessors could not accept their redelivery.696\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 302, 308-312.\n\nResp.

It states that at this time, only three out of 24 of the Airlines\u2019 owned planes were operative, and only 31 out of 62 of the Airlines\u2019 leased planes were operative.697\n\nResp.

First, they rely on the evidence of their expert, Mr. Ricover, that the average age of the Airlines\u2019 fleet was comparable with that of other major airlines, including American, British and United.698 They note that the Government of Argentina acquired or leased even older aircraft for Airlines after the 2008 nationalization.699 Moreover, Claimants argue that fleet age should not be confused with fleet efficiency.700 Mr. Ricover asserts that\n\n[E]ven though the average fleet age increased significantly between 2006 and 2008, utilization remained virtually unchanged. In addition, even though fleet age decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008, utilization fell as well. The data presented shows no conclusive evidence on the relationship between fleet age and utilization. Automatically concluding that an older fleet would be less efficient is therefore misguided.701\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 86, citing Ricover ER1, \u00b6\u00b6 44-48.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 87.\n\nCl.

Reply \u00b6\u00b690-91.\n\n620.\n\nSecond, with respect to Respondent\u2019s contentions concerning the heterogeneity of the Airlines\u2019 fleet and the inefficiencies this created, Claimants argue that in fact the Airlines were comparable to competitors. Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Ricover, explained that the proper way to assess fleet homogeneity from an airline management perspective is to measure the level of \"cockpit commonality\"\u2014namely, the ability to operate different types of aircraft within the same fleet by using the same type-rated crews. Mr. Ricover asserts that all of AUSA\u2019s aircraft presented the same type-rating and could thus be operated by the same crews, and that ARSA\u2019s fleet was similarly homogeneous with only five cockpit types, a similar level to most international carriers.703\n\nCl. CC Rej. \u00b634; Ricover ER2 \u00b6 46-48 and Fig. 7.\n\n621.\n\nThird, with respect to what Respondent characterizes as \"cannibalization,\" Claimants assert that this is, in fact, the widely-encountered practice of airlines managing their spare parts inventory between different aircraft.704 Claimants state that aircraft are composed of numerous components that are designed to be interchangeable and easily removed and replaced. Instead of immobilizing an entire aircraft when one of its engines requires or undergoes maintenance, an airline can install another engine on that aircraft (which, for instance, can come from another aircraft whose mainframe or landing gear is undergoing maintenance at the same time) to maximize the operational efficiency of the fleet. Claimants assert that this is a widespread practice.705\n\nCl. CC Rej. \u00b636.\n\nCl. CC Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 37-38.\n\n622.\n\nFourth, with respect to Claimants\u2019 maintenance of aircraft leased by the Airlines, Claimants assert that some of the planes had been leased to ARSA before Claimants took over, and on leases to be returned after 2011. Claimants argue therefore that that they cannot be held accountable for the condition of these planes in late 2011.706\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 85.\n\n**Information and revenue-management systems**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n623.\n\nRespondent and its experts claim that the information systems used by Claimants at the Airlines, which included core systems and equipment, networking electronics, base software, service infrastructure, administration systems, and human resources were outdated.707\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 289; *see also* Wyman ER, \u00b6 6.4.\n\n624.\n\nRespondent also asserts that the revenue management systems used by Claimants were outdated. These systems are intended to set the guidelines for the adequate commercialization of tickets and, based on complex mathematical calculations, provide for the correct value of a ticket, taking into account how far in advance they are booked. In other words, revenue management permits airlines to sell to the right customer at the right moment at the right price.708 Respondent submits that without up-to-date revenue management, the Airlines were hindered in their ability to support activity growth, ensure continued services, and allow for the development and deployment of new updates and new-technology-application projects.709 Respondent also asserts that the Airlines paid their web-booking engine service provider more than twice the rates proposed by a competitor entity.710\n\nResp.

They argue, moreover, that the Airlines \"benefitted from state-of-the-art IT and revenue management systems\" through the Marsans Group. They assert that the only reason Respondent had to incur expenses with respect to revenue management after nationalization was because the Airlines could no longer access the systems that the Marsans Group had used.711\n\nCl.

CM \u00b6298.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6300.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6126.\n\n627.\n\nClaimants assert, in response, that an overwhelming majority of delays and cancelations resulted from the Government of Argentina\u2019s pressure on Claimants through the unions, which was abetted by Undersecretary of Aero-commercial Transportation, Ricardo Cirielli, and the Kirchner administration.715 Claimants also argue that it was Respondent\u2019s policy of \"Re-Argentinization\" that led to the Airlines\u2019 \"financial agony\" during the final years of Claimants\u2019 management.716\n\nCl.

Reply \u00b6265.\n\n**Failure to rejoin the IATA Clearing House**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n628.\n\nRespondent asserts that the Airlines were disadvantaged by not belonging to the International Air Transportation Association (IATA) Clearing House. According to Respondent\u2019s expert witness:\n\n[T]he Airlines\u2019 lack of participation in global airline alliances and injoint ventures and/or code share agreements was a significant inhibitor of international expansion opportunities. All carriers included in the benchmark were members of the IATA Clearing House, which provides a \"competitive, seamless secure service providing an efficient on-time settling of interline accounts between the world\u2019s airlines, airline-associated companies and travel partners.\" The service allows for over 450 airlines and participants to settle their accounts through this service. Without participation as a member in the IATA Clearing House, the Airlines were unable to effectively leverage partnerships that nearly all airlines utilize. In our experience, most major airlines participate in the Clearing House, and absence from it is a significant anomaly and can be representative of management challenges.717\n\nWyman ER, \u00b6 6.2.4.\n\n629.\n\nFor their part, Claimants assert that ARSA\u2019s temporary suspension from the IATA Clearing House did not mean that it could not negotiate or enter into passenger distribution agreements with other airlines. Rather, these settlements were paid directly between the companies and not through a central clearing house.718 Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Ricover, states that not having direct access to the IATA Clearing House did not particularly affect ARSA because most of its activity involved selling point to point tickets between Argentina and the international destinations, with very little traffic traveling beyond those points.719 Moreover, Claimants note that the Airlines were still a part of the IATA, which enabled their flights to be booked on any booking page.720 Finally, Claimants argue that ARSA only regained membership in the IATA Clearing House in 2011, three full years after the Government took control of the Airlines.721\n\nCl\u2019 Reply \u00b6 75.\n\nCl.

Respondent points to what it alleges was a practice of leasing aircraft from ARSA\u2019s and AUSA\u2019s fleet for the benefit of other Marsans Group companies, including Air Comet Espana and Air Comet Chile.722 Respondent alleges that when these aircraft were returned, they were \"in a disastrous condition.\"723 Respondent also asserts that Air Comet would use ARSA aircraft for charter flights, on routes that were inefficient for ARSA, with the costs of fuel, flight crews and attendants borne by ARSA.724\n\nResp.

Respondent alleges that Claimants unified sales and operations of OPTAR with the rest of the Marsans Group in order to take the following alleged measures: the lease of OPTAR\u2019s real estate to Marsans Internacional Argentina S.A. at a \"ridiculous\" price, the Operation and Sale Structure Unification Agreement, the assignment of OPTAR\u2019s administration to Marsans, the transfer of a large amount of OPTAR\u2018s personnel to Marsans, as well as other actions evidencing the existence of an asset stripping.725\n\nResp. CM \u00b6322.\n\n632.\n\nWhat Respondent asserts amounted to \"asset-stripping,\" Claimants argue was the strategic use of beneficial \"synergies\" between Marsans Group entities.726 Claimants deny that the Marsans Group leased planes between its entities in a way that damaged the Airlines. They assert that the planes that ARSA leased to Air Comet were ones that ARSA could not use efficiently, given their age and high fuel consumption. Air Comet, on the other hand, could use them on shorter routes, and paid a monthly lease for them. In short, according to Claimants, Air Comet was able to use ARSA\u2019s planes that would have otherwise been grounded.727 Claimants point to other leases on idle aircraft between ARSA and Air Comet, which they assert were \"very profitable for ARSA.\"728 Finally, Claimants note that Air Comet occasionally chartered inactive ARSA aircraft, for which Air Comet paid an hourly cost at arm\u2019s-length prices and generated significant income for ARSA.729\n\nCl.

As noted previously, after the conclusion of the SPA, under Claimants\u2019 management the Airlines\u2019 operations and financial situation improved substantially until, it appears, the Airlines\u2019 costs (notably for jet fuel and salaries) commenced their sharpest increase in 2004.\n\n635.\n\nIn October 2001, when the SPA was concluded, the Airlines\u2019 operations had almost stopped completely. The Airlines\u2019 liabilities exceeded USD 1 billion and forecasted operating losses for 2001 exceeded USD 350 million. Further, ARSA had been in insolvency proceedings since before SEPI\u2019s privatization process had commenced. In addition, ARSA had only one international destination which it serviced and approximately only 17 operational airplanes. The Airlines\u2019 market share had also fallen to less than 20% of the Argentine market.731 Finally, it was apparent that Respondent was not prepared to contribute funds to assist ARSA and was not prepared to place the Airlines under state ownership.732\n\n*See* Cl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 45-46 and the sources cited there.\n\nBastos WS \u00b621.\n\n636.\n\nCommencing in 2002, the situation of the Airlines improved rapidly. As noted previously, in December 2002, ARSA and the majority of its creditors agreed on a plan of debt restructuring and by the end of 2004 ARSA had repaid the majority of its debt and was relieved from its obligations under its re-organization proceedings.733 Further, despite the challenging economic conditions, the Airlines\u2019 revenues and market share increased substantially. Its market share improved from approximately 32% at the end of 2001 to 81% in 2004. In addition, the Airlines\u2019 net income improved substantially from 2002 through 2004 such that both Airlines had positive net revenues in each of those years.734 The Airlines also expanded and improved their fleet.735 Finally, ARSA\u2019s concessions, whose expiry dates were approaching, were renewed by the Secretariat of Transportation in 2005.736\n\n*See* \u00b6 379 and the sources cited there.\n\n*See* Cl. Mem. \u00b6 47 and the sources cited there; \u00b6 380, above.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 44-45; \u00b6 381, above.\n\n*See* \u00b6 393. above, and the sources cited there.\n\n637.\n\nAll of this evidence supports Claimants\u2019 position that the Airlines were operated efficiently and that they were sufficiently well managed to achieve significant improvement at both an operational and financial level. The Tribunal is unable to accept Respondent\u2019s position that this improvement was due solely to other factors such as the devaluation of the Argentine peso and the recovery of the market. While these, and other factors, may have been of some influence, the Tribunal is not persuaded that these were the primary factors in the improvement of the situation of the Airlines. Further, during the course of 2004, the Airlines\u2019 costs, notably for jet fuel, commenced a very sharp increase which continued through 2008. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the mismatch between these increasing costs and domestic airfares described above had a substantial impact on the Airlines\u2019 operational and financial management and their ability to manage more generally.\n\n638.\n\nCommencing with the Airlines\u2019 fleet management practices, the Tribunal has found the evidence of Claimants\u2019 experts, Compass Lexecon, and their industry expert, Mr. Ricover, persuasive. Amongst other things, the Airlines\u2019 revenue-passenger kilometer (\"RPK\") appears to have increased substantially from 2001 through 2005.737 Similarly, the Airlines\u2019 available seat-kilometer per employee ratio also increased substantially from 2001 through 2005.738 Further, it appears that the Airlines were, in fact, more productive than their regional competitors, TAM, LAN and Gol.739\n\nRicover ER1 \u00b628 and Figure 3.\n\nRicover ER1 \u00b632 and Figure 4; Ricover ER2 \u00b6 27-30 and Figure 6.\n\nCl. CC. Rej. **1** 32; Ricover ER2 \u00b6 21-26.\n\n639.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered Respondent\u2019s arguments regarding the age and heterogeneity of the Airlines\u2019 fleet. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent\u2019s complaints in this regard do not demonstrate that the Airlines\u2019 fleet was unduly old or heterogonous such that their efficiency would be affected more than other comparable airlines or that the age of the Airlines\u2019 fleet or the number of different aircraft which composed it constitutes evidence of poor management. In this regard, the Tribunal finds the evidence of Mr. Ricover persuasive, despite Respondent\u2019s criticism of his evidence.740 Although Mr. Ricover\u2019s evidence on these issues was not initially clear in light of amendments made to his report, this did not appear to affect its effect. For example, while Mr. Ricover did not calculate the average age of the entire fleet of British Airways and United Airlines, which was lower than the age of the Airlines\u2019 fleet, he selected comparable categories of aircraft and compared these.741 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the use of comparable aircraft appears reasonable in the circumstances. Mr. Ricover\u2019s evidence tended to indicate that the age of the Airlines\u2019 fleet was not out of line with that of the other airlines to which they were compared insofar as comparable aircraft were concerned.\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 184-189.\n\nTranscript pp. 765-771, 786-787.\n\n640.\n\nThe Tribunal has also noted the point made by Respondent that Mr. Ricover attached draft financial statements for 2007 to his reports although by the time he testified, the audited financial statements were available. However, it does not appear that any relevant information upon which he relied differed between the draft and the audited financial statements.742 With respect to the alleged heterogonous nature of the Airlines\u2019 fleets, it appears that the Airlines had a similar number of cockpit types as other airlines with much larger fleets. This tends to indicate that those airlines had the potential to be more efficient given the larger number of aircraft which could be operated by the same cockpit crews. However, Mr. Ricover also noted that other airlines had significantly more cockpit types and yet operated very efficiently.743 As a result, Respondent\u2019s criticism is not conclusive. Further, the Tribunal notes that many of the aircraft that the Airlines operated between 2001 through 2008 had been in service for some time and it could be expected that it would take some time to renew the fleet and, in doing so, achieve higher cockpit commonality. While the Airlines had started a process of renewal of the fleet by sourcing aircraft from Airbus, they were unable to complete the large purchase of further aircraft from Airbus and their integration into the fleet.\n\n*See;* Transcript pp. 754-760, 786-787.\n\nRicover ER2 \u00b6 48 and Figure 7; Transcript pp. 773-777. Mr. Ricover noted that all of AUSA\u2019s aircraft presented the same type rating and could therefore be operated by the same crews. *See* Ricover ER2 \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.\n\n641.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered Respondent\u2019s other criticisms of the Airlines\u2019 fleet management practices, including the alleged \"cannibalization\" of parts and maintenance of leased aircraft. With respect to the former, the practice of \"cannibalization\" appears to be a common practice in the airline industry.744 However, from the evidence, the Tribunal is unable to determine whether the practice by the Airlines was greater than for comparable airlines in the industry.\n\nCl. CC. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 36-39 and the sources cited there.\n\n642.\n\nWith respect to the maintenance of leased aircraft, the Tribunal accepts that as at December 2008, a number of leased aircraft were in poor condition such that they failed to meet the required technical conditions for return to the lessor. In addition, it appears that unpaid rent and penalties were due.745\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 91; RA-434; RA-279. It appears that in all but one case, the aircraft in question were leased prior to Claimants\u2019 investment in the Airlines and that the earliest expiry date of the leases was in October 2008, with the balance of the leases expiring in 2009 and 2010: *see* RA-434 p. 2/16. The ARSA internal report goes on to state that as at the end of December 2008, only three of the nine B737-200s were in operation. It appears that: two of the aircraft in question had been out of operation since April and July 2006; two aircraft in question had been out of operation since January and July 2007; and one aircraft in question had been taken out of operation for scheduled maintenance in April 2008. Further, it appears that one of the aircraft was sub-leased to Aerolineas Austral Chile S.A. (a subsidiary of Air Comet). The report also records that as of its date (April 12.2011), five of the aircraft were in storage at various airports in \"high degree of deterioration and cannibalism\".  \n It appears that, in the end, the dispute between the Airlines and the lessor was resolved by way of an agreement in which the Airlines acknowledged the debt for outstanding rents, penalties and interest on arrears (in the amount of USD 11,468,242.80): *see* Resp. CM \u00b6305.\n\n643.\n\nWith respect to the Airlines\u2019 suspension from the IATA Clearing House, the Tribunal finds that this had a more limited effect on the Airlines during the period of Claimants\u2019 management than suggested by Respondent. First, the Tribunal notes that throughout the entire relevant period, both Airlines remained members of IATA and it was only their access to the IATA Clearing House which was suspended due to an outstanding debt incurred prior to October 2001. Further, it appears that the Airlines had access to IATA\u2019s billing and settlement plans through the Marsans Group.746 As a result, the Airlines had access to IATA and were able to clear payments through the Marsans Group. It also appears that ARSA was able to enter into various distribution agreements with other airlines. Finally, the Tribunal notes that under Respondent\u2019s management, ARSA only re-acquired its membership in the IATA Clearing House in 2011. As a result, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the failure to re-instate the Airlines\u2019 membership in the IATA Clearing House demonstrates the poor management of the Airlines alleged by Respondent.\n\nMunoz Perez WS3 \u00b617.\n\n644.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered Respondent\u2019s allegations of \"asset stripping\" relating to what it alleges was a practice of leasing aircraft from ARSA\u2019s and AUSA\u2019s fleets for the benefit of other Marsans Group companies. Respondent alleges that these leases were not in the Airlines\u2019 economic interest and that the leased aircraft were returned in poor condition. The Tribunal\u2019s review of the relevant evidence does not establish Respondent\u2019s allegations. The explanations supplied by Claimants in respect of the leasing which Respondent impugns appear to make business sense and to have generated revenue for the Airlines.747 The Tribunal is unable to conclude on the basis of the limited evidence presented that Claimants engaged in \"asset stripping\" in favor of other Marsans Group companies as alleged.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 80-84.\n\n645.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered Respondent\u2019s allegations with respect to merging the management of Optar S.A. with Marsans\u2019 International Argentina. Claimants explained that this was done instead of leaving the two businesses separate and competing against each other. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Argentine Secretariat of Tourism authorized the unification of the management of the two companies\u2019 operations in the same premises.748 In support of its allegations, Respondent relied on an internal report to the General Management of the Airlines dated February 3, 2012.749 While this report makes a number of detailed allegations, there is no direct evidence of the alleged favorable treatment of Marsans International by way of the alleged favorable lease of Optar S.A.\u2019s premises, assignment of Optar S.A.\u2019s administration and the transfer of Optar S.A.\u2019s personnel to Marsans International as well as other actions alleged to evidence \"asset stripping\". As a result, the Tribunal is unable to reach any firm conclusion in respect of these allegations.\n\nResolution No. 1122, November 17, 2004: RA-283. *See also;* Operation and Sale Structure Unification Agreement dated July 28, 2004: RA-282.\n\nRA-281.\n\n646.\n\nRespondent also criticized the information and management systems used by the Airlines under Claimants\u2019 management, supported, in part, by its industry expert, Oliver Wyman. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, while updating and improvements to the systems used by the Airlines could well have been made, this does not necessarily demonstrate mismanagement by the Airlines or Claimants. In reviewing the evidence of Respondent\u2019s expert with respect to information and revenue management systems, the Tribunal notes that during the period of Claimants\u2019 management of the Airlines, the latter had access to and used the information technology and revenue management systems of the Marsans Group. This included, for example, access to the flight booking system used by the Marsans Group, Amadeus. While there were other systems available at the time, some of which appear to have been less expensive, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the Airlines\u2019 reliance on the Amadeus system constitutes mismanagement.750\n\n*See* Wyman ER \u00b6 6.3.4.1 which points out the major available systems at the time, including Amadeus. The experts go on to say that the Airlines were paying Amadeus more than twice the web booking engine rates proposed by one of its competitors. Sabre. No details for this were provided in support.\n\n647.\n\nRespondent\u2019s expert also made a number of other criticisms of the Airlines\u2019 sales and marketing systems and costs.751 These appear to indicate that the Airlines were paying higher average commissions to distributors with a point of sale in Argentina (an average of 6%, as compared to the market average of 4% to 5%). They also indicated that other carriers had moved to a lower base commission rate (1%) versus the Airlines\u2019 3% base commission rate during the time of their engagement.752 The Tribunal accepts that improvements could have been made to the Airlines\u2019 systems and that these may have improved the Airlines\u2019 revenue. However, the Tribunal is unable to determine with any certainty what impact this had.\n\n*See,* for example, Wyman ER \u00b66.3.4.\n\nWyman ER \u00b6 6.3.4. With respect to the latter, the Tribunal notes that Oliver Wyman\u2019s engagement commenced in October 2009. As a result, it is hard to determine precisely what the base commission rates for the comparative airlines were prior to that time or what steps, if any, the Airlines took in regard to base commissions in 2009, or subsequently.\n\n648.\n\nRespondent relied on the evidence of its expert, Oliver Wyman, in respect of the many criticisms it makes of Claimants\u2019 management of the Airlines. From its review of that evidence and that of Claimants\u2019 expert, Mr. Ricover, as well as, to a certain extent, Compass Lexecon, the Tribunal accepts that a number of improvements could have been made to various aspects of the Airlines\u2019 operations and management. In other cases, the Tribunal does not accept that the evidence supports Respondent\u2019s criticisms. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that Oliver Wyman was retained in October 2009 and that its evidence is based on its observations from that point forward.753 Further, Oliver Wyman relied primarily on the data for the Airlines for the year 2008 as the basis for its report.754 As a result, Oliver Wyman did not examine the state of the air transport industry in Argentina, including the regulation of domestic tariffs, prior to 2008.755 Further, Oliver Wyman was apparently not aware that the commercial air transport sector was in a declared state of emergency from 2002 through 2008, nor of the fact that other airlines (LAP A, Dinar and Southern Winds) had gone out of business during that time.756\n\nTranscript pp. 824-826.\n\nTranscript pp. 832-833. Mr. Krishnan stated as follows:  \n We were not explicitly instructed as such. But our focus was to, as I mentioned in my PowerPoint presentation, to first just describe the state of the Airlines as we found them, and then look at a path forward. So we did not spend any time exploring time periods prior to \u201908.\n\nTranscript pp. 835-836. It does not appear that Oliver Wyman was aware of the levels at which airfares had been set, nor the effect that these might have had on the performance of the Airlines. According to them, \"there were ways in which the Airlines could manage its way to break even without the tariff structure ever changing.\" In Oliver Wyman\u2019s view, the airfares were not \"...one of the drivers of the Airlines\u2019 unprofitability.\" *See* Transcript pp. 836, 846-847.\n\nTranscript pp. 838 - 839.\n\n649.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that the evidence of Oliver Wyman must be tempered. While it was highly critical of the Airlines\u2019 management and performance, it does not appear that the entire relevant context was examined in arriving at these conclusions. Further, Oliver Wyman did not consider the effect of the regulated domestic airfares on the profitability of the Airlines during Claimants\u2019 management. Oliver Wyman concluded that the performance gaps which they identified in the management and operation of the Airlines was USD 357 million less than it should have been based on benchmarked Latin American carriers and USD 248 million less than it should have been compared to global benchmarks. As a result, they concluded that the Airlines were facing severe commercial and operational challenges at the time of their study, which commenced in 2009, and that this outcome had likely materialized over several years of performance deterioration.757\n\nWyman ER \u00b6 8.1; Transcript p. 801.\n\n650.\n\nWhile the Tribunal accepts that a number of the criticisms and gaps identified by Oliver Wyman appear to be valid, for the reasons outlined above, it cannot accept all of them. Further, the Tribunal cannot accept that the regulation of domestic airfares did not affect the profitability of the Airlines. As indicated previously, AUSA\u2019s revenues were generated almost exclusively by domestic transportation and domestic airfares represented approximately 25% of ARSA\u2019s revenue. In their letter of April 29, 2008 to the Secretary of Transportation, the Airlines identified the loss in net income flowing from the regulation of airfares at levels below the TER standard at a range of USD 390 million to USD 450 million.758 Claimants\u2019 experts, Compass Lexecon, estimated the historical losses due to the setting of domestic airfares between September 2002 and 2008 at USD 268 million for AUSA.759\n\nC-79, approved by ARSA\u2019s Board of Directors at its meeting of May 29, 2008: C-86.\n\nThe estimate calculated to August 2010 for AUSA was USD 390 million. Discounted to January 2008, the amount is USD 268 million. Compass Lexecon had also quantified the airfare squeeze damages for ARSA, differed to 2010, in the amount of USD 269.7 million. However, according to Claimants, this claim would only come into play in the event of a finding of unlawful expropriation. In any event. Claimants did not rely on Compass Lexecon in support of its damages claim in so far as ARSA is concerned. *See* Cl. PHB \u00b6 200.\n\n651.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed all of the relevant evidence, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the alleged inefficiencies and mismanagement of the Airlines was the sole or primary cause of their losses during the period of 2002 through 2008. While the Tribunal accepts that some of the criticisms made by Respondent and its experts may be valid and may have contributed to some extent to a loss of revenue, it is unable to accept that the regulated domestic fares had no role to play. Rather, the Tribunal has found the regulated domestic airfares were insufficient to permit the Airlines to cover their costs relating to their domestic operations. This is particularly the case in respect of AUSA whose revenue was generated almost exclusively from domestic airfares. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the low, regulated domestic airfares had a substantial impact on the Airlines\u2019 financial and operative performance and Claimants\u2019 ability to manage the Airlines efficiently.\n\n652.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal believes that the difficult circumstances of the airline industry during the time the Airlines were owned by Claimants should be borne in mind. As noted previously, a state of emergency in the air transportation sector in Argentina was declared in 2002 and maintained throughout the relevant period. The various decrees and resolutions adopted by the Government during that time reflected the very difficult conditions faced by the industry both in Argentina and internationally.\n\n653.\n\nIn conclusion, in spite of the provisions in the regulatory framework providing for the establishment of domestic airfares in accordance with the TER, it does not appear that the economically reasonable tariff was ever calculated or set by the Secretary of Transportation or any other of Respondent\u2019s government agencies. Nevertheless, the evidence indicates that the Ministry of Transportation, and the Government of Argentina more broadly, was aware of the need to adjust airfares to address the interests set out in Article 42 of the Air Business Law, including the need to permit airlines to cover their costs and earn a reasonable profit. Although the Secretary of Transportation increased the reference airfare, and consequently the maximum airfare cap, during the course of Claimants\u2019 ownership of the Airlines between 2001 and 2008, the increases to the airfare and other measures adopted did not keep pace with the steadily increasing costs faced by the Airlines during the period in question. As a result, the airfares set between 2001 and 2008 did not comply with the TER standard. Further, Respondent\u2019s failure to adjust airfares sufficiently to meet the TER standard affected the Airlines\u2019 ability to operate efficiently and earn a reasonable margin of return. Finally, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the alleged inefficiencies and poor management of the Airlines explain or account for the Airlines\u2019 losses from 2005 through 2008. The Tribunal now considers whether the failure to set domestic airfares in accordance with the TER standard amounted to a breach of the FET standard under the Treaty.\n\n**3. Does the failure to set airfares in accordance with the TER standard amount to a breach of FET under the Treaty?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Positions of the Parties**\n----------------------------\n\n654.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent failed to abide by its specific commitments, promises and guarantees regarding Claimants\u2019 ability to charge economically reasonable airfares. Claimants say that their legitimate expectations were grounded on clear rights and specific commitments and guarantees provided in the regulatory framework at the time of their investment.760 They specify that they were entitled and expected Respondent to comply with the following specific commitments, promises and guarantees regarding domestic airfares:\n\n\u2022 The legal obligation to grant the Argentine Airlines Economically Reasonable Airfare, pursuant to the applicable regulatory framework, specifically the Air Business Law and Decree 6875/1971;\n\n\u2022 The contractual obligation to set airfares permitting ARSA to obtain a reasonable margin of return, pursuant to the General Transfer Contract by which the GOA privatized ARSA;\n\n\u2022 The obligation to conduct periodical airfare reviews, according to specific and detailed legal mechanisms pursuant to Decree 6875/1971;\n\n\u2022 The obligation to review airfares in case of cost increases and changes in market conditions affecting the items to be taken into account in setting airfares, specifically (i) direct costs, (ii) indirect costs, (iii) financial costs, and (iv) reasonable rate of return, according to specific and detailed legal mechanisms pursuant to Decree 6875/1971;\n\n\u2022 The ability to implement meaningful yield management and price differentiation techniques on the basis of reasonable airfare bands[\u2026]761\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 481.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 480 (footnotes omitted).\n\n655.\n\nClaimants also argue that during the period of their investment they obtained a number of additional assurances and commitments:\n\n\u2022 Through Decree 1654/2002, Argentina recognized that it was not providing air carriers with Economically Reasonable Airfares, and thus promised to implement (i) a 50% cut in the value-added tax (VAT) for fuel; (ii) a tax exemption from the VAT for aircraft leased with a purchase option; (iii) the right to use VAT surpluses to pay any other taxes and Social Security obligations; and (iv) a tax exemption from the VAT applied to insurance policies purchased outside Argentina;\n\n\u2022 The promise to increase airfares made specifically to Claimants\u2019 representatives in 2005 during meetings with Argentina\u2019s highest Government officials;\n\n\u2022 During the negotiations of the June 2006 Agreement, and in exchange for increasing its stockholding in ARSA, Argentina promised to increase airfares, setting them in accordance with the regulatory TER standard;\n\n\u2022 Through Decree 1012/2006, Argentina again specifically recognized that it was not providing air carriers with Economically Reasonable Airfares, and thus promised to implement (i) a 50% cut in the value-added tax (VAT) for fuel; (ii) a tax exemption from the VAT for aircraft leased with a purchase option; (iii) the right to use VAT surpluses to pay any other taxes and Social Security obligations; and (iv) a tax exemption from the VAT applied to insurance policies purchased outside Argentina;\n\n\u2022 In the May 2008 Agreement, Argentina made the additional promises to grant a series of relief measures, including airfare increases, subsidies and debt relief, to make the Argentine Airlines economically viable.762\n\nClaimants say that Respondent disregarded these rights, guarantees or commitments.763\n\nCl.

Reply \u00b6\u00b6 482-483.\n\n656.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s arguments, Claimants say their position has never been that Respondent should have changed the regulatory framework in place at the time of their investment in order to benefit them nor do they argue that the FET standard should operate as an insurance policy against bad investments. Rather, Claimants say that they were entitled to charge economically reasonable airfares, covering their direct and indirect costs and providing a reasonable margin of return, but Respondent refused to adjust airfares or implement alternative relief measures throughout the entire period of their investment.764\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 484 and the sources cited there.\n\n657.\n\nAmongst other sources, Claimants rely on the decision in the *Suez* case765 which they say addressed a very similar pattern of conduct where the tribunal found that, by refusing to adjust tariffs and using claimant\u2019s ensuing difficulties in order to unilaterally force the renegotiation of that concession, Argentina had frustrated the claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations regarding the legal framework in force and the obligation to provide investors with a stable and predictable legal framework.766 Claimants also relied on the decision in the *EDF* v. *Argentina* case,767 which they say also analyzed a factual pattern similar to the one at issue here, where they say the tribunal found that Argentina was required to provide the investor \u2018\"long-term political and regulatory stability... [and specifically] tariffs were to be determined in a way that afforded the concessionaire sufficient income to cover all costs associated with the distribution of electricity as well as to obtain a reasonable return on its investments\u2019\". Claimants say that, in that case, Argentina was found to be in breach of its obligations under the FET standard, not because it actively changed the regulatory framework substantially, but because it had failed to adjust tariffs to the largely modified economic and financial conditions governing the investment, and specifically the tariffs in place.768\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General deAguas de Barcelona S.A., andInteragua Servicios Integrates deAgua S.A.,* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on Liability, July 30, 2010: C-328 [hereinafter: *Suez],*\n\nCl.

Reply \u00b6\u00b6486-487.\n\n658.\n\nRelying on *Suez* and *EDI-',* Claimants say that Respondent violated the FET standard by frustrating the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations by failing to abide by its own legal and contractual commitments, promises and guarantees. Claimants say that these included the ability to charge economically reasonable airfares and obtain a reasonable margin of return on their investment.769\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 488. Claimants also argue that Respondent failed to act consistently and transparently towards Claimants\u2019 investment, that it grossly failed to exercise its regulatory powers in good faith and in a reasonable manner.\n\n659.\n\nFor its part, Respondent denies any breach of the FET standard with respect to the domestic airfares under the legal regulatory framework. It denies the scope that Claimants attribute to the FET standard and says, rather, that that standard reflects only the minimum standard of customary international law. It also disputes that the expectations of an investor are a source of obligations under the FET standard.770 Without conceding Claimants\u2019 arguments regarding legitimate expectations, Respondent says that if these were to be taken into account for the purpose of argument, any expectations must be considered in the factual circumstances of each case and the circumstances relating to each investor as well as the conduct of the host state. Further, it says that the subjective expectations of a claimant are not relevant and that, in those cases which have accepted the concept of legitimate expectations, the claimant was required to demonstrate legitimate and reasonable expectations in light of all the circumstances. The tribunal must approach the question from an objective and reasonable point of view.771\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s position set out at: Resp. CM \u00b6 651-681; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 590-639.\n\nResp.

Further, Respondent says that Claimants conducted no due diligence prior to signing the SPA.772 Respondent also says that investment treaties and the FET standard are not insurance policies against bad business decisions made by investors. It says that Claimants had invoked the FET standard to hold it liable for the consequences of their poor management and poor business decisions.773\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 668-669; Resp.

In any event, Respondent says that the regulatory framework in this case did not change throughout the relevant period. Rather, it says that it was Claimants who wanted to have the regulatory framework changed by way of deregulation.774 In this regard, Respondent distinguishes the *Suez* and *EDF* cases upon which Claimants rely. Although it does not accept the decisions in those cases, Respondent says that they illustrate why Claimants\u2019 claim in this case is substantially different and unfounded. Respondent says that in both *Suez* and *EDF,* the tribunals found that there had been fundamental alterations of the regulatory framework.775 In addition, Respondent says that it responded to the requests from the airline industry to increase airfares and took other measures to assist it.776\n\nResp.

Rej. \u00b6 715.\n\n**The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Scope of the FET Obligation**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n663.\n\nRespondent\u2019s obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment to an investment arises from Article IV(1 of the Treaty, which provides that \"[e]ach Party shall guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment of investments made by investors of the other Party.\" While the expression of this obligation is general and somewhat vague, the Tribunal is assisted in interpreting the content of this obligation by both the context of the Treaty itself and the decisions of other tribunals who have developed the content of this obligation by interpreting this particular Treaty, as well as numerous other treaties with similar provisions in different factual scenarios.\n\n664.\n\nThe Tribunal is guided by the Vienna Convention, which directs that the Treaty \"shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\" and that the purpose can be gleaned from the text of the Treaty, its preamble and annexes and other related agreements. The preamble of the Treaty provides:\n\nThe Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain, hereinafter referred to as \"the Parties\",\n\nDesiring to intensify economic cooperation for the economic benefit of both countries.\n\nIntending to create favorable conditions for investments made by investors of either State in the territory of the Other State,\n\nRecognizing that the promotion and protection of investments in accordance with this Agreement will encourage initiatives in this field...\n\n665.\n\nThus, the general obligation to treat the investment fairly and equitably arises in the context of the Treaty, the stated purpose of which is to \"intensify economic cooperation\", \"create favorable conditions for investments\", and to promote and protect investments in order to encourage investment. \"Treatment\" according to the Oxford dictionary definition is \"the manner in which someone behaves towards or deals with someone or something.\" In the case of the Treaty, the treatment that is to be fair and equitable relates to the treatment of the investment by the Government of Argentina. Previous tribunals which have turned their mind to the definition have adopted the formulation of the standard by the *S.D. Myers* tribunal that the standard is breached where there has been \"treatment in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective.\"778\n\n*S.D. Myers Inc.* v. *Canada,* 140 ILM 1408,\u00b6263; *Saluka,* \u00b6 297, C-325; *Suez* at \u00b6231.\n\n666.\n\nIn terms of content, the Tribunal is of the view that fair and equitable treatment is not only the minimum standard of treatment at international law, as that term is not used in the Treaty. The minimum standard of treatment is a customary international law principle that sets out the obligations owed by a State to aliens and, as such, evolves over time as State practice and *opinio juris* changes to include today\u2019s notions of minimum standards.779 As discussed above, the Vienna Convention directs the Tribunal to interpret the words of the Treaty \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"780\n\nEven the U.S. and Canada, which both specifically link the minimum standard of treatment or general international law obligations with the fair and equitable treatment standard in their investment agreements, recognize that the standard evolves.\n\n*See \u00b6* 478, above.\n\n667.\n\nWhile the term legitimate expectations is also not found in the Treaty, the fair and equitable treatment language has been interpreted to oblige a State not to frustrate an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations, either at the time of the investment or in the course of the investment, as long as those expectations were objectively reasonable, created by the State (the State intended for the investor to rely upon them) and relied upon by the investor.781 In determining what constitutes legitimate expectations, the Tribunal agrees that these must be considered in light of all of the circumstances of a case from an objective and reasonable point of view. In other words, what would have been the legitimate and reasonable expectations of a reasonable investor in the position of the Claimants here at the time they made their investment?782\n\n*See,* for example, *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A.* v. *Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, August 18, 2008, \u00b6 340.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 665-669, quoting from *Suez* \u00b6 228: AL RA-282.\n\n668.\n\nThe aspect of the fair and equitable treatment obligation that relates to legitimate expectations responds to change - usually in a State\u2019s changes to a regulatory regime upon which an investor relied in making its investment. It has also been consistently held that it is not legitimate for investors to expect that a regulatory regime or laws will never change and that a State has the right to change its laws. In doing so, it will not breach its obligation to treat investors fairly and equitably if it changes its laws in a legitimate exercise of its regulatory authority.783\n\n*Saluka.*\n\n669.\n\nTurning first to the question of Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations at the time of their investment in October 2001, the Tribunal has reached the conclusion that in all of the relevant circumstances, Claimants could not reasonably or legitimately have held the expectations they claim with respect to airfares under the existing regulatory framework (listed above at paragraph 654).\n\n670.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls, first, the circumstances in which the SPA was concluded and Claimants took over the Airlines. As noted previously, both Airlines were facing serious financial difficulties, with ARSA in insolvency proceedings since June 2001. Liabilities exceeded USD 1 billion and forecasted operating losses for 2001 were in excess of USD 350 million. ARSA was losing approximately USD 40 million per month and had cancelled all its international routes except one and was operating only 30% of its domestic routes. Although it had not filed for insolvency protection, AUSA was in similarly difficult circumstances.784\n\n*See* \u00b6 372 above and the various sources cited there.\n\n671.\n\nBy October 2001, the Argentine economy was also in very difficult circumstances and on the verge of economic crisis. The international airline industry had also been affected by the events of September 11, 2001. Further, the airlines operating in Argentina were engaged in a destructive airfare war which was depressing airfares.785 The evidence also indicates that SEPI was keen to free itself of a significant portion of accumulated liabilities and to put an end to the continuous contributions made to support the Airlines over a period of approximately 10 years.786\n\nRA-538: Decree 1654/2002; Resp. CM \u00b6 385, 876; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 338, 384-386.\n\nC-9: SEPI\u2019s Summary Report pp. 3, 12-13.\n\n672.\n\nThe evidence also indicates that Claimants and Air Comet performed very little, if any, due diligence before agreeing to the SPA. Other than what Minister Bastos described as the \"general regulatory conditions\" and that Argentina did not have an open-sky policy, that routes were granted by concession, that other airlines operated in the domestic area and that international services competed with other international airlines, there was no indication that Claimants engaged in a review of the regulatory framework or relied on any representation or commitment by Respondent.787 Notably, there was no indication that Claimants had reviewed the General Transfer Contract nor made any inquiry in respect of the concept of the TER. It also appears that Minister Bastos advised the representatives of Claimants that the Government of Argentina wished to see the Airlines to continue in operation, but that it was not prepared to contribute public funds to assist them.788\n\nBastos WS \u00b6 36.\n\nBastos WS \u00b6\u00b6 6, 36. Minister Bastos also indicated that Claimants\u2019 representatives did not request any special treatment or privilege from the Government which, in any event, could not have been granted.\n\n673.\n\nIt appears that Claimants prepared a business plan for the purposes of SEPI\u2019s tender process and the SPA. However, the only business plan in evidence was a summary of the general parameters of the management which the Marsans Group intended to implement over the next three years.789 This summary plan does not reflect any inquiry into the airfare system nor any assumptions on the evolution of airfares. This is consistent with the evidence of Mr. Munoz Perez that very little in the way of due diligence had been done before the signature of the SPA.790\n\n*See* Cl. Reply \u00b6 73; SPA: C-18; *Plan deNegocio - Resumen Memoria Explicativa Sobre Grandes Pardmetros;* RA-266. It is not entirely clear whether this document is the *Plan de Negocio* referred to in SEPI\u2019s summary: C-9. Further, the date of the document is not entirely clear (it bears a date of \"11/09/01\" on its front page). According to Claimants, they periodically revised the Airlines\u2019 business plan. However, there was no other business plan in evidence, other than a projection of the development of the Airlines\u2019 active fleet: C-42.\n\nIn his statement before the Argentine Congress, Mr. Munoz Perez stated, in part:  \n... I did not know what I was going to find. I signed a contract in 2001 without having seen anything. I hadn\u2019t even seen an account. I hadn\u2019t seen the offices even. I bought on the basis of the documents I was shown without having verified anything.  \n*See* C-l 104: transcript of the proceedings before the Senate Committee on Infrastructure, Housing and Transportation of September 1, 2008, p. 35.\n\n674.\n\nTurning to the regulatory framework in place in 2001, this has been described above. Although the Tribunal has concluded that the framework did provide for the setting of airfares in accordance with the TER standard, this required a close examination and interpretation of the various laws and decrees. There was no evidence that Claimants had made any inquiries or sought any clarification or assurances in respect of the regulatory framework at the time of their investment. Further, despite the fact that the regulatory framework had been in place for some time, there is no indication that Claimants made any inquiries as to how airfares were set under the regime, nor how they had been set in the past. This is despite the insolvency of ARSA and the very substantial accumulated liabilities and ongoing losses suffered by the Airlines.\n\n675.\n\nFinally, although there was no specific evidence of Claimants\u2019 reliance on it, the Tribunal has considered the nature and content of the regulatory regime governing domestic air transportation at the relevant time in order to determine whether, objectively, it could have given rise to the legitimate expectations claimed by Claimants. In this regard, the Tribunal finds that the regulatory regime governing air transportation in Argentina differed in a number of ways from the regulatory regimes governing other public utilities or services, including gas distribution, water and sewage concessions and electrical power distribution concessions.791 For example, the regulatory regime addressed in the *Suez* case was quite different from the one governing airfares in the domestic transportation industry under consideration here.792 In that case, the bidding rules pursuant to which the concession contract was awarded to the claimants, and the concession itself, specifically provided for tariff revisions on the basis of increases in costs and extraordinary revisions caused by specified economic factors, including modification of the ARS/USD exchange rate.793\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 375-377, 625-630; Resp PHB \u00b6 94-95.\n\n*See* C-328/RA-283: Suez \u00b6\u00b664-115.\n\n*Suez* \u00b6\u00b6 91, 101-102. While the tribunal in the *Suez* case recognized that the concession at issue there did not contain certain elements found in other privatized concessions in other sectors, it was clear that the concession sought to protect the concessionaire from changes in the legal parity of the ARS with the USD and from significant cost increases: \u00b6 \u00b6 114-115, 212.\n\n676.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of *EDF,* the regulatory framework, particularly with respect to tariffs payable to electricity distributors, was considerably more detailed than the provisions of Law 19,030 and Decree 6875/1971 in respect of domestic airfares.794 The relevant provincial legislation provided specifically for how electricity tariffs were to be set and provided for both ordinary and extraordinary tariff reviews. Further, importantly, the relevant concession agreement specifically provided that accounting of costs reflected in the tariff schedule and periodic adjustment was to be in USD and tariff adjustments, to be done every 12 months, were to be conducted on the basis of U.S. producer and consumer price indices.795 Further, the Tribunal notes that in these, and in other industries such as gas distribution, the relevant concession holders were granted exclusive rights as opposed to the competition permitted in the domestic air transportation industry.\n\n*EDF \u00b6\u00b6* 50-91, where the tribunal describes the relevant federal and provincial legislation, the info-memo, bidding terms and the relevant concession contract.\n\n*EDF* \u00b6\u00b6 80-87. The terms of the concession in this respect reflected the information provided in the info-memo presented to promote to potential investors participation in the bidding process for the purchase of shares in the privatized electrical distribution company. These same terms were incorporated in the draft concession agreement which formed part of the bidding terms pursuant to which the claimants acquired their interest in the newly formed privatized company.\n\n677.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal finds that the regulatory framework for domestic air transportation at the time of Claimants\u2019 investment did not provide an objective basis for much in the way of expectations on the part of Claimants. The applicable legislation was very general in nature, and did not reflect any specific intention or commitment to protect tariffs by way of reviews on the basis of currency stability, foreign indices or other mechanisms. While the General Transfer Contract did make reference in general terms to the calculation of domestic airfares in accordance with LawNo. 19,030 (of 1971) pursuant to Articles 42 through 46 of that Law, no further provision was made with respect to the currency in which airfares would be calculated or to their revision in accordance with a foreign price index. Further, there was no evidence of any specific reliance placed by Iberia or Air Comet and Claimants on the terms of the General Transfer Contract.\n\n678.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Claimants have not demonstrated on an objective basis any legitimate expectations in respect of the regulatory regime, particularly airfares, relating to their investment in the Airlines in 2001. Rather, the Tribunal concludes that while investing in the Airlines pursuant to the bidding process conducted by SEPI may have offered Claimants an opportunity, it also brought with it significant financial and other risks.\n\n679.\n\nThis does not, however, exclude the expectation that the conduct of Respondent subsequent to Claimants\u2019 investment would be fair and equitable. In this regard, the Tribunal accepts that Claimants could expect that Respondent would comply with its laws and regulations and act transparently, grant due process and refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures or exercising coercion.796 The Tribunal now turns to this question, commencing with Claimants\u2019 allegations relating to the setting of domestic tariffs and the \"Airfare Squeeze\".\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Te Sanayi A.S.* v. *Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, August 27, 2009, \u00b6 141 [hereinafter: *Bayindir* v. *Pakistan],* as cited in *Suez* \u00b6\u00b6 206-207.\n\n680.\n\nClaimants allege that Respondent failed to abide by its specific commitments, promises and guarantees regarding the Airlines\u2019 ability to charge economically reasonable airfares by failing to grant increases to domestic airfares. Having carefully reviewed the detailed evidence with respect to the setting of airfares between October 2001 and July 2008, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondents\u2019 conduct amounted to a breach of the FET standard set out in the Treaty. While during that period costs increased very substantially and domestic airfares did not keep pace with these, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the failure to grant the fare increases requested amounted to a breach of the FET standard.\n\n681.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, unlike other cases involving Respondent, this is not a case where fundamental changes were made to a regulatory regime providing specific terms for the setting, review and revision of public service tariffs. In fact, no changes to the basic regulatory framework governing domestic airfares were made during the period of Claimants\u2019 investment. Claimants acknowledge this, as well as the fact that four airfare increases were granted between 2002 and 2008. Claimants\u2019 complaint is that Respondent did not properly apply the regulatory framework by granting airfare increases which would have permitted them to charge domestic airfares at the TER standard. Nevertheless, it is useful to bear in mind the distinction between the circumstances of this case and the various other cases dealing with tariff adjustments relating to concessions in other services. Another distinguishing aspect between this and other cases is that the domestic airfares were not frozen and the Secretary of Transportation and the Government of Argentina did grant airfare increases in response to requests from the Airlines and other airlines.\n\n682.\n\nAs noted above, in September 2002, Decree 1654/2002 declared a state of emergency in the air transportation sector and, recognizing the increase in costs in the sector, provided for an increase in domestic airfares of approximately 41% in nominal terms and re-established airfare bands at approximately 60%. The Decree also provided for the preparation of a bill to provide additional assistance to assist airlines to meet the cost increases and difficult circumstances they were facing. While Claimants maintain that this increase was inadequate to meet the TER standard, the Tribunal accepts that, unlike in other industries, an increase to the airfares was granted in difficult economic times. Further, it does appear that the bill requesting tax measures to assist the airline industry was prepared, although it was never adopted by Congress. While reference to these tax measures in Decree 1654/2002 reflects a recognition of the need to provide additional assistance to airlines, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that it constituted any commitment or guarantee of actually obtaining the adoption and implementation of those measures.\n\n683.\n\nThe next request for airfare increases was made by the Airlines in 2004 in the amount of 8%. Although the Secretary of Transportation rejected the Airlines\u2019 request for a larger fare increase, this was done on the basis of a study conducted by the Secretariat of Transportation on the basis that the airlines had increased their airfares, as permitted by Decree 1654/2002 and achieved positive operating results and profits for both 2003 and 2004. The Airlines\u2019 appeals were dismissed by the Secretary of Transportation, again on the basis of a report prepared by the Secretariat.797 Claimants argue that the denial of the airfare increase requested in 2004 was in contravention of the regulatory framework since, in its view, the increase in its revenues or the fact that it had achieved a profit did not disentitle it to an airfare increase in accordance with the TER standard. Whether or not Claimants are correct in this regard is not determinative. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, what is relevant is that the Secretary of Transportation considered the Airlines\u2019 request and determined it on the basis of a reasoned study. The Tribunal also notes that the Airlines substantially improved their operational and economic situation and earned profits in both 2003 and 2004. In these circumstances, even if the decision to deny the airfare increases was not in compliance with the TER standard, it does not appear to have been made arbitrarily or in bad faith.\n\n*See* above at \u00b6 3 95. Although Mr. Cirielli supported the initial recommendation not to increase airfares, the decision was by the Secretary of Transportation. Further, it appears that Mr. Cirielli played no role in the appeal, in light of the challenges brought against him by the Airlines in the courts.\n\n684.\n\nAfter 2004, the increase in costs, particularly the cost of jet fuel, accelerated sharply. Further, in November 2005, a significant strike affecting all airlines operating in Argentina occurred. This and the increasing costs in the industry led to meetings with representatives of Claimants, the Government of Argentina and unions. This was followed by negotiations which, eventually, led to the June 2006 Agreement and Addendum.798\n\n*See \u00b6\u00b6* 398-406, above. This was followed by the adoption of Decree 1012/2006 on August 7, 2006. That decree, amongst other tilings, continued the state of emergency in commercial air transportation in Argentina, an increase in airfares of approximately 20% and the establishment of an aviation fuel subsidy scheme.\n\n685.\n\nShortly after the adoption of Decree 1012/2006, the Airlines wrote to the Secretary of Transportation complaining that the airfare increase granted was insufficient to allow them to charge economically reasonable airfares. This letter was followed by others from the Airlines and from CLARA. It appears that the Airlines met with the Secretary of Transportation to discuss the need to revise airfares and their increasing costs and salary demands from the unions representing their employees.799 Correspondence and discussions appear to have continued throughout 2007. In early 2008, the Secretariat of Transportation was studying the air transportation industry and the improvement of service. In that context, it requested comments from the Airlines on proposed measures to increase airfares by approximately 30% and to fix the maximum price for jet fuel at ARS 1.80 per liter.800 This was followed by the adoption of Resolution ST No. 257/2008 on April 11 and Resolution ST No. 315/2008 on May 16, 2008. Each of these resolutions provided for airfare increases of approximately 18%. Resolution ST No. 257/2008 made reference to the increasing costs faced by airlines, the complexity inherent in determining air transportation costs and the need for external technical assistance to identify a satisfactory adjustment procedure in order to determine economically reasonable airfares. Resolution ST No. 315/2008 made reference to technical studies which indicated that the airfare increases provided for in Decree 1012/2006 were insufficient to cover cost increases since August 2006.801\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 409 and 413, above.\n\nC-78/RA-371.\n\nC-181/RA-341; C-182/RA-342. Resolution ST No. 315/2008 also made reference to the need for an economic-financial equation covering the economic equilibrium for airline operators in order to achieve a better service for users.\n\n686.\n\nIt also appears that the Secretariat of Transportation was considering other steps to address the financial situation of the Airlines. This is reflected in the May 2008 Agreement which provided for the entry of another private sector shareholder in the ownership of the Airlines.802 As previously indicated, the proposed investor did not proceed to invest and the May 2008 Agreement was not implemented.803 The Tribunal addresses separately, below, the Parties\u2019 allegations regarding the alleged breach of the May 2008 Agreement.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 417-420, above.\n\n*See* \u00b6 428, above.\n\n687.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s review of all of the evidence relating to the various communications between Claimants and the Secretariat of Transportation and other representatives of the Government of Argentina with regard to airfares does not lead it to conclude that Respondent\u2019s failure to approve the various airfare increases requested by the Airlines amounts to a breach of the FET standard in the Treaty. As noted by Respondent, no change was made to the regulatory framework during the period of Claimants\u2019 investment. Further, Respondent did respond to requests by the Airlines, and other airlines operating domestically, for airfare increases and other forms of relief to meet the difficult circumstances of the industry. The evidence indicates that the Secretary of Transportation reviewed the status of the Airlines and granted airfare increases in 2002, 2006 and 2008. While Claimants say that the Secretary of Transportation improperly denied their request for an airfare increase in 2004, this was done on the basis of studies prepared to address the Airlines\u2019 request and, in the circumstances, was not arbitrary. The Tribunal notes that the Airlines had competitors in the domestic market and that the various conditions which led to the increase in costs were common to all airlines. The decision to deny the airfare increase requested applied to the entire industry and, therefore, was not, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, discriminatory.\n\n688.\n\nClaimants also complained that Respondent was slow in implementing the airfare increases it did grant as well as other measures such as the fuel subsidies. However, in this regard, as well as the question of setting airfares more broadly, the Tribunal accepts that the issues involved were complex and that Respondent had other concerns to address, including the maintenance of service to various parts of the country and prices to users. In this regard, the Tribunal accepts that some deference or leeway should be granted to Respondent in balancing these interests.804\n\nIn this regard, *see'.* Resp. CM \u00b6835; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 743 where Respondent refers to the award in the *Kardassopoulos* v. *Georgia* case where the tribunal held that the respondent State was entitled to a measure of deference in determining whether a measure was in the public interest. The Tribunal believes that in the circumstances of this case, a similar approach should be adopted on this issue.\n\n689.\n\nFinally, the regulatory framework governing domestic air transportation was general in nature and not well developed. This includes the notion of the TER which, eventually, the Secretary of Transportation came to recognize required the assistance of technical experts to calculate.805 There was no indication that the Secretary of Transportation had ever calculated the TER and the available evidence tends to indicate that, in fact, this had never been done since the adoption of the Air Business Law and Decree 6875/1971.\n\n*See* Resolution ST No. 257/2008: C-181/RA-341, discussed above.\n\n690.\n\nOn balance, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that Respondent\u2019s conduct in the setting of airfares and denying the Airlines\u2019 requests for increases during the period from 2001 through 2008 rises to the level of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. As a result, Claimants\u2019 claim that Respondent\u2019s role in the alleged \"airfare squeeze\" constituted a breach of the FET standard under the Treaty fails.\n\n691.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the other conduct or measures of Respondent that Claimants allege breached the FET standard protected in the Treaty.\n\n**D. Other Acts of Alleged \"Re-Argentinization\" and Undue Pressure Exerted by the Government of Argentina**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n692.\n\nAccording to Claimants, \"President Kirchner\u2019s administration was hostile towards Claimants\u2019 management of the Argentine Airlines and seemed driven by a desire to ultimately \u2019re-Argentinize\u2019 the companies. The administration sought to\u2014and ultimately did\u2014reach this goal by taking a number of measures which destabilized the legal and business environment surrounding the Claimants\u2019 investment.\"806 Claimants point to \u00b6 the appointment and maintenance in office of Mr. Cirielli as Undersecretary of Air Transportation; 2) alleged pressure exerted on Claimants by the Government of Argentina through the unions; 3) the judicial challenges filed by Respondent against three of ARSA\u2019s financial statements; 4) the negotiation of an agreement with Respondent in 2006, by which they allege Respondent extracted a greater shareholding in the Airlines in return for a promise to raise airfares; and 5) Respondent\u2019s alleged pressure on Claimants to sell their controlling interest in the Airlines.807\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 164.\n\n*See also* Cl. Mem. \u00b6211 (\"In sum, the GOA illicitly pressured Claimants by (i) refusing to perform their regulatory function of providing legally-required and financially-adequate airfares in accordance with Argentine law; (ii) supporting and encouraging APLA\u2019s and APTA\u2019s strike in November 2005; (iii) requiring that Claimants negotiate with APLA and APTA an end to the November strike with the promise of an immediate airfare increase but then delaying the airfare increase for months; (iv) crippling Claimants\u2019 financial position so as to be in a stronger position to acquire an increased shareholder percentage of ARSA; and (v) attempting to deceive Claimants by swapping the text of the true agreement with a different version. This behavior is certainly in violation of the BIT and customary international law.\").\n\n**1. The Role of Undersecretary of Air Transportation Ricardo Cirielli**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n693.\n\nClaimants assert that there was one key individual who embodied\u2014and helped execute\u2014 the Government of Argentina\u2019s backhanded strategy: Mr. Cirielli, Undersecretary of Air Transportation. Claimants request a finding that Respondent\u2019s appointment and maintenance in office of Undersecretary Cirielli as well as his harmful conduct toward Claimants in his capacity as an organ of the Government were arbitrary, unfair and inequitable under the Treaty.808\n\nCl.

During his tenure as Undersecretary, Mr. Cirielli remained on an unpaid leave of absence from APTA, and he returned there at the end of his term in office.\n\nC-88.\n\nIn terms of hierarchy, it should be noted that the Argentine Undersecretariat of Commercial Air Transportation reported to the Argentine Secretariat of Transportation, who reported in turn to the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services, *see* Resp.

Reply \u00b6\u00b6 202-203.\n\n701.\n\nRespondent asserts that only the conduct of Mr. Cirielli while he held office is relevant in the instant case with a view to determining the alleged responsibility of the Argentine State.830 Nonetheless, it argues that Claimants have relied upon the conduct of Mr. Cirielli before he was in office, which cannot be relevant for the purposes of determining the international responsibility of Argentina.831 The only acts actually performed by Mr. Cirielli during the period of his tenure as a government official, that Claimants invoked as the basis of their FET claim are his opposition to the requests for airfare increases for the Airlines and his alleged support for strikes. As noted above, Respondent asserts that Claimants have not established their burden of proof in respect of these acts.832 Respondent further argues that news articles that speculate about Mr. Cirielli\u2019s personal intentions are not attributable to the State under ILC Article IV.833\n\nResp. CM \u00b6691, citing Decision on Jurisdiction at \u00b6276.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6692.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6694-696.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6693.\n\n702.\n\nCommencing with the question of attribution, the Parties agree that insofar as the conduct of Mr. Cirielli as the Undersecretary of Air Transportation is concerned, the applicable principles are contained in Article IV of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (the ILC Articles). The Tribunal notes the Parties also appear to agree that only Mr. Cirielli\u2019s conduct while in office is directly attributable to Respondent. Accordingly, only the conduct of Mr. Cirielli during his tenure as Undersecretary of Air Transportation is relevant to this claim. Claimants acknowledge this when they state that the evidence of Mr. Cirielli\u2019s statements made before his appointment are submitted only to show his alleged public animosity towards Claimants and not in order to legally attribute those statements to Respondent.834 The Parties also seem to agree that the purely private conduct of Mr. Cirielli during his tenure as Undersecretary of Air Transportation is not attributable to Respondent.835\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6198.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6693 and the sources cited there; Cl. Reply \u00b6 202-203 and the sources cited there.  \n Claimants refer to Article VII of the ILC Articles which provides that if a person empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority acts in that capacity, their conduct is considered an act of the state, even if it exceeds that person\u2019s authority or contravenes instructions.\n\n703.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered Claimants\u2019 complaints regarding the conduct of Mr. Cirielli in accordance with these principles. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Claimants have not demonstrated that the conduct complained of constitutes a breach of Respondent\u2019s obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment pursuant to the terms of the Treaty.\n\n704.\n\nClaimants say that Mr. Cirielli made a number of negative statements about the Marsans Group and Spanish ownership of the Airlines while in office. According to them, these statements reflected earlier statements made by him, while still in his position as the head of APTA, that the Airlines should be owned by Argentine interests and that this, and his expressed hostility to the Marsans Group, became Respondent\u2019s official policy. In reviewing these allegations, the Tribunal notes that most of the evidence upon which Claimants rely are either press articles or APTA press releases made after Mr. Cirielli\u2019s appointment as Undersecretary of Air Transportation and during his leave of absence from the union.836\n\nC-92; C-; C-94; and C-95.\n\n705.\n\nClaimants say that Mr. Cirielli\u2019s views and strong opposition to the ownership and management of the Airlines by the Marsans Group was carried over to, and continued throughout, his tenure as Undersecretary of Air Transportation. Claimants rely on press reports and a press release by another union to support this. While the Tribunal accepts Respondent\u2019s position that newspaper articles do not provide direct proof of Mr. Cirielli\u2019s personal views or intentions and must be treated with caution,837 it accepts, on the basis of all of the evidence submitted in respect of this issue, that Mr. Cirielli held, and likely maintained during his tenure as Undersecretary of Air Transportation, a negative view of the Airlines\u2019 ownership by the Spanish Marsans Group. However, the relevant issue is whether Claimants have demonstrated that this attitude influenced Mr. Cirielli\u2019s conduct in such a way as to affect the Airlines, and Claimants, to the extent that their right to fair and equitable treatment was breached.\n\n*See* Resp. CM \u00b6370.\n\n706.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the fact that Respondent may have appointed Mr. Cirielli as Undersecretary of Air Transportation and maintained him in office until 2007 does not, in itself, amount to a breach of Claimants\u2019 rights. While this appointment may have resulted in an Undersecretary of Air Transportation who was sympathetic to stakeholders other than the Airlines and their owners, this was a political appointment which Respondent was entitled to make. In order to prove a breach of Claimants\u2019 right to fair and equitable treatment under the Treaty, Claimants must show that Mr. Cirielli\u2019s conduct as Undersecretary of Air Transportation resulted in the arbitrary or discriminatory treatment of Claimants\u2019 investment in the Airlines.\n\n707.\n\nIn this regard, Claimants allege that Mr. Cirielli called for and supported strikes against the Airlines in support of a policy to \"re-Argentinize\" the Airlines. They rely on a number of newspaper articles and certain press releases by other unions in support of this contention.838 Having reviewed these various articles and documents, the Tribunal is not persuaded that they provide sufficient, reliable proof of Claimants\u2019 allegations.\n\n*See, inter alia,* Cl. Mem. footnotes 188 and 194; Cl. Reply footnotes 406 and 407.\n\n708.\n\nClaimants also allege that Mr. Cirielli\u2019s attitude towards the Marsans Group and its ownership of the Airlines led him to oppose the Airlines\u2019 request for an airfare increase in December 2004. As discussed above, the denial of the Airlines\u2019 request was on the basis of an internal study of the Secretariat of Transportation. While Mr. Cirielli supported the study\u2019s conclusion that the airfare increases requested were not warranted, there was no indication that Mr. Cirielli, himself, had authored the report or influenced its conclusion. Further, the decision on whether or not to grant the airfare increases was made by the Secretary of Transportation, and not Mr. Cirielli.\n\n709.\n\nClaimants also allege that Mr. Cirielli personally instigated the Government\u2019s challenge of ARSA\u2019s financial statements for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004.839 It appears that there was some discussion between various Government ministries, and within the Secretariat of Transportation, as to whether the financial statements of ARSA for 2002, 2003 and 2004 should be approved by the Government as a shareholder. It appears Mr. Cirielli was of the view that the financial statements should not be approved and that he disagreed with the Secretary of Transportation in this regard. As described previously, ARSA\u2019s financial statements for 2002 through 2005 were not approved until the signature of the June 2006 Agreement.840 As will be discussed below, the approval of ARSA\u2019s financial statements generated considerable discussion and controversy for some time. While, ultimately, the Government agreed to approve the financial statements, the objections to their approval were not entirely unfounded.841 As a result, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Mr. Cirielli acted arbitrarily in raising his objections to the approval of the financial statements. In any event, Claimants have not demonstrated that Mr. Cirielli\u2019s views determined, or affected, Respondent\u2019s conduct in respect of the financial statements.\n\n*See* Mr. Cirielli\u2019s statement before the Argentine Senate Commission on August 28, 2008: C-947 p. 3; Article in *La Nacion* dated October 3, 2005: C-873.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 403 - 411, above. As part of the June 2006 Agreement, the Parties agreed to transfer shares of ARSA to the Government of Argentina to achieve a total of 5% of ARSA\u2019s stock and to permit the Government to increase its shareholdings up to 20%. In addition, the Parties agreed that the financial statements of ARSA for 2005 would be approved. As described below, all of the financial statements for 2002 through 2005 were approved.\n\nThe debate around the approval of the financial statements appears to have centered on the subrogation of ARSA\u2019s debt by Air Comet and how this should be accounted for: C-873.\n\n710.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the decisions of the Federal Court of Appeals of November 15, 2005 and the Anti-Corruption Office of March 29, 2006 finding that Mr. Cirielli had a conflict of interest between his position as Secretary General of APTA, albeit while on leave of absence, and his dealings with ARSA as the Undersecretary of Air Transportation and required him to refrain from dealing with any matters in which ARSA had an interest. There is no indication that Mr. Cirielli failed to comply with these directions after they were rendered.842\n\n*See,* for example, RA-303.\n\n711.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the only conduct of Mr. Cirielli that was attributable to Respondent was his conduct while he was in office as Undersecretary of Air Transportation. The evidence tendered in respect of that conduct was not sufficient to persuade the Tribunal that Mr. Cirielli\u2019s apparently negative view of the Spanish ownership of the Airlines affected the treatment of the Airlines and Claimants\u2019 rights in respect of them. Accordingly, Claimants\u2019 claim that Mr. Cirielli\u2019s conduct amounted to a breach of the FET standard by Respondent must fail.\n\n**2. Unions**\n-------------\n\n712.\n\nClaimants assert that, as part of Respondent\u2019s plan to \"re-Argentinize\" the Airlines, the Government of Argentina \"found in two of the Argentine Airlines\u2019 powerful unions an alliance of convenience.\"843 Claimants describe damaging strikes and unreasonable demands made by the APLA and APTA unions, which weakened Claimants financially and made their need for fare increases even more urgent. They allege that Respondent directed and encouraged or supported these strikes.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b610.\n\n713.\n\nClaimants point to an eleven-day strike in November 2005 that they claim \"took a serious toll\" on ARSA\u2019s economic performance (estimated at approximately ARS 27 million) during high season.844 According to Claimants, the strike prompted negotiations between the Airlines and the Government in December, culminating in a provisional agreement with the unions regarding a 10-20% salary increase to take effect in March 2006, at the same time that the Government would increase the airfares.845 However, Claimants state that by March 2006, the Government had failed to implement the fare increases, and the unions were again pressing for salary increases. Claimants state that they met again with the Government in May 2006, and President Kirchner promised to grant fare increases, but on the condition of the conclusion of a 25% salary increase for the unions. Claimants assert that they complied with the Government\u2019s request and concluded an agreement with certain unions on May 15, 2006.846\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 184, citing C-37 and C-38.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 188.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 190-193.\n\n714.\n\nClaimants also point to a \"campaign of harassment\" by the unions in 2007, which they alleged involved a strike on average every fifteen days.847 Claimants assert that these strikes constituted a \"final attack\" against Claimants\u2019 ownership of the Airlines.848\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 220, citing Pascual Arias WS \u00b6 55.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 220.\n\n715.\n\nRespondent does not contest the occurrence of the strikes, but asserts that the strikes were not due to any secret conspiracy but rather a number of specific conflicts between the Airlines and the unions. Respondent asserts that the mandatory conciliations ordered by the Ministry of Labor demonstrate that the issues between the Airlines and the unions included non-compliance with collective bargaining agreements, deductions on account of unauthorized union leaves, remuneration categories, non-wage monthly payments, formalization of temporary-to-permanent employment, and airline-imposed restrictions on union activity.849\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 358; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 293, citing Caneto WS2 \u00b6 6.\n\n716.\n\nMore generally, Respondent argues that these kinds of strikes are not unusual, were not specific or limited to Claimants, and were entirely foreseeable. Respondent asserts that the aviation industry is one of the most highly unionized, due to the number of unions, and the high level of unionized personnel in a large workforce.850 It also asserts that Claimants were or should have been fully aware of this dynamic, and points out that Mr. Diaz Ferran himself noted that union and employee relations were \"highly conflicted\" when Claimants took control of the Airlines.851 Finally, Respondent notes that union conflicts continue to occur at ARSA and AUSA.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6346-347.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 353-355, referencing Diaz Ferran WS **1** 9. Respondent also cites the testimony of Mr. Pascual de Riva (Pascual de Riva WS, \u00b672) and Mr. Carlos Bastos (Bastos WS \u00b6 6, 17).\n\n717.\n\nFinally, the Parties strongly disagree over the Government of Argentina\u2019s alleged role in encouraging the unions to strike. Claimants assert that there is ample evidence that unions like APTA and APLA in various instances acted \"on the instructions or under the direction or control\" of the Government of Argentina, per Article VIII of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.852 Claimants assert that the \"overall control\" standard should be applied in the instant case,853 and that this standard is satisfied.\n\nCl.

(26 February) (AL RA-76).\n\n720.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants have failed to present any convincing evidence that either the Government of Argentina generally, or Undersecretary Cirielli specifically, controlled the unions or induced them to strike.859 Respondent notes that the Argentine Ministry of Labor presided over numerous conciliation proceedings between the Airlines and the unions with the purpose of avoiding strikes and resetting relationships.860 Respondent also notes that both APLA and APTA filed a complaint with the International Labor Organization against the Government of Argentina regarding its role as an intermediary in the labor conflicts with the Airlines during Claimants\u2019 management, alleging that the Government of Argentina had undermined their rights of association.861\n\nTranscript p. 286 (\"Where is the proof of coordination by the State of the conduct of the unions?

That Article provides as follows: \"the conduct of a person or a group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.\"\n\n722.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the standard for determining whether a person or group of persons is acting \"under the direction or control of\u2019 the State. Claimants maintain that the standard should be that of \"overall control\", while Respondent says that the appropriate test is \"effective control\".862 Having reviewed the Parties\u2019 arguments and the various authorities cited, the Tribunal finds Professor Kingsbury\u2019s opinion on this point persuasive and concludes that in the circumstances of this case, the test is effective control.863\n\n*See* Resp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 312-319; Cl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 207-211; Resp. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 123-125.\n\nKingsbury ER \u00b6\u00b6 53-54; *White Industries Australia Limited v.

CM \u00b6\u00b6 684-688. *See also* Kingsbury, Transcript pp. 586-588.\n\n723.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimants have demonstrated such control by Respondent, through Mr. Cirielli or otherwise, over the various unions involved in strikes against the Airlines, notably APTA and APLA. In this regard, the Tribunal finds the evidence of Mr. Caneto, the Deputy Director of Labor Relations for the Ministry of Labor, persuasive.864 The Tribunal\u2019s review of this and other evidence does not indicate that the strikes that Claimants complain of were carried out on the instructions of, or under the directions or control of Respondent. As a result, the Tribunal finds that Respondent did not have effective control over the unions and that their conduct cannot be attributed to it.\n\n*See* Caneto WS \u00b6\u00b6 9-15; Transcript pp. 533-536, 547-551. Mr. Caneto\u2019s evidence indicated that the Ministry of Labor was involved on a number of occasions in attempts to resolve disputes between the unions and the Airlines and also imposed mandatory conciliation by APTA and APLA against Argentina and the Airlines before the ILO: AC-9; AC-10; AC-8.\n\n724.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered Claimants\u2019 argument that Respondent exercised overall control over APTA through Mr. Cirielli, as Undersecretary of Air Transportation. As indicated above, the Tribunal believes that the appropriate test for the attribution of the unions\u2019 conduct to Respondent is effective control. In any event, even applying the lower \"overall control\" test advocated by Claimants, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Mr. Cirielli, or Respondent, exercised such control over the unions. While Mr. Cirielli may have been sympathetic to the unions, there is no reliable indication that he was involved in organizing, coordinating or planning the unions\u2019 activities, nor that he financed, organized or provided operating support while he was the Undersecretary of Air Transportation.865 As a result, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the conduct of the unions of which Claimants complain can be attributed to Respondent. Accordingly, a breach of the FET standard under the Treaty on this basis must be dismissed.\n\n*See* Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 317-318 and the sources cited there. Further, the Tribunal notes, again, that Claimants rely primarily on newspaper articles which, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, must be treated cautiously.\n\n**3. Financial statements**\n---------------------------\n\n725.\n\nClaimants assert that the Government intentionally undermined the Airlines by challenging ARSA\u2019s financial statements in its capacity as ARSA\u2019s minority shareholder. Claimants assert that the Government\u2019s representative in ARSA voted against the approval of the 2002, 2003 and 2004 ARSA financial statements, and Respondent also brought judicial challenges against all three sets of financial statements.866 According to Claimants, these challenges were baseless, since the Government had been timely provided with the necessary documentation and because the statements had been audited. Claimants also assert that the Government was perfectly willing to drop the judicial challenges as a condition of concluding the 2006 Agreement.867\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6178.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 179-180; Cl. Reply \u00b6246.\n\n726.\n\nIn response, Respondent argues that the Airlines commingled assets in a non-transparent way and failed to provide the Government with sufficient access to relevant information.868 It asserts that it had a legitimate right as a minority shareholder to take legal measures in the face of the irregularities in the statements.869 Respondent also says that by purchasing and subrogating the claims of creditors in ARSA\u2019s insolvency and then contributing them to ARSA\u2019s capital, Air Comet diluted Respondent\u2019s shares in ARSA to less than 2%.870 Respondent also maintains that due to these and other issues, there were a number of inconsistencies and irregularities in the financial statements until these were corrected in 2006.871\n\nResp.

CM \u00b6\u00b6437-438.\n\n727.\n\nRespondent also says that as a consequence of the dilution of its shareholding to less than 2%, its shareholding fell below the minimum required by law to request information from the company and, as a result, it was converted into a simple passive shareholder.872\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 424. It appears that Respondent was also concerned about the number of directors its shareholding entitled it on the ARSA Board. *See,* in this regard, Mr. Llorens\u2019 letter of November 21, 2006 on behalf of the Ministry of Planning to the Secretary of Transportation providing a favorable opinion on the steps taken by ARSA\u2019s Board to address Respondent\u2019s complaints regarding limited access to information, adjust the draft financial statements, the reinstatement of the State\u2019s 5% shareholding, the addition of one more appointee to ARSA\u2019s Board and the designation of one member of the Company\u2019s audit committee. The letter also notes the amendments agreed (in the June 2006 Agreement) to give Respondent the power to veto certain decisions of strategic importance. *See* RA-363.\n\n728.\n\nFrom its review of the Parties\u2019 arguments and the relevant evidence, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that Respondent intentionally undermined the Airlines by challenging ARSA\u2019s financial statements. Independent of the ultimate merits of Respondent\u2019s complaints outlined above, Respondent had the right, as a shareholder, to vote against the adoption of the financial statements it challenged and to have recourse to the courts to annul the resolutions adopting them. The Tribunal is unable to determine, on the basis of the available evidence, the merits of Respondent\u2019s complaint about the lack of information provided to it. However, it does note that some changes were made with respect to the information made available to shareholders and that adjustments were made to ARSA\u2019s 2005 financial statements to the satisfaction of the Ministry of Planning.\n\n729.\n\nWith respect to Respondent\u2019s agreement to withdraw its court challenges to the financial statements, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent\u2019s willingness to do this reflects that the initial challenges were baseless. Rather, the withdrawal of the lawsuits was part of a compromise which resolved a contentious issue between the shareholders of ARSA.873 Finally, the fact that Respondent was able to negotiate the transfer of approximately 3.8% of ARSA\u2019s shares to bring it back to its original shareholding of 5% does not, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, reflect improper conduct. Rather, it forms part of a compromise negotiated between the shareholders of ARSA.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that the challenges to the financial statements and lawsuits were based on Respondent\u2019s complaints relating to the implementation of the SPA and the capitalization of ARSA\u2019s debt.\n\n**4. The June 2006 Agreement**\n------------------------------\n\n730.\n\nClaimants assert that they continued to negotiate with the Government through the first half of 2006 to find a solution to the Airlines\u2019 financial difficulties. According to Claimants, Secretary of Transportation Jaime demanded that the Government be allowed to increase its control and shareholding participation in ARSA as a condition of increasing airfares and of withdrawing the judicial challenges against ARSA\u2019s financial statements.874 Claimants assert that they felt obligated to negotiate an agreement, since they so badly needed an airfare increase. However, they believe that they were \"extorted\"875 and \"coerced\"876 by the Government into signing the June 21, 2006 agreement on these terms.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 200; Cl.

In return for that, the Government promised to raise airfares to an economically reasonable level.\").\n\n731.\n\nClaimants request that the Tribunal find that Argentina violated the FET provision in the Treaty: (i) by unlawfully pressuring Claimants to sign the June 2006 Agreement and relinquish to the Government of Argentina 3.8% of their shares in ARSA with the promise to grant Economically Reasonable Airfares and the withdrawal of groundless challenges to ARSA\u2019s financial statements; (ii) by unilaterally and in bad faith modifying the text of the June 2006 Agreement, and (iii) by violating the June 2006 Agreement, including by not setting TER-compliant airfares and failing to comply with its 15% stock option of ARSA by making the corresponding cash contribution.

PHB \u00b6 103.\n\n732.\n\nIn response, Respondent argues that the June 2006 Agreement did not bind the Government of Argentina to Claimants since the latter were not parties to the Agreement. Moreover, Respondent says that a simple breach of contract cannot constitute a breach of the FET standard; otherwise the distinction between treaty and contract would collapse and contracts could be brought into the treaty framework in a way not supported by most of the jurisprudence. In any event, Respondent says that it did not repudiate or breach the June 2006 Agreement.878\n\nResp.

The Agreement provided for \u00b6 the approval of the 2005 financial statements, 2) the increase of the Government of Argentina\u2019s share in ARSA of a minimum of 5%, with the possibility of an additional 15% increase, 3) certain modifications to the voting rights of Class A shares, 4) the Government\u2019s agreement to desist in its lawsuits concerning the financial statements of 2002, 2003 and 2004 and 5) an agreement for the parties to take steps to arrange an eventual public offering of shares.879 An \"addendum\" to the Agreement dated June 21, 2006 altered certain terms of the June 2006 Agreement, notably with respect to the rights of Class \"A\" shareholders.\n\nC-134.\n\n734.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the motivation behind Respondent\u2019s demand for a share increase through the June 2006 Agreement. Respondent argues that Air Comet had acted fraudulently in capitalizing certain claims following ARSA\u2019s bankruptcy in 2001, and this had had the effect of diluting the Government of Argentina\u2019s shares in the company.880 Respondent complains in particular about \"false entries\" with respect to the capitalization in 2001 of funds provided by SEPI; these alleged false entries resulted in the dilution of Respondent\u2019s shares in the airlines to less than the 2% minimum that allows shareholders to request information and file claims.881 Accordingly, Respondent asserts that the share increase provided by the June 2006 Agreement served to \"reinstate\" its interest in the Airlines that had been previously reduced.882\n\nResp.

It notes that the Marsans Group never made any statement regarding the alleged coercion at the time the Agreement was executed.884 It also points to an Interinvest Board of Directors meeting, which described the June 2006 Agreement as follows:\n\n... Recuerda que Interinvest tambien participo y suscribio los documentos, que reflejaron entre otras cuestiones que la sociedad debia solucionar la restitution del 5% de la participacion que el Estado Nacional tenia en Aerolineas Argentinas, participacion que se ltabia visto disminuida en razon de los aportes irrevocables efectuados por esta Compania y sus controlantes....Esta transferencia [de acciones] no sera gravosa para las partes.

PHB \u00b6 138.\n\n*See* RA-364 (Minutes of the Board of Directors of Interinvest S.A., October 24, 2006).\n\n736.\n\nFor their part, Claimants deny that their repayment of ARSA\u2019s debts resulted in the dilution of Argentina\u2019s shares in the Airlines, and they argue that at any rate, Argentina could have matched Interinvest\u2019s capital contributions to avoid dilution. Claimants therefore dispute that the June 2006 Agreement\u2019s provisions regarding Argentina\u2019s 5% option serve to \"restore\" what had been taken from Argentina. Rather, they assert that the June 2006 Agreement gave Respondent a 3.8% shareholding \"without paying a dollar,\" and that, as such, it was unlawfully taken by the Government in violation of the Treaty and international law.886\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opening, Transcript p. 161.\n\n737.\n\nClaimants also assert that Respondent failed to observe most of the commitments of the June 2006 Agreement. Specifically, they allege that the August 2006 fare increase granted per Decree 1012/2006 was insufficient and late.887 Claimants also assert that even though Respondent later exercised its 15% stock option in ARSA under the June 2006 Agreement, it then failed to follow through and never made the required cash contribution.888\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6101.\n\n*Id.*\n\n738.\n\nIn response, Respondent notes that neither the June 2006 Agreement nor its addendum contained any stipulation regarding a commitment of airfare increases. Moreover, Respondent points out that on August 7, 2006, the Argentine Executive issued Presidential Decree 1012, providing an additional 20% fare increase, extending the state of emergency in the commercial air sector, continuing an exemption from taking out commercial aviation insurance within Argentina, and establishing an Aviation Fuel Subsidy Scheme.889\n\nResp. CM \u00b6465.\n\n739.\n\nFinally, Claimants submit that Respondent deceived them in the formal signing of the Agreement. Claimants allege that the Agreement that the Government presented and that Claimants signed during an official visit of President Kirchner to Spain was, unbeknownst to Claimants, different from the terms to which the parties had previously agreed. According to Claimants, the new agreement gave the Government shareholding privileges that Claimants had previous rejected in earlier drafts of the Agreement. Claimants state that with the support of the Spanish executive, they confronted the Government about the deception, and that the parties signed an addendum to the Agreement restoring the originally-agreed terms890\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 203-209.\n\n740.\n\nRespondent denies that any deception occurred in the signing of the June 2006 Agreement, and that Claimants have failed to produce any evidence to support their assertions.891 Respondent also argues, in the alternative, that Claimants are estopped from arguing deception when they did not fulfill the duty of diligence to read the Agreement before signing it.892\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 447.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 449.\n\n741.\n\nThe relevant particulars of the 2006 Agreement are quoted above at paragraph 404. The Addendum modified certain terms of the Agreement. With respect to the provisions concerning the rights of Class A shareholders, the following changes were made to the original language:\n\nPRIMERO\n\n\u2026\n\nc) La modification del Estatuto Social de AASA a efectos de que este prevea y refleje:\n\n\u2026\n\nii) que sera necesario el voto favorable de las Acciones Clase \"A\" o ~~y en su caso~~ de los dos directores designados a propuesta de los accionistas de la Clase \"A\" segun sea el caso. para ~~decisiones estrat\u00e9gicas como~~ por ~~ejemplo~~las siguientes decisiones:\n\n1) aumentos significativos de capital de la sociedad. salvo que ello fuere necesario para garantizar el normal funcionamiento v desarrollo de la misma.\n\n2) ~~alianzas estrat\u00e9gicas u operaciones que afecten la linea de bandera nacional o deban alinearse con la politica aerocomercial argentina.~~El ingreso a alianzas con otras aerolineas intemacionales del tipo de la \"One World\" \"Star Alliance\":\n\n3) ~~resolver la~~ eliminacion o reduccion sustancial de los servicios de transporte aerocomercial de cabotaje.

Lev 19,030),\n\n742.\n\nThe June 2006 Agreement is entitled \"Letter of Intent between the State of Argentina and Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. and Interinvest S.A \". It states that it is the parties\u2019 intention to discuss a number of issues at the next annual/special meeting of the shareholders of ARSA. As Respondent submitted, no reference is made to an increase in airfares in the text of the June 2006 Agreement, nor the Addendum.\n\n743.\n\nNevertheless, Claimants submit that an increase in airfares had been promised by Respondent and formed part of the June 2006 Agreement which Respondent breached when it failed to increase airfares in an amount sufficient to cover the Airlines\u2019 costs and achieve the TER standard.893 Claimants say that they relied on the promises made to it by the Government of Argentina to increase airfares to meet the TER standard to agree to the terms of the June 2006 Agreement.894 Claimants also say that Respondent\u2019s representatives told them that airfare increases would only be granted if ARSA granted wage increases to APTA and APLA\u2019s members.895 Therefore, Claimants argue that Respondent conditioned airfare increases on their political needs and coerced their agreement to the June 2006 Agreement.\n\nCl.

Claimants also say that they agreed to the transfer of ARSA shares to the Government in return for the promised airfare increases and withdrawal of the lawsuits challenging ARSA\u2019s financial statements.\n\n744.\n\nThe evidence surrounding the negotiation of the June 2006 Agreement, commencing with the strike by the unions, APTA and APLA, in November 2005, is complex and not altogether clear. It appears that the strike by the unions, which lasted nine days, led to a request by the Government of Argentina that representatives of the Marsans Group travel to Argentina to discuss the resolution of the strike.896 It appears that during the course of discussions, Mr. Diaz Ferran advised Respondent that the Airlines could not increase wages to resolve the strikes without an airfare increase, to which the Government responded that it would increase airfares and provide a subsidy for jet fuel once an agreement was reached with the union. This led to the signature of a provisional agreement with the unions in December 2005 and the resolution of the strike.897\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 184-190.\n\n*See* \u00b6 398, above, and Diaz Ferran WS \u00b6 31-34; Cl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 188-190.\n\n745.\n\nAlthough the precise details of the strike and the negotiations between Claimants\u2019 representatives, the unions and representatives of the Government are not clear, the Tribunal accepts that the Government was concerned about the strike which had paralyzed the operations of the Airlines and affected air transportation in Argentina and that it would seek to act as an intermediary to resolve the situation. The Tribunal also accepts that, in this context, the Government would summon the unions\u2019 representatives to discuss a solution with Mr. Diaz Ferran and other representatives of the Airlines. While there appears to have been some familiarity between the Government and the union leaders, the Tribunal does not find this necessarily surprising and is unable to conclude that the Government orchestrated or supported the strike. Finally, the Tribunal does not find it surprising that in the context of discussions surrounding the strikes, increases in airfares and other measures were discussed and that the Government indicated that it would increase airfares in order to assist in finding a solution to the strike.\n\n746.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that neither the increase in airfares nor the increase in union salaries are referred to in the June 2006 Agreement. This is perhaps not surprising given the nature of the June 2006 Agreement. The June 2006 Agreement is in the form of an agreement between the shareholders of ARSA to discuss and resolve certain issues at the next shareholders\u2019 meeting. However, the Tribunal is unable to accept that the increase in airfares discussed between the representatives of Claimants and the representatives of Respondent during the course of the various meetings relating to the June 2006 Agreement formed part of that agreement. As a result, the alleged delay and inadequacy in the airfare increase granted in Decree 1012/2006 in August 2006 cannot give rise to a breach of the agreement. Rather, the question of the increase of the airfares, and Claimants\u2019 allegations that it was inadequate, falls to be decided within the more general question of whether Respondent permitted the Airlines to charge economically reasonable tariffs. As discussed above, the Tribunal has concluded that Respondent\u2019s conduct in this regard does not amount to a breach of the FET standard (see paragraphs 654 - 691, above).\n\n747.\n\nWith respect to the items listed in the June 2006 Agreement, the Tribunal finds that each of the parties complied with their obligations: Interinvest transferred approximately 3.2% of ARSA\u2019s stock to Respondent free of charge and provided an option for Respondent to increase its stock holdings to up to 20%; amendments to ARSA\u2019s by-laws were made in order to provide for certain rights which would attach to Class \"A\" shares; and Respondent withdrew the legal proceedings challenging the approval of ARSA\u2019s financial statements for the years 2002, 2003 and 2004.898 As a result, the Tribunal finds that neither Party breached the June 2006 Agreement.\n\nAs indicated above. Respondent consented to the approval of the 2005 financial statements after certain adjustments which it requested were made.\n\n748.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered Claimants\u2019 complaint regarding the alleged deception by Respondent in the drafting of paragraph 1(c) of the June 2006 Agreement relating to Section 1 (c)(ii) of ARSA\u2019s by-laws in respect of the voting rights attaching to Class \"A\" shares held by Respondent.899 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the alleged deception was more likely due to a lack of communication or complication in the process of finalizing the June 2006 Agreement. It appears that any intentional deception was unlikely since one could normally anticipate that the agreement would be reviewed before signing and that any departure from the agreed final version would be noticed by Claimants. In any event, the modification made by Respondent\u2019s representatives was noticed and an addendum containing the parties\u2019 agreed, revised language was signed.\n\nCl.

For the reasons stated there, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that these demonstrate arbitrary or other conduct which rises to the level of a breach of the FET standard set out in the Treaty.\n\n**5. Respondent\u2019s pressure on Claimants to sell the Airlines**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n750.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Airlines were in a very difficult financial condition by the end of 2007 and early 2008. Claimants note that \"[b]y 2007, ARSA had an EBITDA of US$4 million, net losses amounting to US$116 million, and an increase in the company\u2019s accounts payable (or commercial debts with suppliers) of US$34 million compared to 2006. AUSA\u2019s situation was not much better. By the end of 2007, its EBITDA had dropped to USS 4 million, net losses amounting to US$21 million, and AUSA\u2019s account payables (short term debt with suppliers) increased US$20 million between December 2007 and June 2008.\"900 Respondent characterizes the Airlines as being in a state of \"imminent collapse\" by the spring of 2008.901\n\nCl.

Mem. \u00b6217; Cl. Reply \u00b6 265, 275.\n\n752.\n\nIn contrast, Respondent attributes the Airlines\u2019 condition to Claimants\u2019 alleged mismanagement of the Airlines. Respondent also asserts that by the spring of 2008, the Airlines were \"threatening\" to cease all services in several destinations and to reduce flight frequency in others.903\n\n*See, e.g.,* Resp. Rei. \u00b6 444-446; C-78; C-79; C-371.\n\n753.\n\nIn this context of the Airlines\u2019 financial turmoil, Claimants assert that Respondent placed increased pressure on them \"to compel them to sell part or all of their stake in the Argentine Airlines to a local businessman or to the GOA itself.\"904 They argue that Argentina\u2019s ever-increasing \"asphyxiation\" strategy culminated in 2008 with a series of measures that concluded in the formal expropriation of the Airlines.\n\nCl.

This group was led by Mr. Manuel Vazquez, a purported advisor to Secretary of Transportation Jaime, and Mr. Miguel Angel Llorente, a private investor.906 While it does not appear that Mr. Vazquez had an official government position, Claimants state that he was nonetheless an \"advisor\" to Secretary of Transportation Jaime, and that the negotiations he led were therefore *\"de facto\"* negotiations with the Argentine government.907 According to Claimants, it was clear from Mr. Vazquez that the Government of Argentina wanted a sale and transfer of control settled quietly and without any publicity.908\n\nCl.

An April 2, 2008 letter from Mr. Angel Llorente to Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias, which includes the proposed terms of the offer, does not mention Mr. Vazquez or the Government of Argentina.910 An April 3, 2008 response letter, written by Mr. Munoz Perez, counters with a higher sale price, and also includes as a condition that each of the prospective buyers be identified by name and percentage of ownership.911\n\nC-121.\n\nC-122.\n\n758.\n\nClaimants assert that after some negotiations, Mr. Munoz Perez rejected the $150 million offer, which they considered to be too low.912\n\nCl.

Further, while ARSA may have been facing another strike (this time by APLA), the evidence does not bear out that this was coordinated by the Government through Mr. Perez Tamayo to put additional pressure on Claimants.\n\n**The May 2008 Agreement**\n--------------------------\n\n760.\n\nClaimants say that the Government of Argentina subsequently made an official attempt to induce an investor to take over the Airlines. According to Claimants, in mid-April 2008, Mr. Ernesto Gutierrez advised Mr. Pascual Arias that he had been asked by the Government of Argentina to act as an intermediary for the purpose of allowing Argentine investors to acquire participation in ARSA and in increasing the Government of Argentina\u2019s shareholding. It appears that in May 2008, Mr. Gutierrez introduced Mr. Lopez Mena to Claimants. Claimants say that Mr. Lopez Mena was interested in acquiring a controlling participation in the Airlines and that he had the Government of Argentina\u2019s support. Further, in May 2008, Messrs. Pascual Arias and Lopez Mena agreed to initiate a due diligence process for the purchase of a majority share of the Airlines.913 Claimants assert that Mr. Lopez Mena insisted that the Government of Argentina grant him certain guarantees that would allow the Airlines to improve their performance.914\n\nCl.

PHB \u00b6 142. By way of Resolution No. 315/2008 (RA-342), the Secretary of Transportation granted an 18% increase in airfares. The jet fuel supply agreement was dated June 19, 2008: RA-375.\n\n767.\n\nThe May 2008 Agreement provided for two main features: \u00b6 a new corporate structure and ownership chain (with the controlling indirect interest in the Airlines going to the new investor), and 2) Argentina\u2019s agreement to implement specific measures to assist the Airlines.\n\n768.\n\nWith respect to the first feature, the Agreement provided for the reallocation of shares in the Airlines from Interinvest to a new corporate vehicle which would hold 70% of ARSA\u2019s share, divided 48% to the Air Comet-Interinvest Group and 52% to the new investor; the Government of Argentina (up to 20%) and Airline employees (up to 10%).922 Specifically, the Agreement contemplated that (i) Claimants would sell AUSA to ARSA, (ii) the Government of Argentina would make an equity contribution in ARSA and increase its participation in ARSA by 15%, and (iii) Claimants would sell a controlling indirect interest in both airlines to Mr. Lopez Mena.923 The price to be fixed for the shares for the public sector\u2019s interest and the Argentine private company\u2019s interest was to be based on \"the average of the appraisals conducted by three consulting firms with expertise in international quality appraisals selected by the Shareholders with the approval of the Argentine State\"\u2014namely, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and Morgan Stanley.924\n\nThe details of this share transfer are quite complex. *See* Claimants Opening, Slide 81 for more details.\n\nCl.

The valuation of AUSA by PricewaterhouseCoopers indicated a range of USD 130.3 million to 369.4 million (comparable valuation) or USD 381 million (DCF valuation); by Deloitte USD 476 million (DCF valuation); and by Morgan Stanley a range of USD 450 million to 550 million (DCF valuation and comparable valuation).928\n\nC-377.\n\nC-3 75.\n\nC-376.\n\n*Id.; see also* CLEX ER Supp. Report at Figure XIII. These valuations averaged USD 450 million for AUSA alone.\n\n770.\n\nWith respect to the second feature of the May 2008 Agreement, the \"Viability Measures for Aerolineas and Austral,\" these measures included an increase in airfares by 18%, a price cap of ARS 1.85 per liter for fuel, exemptions on VAT and other taxes, renewal of the fleet, resolution of ARSA\u2019s debts, among other measures (Articles 2.1-2.11). According to Claimants, these provisions constituted recognition on the part of the Government of Argentina \"that new and urgent airfare increases, tax exemptions and fuel subsidies were needed to make the Argentine Airlines viable\"929 and to make the transaction with Mr. Lopez Mena go forward.\n\nCl.

With respect to the measures promised by Respondent, Mr. Lopez Mena asserted, \"What we are asking, and I\u2019m asking this through you, is that the Government treats us in the same way airlines are treated in serious countries.\"931 According to Mr. Pascual Arias, Mr. Lopez Mena was then \"scared away\" from the deal contemplated under the May 2008 Agreement, due to the Government of Argentina\u2019s record of not fulfilling its commitments and the lack of certainty that the situation would be any different this time.932\n\nCl.

Respondent points to a May 7, 2008 letter from Mr. Lopez Mena to Mr. Pascual Arias clarifying that any such deal was contingent on the favorable results of the audit of the Airlines.937 Respondent also references a statement made by Mr. Lopez Mena\u2019s company, Buquebus: \"[M]r. Lopez Mena decided not to proceed with the purchase of the Airlines because he could never become sufficiently familiarized with the economic, financial and operative situation of the Companies, given that, as already stated, the Marsans group failed to furnish the required information.\"938 Mr. Llorens testified that the May 2008 Agreement failed because Interinvest did not provide \"in a complete fashion the information needed for the due diligence so as to assess the value of the company.\"939 Finally, Respondent notes that Claimants\u2019 witness, Mr. Munoz Perez, testified to the Argentine Congress in August of 2008 that the May 2008 Agreement failed \"because it was not viable,\" and because \"we were unable to implement it in the adequate deadline.\"940\n\nC-312.\n\nResp.

At the time, the Airlines were already in difficult financial conditions and there was evidence of uncertainty surrounding airfares and fuel subsidies. In addition, the proposed deal was complex and the valuations obtained by Claimants were substantial. Thus, the negotiation of the proposed deal could have been expected to take time and there were several potential points of disagreement and uncertainty. As a result, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that either Party was responsible for the failure of the proposed transaction described in the May 2008 Agreement.\n\n776.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent\u2019s involvement in the May 2008 Agreement and its attempt to introduce another private sector investor was improper or amounted to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment due to Claimants\u2019 investment in the Airlines.\n\n**The July 2008 Agreement**\n---------------------------\n\n777.\n\nAfter the deal contemplated by the May 2008 Agreement fell through, the Airlines\u2019 financial situation continued to deteriorate. Claimants assert that \"[b]y mid-2008 the Argentine Airline\u2019s financial condition hit its worst point since Claimants acquired them in October 2001.\"941 Respondent characterizes the Airlines as being \"in truly bankrupt condition\" by this time.942 Respondent moreover asserts that it entered an agreement with the aviation unions on July 9, 2008 to maintain normal labor relations and the provision of air services,943 and that when the Airlines were unable to make payroll for June 2008, the Government of Argentina began to make payments to cover wages and operating expenses as part of its \"emergency financial assistance\" to the Airlines.944\n\nCl.

PHB \u00b6 149.\n\n778.\n\nAfter the failure of the May 2008 Agreement, Interinvest and Respondent began negotiations for the purchase of the Airlines directly by the Government of Argentina. On July 17, 2008, Interinvest and Argentina signed the July 2008 Agreement. Under the terms of the Agreement, Interinvest agreed to sell all of its shares in the Airlines for a price to be determined pursuant to a defined mechanism.945 The Agreement provided that the Parties would take all corporate and statutory steps required to formalize the purchase and sale transaction: Interinvest was required to provide to Respondent all documents required to formalize the transfers provided for in the Agreement; Respondent was required to take all steps legally required for the purchase of Interinvest\u2019s entire stockholding in the Airlines. The Agreement provided for a 60 day transition period to formalize the purchase and sale, during which time a transition board would manage the operations of the Airlines (Article 3). Each party to the Agreement would appoint two members to sit on the Transition Board, which would be presided over by a General Manager appointed by Argentina, who would monitor the Airlines\u2019 operation and be in charge of their daily management (Article 3). Article 4 of the Agreement provided a list of things to be completed by the parties within the 60-day period, and Article 5 provided that the parties would prepare an income statement and balance sheet for the Airlines as of July 17, 2008, the date on which the Transition Board would come into operation.\n\nC-190, quoted above at \u00b6 435 and below at \u00b6 779.\n\n779.\n\nArticle 6 of the Agreement spells out the specific mechanism by which the parties agreed to set the sale price for the Airlines\u2019 shares. In full, Article 6 provides:\n\n(i) The purchase price for AUSTRAL\u2019s [AUSA\u2019s] stock interest shall be determined based on the valuation provided by a valuation entity to be appointed therefor by [Interinvest] and the valuation to be performed at the request of the STATE OF ARGENTINA.\n\n(ii) The purchase price for AEROLINEAS\u2019 [ARSA\u2019s] stock interest shall be determined based on the valuation provided by a valuation entity to be appointed therefor by [Interinvest] and the valuation to be performed at the request of the STATE OF ARGENTINA.\n\nThe STATE OF ARGENTINA shall seek the abovementioned valuations from the Appraisal Board, which agency shall assess the value of the airlines as a whole.\n\nShould the valuations thus performed yield different results and/or if an agreement cannot be otherwise reached as to the price of the two stock interests, a third valuation shall be sought from an impartial local or foreign entity of international renown specialized in the purchase and sale and/or valuation of international airlines; the valuation thus obtained shall be final and definitive as between the Parties.\n\nThe valuation shall be performed using the discounted cash flow method. Such future cash flows shall be calculated using the following assumptions: (i) the cost of fuel at its current subsidized value of $1.85 (one Argentine peso and eighty-five cents) per liter plus VAT; said price is to be changed using reference prices and proportionately to price variations in the market; and (ii) the current fare for domestic flights, modified proportionately to any changes projected for all other costs.\n\n780.\n\nThe July 2008 Agreement was signed at a public event on July 17, 2008 by Secretary Jaime on behalf of Respondent and by the representative of the Interinvest S.A. Group, Mr. Eduardo Aranda. The Agreement provided that it would be ratified by the Federal Minister of Planning and by Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias on July 21, 2008.946 As agreed, the July 2008 Agreement was then ratified on July 21 by Federal Minister of Planning De Vido, the Spanish Ambassador to Argentina, Mr. Estrella, and Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias.\n\nC-90. Messrs. Diaz Ferran and Pascual Arias were referred to as the majority shareholders of ARSA and AUSA.\n\n781.\n\nThere was a dispute between the Parties\u2019 legal experts on the nature of the July 2008 Agreement. Respondent\u2019s expert, Professor Mata, opined that the July 2008 Agreement was a form of preliminary or \"preparatory\" agreement for the purchase and sale of the shares. He also maintained that there was no specific obligation in the Agreement for Interinvest to sell its shares nor for the Government to purchase them. Rather, he agreed to the suggestion that Interinvest could have decided not to sell or the Government of Argentina could have decided not to buy the shares.947 On the other hand, Claimants\u2019 expert, Professor Bianchi, was of the view that the July 2008 Agreement was binding in nature and provided Interinvest with the vested right to sell the shares of the Airlines by means of a sale contract at a price to be defined by an agreed mechanism.948\n\n*See* Professor Mata\u2019s evidence at Transcript pp. 662, 664-665.\n\nBianchi ER1 \u00b6 43-48; Transcript pp. 589-590.\n\n782.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the July 2008 Agreement constituted a binding agreement between Interinvest and the Government of Argentina pursuant to which the two parties agreed to the purchase and sale of Interinvest\u2019s shares in the Airlines on the terms set out in the Agreement. Whether a further, formalized purchase and sale agreement was envisioned by the Parties does not affect the binding nature of the commitments contained in the July 2008 Agreement. The Parties to the agreement agreed to the purchase and sale of the Airlines on certain terms.949 The July 2008 Agreement came in to full force and effect upon ratification by the Government\u2019s Minister of Federal Planning, Mr. De Vido, on July 21, 2008. Further, as of that date, the Parties commenced the implementation of the July 2008 Agreement with the appointment of the Transition Committee and the Interim General Manager, Mr. Alak. As will be discussed further below, the Parties generally comported themselves in a manner that indicated that they considered themselves bound by the agreement well into November of 2008.\n\nThis is reflected in the oral evidence of Mr. Llorens, the Legal Subsecretary of the Federal Ministry of Planning, Public Investment and Services, who agreed that in the July 2008 Agreement, the Government agreed to buy the Airlines provided certain conditions were met. *See* Transcript p. 633. Mr. Llorens also accepted that the Agreement provided for a mechanism to set the price for the shares and provided for a DCF valuation methodology.\n\n783.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted some disagreement between the Parties\u2019 legal experts as to whether there was a requirement that the July 2008 Agreement be approved by Congress. Professor Bianchi was of the view that the agreement became fully effective upon formal ratification by Minister De Vido and that if the agreement was subsequently submitted for Congressional approval, this was a political decision by the Executive. In his opinion, the purchase of a company, in this case of the shares of the Airlines, is administrative matter which fell within the scope of authority of the Executive.950 On the other hand, Professor Mata was of the view that the approval of Congress was required since the privatization of ARSA had been approved by an act of Congress. According to him, the acquisition of the shares of the Airlines entailed reversing the privatization as well as the Government of Argentina\u2019s re-assumption of the corporate decision-making power over the Airlines, both of which required the approval of Congress. Further, according to Professor Mata, the purchase of the Airlines\u2019 shares implied the need for earmarking within the national budget which required the consideration and approval of Congress.951 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, whether Congress\u2019 approval was required for the implementation of the purchase of the Airlines does not affect the binding nature of the commitments made by the Government of Argentina in the July 2008 Agreement.\n\nBianchi ER1 \u00b6\u00b6 49-50; Transcript pp. 602-604. He also disagreed with Professor Mata that a law approving the Agreement was required because ARSA had been privatized by way of a statute adopted by Congress or because the amount to be paid for the transaction had to be reflected in the budget. *See* Bianchi ER1 \u00b650: Transcript pp. 602-603.\n\nMata ER4 \u00b6\u00b6 16-22; Transcript Day 4, pp. 625-626.\n\n784.\n\nIn this regard, the agreement does not expressly provide for approval by Congress before it was to come into effect. Rather, Article 2 of the Agreement provides that Respondent was required to \"take [all] the steps legally required for the purchase of [Interinvest\u2019s] entire stockholding in Aerolineas and Austral.\" After having been signed by the Secretary of Transportation on July 21, 2008, the Agreement was ratified by the Federal Minister of Planning, Claimants and the Spanish Ambassador to Argentina. In these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the Government of Argentina bound itself to the provisions of the July 2008 Agreement without the condition of approval by Congress. In any event, Respondent accepts that Law No. 26,412 approved the July 2008 Agreement, albeit with some modifications.952\n\n*See* the testimony of Mr. Llorens at Transcript p. 640. In addition, Mr. Llorens testified that after the adoption of Law No. 26,412, the pricing mechanism under the agreement continued to be in force and that pursuing its implementation was not inconsistent with Law No. 26,412.\n\n785.\n\nClaimants assert that at the same time the July 2008 Agreement was signed, Interinvest also signed a \"List of Non-Contractual Arrangements\" with the Government.953 According to Claimants, this Side Agreement was necessary because the executives of the Airlines \"had been the object of persecution in the courts and in the media\" and they wanted to ensure that once the Airlines were sold, \"the judicial persecution would cease.\"954 This \"List\" provides as follows:\n\nStay of all court actions. Immediate.\n\nUpon the signing of the agreement, all court actions will be dropped.\n\nSigning of the Agreement: On Monday 21, before the ambassador to Spain (who will also be signing), the Argentine Minister, and the executing parties.\n\nOral agreement that there will be no political, media or court persecution and that upon the execution of all final documents, the broadest statutory guarantees will be given.955\n\nThis side agreement is appended to Claimants\u2019 copy of the July 2008 Agreement: C-190. It is not, however, included in Respondent\u2019s copy of the July 2008 Agreement: RA-559.\n\n*See* Pascual Arias WS \u00b680.\n\nC-190.\n\n786.\n\nRespondent strenuously denies that this \"extra contractual arrangement\" was a part of the July 2008 Agreement and asserts that the alleged signatory was not a State representative.956\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 474-475.\n\n787.\n\nIt appears that the Side Agreement was signed on July 16, 2008 and that one of the signatures was by Mr. Gutierrez at whose offices the Parties met on that date.957 It does not appear that Mr. Gutierrez was acting in any formal capacity as Respondent\u2019s representative. However, the evidence indicates that he was involved as a *de facto* agent or facilitator on behalf of Respondent in respect of both the May 2008 Agreement and the July 2008 Agreement.958 Although the Side Agreement is not formally referred to in the July 2008 Agreement, nor expressly appended to that agreement as an exhibit, it does appear to have been signed contemporaneously with the agreement and lists at least one agreed term relating to the July 2008 Agreement: signature of the July 2008 Agreement on July 21st with the presence and signature by the Spanish Ambassador to Argentina.959\n\nMunoz Perez, Transcript pp. 455-456; Cl.

Pascual Arias (WS \u00b6 80) and Munoz Perez (WS 1 \u00b6 12) make some reference to legal actions and threats against the representatives of the Marsans Group and the Airlines, but there was little or no evidence of the alleged legal proceedings in the record. Further, Mr. Llorens denied having threatened Mr. Munoz Perez. In any event, according to Mr. Munoz Perez, he held firm to his position regarding the terms of the July 2008 Agreement and did not give in to the alleged threats. Subsequently, the Parties negotiated and signed the final text of the July 2008 Agreement. Munoz Perez, Transcript pp. 453-456.\n\n788.\n\nEach of the Parties accuses the other of breaching the July 2008 Agreement. For their part, Claimants say that Respondent effectively repudiated the agreement by failing to simply submit it for approval by the Argentine Congress and, instead, filing a bill for a \"repossession\" or *\"rescate\"* law. In addition, they say that the lengthy Presidential message which introduced the *rescate* bill contained a variety of false statements and many negative remarks in an attempt to generate a strong reaction from Congress against Claimants and the July 2008 Agreement.960 Further, Claimants say that Law No. 26,412, which approved Respondent\u2019s \"repossession\" or *\"rescate\"* of the Airlines, referred only to calculation of compensation for the purchase of the shares by the TTN and made no reference to the July 2008 Agreement or the valuation methodology contained in the agreement.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 299-304. Claimants say that despite their attempt to have Respondent correct the false statements, this was not done.\n\n789.\n\nClaimants also say that after the adoption of Law No. 26,412 in September 2008, Respondent continued to act in an arbitrary and non-transparent manner by acting as if it were abiding by the July 2008 Agreement while, at the same time, repudiating it. They say that Respondent maintained discussions and meetings with them (primarily relating to the valuation submitted by Claimants) in the pretense that it was going to enforce and comply with the July 2008 Agreement. However, Claimants say that Respondent did not do this and effectively took control of the Airlines in November 2008 and subsequently expropriated the shares in the Airlines in December 2008. Claimants say that this conduct violated the FET standard in a number of ways, in particular the requirements that Respondent act transparently and consistently towards Claimants\u2019 investment, that it respect Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations and rights and that it act in good faith.961\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 453-456; Cl. Reply \u00b6 304, 479, 496-497. Claimants say that both the *Rescate* Law and the Expropriation Law repudiated the July 2008 Agreement.\n\n790.\n\nClaimants also say that Respondent breached the July 2008 Agreement by failing to conduct the valuation pursuant to Article 6 of the Agreement in accordance with the DCF methodology agreed. According to Claimants, the DCF valuation that was prepared for Respondent by the TTN did not adopt the terms of the July 2008 Agreement.962\n\nAccording to Claimants, the TTN\u2019s DCF valuation assumed only 5 years of cash flows and terminal value for the Airlines; applied discount rates in ARS to cash flows in USD; did not adjust airfares in proportion to cost increases. *See,* for example. Cl. PHB \u00b6130. The Tribunal notes that the TTN\u2019s primary basis for valuation was an asset valuation: *see* TTN\u2019s valuation dated October 10, 2008: C-204. Claimants also say that under its DCF valuation, the TTN had valued AUSA at USD 79 million, but arbitrarily concluded that since ARSA had a negative value that exceeded AUSA\u2019s positive valuation, no compensation was due to Claimants for AUSA: Cl. PHB \u00b6131.\n\n791.\n\nIn addition, and in any event, Claimants say that since Credit Suisse\u2019s valuation and TTN\u2019s valuation differed, the Parties were obliged to appoint a third, independent valuator in accordance with Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. However, Respondent refused to do so despite Claimants\u2019 repeated requests. Claimants maintain that to justify this refusal, Respondent raised a number of invalid objections, including, *inter alia,* that: the Credit Suisse valuation did not bear a holographic signature and was not apostilled; it lacked information to properly asses the Credit Suisse valuation and the Airlines in general; and Marsans Group/Interinvest had failed to submit a draft 2007 balance sheet sufficiently in advance of the shareholders\u2019 meeting called to approve it.963 Claimants say that, for a number of reasons, these objections were not valid.\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6134.\n\n792.\n\nFurther, Claimants say that although the Transition Committee\u2019s powers and term should have expired on October 14, 2008, Respondent continued to control the Airlines through the General Manager, Mr. Alak, appointed under the July 2008 Agreement. When Claimants attempted to call a Board of Directors\u2019 meeting with a view to removing Mr. Alak as Interim General Manager, Respondent requested and obtained an injunction preventing any change in the Board of Directors or the removal of Mr. Alak.964\n\nCl.

It says that the Law authorized the executive branch of government to enter into a share purchase agreement and that after the enactment of the Law, it continued to make its best efforts to ensure the requirements and conditions set forth in the Agreement were met.965\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6 156.\n\n794.\n\nIn this regard, Respondent says that Claimants failed to provide the financial information required under the terms of the July 2008 Agreement. Specifically, Respondent says that the Credit Suisse valuation submitted by Claimants was not properly signed, nor was it independent. Further, Respondent says that Claimants failed or refused to provide all of the necessary information to assess the Credit Suisse valuation and therefore it could not consider the valuation as an appraisal under Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement.966\n\nResp.

Rej. \u00b6\u00b6498-499.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6501. According to Mr. Llorens, Claimants never submitted the documentation required to support the Credit Suisse valuation, which constituted a breach of the July 2008 Agreement.

It alleges, amongst other things, that they never complied with their commitments to make investments, increase regular flights and incorporate new aircraft in either domestic or international services. It also states that the serious situation of the Airlines was due to the deficient management by Marsans Group. It also referred to alleged repeated failure to comply with agreements with the Government of Argentina and the failure to comply with operating requirements for routes covered by their concessions, as well as the failure to meet technical requirements pursuant to the terms of the Air Transportation Code.977\n\n*See* Munoz Perez WS2, App. 12. The message was also highly critical of the management of the Airlines prior to 2001 and of the privatization policy under which the Airlines had been privatized. The introductory message also stated that it was in the interest of the State that the final price arrived by application of the provisions in the July 2008 Agreement be subject to approval of Congress.\n\n802.\n\nAs noted previously, on July 29, 2008, Interinvest wrote to the Federal Minister of Planning and to the Secretary of Transportation to complain that the introductory message contained many incorrect statements contrary to the interests of Interinvest and its management of the Airlines. Interinvest also complained that the statements in question were unnecessary for the purpose of submitting the bill to Congress. On September 16, 2008, Interinvest submitted a lengthy and detailed document pointing out the many alleged inaccuracies contained in the Presidential introductory message.978\n\nMunoz Perez WS2, App. 13. Interinvest's response runs to 44 pages. It addresses, *inter alia,* the fact that the Airlines were under the supervision of the Secretariat of Transportation and other authorities which regularly reviewed their operations and had renewed the Airlines\u2019 concessions. Interinvest also denied that its management of the Airlines was inadequate and raised the issue of the very significant increase in the costs of the Airlines and the inadequacy of the airfare increases which did not comply with the TER standard.\n\n803.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the message introducing the proposed bill was partial and did not give a fair account of the reasons for the serious financial conditions of the Airlines. As indicated above, the Tribunal has found that Respondent has not, for the most part, demonstrated the alleged poor management of the Airlines. Further, the introductory message took no account of the sharply increasing costs of the Airlines and the fact that these were only offset to a limited extent by measures adopted by the Government, nor the poor market conditions faced by the airline industry. As the Tribunal has found previously, the Government repeatedly acknowledged the crisis faced by airlines by implementing and continuing a state of emergency in the air transportation sector and in the various decrees and resolutions implementing airfare increases and proposed tax measures to assist the industry. In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the introductory message introducing the request for approval of the July 2008 Agreement was not fairly balanced and could not have been of much, if any, support for the approval of the terms of the July 2008 Agreement.\n\n804.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal finds that the statement made by the Government representatives to the committee of Congress considering the bill were also not supportive of the adoption of the July 2008 Agreement. For example, Secretary Jaime was critical of the performance and management of the Airlines and offered his view that ARSA had been deprived of much and that \"obviously, I consider that nothing should be paid. However, it is the appropriate agencies which will determine which is the true price to be paid, one or the other. That will be determined by Congress.\"979 Secretary Jaime\u2019s statements were also inconsistent. On occasion he stated that if there was no agreement on the price, then there would be a third valuation by an international entity. However, at other times, he stated that the third-party valuation would be binding on the Parties and unappealable by them, but not on Congress which could decide not to approve the price determined by the third valuator.980\n\nC-196. \"4 *Aerolineas se le ha sacado mucho. Obviamente, considero que no se debe pagar nada. Pero, son los organismos que corresponden aquellos que determinaran cual es el verdadero precio que tendrd que pagar, uno o el otro. Eso lo determinara el Congreso de la Nation. \"*\n\n*See* C-196, pp. 16/49, 42/49, 43/49.\n\n805.\n\nThe bill submitting the July 2008 Agreement for approval proposes the repossession or *rescate* of the Airlines and the approval of the agreement which was attached Annex 1. The bill provided that the TTN would perform the valuation provided for in Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. It also provided that the price determined by Article 6 of the Agreement would have to be submitted to Congress for approval before payment.981\n\nDraft bill Articles 2-3: Munoz Perez WS2, App. 12.\n\n806.\n\nThe Argentine Congress enacted Law No. 26,412 on September 18, 2008, approving the Government\u2019s \"repossession\" of the Airlines.982 The law provides, in relevant part:\n\n**SECTION 1** - In order to guarantee the public service of commercial air transport for passengers, mail and cargo, the Argentine State shall redeem the shares in Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. and Austral Lineas Aereas - Cielos del Sur S.A, and any other company owned by them (Optar S.A., Jet Paq S.A., Aerohandling S.A.), by purchasing their capital stock.\n\n**SECTION 2 -** The National Valuation Office shall assess the companies Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. and Austral Lineas Aereas - Cielos del Sur S.A, pursuant to Section 1 hereof. Valuations will be carried out taking into consideration the values prevailing as of July 1, 2008. The Joint Committee of the House and the Senate for State Reform and Privatization Follow Up created under Section 14 of Law 23,696, shall supervise the valuations, ensuring that they take into account the companies\u2019 actual Shareholders\u2019 Equity and that they are in keeping with the technical criteria governing the activities that those companies are engaged in.\n\n**SECTION 3** - The price determined shall be submitted to the Honourable Argentine Congress for approval...983\n\nC-13.\n\nC-388. The full text of Law 26,412 is set out at para. 442, above.\n\n807.\n\nAlthough Article 1 of Law No. 26,412 provides that the redemption of the shares would be achieved by way of their purchase, no reference is made to the July 2008 Agreement nor the methodology contained in it for the determination of the price of the shares. Rather, the only valuations mentioned were to be performed by the TTN and supervised by the joint committee of Congress, with the price determined to be subject to congressional approval.\n\n808.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether Law No. 26,412, as enacted, disregarded or breached the July 2008 Agreement. Claimants assert that, \"in a clear breach of the July 2008 Agreement, Law No. 26,412 did not make any reference to the July 2008 Agreement section establishing that in case of disagreement between the Parties\u2019 valuations, the price of the Argentine Airlines\u2019 shares would be set by a third independent and renowned valuation agency.\"984 Instead, the law provided only that the Tribunal de Tasaciones, the TTN, would calculate the compensation.985\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opening, Transcript pp. 170-171.\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 126.\n\n809.\n\nRespondent asserts, however, that Law No. 26,412 did not disregard or ignore the July 2008 Agreement. To the contrary, it argues the July 2008 Agreement provided in Article 2 that the Government of Argentina \"shall take all steps legally required for the purchase of [Interinvest] \u2019s entire stockholding in AEROLINEAS and AUSTRAL.\"986 It further argues that Congress was required to approve the July 2008 Agreement because the share purchase needed to be ear-marked in the national budget, and also because the Agreement reversed an older law privatizing the Airlines.987\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6505; *see also* C-190.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing, Transcript p. 1750; *see also* Testimony of Ismael Mata, Transcript pp. 625-626.\n\n810.\n\nRespondent points out, furthermore, that following the enactment of Law No. 26,412, the Government of Argentina made its best efforts to ensure that the requirements and conditions set forth in the July 2008 Agreement were met.988\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6 156; *see also* Testimony of Undersecretary Llorens, Transcript pp. 640-641 (agreeing that Law 26,412 approved the July 2008 Agreement, \"with some modifications\").\n\n811.\n\nAlthough Law No. 26,412 did not refer to the July 2008 Agreement nor incorporate the valuation methodology contained in the agreement, the law was not necessarily inconsistent with the agreement. There was no express requirement in the July 2008 Agreement for the Government of Argentina to obtain the approval of Congress, nor for it to set out the valuation methodology for determining the price of the purchase of the Airlines\u2019 shares. Rather, the Government of Argentina\u2019s obligation was to take all steps legally required for the purchase of Interinvest\u2019s entire shareholding in the Airlines. The agreement also required, in Article 6, that the Government of Argentina should seek the valuations provided for in that article from the TTN. On its face, Law No. 26,412 provided for valuations of both Airlines by the TTN. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, whether the valuations were properly conducted by the TTN (or Interinvest) and the subsequent failure to propose or agree to appoint a third valuator is a separate matter. There was no indication that these issues were specifically related to Law No. 26,412. As a result, the Tribunal cannot conclude that Law No. 26,412 itself breached the July 2008 Agreement as alleged by Claimants. Rather, the relevant question is whether the Parties complied with their obligations under the Agreement to conduct the valuations provided for and, in the event of a failure to agree on a price, to appoint a third valuator to determine the same.\n\n812.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it appears common ground between the Parties that the July 2008 Agreement remained in force irrespective of the adoption of Law No. 26,412. As discussed below, the Parties continued to address the valuations throughout the month of October and into November 2008.989\n\nIn this regard, Mr. Llorens accepted that the pricing mechanism in Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement remained in force at the time he wrote his letter of October 30, 2008 and that he was acting consistently with Law No. 26,412: Transcript p. 640; RL-23.\n\n**The valuations of the Airlines**\n----------------------------------\n\n813.\n\nAfter the execution and ratification of the July 2008 Agreement, the Transition Committee commenced its function and Mr. Alak was appointed the General Manager of the Airlines. At its first meeting, the Transition Committee set out its duties and those of the General Manager who, in addition to control of operations and daily management of the Companies under the instructions of the Transition Committee, was also charged with implementing the necessary actions required to perfect the purchase and sale agreement which was the subject of the July 2008 Agreement. Further, at the request of Interinvest, information requests in respect of the Airlines were to be centralized or channeled through the General Manager.990\n\nRA-378. This was confirmed at the second meeting of the Transition Committee where the representatives of the State confirmed that administrative managements had been made so that all document or information requests and their receipt should be implemented through the General Manager. Further, the State\u2019s representatives indicated that the teams from the Ministry of Planning, the General Audit Office (AGN) and the Siren would participate in information requests and assist the General Manager. With respect to the valuations of the shares of ARSA and AUSA, the minutes record that the valuations would be performed by entities appointed by Interinvest and the State pursuant to the DCF methodology in accordance with Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement and that the members of the Transition Committee requested that the valuating entities consider that, to the extent possible, the valuations should be technically comparable. RA-379, p. 2.\n\n814.\n\nBy October 14, 2008, valuations had been prepared by both the TTN and Credit Suisse and exchanged between Interinvest and Respondent. The TTN\u2019s valuation was dated October 9, 2008 and was submitted to Subsecretary Llorens on October 10, 2008.991 The Credit Suisse valuation was dated October 12, 2008.992 These two valuations were dramatically different. Credit Suisse\u2019s valuation for the Airlines ranged between USD 330 million to USD 540 million.993 The TTN\u2019s valuation found the Airlines to have a negative value of USD 832 million.994\n\nLlorens WS1, Ex. 12; C-204.\n\nC-2001. A certified and apostilled copy of the Credit Suisse report was also prepared on October 31, 2008.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 269; Credit Suisse Valuation, October 12, 2008, at 7: C-201.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 270; Tribunal de Tasaciones de la Nacion October 2008 Valuation, at 1: C-204. Claimants also note that the Tribunal de Tasaciones de la Nacion drafted two additional valuations of the Airlines at the request of the Government of Argentina in November 2008 and January 2009. Those valuations also resulted in billionaire negative values in ARS. These were submitted as C-380 and C-379, respectively.\n\n815.\n\nThe Parties have three fundamental disagreements with respect to the valuations. First, they disagree as to whether the valuation submitted by Interinvest complied with the requirements of the July 2008 Agreement. As outlined below, Respondent asserts that Claimants breached the agreement by failing to provide a valid valuation, which it says required a signed and apostilled independent valuation. Respondent also says that Interinvest failed to provide all of the financial information it was required to provide such that the TTN could fully analyze the Credit Suisse valuation. Claimants assert that Respondent had access to all the information and unjustifiably rejected the Credit Suisse valuation. Second, the Parties disagree as to whether the TTN\u2019s valuation was independent and in compliance with the Agreement. Third, the Parties accuse each other of breaching the July 2008 Agreement with respect to the obligation to finalize the Airlines\u2019 financial statements.\n\n816.\n\nAfter receiving Claimants\u2019 Credit Suisse valuation, Undersecretary Llorens995 requested on October 15, 2008 that Interinvest submit supporting materials for the Credit Suisse valuation, specifically with respect to the valuation\u2019s EBITDA, WACC and TIR indexes.996 Undersecretary Llorens reiterated this request on October 23, 2008.997 On that same day, Interinvest requested the exhibits supporting the TTN\u2019s first valuation,998 and these exhibits were provided to Interinvest on October 27, 2008.999 On October 27, 2008, Interinvest presented supplementary materials. However, Undersecretary Llorens asserts that these materials were insufficient.1000\n\nUndersecretary Llorens notes that the Secretariat of Transportation reports to the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services, and that the Undersecretariat of Legal Affairs therefore handles legal issues for the Secretariat of Transportation.\n\nRL-13.\n\nRL-16.\n\nRL-15.\n\nRL-19.\n\nLlorens WS1, \u00b6 41.\n\n817.\n\nConcurrent with Undersecretary Llorens\u2019 requests for supplemental materials supporting the Credit Suisse valuation, he also requested that Interinvest submit a signed copy of the Credit Suisse valuation that complied with the requirements of the Hague Convention of 1961.1001 According to Respondent and Undersecretary Llorens, the Credit Suisse valuation as submitted by Interinvest did not have a holographic signature.1002 Undersecretary Llorens asserts that he met with a representative from Interinvest and a representative from Credit Suisse to discuss the outstanding issues on October 29, 2008. According to Undersecretary Llorens, the Credit Suisse representative clarified that the Credit Suisse report was indeed a valuation, but that it should not be considered to be independent.1003 Respondent points out that Mr. Munoz Perez confirmed that the Credit Suisse valuation was based on the Business Plan prepared by the Board of Directors of the Marsans Group.1004\n\nLlorens WS3,\u00b6 41 ; *see* letters from Undersecretariat of Legal Affairs to Interinvest of October 24 (RL-17) and October 28, 2008 (RL-20).\n\nLlorens WS3 \u00b634; *see also* Respondent\u2019s Closing, Transcript p. 1752.\n\nLlorens WS \u00b6\u00b642-43.\n\nResp. PHB \u00b640, citing Testimony of Munoz Perez, Transcript p. 489.\n\n818.\n\nOn October 30, 2008, Undersecretary Llorens sent a letter responding to Interinvest\u2019s request for the appointment of a third-party independent valuator per the terms of Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement.1005 In this letter, the Undersecretariat of Legal Affairs asserted that it could not consider the Credit Suisse documents submitted as an appraisal under Article 6, as Interinvest and Credit Suisse had not responded to the Undersecretariat\u2019s requests for signatures and verification. In the letter, Interinvest was warned that it was required to submit the valuation within 48 hours on penalty of breach of the July 2008 Agreement.\n\nRL-23.\n\n819.\n\nOn November 4, 2008, Interinvest submitted the Credit Suisse valuation \"with the appropriate certifications and authentications under the law governing its execution and the international certification pursuant to the Apostille system established by The Hague Conference,\" according to Undersecretary Llorens.1006 However, Undersecretary Llorens asserts that this valuation only partially complied with the letters sent by the Undersecretariat of Legal Affairs.1007 On November 7, 2008, Undersecretary Llorens issued a letter to Interinvest repeating the request for specific documentation supporting the Credit Suisse valuation.1008 In this letter, Interinvest was informed of the Undersecretariat\u2019s view that it was not possible to finalize discussion of the valuations, or to affirm the lack of consensus as to a price for the transfer of shares until Interinvest satisfied these requests for documents and information.1009\n\nLlorens WS3 \u00b647.\n\nLlorens WS3 \u00b647.\n\nRL-25.\n\n*Id.*\n\n820.\n\nClaimants assert a number of arguments in response to the issues raised by Respondent through Undersecretary Llorens. First, Claimants argue that although they were unnecessary, Credit Suisse did in fact provide the signatures and formalities required by the Undersecretariat, and within a week of its first request.1010 Second, with respect to the supporting documents requested by Respondent, Claimants argue that TTN President, Mr. Daniel Martin, conceded that he had sufficient information to analyze the Credit Suisse valuation.1011 Third, with respect to the assertion that Credit Suisse\u2019s valuation was not \"independent,\" Claimants argue that \"the GOA could have simply disregarded Credit Suisse\u2019s valuation and appointed together with Interinvest a third independent valuator, as the July 2008 Agreement provided.\"1012 Claimants assert that they requested in writing the appointment of a third independent valuator at least six times between late October and mid-November 2008, and that Respondent failed to appoint a third valuator.1013\n\nClaimants\u2019 Closing, Transcript p. 1657.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Closing, Transcript p. 1658.\n\nCl.

PHB \u00b6 133; *see also* C-202; C-209; RL-24; C-210; and C-886.\n\n821.\n\nFurther, Claimants assert that the TTN did not observe the terms agreed to under the July 2008 Agreement with respect to the valuation.1014 The TTN\u2019s primary valuation was not performed on a DCF basis but, rather, on an asset valuation or liquidation basis. Further, they assert that the TTN\u2019s DCF valuation i) assumed only five years of cash flows and no terminal value for the Airlines, ii) applied discount rates in ARS to cash flows in USD, and iii) did not adjust airfares in proportion to cost increases.1015 Claimants point to testimony given by Mr. Martin to Congress, in which he stated that \"the valuation that we are conducting is different from the one agreed in the [July 2008 Agreement], In this respect, we have contacted Credit Suisse, the agency in charge of valuing the [Argentine Airlines] in accordance with the methodology agreed in the [July 2008 Agreement].\"1016 Furthermore, Claimants argue that as an agency of the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment, and Services, the TTN lacked independence in conducting its own valuation.1017 Finally, Claimants\u2019 legal expert, Dr. Bianchi, asserts that the TTN lacks the technical standards and rules needed to appraise the shares of going concerns like the Airlines.1018\n\nCl.

For its part, Respondent argues that the Marsans Group did not have available sufficient accounting information to determine the real state of the Airlines at the time the July 2008 Agreement was executed.1019 Respondent says that Interinvest, as majority shareholder in the Airlines, provided only unaudited, incomplete copies of the July 17, 2008 financial statements as required pursuant to Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement.1020 Claimants, in response, argue that both the Interim General Manager, Mr. Alak, and the TTN had access to these statements.1021\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 152, 159, 161.\n\nLlorens WS3 \u00b6 54-60. *See also* Resp.

PHB \u00b6\u00b6 139-140.\n\n823.\n\nCommencing with Respondent\u2019s allegations that the Credit Suisse valuation did not comply with the requirements of the July 2008 Agreement, the Tribunal has concluded that these are not valid. In relation to Respondent\u2019s complaint that the Credit Suisse valuation was not signed and apostilled, the Tribunal notes that neither was required by the terms of the July 2008 Agreement. In any event, Credit Suisse explained that it does not normally sign its valuation reports and, in any event, confirmed at a meeting on October 29, 2008 their authorship of the valuation report.1022 Further, Credit Suisse then submitted a signed and apostilled version of its valuation report.1023\n\nPublic deed of meeting, October 29, 2008: C-2008.\n\nLetter from Interinvest to Mr. Llorens, dated November 4, 2008: RL-24; C-201.\n\n824.\n\nAs concerns Respondent\u2019s position that the Credit Suisse valuation was not independent, the Tribunal again notes that there was no requirement in the July 2008 Agreement that the valuations performed by the Parties were to be \"independent\". Evidence in the record demonstrates that Interinvest had requested the assistance of Credit Suisse earlier in 2008 to assist it with a valuation of the Airlines when Interinvest had been approached by Mr. Llorente regarding the purchase of the Airlines (January 2008) and in respect of the May 2008 Agreement.1024 In these circumstances, it seems logical for Interinvest to have had recourse, again, to Credit Suisse when it required a valuation pursuant to the July 2008 Agreement terms. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the fact that Credit Suisse had previously performed services for Interinvest did not disqualify it as an appropriate entity for the valuation of the Airlines\u2019 shares pursuant to Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. Similarly, the TTN\u2019s relationship with Respondent on the basis of lack of independence does not disqualify it as an appropriate entity for the valuation of the Airlines.\n\n*See,* for example, Pascual Arias WS \u00b6 68; *See also* RA-555: the letter from Buquebus dated October 21, 2013 in which that company states that Claimants had designated Credit Suisse as their contact for obtaining information and due diligence in relation to the May 2008 Agreement.\n\n825.\n\nInsofar as Respondent alleges that the Credit Suisse valuation was not independent in the sense that Credit Suisse did not independently verify or audit the documents and information used for the purposes of its valuation, the Tribunal finds that this was neither required by the July 2008 Agreement, nor was it practical. Further, Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement specified certain agreed parameters for a DCF valuation and Respondent did not object to the Credit Suisse valuation on that basis. In any event, neither of the valuations prepared by Credit Suisse and the TTN were binding on the Parties. Either Party was entitled to disagree with the valuation provided by the other Party and proceed to valuation from \"...an impartial, local or foreign entity of international renown specialized in the purchase and sale and/or valuation of international airlines.\" By agreement of the Parties, that valuation was agreed to be \"final and definitive\" as between the Parties (July 2008 Agreement, Article 6). In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent\u2019s complaints regarding the Credit Suisse valuation were highly formal and artificial.\n\n826.\n\nTurning to the question of whether Respondent and the TTN had sufficient information to assess the value of ARSA and AUSA, the Tribunal concludes that they did, in fact, have sufficient information and that Respondent\u2019s complaints with respect to what was provided by Interinvest do not amount to a breach by Claimants of the terms of the July 2008 Agreement. In addressing this question, it is important to bear in mind the context leading up to the adoption of the agreement.\n\n827.\n\nIn this regard, as a shareholder and through its representation on the Board of Directors, Respondent had challenged the financial statements of ARSA for the years 2002 through 2005 and, as described above, eventually approved those statements as part of the June 2006 Agreement. By way of this process, Respondent must have had considerable information and familiarity with ARSA\u2019s financial statements and financial situation more generally. Further, by way of the June 2006 Agreement, the Government of Argentina appointed a second member of the Board of Directors of ARSA and appointed a member to ARSA\u2019s audit committee. As a result, in the words of Mr. Llorens, after the June 2006 Agreement, Respondent \"started to participate in the day-to-day operations of the Company.\"1025 Further, the May 2008 Agreement involved the production of three different valuations of AUSA by international valuation firms and must have provided considerable additional information in that context. Finally, upon the appointment of the Transition Committee and Mr. Alak as the Interim General Manager, Respondent had broad access to the information of the Airlines. As noted previously, all requests for information from Respondent and its various entities were channeled through Mr. Alak as Interim General Manager of the Airlines. The evidence also indicates that Interinvest did produce, and make available, information in response to the Respondent\u2019s requests.\n\nTranscript of Mr. Llorens\u2019 testimony. Hearing on Jurisdiction, Day 2, p. 298, quoted at Cl. PHB \u00b6 100.\n\n828.\n\nA review of the evidence indicates that the TTN was able to assess Credit Suisse\u2019s valuation. This is reflected in the minutes of the meeting held between the TTN and Credit Suisse on October 29, 2008 and, in particular, the TTN\u2019s supplemental report dated November 12, 2008 in which it confirmed its valuation and addressed Interinvest\u2019s complaints regarding the TTN valuation and critiqued Credit Suisse\u2019s valuation.1026 In addition, Mr. Martin accepted in his testimony that the TTN was able to analyze the Credit Suisse valuation and provide its views on it.1027\n\nC-208; C-380.\n\nTranscript pp. 675-676. Mr. Martin also accepted that no complaint was made in the TTN supplementary report regarding the lack of information. *See also* the testimony of Mr. Llorens at Transcript p. 647, accepting that the TTN was able to analyze the Credit Suisse valuation.\n\n829.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimants breached the July 2008 Agreement by failing to provide a valid valuation or by failing to provide the financial information required such that the TTN and Respondent could adequately analyze the Credit Suisse valuation.\n\n830.\n\nTurning to Claimants\u2019 argument that the TTN valuation was not in accordance with the terms of the July 2008 Agreement, the Tribunal is not persuaded that this has been made out. While it appears that Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement provides that all of the valuations were to be conducted on a DCF basis and the TTN\u2019s primary valuation was not conducted on that basis, the TTN, nevertheless, conducted a DCF valuation which it set out in its report of October 10, 2008.1028 Claimants assert that the DCF valuation performed by the TTN was not carried out in accordance with the terms of the July 2008 Agreement for a number of reasons.1029 These include the fact that the TTN\u2019s analysis assumed only five years of cash flows and no terminal value for the Airlines; applied discount rates in ARS to cash flows in USD; and did not adjust airfares in proportion to cost increases. These criticisms of the TTN\u2019s DCF valuation appear to be valid and would affect the reliability of that valuation. However, they do not in themselves amount to a breach of the July 2008 Agreement. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the issues between the Parties in respect of these matters are what was intended to be resolved by the third valuator to be appointed under Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. Further, as expressed above, the Agreement did not require that the valuations prepared and submitted by the Parties be independent.\n\nC-204. In its report, the TTN states that, in its view, the best method for valuing the Companies is the substantive or patrimonial value *(valor sustantivo o patrimonial)* and valued the Companies\u2019 assets and liabilities at market value. It also explained why the DCF methodology was not appropriate. It also explained that it had performed a second valuation on the basis of cash flows for five years and a discount rate of 15.6% (pp. 25-27).\n\n*See* Cl. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 130-131 and the sources cited there.\n\n831.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal addresses Respondent\u2019s argument that Interinvest failed to provide an audited income statement and balance sheet for the Airlines as at July 17, 2008.1030 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this does not amount to a breach of the July 2008 Agreement.\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6 161. Respondent submits that ARSA\u2019s auditors, PwC, did not sign the July 17, 2008 statements and the Board did not retain another finn to replace PwC and provide the audited statements. It also submits that the financial statements were approved by the Board, without any audit in November 2008: see the minutes of the ARSA Board meetings of August, September and October 2008: RA-493; notarial certificate of the shareholders\u2019 meeting of November 12, 2008: RL-26.\n\n832.\n\nPursuant to Article 5 of the July 2008 Agreement, the Parties were to prepare an income statement and balance sheet for ARSA and AUSA as of July 17, 2008 and once those statements had been prepared and audited (within the 60-day transition period) the Parties were to review and approve these. Article 5 also provides that the financial statements in question were to be approved by the shareholders of ARSA and AUSA pursuant to the relevant statutory procedures. At the outset, the Tribunal notes that the obligation contained in Article 5 of the July 2008 Agreement is upon the Parties to the Agreement, not solely on Interinvest. Further, although the July 17, 2008 statements were not audited, it appears that drafts of the statements had been circulated by August 28, 2008 when Mr. Alak, the Interim General Manager appointed under the July 2008 Agreement, appeared before Congress.1031\n\nTranscript of Mr. Alak\u2019s appearance before Congress: C-947, p. 46. In his statement, Mr. Alak indicated that drafts of the 2007 financial statements and the July 17, 2008 financial statements had been prepared and circulated. Although the 2007 financial statements had not been studied by the Board of Directors, they had been submitted to the State\u2019s General Audit Office (AGN) for its review and the AGN was in the process of reviewing them.\n\n833.\n\nAt the ARSA shareholders\u2019 meeting of November 12, 2008, the July 17, 2008 financial statements were approved by the majority of the shareholders although the statements had not been audited. The approval of the statements was opposed by the representatives of the Class \"A\" shares (the Government of Argentina) and the Class \"B\" shares (employee shareholdings).1032\n\nRL-26.\n\n834.\n\nAlthough the July 17, 2008 financial statements had not been audited prior to their approval, the evidence indicates that they had been circulated, together with the 2007 financial statements, prior to August 28, 2008. Further, as described above, the TTN was able to analyze and comment on the Credit Suisse valuation despite the lack of audited financial statements at July 17, 2008. In the circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the lack of audited financial statements at July 17, 2008 constituted a breach of the July 2008 Agreement by Claimants. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the Parties did not strictly enforce all of the terms of the July 2008 Agreement. For example, the 60-day transition period appears to have expired on or about October 14, 2008.1033 Nevertheless, the Parties continued discussions of their respective valuations and considered that the Agreement remained in effect.1034\n\nIt appears that on the basis of working days counted from July 21.2008 when the Agreement was formally ratified, 60 days expired on or about October 14, 2008.\n\nIn this regard, *see* Mr. Llorens\u2019 letters of October 30 and November 7, 2008, RL23, RL25. See also the evidence of Mr. Llorens at Transcript pp. 640-641.\n\n835.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s review of the evidence indicates that the Credit Suisse and TTN valuations were very different and there was an impasse between the Parties on reaching agreement on the price to be paid for the shares of ARSA and AUSA. In these circumstances, the appointment of a third valuator to determine the price of the shares was appropriate and required. Clearly, the valuations yielded different results and, in addition, it was plain that agreement could not be reached as to the price of the shares, as provided in Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. In these circumstances, Interinvest requested the appointment of a third, independent valuator a number of times, commencing on October 29, 2008.1035\n\n*See* letters from Interinvest to the Federal Minister of Planning, Mr. De Vido, and the Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Jaime, dated October 29 (C-202); October 30 (C-209); November 4 (RL-24); November 5 (Interinvest\u2019s letter of November 12, 2008 referred to in C-210); November 10 (C-886); and November 12, 2008 (C-210). None of these received a favorable response from Respondent.\n\n**Management of the Airlines and the Injunction**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n836.\n\nIn its letter of November 12, 2008 to the Minister of Planning and the Secretary of Transportation, Interinvest complained that since October 8, 2008, Respondent\u2019s appointees to the Transition Committee had not attended any meetings, although duly invited to do so. As a result, the Transition Committee did not have a sufficient quorum to provide directions to the General Manager appointed under the terms of the July 2008 Agreement. Despite this, the Interim General Manger had continued to manage the Airlines. As a result, Interinvest requested an urgent meeting of the Transition Committee. Interinvest also requested that Respondent proceed with the selection of a third valuator.1036\n\nC-210\n\n837.\n\nAt the Board of Directors meeting of ARSA on November 19, 2008, representatives of Interinvest raised the question of Mr. Alak\u2019s continuation as General Manager without the supervision of the Transition Committee which had not met since October 8, 2008 due to the failure of the Government of Argentina\u2019s representatives to attend the meetings of the Committee. The representatives of Interinvest stated that this constituted a breach of the terms of the July 2008 Agreement and that the General Manager had proceeded to adopt important measures relating to the Airlines without the authorization of the Transition Committee. In addition, Mr. Aranda Unzurrunzaga stated that it had been reported that the Minister of Planning had stated to the press that there would be no third valuator and that it was Congress which had the final word in determining the price of the shares under the July 2008 Agreement. In light of these events, Mr. Aranda proposed that the same powers of General Manager held by Mr. Alak should be given to the Assistant General Manager, Mr. Molina, and that the General Manger could only act jointly with the Assistant General Manager until the Government of Argentina clarified its position with respect to the continuing effect of, and compliance with, the July 2008 Agreement. Mr. Alak objected to the resolution as it was not on the agenda for the meeting. After some discussion, the Board agreed to call another meeting on November 25, 2008 to discuss the proposal of Mr. Aranda.1037\n\nMinutes of the Board Meeting of ARSA, November 19, 2008 C-212, pp. 29-34.\n\n838.\n\nOn November 21, 2008, an Argentine court issued a preliminary injunction ordering that: \u00b6 the current membership of the Airline\u2019s board of directors not be modified; 2) Mr. Julio Alak continue as the Airlines\u2019 Interim General Manager and as a director of ARSA; and 3) a comptroller *(interventor judicial veedor e informante)* be appointed to oversee the operations of the Airlines and provide a report to the court.1038\n\nCl.

Article 1 also designates the TTN to perform the valuation of the Airlines pursuant to Law No. 21,499 (\"Argentine Expropriation Law\").\n\nC-214.\n\nR-314. The law was first approved by the Chamber of Deputies on December 17, 2008.\n\n842.\n\nOn December 30, 2008, Decree 2347/2008 was enacted, establishing the Ministry of Federal Planning as the entity charged with carrying out the expropriation under Law No. 26,466. Under the terms of Decree 2347/2008, the Government of Argentina shall \"exercise any and all rights granted by the shares to be expropriated\" starting from the date of publication of the law and \"until the relevant expropriation process set forth in the above law has been completed.\"1044 This was to be done by an administrative entity created in the decree and consisting of four members named by the Government, including Mr. Alak. According to Claimants, the practical implication of this was that Claimants continued to hold the title to their shares in the Airlines, through their subsidiaries, but were unable to exercise any control over the Airlines through these shares.1045\n\nC-217, cited in Cl.

This valuation, which provided an even greater negative valuation of the Airlines than the TTN\u2019s prior valuations, was, according to Respondent\u2019s expert and TTN President, Mr. Martin, due to the difference in valuation with two additional aircraft that were not in operation.1047 Argentina offered a token ARS 1.00 in compensation for the expropriation.\n\nC-379.\n\nTestimony of Mr. Martin, Transcript p. 699.\n\n844.\n\nRespondent requested Interinvest to inform it, within five days of being served, whether it accepted that valuation.

They say that that Argentina\u2019s violation of the Agreement in and of itself constitutes a breach of the FET standard because it: breached a sovereign contractual commitment that Claimants had relied on; undermined the transparency of the divestment process in which the Government pressured Claimants to engage; and demonstrated bad faith due Respondent\u2019s disregard of its commitment to rely on a third-party valuation expert in order to limit the compensation payable to Claimants for the expropriation of the shares of the Airlines to an absurdly low number.1050 Claimants also allege that Respondent\u2019s conduct following the adoption of the July 2008 Agreement was arbitrary, ambiguous and lacked transparency.1051 Claimants also say that under the pretense of complying with the July 2008 Agreement, Respondent engaged in a dilatory strategy while, in reality, repudiating the Agreement by failing to implement the agreed valuation methodology for the purchase of the Airlines\u2019 shares and effectively taking control of the Airlines and proceeding with the expropriation of their shares.1052\n\nCl.

Rather, it says that despite breaches of the Agreement by Interinvest, including the failure to provide the information required under the terms of the Agreement and a valid valuation, it continued making every effort to ensure the successful conclusion of the process initiated under the Agreement.1053 It says that at the time the July 2008 Agreement was executed, the accounting information available made it impossible to know the real state of affairs of the Airlines. It says that as the process under the July 2008 Agreement advanced, it discovered the catastrophic state of the Airlines.1054 In these circumstances, Respondent says that the performance of the July 2008 Agreement became impossible to fulfill, for reasons not attributable to it. Accordingly, the only viable alternative in order to maintain the provision of air transportation service was to proceed with expropriation pursuant to Law No. 26,466.1055\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 159-162.\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 151-161.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 508. *See also* the evidence of Undersecretary Llorens, Llorens WS3 \u00b6 86, quoted above at \u00b6 840. *See also* Mr. Llorens\u2019 evidence at the hearing: Transcript Day 3.\n\n847.\n\nAs described above, the Parties exchanged valuations pursuant to the terms of the July 2008 Agreement. While Respondent alleged a number of deficiencies in the Credit Suisse valuation, it had adequate information to assess it and, in fact, did analyze it. The valuations were clearly very different and the Parties were unable to agree on a price for the purchase of the Airlines\u2019 shares. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal has found that Respondent\u2019s criticisms and allegations that Interinvest was in breach of the July 2008 Agreement are unfounded. As a result, the next appropriate step under the terms of the Agreement was for the Parties to proceed with the appointment of a third valuator to determine the price at which the shares of the Airlines were to be purchased.\n\n848.\n\nRather than proceeding in this manner, Respondent continued to object to the Credit Suisse valuation and a number of disputes arose between Interinvest and Respondent at the level of both the Board of Directors and at shareholders meetings. Instead of proceeding with valuation of the shares by an independent third valuator pursuant to Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement, Respondent proceeded by way of an injunction appointing a comptroller *(yeedor)* to oversee the Airlines and to maintain Mr. Alak as the General Manger of the Airlines. This was followed by the expropriation of the Airlines by way of Law No. 26,466. Pursuant to the terms of that law, the valuation of the Airlines was to be conducted on an entirely different basis than had been provided for under the July 2008 Agreement for the determination of the price of the Airlines\u2019 shares.\n\n849.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed all of the relevant evidence and the Parties\u2019 arguments, the Tribunal has concluded that in proceeding as it did, Respondent failed to comply with the July 2008 Agreement and the commitments given by it in that agreement. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this amounted to a breach of the FET standard.\n\n850.\n\nAs the Tribunal has found, the July 2008 Agreement was a binding contract between the Government of Argentina and Interinvest S.A., executed and ratified by authorized signatories for each of those parties. It provides for the purchase and sale of the shares in the Airlines and defines the mechanism for determining the key element of the Agreement, the determination of the price at which the shares were to be purchased. The Agreement provides that the transition period of 60 days was for the purpose of formalizing the purchase and sale of the stock that was the subject matter of the Agreement. Although the transition period of 60 days appears to have expired on or about October 14, 2008, the Parties continued performing under the Agreement by continuing their discussions regarding their respective valuations in an attempt to reach agreement on the sale price of the shares. Neither Party purported to terminate the Agreement and, indeed, the conduct of both of the Parties reflected an understanding that the Agreement remained in full force and effect until at least mid-November 2008.1056\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes that at the meeting of the Board of Directors of ARSA on November 19, 2008, Mr. Alak submitted a report to the Board regarding suggested improvements in ARSA\u2019s internal controls and infonnation systems. Mr. Alak also reported that with respect to the National Audit Office all of its requirements to date had been met, except for some documentation which would be provided the following day. See the Board Minutes at C-212, pp. 28-29. Later during the course of the meeting, one of Interinvest\u2019s appointees to the Board, Mr. Aranda, raised the issue of the State\u2019s compliance with the terms of the July 2008 Agreement in light of Mr. Alak\u2019s continued function as General Manager of the Airlines despite the fact that the Transition Committee had not met since October 8, 2008. As described above, after some discussion, a decision was made to schedule a new meeting of the Board to discuss this issue on November 25, 2008.\n\n851.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the July 2008 Agreement was binding on both Parties. There was no express condition that the Agreement was subject to the approval of the Argentine Congress. The Tribunal is unable to accept Respondent\u2019s argument that the reference in Article 2 of the Agreement that the Government of Argentina \"...shall take all steps legally required for the purchase of [Interinvest]\u2019s entire stockholding in Aerolineas and Austral\" subjected the agreement or the determination of the price for the purchase of the shares to the approval of Congress. Rather, Article 2 of the agreement requires the Government of Argentina to take all the steps legally required to complete the purchase of the shares. Article 6 of the agreement clearly states that the third valuation to be sought from an impartial entity \"... shall be final and definitive as between the Parties.\"\n\n852.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered Respondent\u2019s argument that at the time it executed and ratified the July 2008 Agreement, it had insufficient information regarding the true state of the affairs of the Airlines and that it was only after the TTN conducted its valuations that it discovered the true situation of the Airlines such that the purchase and sale of the shares became unviable. The Tribunal is unable to accept this argument. Since the June 2006 Agreement, Respondent had two representatives on the Board of Directors of ARSA and one representative on its audit committee and, in the words of Mr. Llorens, it began to participate in the daily affairs of ARSA. Further, from that time forward, Interinvest and the Airlines had written to, and met with, the Secretariat of Transportation, as well as other Government entities, regarding the difficult financial circumstances of the Airlines and the need to implement airfare increases and other measures to help them cover their costs. This difficult situation was repeatedly reflected in the various decrees and resolutions adopted, including the continuation of the state of emergency in the air transportation sector by Decree 1012/2006. Of particular note are Interinvest\u2019s letters of March 26 and April 29, 2008, referred to above at paragraphs 412, 514 and 515, in which the very difficult circumstances of the Airlines were set out in detail. After this, the Parties entered into the May 2008 Agreement pursuant to which the Parties agreed to a reallocation of the capital stock of the Airlines.1057\n\nThe May 2008 Agreement is entitled \"Framework Agreement between the Owners of the Air Comet - Interinvest Group and the Argentine State in connection with the Viability of Aerolineas Argentinas S.A. and Austral Lineas Aereas - Cielos del Sur S.A. and the Allocation of their Capital Stock\". The Agreement also provided that Respondent would increase its direct interest in the shares of ARSA and that the employees of the Company could hold up to a maximum of 10% of the stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the price to be paid for the increase in the capital stock of ARSA was to be fixed on the basis of the average of the appraisals conducted by the three consulting firms identified in the Agreement.\n\n853.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to accept that Respondent did not have access to sufficient information and was unaware of the state of the Airlines when it signed the July 2008 Agreement. The Tribunal also notes that the Government of Argentina made the first two contributions to ARSA\u2019s capital to cover wages and other expenses and made its submission to the court handling ARSA\u2019s continuing insolvency proceedings prior to signing and ratifying the July 2008 Agreement.\n\n854.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered Respondent\u2019s argument that not every breach of contract by a State constitutes a violation of the duty of fair and equitable treatment.1058 The Tribunal accepts this proposition.1059 However, the July 2008 Agreement was not simply a commercial agreement and, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, Respondent failed to comply with an essential element of that agreement. As described previously, the July 2008 Agreement was signed and ratified by the Government of Argentina. Further, as reflected in the preamble and in Respondent\u2019s arguments and evidence throughout these proceedings, Respondent\u2019s purpose for entering into the July 2008 Agreement was to fulfill its public obligation to guarantee the provision and continuity of air transportation services in Argentina. In order to affect that purpose, it agreed to a specific mechanism to determine the purchase price for all of Interinvest\u2019s shares in the Airlines, which represented the Claimants\u2019 entire investment. The July 2008 Agreement was intended to put an end to the long and difficult relationship between Respondent and Interinvest, Air Comet and the Marsans Group. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the July 2008 Agreement was not a simple commercial agreement.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6 655 and the sources cited there, including Kingsbury ER \u00b6 28.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the issue discussed here is different from the question of the breach of an umbrella clause, which is discussed separately below.\n\n855.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that Interinvest and Claimants legitimately expected Respondent to comply with its commitment to purchase all of the shares in the Airlines at the price determined by the agreed mechanism in Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. The Parties commenced performance under the terms of the agreement and Respondent sought to enforce its terms by insisting on the production of Interinvest\u2019s valuation in the appropriate format and what it maintained was the required supporting information. Further, although Law No. 26,412 did not specifically refer to the July 2008 Agreement, Respondent consistently maintained that the law enabled it to proceed with the purchase of the shares and to comply with the July 2008 Agreement. It was not until some point in November 2008 that Respondent apparently decided that the July 2008 Agreement was not viable and decided to proceed by way of expropriation without notice to Interinvest or Claimants.\n\n856.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, this conduct amounts to a breach of the FET standard. In addition, the Tribunal finds that Respondent\u2019s conduct, described above, in relation to the introductory message and bill seeking approval of the July 2008 Agreement, the adoption of Law No. 26,412, the objections as to the form the Credit Suisse valuation, the injunction appointing a comptroller over the Airlines, the maintenance of Mr. Alak as General Manager of the Airlines and the decision to proceed by expropriation lacked transparency and was arbitrary.\n\n857.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent\u2019s conduct in failing to comply with its commitment under the July 2008 Agreement to proceed with the purchase of Interinvest\u2019s shares in the Airlines on the basis of the agreed mechanism contained in the agreement breached the FET standard in the Treaty.\n\n**6. Assumption of Obligations under the Airbus Purchase Orders**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n858.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered Claimants\u2019 arguments relating to Respondent\u2019s alleged breach of the FET standard by failing to respect its commitment to assume ASTRA\u2019s obligations under the purchase orders placed with Airbus. Claimants say that Respondent reneged on its promise to purchase 35 aircraft purchased by ASTRA (as part of its purchase of 73 aircraft from Airbus between December 2006 and October 2007).1060 At the heart of this claim is Claimants\u2019 allegation that Respondent initialled the Draft Agreement (the draft \"Agreement for the Implementation of Law 26,466\") which they say Respondent agreed to for the purpose of subrogating into ASTRA\u2019s aircraft purchase orders with Airbus and compensating them for the expropriation of the Airlines.1061\n\nCl.

PHB \u00b6152; C-235.\n\n859.\n\nThe complex and extensive details of the various negotiations and draft agreements are summarized above at paragraphs 456 through 464. Claimants say that the Draft Agreement would have entailed the following benefits:\n\n\u2022 Claimants would recover USS 116,691,789 from Airbus in respect of pre-delivery payments (\"PDPs\") and buyer-furnished equipment payments (\"BFEs\") made by Astra to Airbus for aircraft allocated to ARSA and AUSA.\n\n\u2022 Claimants would not be forced to pay the penalties associated with the cancellation of Astra\u2019s order for ARSA and AUSA.\n\n\u2022 Claimants would receive USS 150 million from Argentina in respect of the compensation for the expropriation of the Argentine Airlines.\n\n\u2022 Claimants would be able to maintain the Airbus contract and resell the remaining 38 Airbus \"slots\" for a profit.1062\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6153 (footnotes omitted).\n\n860.\n\nClaimants say that due to Respondent\u2019s failure to honor its commitments, ASTRA was forced to cancel the Airbus purchase agreements and, as a result, the benefits set out above were lost. Claimants say that coupled with the expropriation of the Airlines, the failure of the Draft Agreement precipitated the collapse of the entirety of the Marsans Group. Claimants say that Respondent\u2019s failure to honor the terms of the Draft Agreement and proceed with the assumption of the Airbus purchase orders constitutes a violation of the FET standard and the obligations relating to expropriation under Article V of the Treaty.1063\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 161. Claimants also say that Respondent\u2019s alleged promise to subrogate into ASTRA\u2019s Airbus orders constitutes a direct and express acknowledgement by it of the obligation to compensate Claimants for the confiscation of the Airlines.\n\n861.\n\nRespondent denies that there was any agreement giving rise to any commitment relating to the Airbus purchase orders. It says that it neither executed any agreement with ASTRA or Airbus, nor undertook any commitments to them. It says that the negotiations with Interinvest were not successful and did not give rise to any commitments regarding the settlement of the dispute between the Parties.1064\n\nResp.

Respondent also alleges that ASTRA recovered USD 34 million from Airbus in respect of the cancelled purchases. There is a dispute between the Parties as to whether this sum was related to any of the payments said to have been undertaken by Respondent under the Draft Agreement. *See* Cl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 346-349; Resp. Rei. \u00b6\u00b6 532-539; Resp. PHB \u00b6 168.\n\n862.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the extensive evidence relating to Claimants\u2019 allegation regarding the assumption of the obligations under the Airbus purchase orders and concluded that Respondent did not enter into any binding obligation in that regard. There was evidence of negotiations between Interinvest and Respondent regarding the taking over of 35 of the purchase orders from Airbus and that Respondent had some interest in doing so in order to acquire the aircraft for the Airlines. There was also evidence of the dealings between Interinvest and ASTRA and Airbus as well as between Respondent and Airbus regarding the assumption of the purchase orders by Respondent. However, none of the relevant agreements under discussion were concluded.\n\n863.\n\nAs discussed above, the proposed Draft Agreement is at the heart of Claimants\u2019 claim. However, this agreement was never executed and the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent committed to signing and concluding that agreement. While Mr. Munoz Perez testified that Interinvest and Respondent had each initialed a copy of the Draft Agreement and provided it to the other, Mr. Llorens denied that he had initialed or signed the Draft Agreement.1065 While there was some evidence that the initial on Interinvest\u2019s copy of the Draft Agreement was that of Mr. Manuel Vazquez,1066 this was not clear. In any event, the Draft Agreement was never signed on behalf of Respondent.1067\n\n*See* Transcript pp. 621-623, 660.\n\nTranscript pp. 649-654; Cl. Mem. \u00b6 289-290; Munoz Perez WS3, Annex 3; email between Mr. Manuel Vazquez and Secretary Jaime.\n\nMr. Llorens noted that the Draft Agreement had his name beneath the signature line and that he was not authorized to sign an agreement of this nature on behalf of Respondent: Transcript pp. 622-623. In addition, Mr. Llorens testified that the Parties were unable to reach agreement in respect of the Draft Agreement since agreement on behalf of Respondent was dependent upon acceptance by Interinvest of a release or waiver of all judicial proceedings against Respondent, including the proceedings in this case, and Interinvest was unwilling to accept that term: Transcript pp. 620-621.\n\n864.\n\nIn contrast with the signature of the July 2008 Agreement, it does not appear that the Parties\u2019 negotiations led to any final agreement between them. The Tribunal accepts that there were serious negotiations between the Parties to arrange for Respondent to take over ASTRA\u2019s purchase orders from Airbus for aircraft intended for the Airlines and to settle the disputes between them. The Tribunal also accepts that such an agreement would have represented significant value for both Respondent and Interinvest and Claimants. The Parties\u2019 negotiations and the Draft Agreement also confirm that ASTRA had identified a number of the aircraft it had ordered from Airbus for use by the Airlines. However, the Tribunal is not persuaded that a final agreement was ever reached. In these circumstances Claimants have not demonstrated that Respondent\u2019s conduct was in breach of a commitment or legitimate expectation such as to give rise to a breach of the FET standard.\n\n**E. Conclusion on the alleged breaches of the FET standard**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n865.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finds that Respondent breached the obligation of fair and equitable treatment under the Treaty in respect of its conduct relating to the July 2008 Agreement, described above at paragraphs 777 through 857. The Tribunal also finds that Claimants have failed to prove a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard in respect of the other claims addressed in this section. Accordingly, the latter must be denied.\n\n**IX. MFN: FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY/UMBRELLA CLAUSE**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n866.\n\nClaimants invoked the MFN Clause contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty to incorporate provisions from the US-Argentina BIT in support of claims that Respondent failed to accord them full protection and security and failed to observe obligations in regard of their investments. Claimants also claim that Respondent failed to afford their investments protection pursuant to Article III(1) of the Treaty.\n\n867.\n\nRespondent disputes that Article IV(2) of the Treaty permits invoking the provisions of the US-Argentina BIT that Claimants seek to apply. Respondent also disputes the merits of Claimants\u2019 claims in respect of both full protection and security and breach of the umbrella clause contained in the US-Argentina BIT.\n\n868.\n\nArticle IV of the Treaty reads in relevant part as follows:\n\nTreatment\n\n1. Each Party shall guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment of investments made by investors of the other Party.\n\n2. In all matters governed by this Agreement, such treatment shall be no less favourable than that accorded by each Party to investments made in its territory by investors of a third country.1068\n\nC-l\n\n869.\n\nThe relevant provisions of the US-Argentina BIT which Claimants seek to invoke provide as follows:\n\nARTICLE II\n\n\u2026\n\n2. a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\n\n\u2026\n\nc) Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.1069\n\nC-348.\n\n870.\n\nClaimants submit that the MFN Clause contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty is very broad and has been invoked and applied by previous tribunals to incorporate more favorable provisions in other BITs concluded by Argentina or Spain. Further, they submit that many tribunals have imported through MFN clauses more favorable substantive standards of treatment accorded to investors of third countries.\n\n871.\n\nClaimants say that the umbrella clause in the US-Argentina BIT is a standard of treatment granted to investors and, therefore, \"a matter governed by\" the (Spain-Argentina) Treaty. According to them, by definition, the MFN Clause imports provisions that are absent from the base treaty (in this case, the Treaty). According to Claimants, the most favored nation treatment obligation applies as long as the third-party treaty provision containing the more favorable treatment is of the same type, in this case, the same \"matter regulated by\" the base treaty. In other words, as long as the third-party treaty addresses the protection of foreign investors, it applies. In this regard, Claimants point to the award in *MTD* v. *Chile* where the tribunal incorporated an umbrella clause taken from the Denmark-Chile BIT by means of an MFN clause in the Malaysia-Chile BIT.1070\n\n*See* Cl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 47-49; *MTD Equity S.dn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A.* v. *Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7 [hereinafter: *MTD* v. *Chile] ;* C-323.\n\n872.\n\nClaimants say that the fact that the Treaty is broad and covers the umbrella clause in the US-Argentina BIT is supported by the fact that paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article IV of the Treaty exclude a number of matters such as those granted by way of regional cooperation agreements (Article IV(3)); tax treatment (Article IV(4)) and concessional funding (paragraph 1 of the Protocol to the Treaty). They say that these matters are much further removed from the provisions in the Treaty than the umbrella clause but that, because of the general nature of the MFN Clause, the contracting parties to the Treaty nonetheless considered it prudent to exclude them. Claimants say that other matters which are more directly related to the protection of foreign investments, such as the umbrella clause, must be covered by the MFN provision. They also note that after the conclusion of the Treaty in this case, Argentina has concluded numerous BITs which contain umbrella clauses. This, they say, demonstrates that there is no public policy reason not to give effect to the MFN Clause in the Treaty with respect to umbrella clauses contained in other BITs.1071\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 490 and the various BITs cited there.\n\n873.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s arguments, Claimants say that the MFN Clause contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty does not apply only to matters that relate to fair and equitable treatment. They say that Article IV(2) explicitly refers to \"all matters\" governed by the Treaty. They say that the obligation to observe commitments undertaken towards claimants and their investments is a \"matter\" that concerns the substantive treatment of investment protection promised by Respondent in the Treaty.1072\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 535. Claimants alsopointto the Decision on Jurisdiction where the Tribunal held that the MFN Clause may apply to matters beyond fair and equitable treatment, noting that \"the broad \u2018all matters\u2019 language of the Article IV(2) MFN Clause is unambiguously inclusive.\"\n\n874.\n\nClaimants also reject Respondent\u2019s argument that the MFN Clause does not apply to the umbrella clause in the US-Argentina BIT because the Treaty in this case does not provide for an umbrella clause itself. Claimants say that Respondent\u2019s reasoning is circular and would negate the meaning and basic purpose of MFN clauses. They say that if the Treaty contained an umbrella clause, there would be no reason for Claimants to invoke the MFN Clause in the first place.1073\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6535.\n\n875.\n\nClaimants go on to refer to a series of legal and contractual obligations which they say were made with regard to Claimants\u2019 investments. These include the commitment to allow the Airlines to charge economically reasonable airfares (pursuant to the Air Business Law, Decree No.6875/171 and the General Transfer Contract); the commitment to review airfares and to do so according to specific and detailed mechanisms; the commitment to compensate airlines forced to operate unprofitable routes; the obligation to allow airline companies to set airfares freely within an air band; the obligation to exempt from VAT the purchase of fuel; and the obligation to exempt from taxes the VAT for aircraft purchased or leased within a purchase option.1074 With regard to contractual obligations, Claimants say that Respondent undertook obligations in the May 2008 Agreement and the July 2008 Agreement. They say that under the May 2008 Agreement, Respondent made a number of commitments relating primarily to the commitment to relieve ARSA\u2019s debt. In the July 2008 Agreement, Claimants say that Respondent committed to observing specific valuation procedures for the purchase of the shares of the Airlines and to allow Interinvest to co-manage the Airlines during the transition period.1075\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6495.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6497.\n\n876.\n\nClaimants say that the fact that the May 2008 Agreement and the July 2008 Agreement were concluded between Respondent and Interinvest, and not directly between Respondent and Claimants themselves, does not affect the claims based on these agreements. They say that the umbrella clause in the US-Argentina BIT refers to obligations entered into \"with regard to investments\". At the time of the conclusion of these two agreements, Claimants held 99% of Interinvest\u2019s shares, which in turn held 94.41% of ARSA\u2019s shares and 98.12% of AUSA\u2019s shares. According to Claimants, their interests in Interinvest (and thus, the Airlines) constitute \"investments\" of Claimants. Claimants point to a number of awards in which tribunals have found a breach of an umbrella clause as a result of breaches of agreements to which the claimants were not direct parties.1076 Claimants also say that Respondent failed to observe the obligations it entered into with regard to Claimants\u2019 investments pursuant to the various decrees and laws previously described. They say that these instruments relate to Claimants\u2019 investments and were not in any way limited to Interinvest. Claimants say that they relied directly on these various commitments when making, maintaining and, over the years, increasing their investment in the Airlines.1077\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 498 and the sources cited there. The Tribunal notes that Article IV(2) of the Treaty also refers to \"investments made in its territory by investors of a third country.\"\n\nCl. Mem \u00b6499.\n\n877.\n\nRespondent submitted that the scope of the MFN Clause contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty is restricted to fair and equitable treatment since it follows Article IV(1 which provides for fair and equitable treatment of investments. Article IV(2) of the Treaty then refers to \"such treatment\". Respondent says that if the Parties to the Treaty had intended to grant the MFN Clause a scope including \"all treatments\" instead of \"such treatment\", they would have expressly stated so.1078\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 758-761; Kingsbury ER \u00b6 42-44; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 682-689 where Respondent maintains its position regarding the scope of the MFN Clause and seeks to distinguish the various awards relied on by Claimants.\n\n878.\n\nRespondent also says that neither the Umbrella Clause nor the full protection and security provisions in the US-Argentina BIT fall within the scope of the MFN Clause since these are not standards of treatment governed by the Treaty. Therefore, they cannot be considered as matters governed by the Treaty and any attempt to expand the scope of the MFN Clause would be contrary to the express intention of the Parties to the Treaty. It says that the States party to the Treaty were fully aware of the existence of the umbrella clauses and full protection and security standards and yet did not include them in the text of the Treaty.1079\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 765-771; Kingsbuiy ER \u00b6 47; Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 684-689.\n\n879.\n\nWith respect to the question of full protection and security, Respondent acknowledges that Article III(1) of the Treaty refers to the obligation of each party to \"protect within its territory investments made, in accordance with its legislation, or the investors of the [p]arty..However, it maintains that in their Memorial Claimants did not raise this provision in support of their claim that the full protection and security provision in the US-Argentina BIT should apply by virtue of the MFN Clause. Therefore, according to Respondent, this argument was raised late and Claimants should not be permitted to rely upon it. It says that Claimants attempted to import \"full protection and security\" under Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT as a new guarantee or protection, different from the one contained in Article III(1) of the Treaty.1080\n\nResp. Rej. **\u00b6\u00b6** 690-693.\n\n880.\n\nThe Tribunal commences with Respondent\u2019s argument that the MFN Clause contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty applies only to fair and equitable treatment since the use of the language \"such treatment\" can only refer to fair and equitable treatment which is provided for in the preceding Article IV(1. The Tribunal is unable to accept this argument. Article IV(2) of the Treaty expressly refers to \"all matters governed by this Agreement\", which the Tribunal has found to be unambiguously inclusive.1081 This broad language is inconsistent with the notion that only fair and equitable treatment was intended to be the subject of the most favorable nation treatment. If such were the case, then the MFN Clause would apply only to more favorable FET provisions contained in other BITs. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the plain or ordinary meaning of the language does not sustain this interpretation. Rather, reading Articles IV(1 and (2) together, a more harmonious and logical interpretation is that the parties to the Treaty are required to accord fair and equitable treatment of investments made by investors of a Party and that in all matters governed by the Treaty, the treatment accorded to investments (which must be fair and equitable treatment pursuant Article IV(1) shall be no less favorable than the treatment accorded to investments made by investors of a third country.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 186.\n\n881.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, this interpretation reflects the ordinary meaning of the language of Article IV of the Treaty. The Tribunal notes that this interpretation is consistent with previous interpretations of Article IV(2) of the Treaty in the decisions *m Maffezini, Gas Natural* and *Suez* cases.1082 Further, in the Decision on Jurisdiction in this case, the Tribunal determined that the MFN Clause contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty extends to matters other than fair and equitable treatment when it applied it to the dispute resolution provisions contained in the Australia-Argentina BIT.1083 Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the MFN Clause contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty is not restricted to fair and equitable treatment provisions and can be used in respect of all matters governed by the Treaty to incorporate more favorable provisions from other BITs concluded by Argentina.\n\n*Emilio Agustrn Maffezini* v. *Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Jurisdiction: C-259; *Gas Natural SDG, SA.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/10, Decision on Jurisdiction, June 17, 2005: C-260; *Suez Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA. and Vivendi Universal S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, August 3, 2006: C-255.\n\n*See* Decision on Jurisdiction \u00b6\u00b6 160-186.\n\n882.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to Respondent\u2019s arguments that the MFN Clause does not apply to permit Claimants to invoke the application of the umbrella clause or the full protection and security provisions in the US-Argentina BIT because the Treaty in this case does not provide for an umbrella clause or full protection and security. In this regard, Claimants argued that the MFN Clause permits importing provisions that are absent from the base treaty and that if this were not so, the MFN Clause would have no effect. Claimants say that pursuant to the *ejusdem generis* principle, MFN treatment applies as long as the third-party treaty provision containing the more favorable treatment is of the same type as in the base treaty. In this case, Claimants argue that the Spain-Argentina BIT and the US-Argentina BIT are of the same type, or address the same \"matter regulated by the base treaty: the protection of foreign investors.\" In this regard, as noted above at paragraph 870, Claimants rely on the Award in *MTD* v. *Chile* which they say incorporated an umbrella clause taken from the Denmark-Chile BIT by means of an MFN clause in the Malaysia-Chile BIT. In respect of the question of having recourse to the provisions of the US-Argentina BIT in respect of full protection and security, Claimants note that, in any event, the Treaty does provide for protection of investments and, therefore, is specifically included as a matter governed by the Treaty.\n\n883.\n\nRespondent submits that the MFN Clause in Article IV(2) of the Treaty cannot be used to introduce an entire umbrella clause or a full protection and security provision not contained in the Treaty. Further, it seeks to distinguish the various decisions relied by Claimants (notably, *Maffezini, Gas Natural* and *Suez* on the basis that they are irrelevant since they concerned the incorporation of dispute settlement provisions rather than substantive provisions. Respondent also distinguished the *MTD* and *Bayindir* cases on other grounds.1084\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 684-689. *MTD,* on the ground that in that case Chile had not challenged the use of an MFN clause to invoke provisions contained in other treaties; *Bayindir,* on the basis that in that case Pakistan had only raised an objection on a temporal issue and on the basis that the tribunal in that case had found that the State parties had clearly contemplated the importance of fair and equitable treatment and that this was relevant for the interpretation of the MFN clause).\n\n884.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, in interpreting the scope of the MFN Clause contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty, meaning must be given to the critical words \" [i]n all matters governed by this Agreement\". According to Claimants, this language should be interpreted as referring generally to the protection of foreign investors. This interpretation is too broad and disregards the reference to all \"matters\" governed by the Treaty. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the plain and ordinary meaning of this language is to refer to the various rights or forms of protection contained in the individual provisions of the Treaty. The Tribunal accepts that the parties to the Treaty were in all likelihood aware of the existence of umbrella clauses and if they had intended to include such a clause in the Treaty, they would have done so.1085 According to Respondent, use of the MFN Clause to incorporate an umbrella clause into the Treaty would result in the incorporation of a new right or standard of treatment not provided for the Treaty. On the basis of the specific language used by the Parties in the Treaty, the Tribunal finds this argument persuasive.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 765-771; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 684; Kingsbuiy ER \u00b6 47.\n\n885.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has considered Claimants\u2019 argument that limiting the application of the MFN Clause to the provisions or treatment that is already present in the base treaty would deprive the clause of any effect. However, this does not appear to be correct since the MFN Clause could clearly \"improve\" the standards of protection contained in the Treaty by incorporating more favorable standards from another treaty. In this regard, the MFN Clause could lead to the incorporation of more favorable standards in relation to, for example, discriminatory or unjustified measures, fair and equitable treatment, expropriation and transfers of income or earnings.1086 As a result, the MFN Clause would not be deprived of any meaning or effect were its scope to be limited to rights or standards contained in the Treaty.\n\n*See* Resp. Rej. \u00b6 767 where Respondent accepts that the MFN Clause covers any substantive issue governed by the Treaty and provides these examples contained in Articles IV, V and VI of the Treaty.\n\n886.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the various authorities relied upon by Claimants in support of their position that the MFN Clause can be applied to invoke the application of rights or standards not contained in the Treaty. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that in the various cases cited by Claimants, the relevant base treaties appear to have provided rights or protection which the claimants sought to improve upon by having recourse to more favorable provisions in other treaties. For example, in the cases dealing with more favorable dispute resolution provisions, the base treaties already contained similar, albeit less favorable, dispute resolution provisions.\n\n887.\n\nThe cases of *MTD* v. *Chile* and *Bayindir* v. *Pakistan* are somewhat different. Nevertheless, they are also distinguishable. In the case of *MTD* v. *Chile,* the question that the tribunal considered relevant was whether the provision that the claimants sought to invoke from other treaties (which dealt with the obligation to award permits subsequent to approval of an investment and to fulfillment of contractual obligations) could be considered as part of fair and equitable treatment (which was provided for the in the base treaty).1087 The MFN clause at issue provided as follows:\n\nInvestments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall receive treatment which is fair and equitable, and not less favourable than that accorded to investments made by investors of any third State.1088\n\nIn addressing that question, the tribunal held as follows:\n\n104. The Tribunal considers the meaning of fair and equitable treatment below and refers to that discussion. The Tribunal lias concluded that, under the BIT, the fair and equitable standard of treatment lias to be interpreted in the manner most conducive to fulfill the objective of the BIT to protect investments and create conditions favourable to investments. The Tribunal considers that to include as part of the protections of the BIT those included in Article III(1) of the Demnark BIT and Article III(3) and (4) of the Croatia BIT is in consonance with this purpose.1089\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, this distinguishes the *MTD* v. *Chile* case since the tribunal in that case appears to have based its decision to permit the invocation of the clauses invoked from the Croatia-Chile BIT and Denmark-Chile BIT on its interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard in the base treaty between Malaysia and Chile.1090 In addition, the language of the relevant MFN clause in the *MTD* v. *Chile* case is different from that of Article IV(2) of the Treaty in this case in that it does not contain the language \"in all matters governed by this Agreement\".\n\n*MTDv. Chile* \u00b6 100-103.\n\n*MTD* v. *Chile* \u00b6 101, quoting Article III(1) of the Malaysia-Chile BIT. In addition, the Malaysia-Chile BIT also contained a separate FET provision which provided that \"investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment..as quoted *in MTD* v. *Chile* \u00b6 107.\n\n*MTD* v. *Chile* \u00b6 104. It is worth noting that, as pointed out by Respondent, the respondent in the *MTD* v. *Chile* case did not argue against the application of the provisions sought to be incorporated by use of the MFN clause. Nevertheless, the tribunal considered it appropriate to examine the MFN clause in the base treaty and satisfy itself that its terms permitted the use of the provisions from the other treaties.\n\nIn its final decision, the tribunal found that certain of the respondent\u2019s conduct had breached the obligations under Article III(1) of the Malaysia-Chile BIT, quoted above.\n\n888.\n\nIn the *Bayindir* v. *Pakistan* case, the respondent does not appear to have raised the same objection under consideration here. Rather, it argued the importation of a FET clause from another BIT is only possible if it is not excluded by the intention of the Contracting Parties.1091 The relevant MFN clause in the Turkey-Pakistan BIT provided as follows:\n\nEach Party shall accord to these investments, once established, treatment no less favourable than that accorded in similar situations to investments of its investors or to investments of investors of any third country, whichever is the most favourable.\n\nThe preamble to that treaty also contained the following language:\n\nAgreeing that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective utilization of economic resources.\n\n*Bayindir* v. *Pakistan* \u00b6 150.\n\n889.\n\nThe tribunal of the *Bayindir* v. *Pakistan* case found that while this language of the BIT offered little assistance since the preamble does not establish any operative obligation, it was relevant for the interpretation of the MFN clause in its context and in light of the treaty\u2019s object and purpose. It was of the view that the reference to FET in the preamble, together with the absence of an FET clause in the treaty, did not rule out the possibility of importing an FET obligation through the MFN clause contained in the treaty. Rather, it stated that \"[t]he fact that the States parties to the Treaty clearly contemplated the importance of the FET rather suggests the contrary. Indeed, even though it does not establish an operative obligation, the preamble is relevant for the interpretation of the MFN clause..1092\n\n*Bayindir* v. *Pakistan* \u2018 155. The tribunal went on to refer to the *MTD* v. *Chile* decision and concluded that on the basis of the MFN provision in the Turkey-Pakistan BIT, the claimant could invoke the application of the FET standard in the Switzerland-Pakistan BIT. *See Bayindir* v. *Pakistan* \u00b6\u00b6 158-159 and 167.\n\n890.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the language of the MFN clause at issue in the *Bayindir* v. *Pakistan* case is different from the language of the Treaty. Again, there is no reference to the relevant language relating to the scope of Article IV(2) of the Treaty: \"in all matters governed by this Agreement\". In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the *MTD* and *Bayindir* decisions are distinguishable from this case. The language of the relevant MFN clauses is different and the context and the provisions sought to be included from third-party treaties are also different. In the *MTD* and *Bayindir* cases, the MFN clause was used to invoke FET provisions in circumstances where there was reference to fair and equitable treatment in the base treaties. In this case, Claimants seek to invoke the MFN Clause to incorporate an umbrella clause in circumstances where there is no umbrella clause in the Treaty, nor any reference to or mention of such a clause.\n\n891.\n\nAsa result, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the decisions in the *MTD* and *Bayindir* cases support Claimants\u2019 claim to invoke the umbrella clause in the US-Argentina BIT in this case.\n\n892.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Article IV(2) of the Treaty does not apply to permit Claimants to invoke the umbrella clause from the US-Argentina BIT. Accordingly, Claimants\u2019 claim based on this clause must fail.\n\n893.\n\nClaimants\u2019 arguments with respect to invoking the full protection and security provisions from the US-Argentina BIT are somewhat different. Claimants advanced a claim on the basis of Article III(1) of the Treaty which provides that \"each Party shall protect within its territory investments made, in accordance with its legislation, or the investors of the other Party...\". In addition, Claimants invoked Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT which requires \"full protection and security\" to the extent that treatment was more favorable than the treatment accorded under Article III of the Treaty. In its Reply, Claimants responded to Respondent\u2019s argument that since the Treaty did not contain any provision relating to \"full protection and security\" (or an umbrella clause), the full protection and security standard did not constitute a matter governed by the Treaty and therefore exceeded the scope of the application of the MFN Clause. Claimants argued that it was not necessary for them to resort to the MFN Clause in order to apply a \"full\" protection and security standard on the basis that there was no significant difference between \"protection\" and \"full protection and security\". In any event, Claimants submitted that should the Tribunal find that Article III(1) of the Treaty does not in and of itself require \"full\" protection and security, it invoked the MFN Clause to apply the full protection and security standard contained in Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT. In that regard, Claimants argued that the Treaty does contain a protection clause and, therefore, they did not seek to import an entirely new, substantive standard but, rather, sought to improve an existing one.1093\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6499-508.\n\n894.\n\nFor its part, Respondent argued that this was a new claim or argument that should have been presented in Claimants\u2019 Memorial. Further, Respondent argued that the Tribunal should not accept Claimants\u2019 argument that they had implicitly raised this argument in their Memorial when they argued that it was not necessary to resort to the MFN Clause to apply a \"full\" protection and security standard since the Treaty already contained a provision on protection. Respondent argued that Claimants should not be permitted to introduce a new argument at the reply stage.1094\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6690-693.\n\n895.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, in their Memorial, Claimants based their claim for a breach of the standard of protection on both Article III(1) of the Treaty and, through the MFN Clause, Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT. They argued that there was no significant difference between the two standards but that in the event the Tribunal disagreed, they sought to invoke the more favorable provision of the US-Argentina BIT. On this basis, the Tribunal finds that Claimants did implicitly raise the argument that it was not necessary to resort to the MFN Clause in order to apply a \"full\" protection and security standard in this case. In any event, the Tribunal finds that when it raised in its Reply the argument that the Treaty contained a protection clause and that it simply sought to improve the treatment accorded by that clause by having recourse to the US-Argentina BIT, Respondent had ample opportunity to respond and has not demonstrated any prejudice flowing from what it says are new arguments. Accordingly, Respondent\u2019s objection as to the timing of Claimants\u2019 argument is dismissed.\n\n896.\n\nArticle III(1) of the Treaty contains an obligation that each Party shall protect within its territory investments made by investors of the Party. As a result, protection of investments is a matter governed by the Treaty and, for the reasons set out above, the MFN Clause contained in Article IV(2) of the Treaty permits Claimants to invoke the full protection and security provision contained in Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT. The Tribunal now turns to whether there is any significant difference between the standards in question and the merits of Claimants\u2019 claim that Respondent failed to protect their investments.\n\n897.\n\nHaving reviewed the authorities cited by Claimants, the Tribunal is of the view that there is no significant difference between the duty to protect investments under Article III(1) of the Treaty and the duty of full protection and security in Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT for present purposes.1095 In any event, to the extent the standard of \"full protection and security\" may be more favorable, the Tribunal applies that standard as set out in Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6464-466; Cl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 500-502.\n\n898.\n\nClaimants summarize the full protection standard as follows:\n\n\u25a1 Generally, the standard imposes an obligation of \"due diligence\" and \"vigilance\" on the host State with respect to the protection and security of investments *(AAPL, AMT)*\n\n\u25a1 More specifically, a host State is required to take all measures necessary to ensure the protection and security of investments *(AAPL, AMT)*\n\n\u25a1 The standard is violated if a host State fails to comply with its own national laws or the standard of protection required by international law *(AMT)*\n\n\u25a1 The standard is violated by a failure immediately to address and rectify acts that have harmed an investment, such as a failure immediately to restore seized properties to an investor\u2019s possession (*Wena Hotels)*\n\n\u25a1 A government will be charged with violating the standard if it could have directed others to take such restorative acts but failed to do so *(Wena Hotels)*\n\n\u25a1 The standard extends beyond \"physical\" security and requires a \"secure investment enviromnent\" *(CME, Siemens, Azurix, Vivendi 11, Frontier Petroleum, Brwater Gauff,* *National Grid)*\n\n\u25a1 The standard is violated if a government, through its laws or administrative applications, withdraws approval of or devalues an investor\u2019s investment *(CME)1096*\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 512.\n\n899.\n\nClaimants allege that Respondent breached this standard in the following ways. First, Respondent failed to permit Claimants to charge economically reasonable airfares which had been guaranteed in numerous Argentine laws, decrees and contractual commitments. Second, Respondent failed to protect Claimants\u2019 investments by appointing and maintaining in office, as Undersecretary of Air Transportation, Mr. Cirielli. Third, Claimants say that Respondent breached the May 2008 Agreement and the July 2008 Agreement and then unlawfully expropriated the Airlines.\n\n900.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s arguments, Claimants submit that the weight of relevant jurisprudence indicates that full protection and security clauses are not limited to physical harm and cover the protection and security of intangible assets. Further, Claimants say that they do not claim that the full protection and security standard amounts to \"an obligation to assume full responsibility\". However, the standard compels the host State to act with due diligence, requiring the reasonable measures of prevention which a well-administered government could be expected to exercise in the circumstances. They note that the threshold for finding a violation of this standard is low, since a mere lack of diligence will suffice and there is no need to establish malice or negligence. Finally, Claimants note the close relationship between the full protection and security standard and the fair and equitable treatment standard.1097\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 509-511 and the sources cited there.\n\n901.\n\nRespondent says that the full protection and security standard covers the obligation to afford physical protection only. In any event, Respondent says that the standard could never amount to an obligation to assume full responsibility on the basis of a strict or absolute obligation upon the host State since it cannot be required to avoid any kind of act that may be detrimental to a foreign investor. According to Respondent, the obligation entails the adoption of reasonable measures, under the circumstances of the case, aimed at preventing hostile acts by the State itself or a third party towards a foreign investor. Finally, Respondent says that the obligation to provide full protection and security does not require a host State to refrain from altering its law, nor does it extend to encompass the maintenance of a stable legal and commercial environment.1098 With respect to the alleged similarity between the full protection and security standard and the FET standard, Respondent says that since the Treaty provides for fair and equitable treatment and protection and security in two distinct clauses, the Parties must have intended them to mean two different things, and so in interpreting these two standards the Tribunal give effect to that intention by giving the two concepts distinct meanings and fields of application.1099\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6774-780; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 695-704 and the sources cited there.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6702, referring to *Suez,* Decision on Liability dated July 30, 2010 \u00b6 161: AL RA-412.\n\n902.\n\nIn respect of the specific merits of Claimants\u2019 allegations, Respondent responded as follows:\n\n\u2022 The regulatory framework governing airfares applied to all airlines and was in place well before the Marsans Group became involved in the Airlines. While the Airlines were under the management of the Marsans Group, there were four airfare increases which were sufficient to cover the costs of the Airlines during the relevant period. Further, the relevant context was that of acute widespread crisis in Argentina.\n\n\u2022 In respect of the conduct of Mr. Cirielli, he took a leave of absence from his position as Secretary General of APTA when he was appointed as Undersecretary of Commercial Air Transport. Therefore, he did not perform in both capacities at the same time. Further, there is no evidence to support the allegation that Mr. Cirielli encouraged the strike in November 2005, referred to by Claimants. Finally, Respondent notes that it was through State mechanisms that measures were implemented in order to prevent Mr. Cirielli from acting in cases where there could be a conflict of interest with the Airlines.\n\n\u2022 In respect of the May 2008 Agreement and July 2008 Agreement, Respondent says that they did not fail due to its conduct. Rather, the Agreements were breached by Interinvest or Air Comet. Respondent also says that the Agreements became meaningless due to the reality of the Airlines\u2019 condition which, when Respondent became aware of it, made it impossible to maintain a purchase option in relation to the Airlines.\n\n\u2022 In respect of the expropriation of the shares in the Airlines, Respondent says that it acted in accordance with the applicable substantive and procedural laws.1100\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 781-786; Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 705-709.\n\n903.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 arguments regarding the nature of the obligation to protect investments and to provide them full protection and security, there is no significant difference for the present purposes. As Claimants have invoked the application of the full protection and security standard contained in the US-Argentina BIT, which the Tribunal has found to be valid, the relevant question is whether Respondent has breached the obligation of providing full protection and security.\n\n904.\n\nIn respect of the relationship between the standard of full protection and security and that of fair and equitable treatment, the Tribunal finds the distinction drawn in the *Suez* Decision on Jurisdiction, cited by Respondent, persuasive.1101 In the Treaty, the provisions regarding protection of investments and fair and equitable treatment are contained in two distinct articles, which leads to the conclusion that the Parties must have intended them to address different things. As a result, the Tribunal believes that these two standards should be given distinct meanings and fields of application.1102\n\n*Suez Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A.* v. *Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19: AL RA-412 \u00b6 172.\n\nThe Tribunal reaches this conclusion despite the fact that the full protection and security provision contained in Article II(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT refers to both fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security in the same article.\n\n905.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal accepts there is considerable overlap between the concepts of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security, as submitted by Claimants. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the fair and equitable standard is broader than that of full protection and security. As a result, while a breach of the full protection and security clause would likely constitute a violation of fair and equitable treatment, the converse is not necessarily the case. Not all violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard automatically constitute violations of the full protection and security standard. Finally, having reviewed the various awards and authorities cited by the Parties, the Tribunal is of the view while the traditional notion of full protection and security addresses the protection of property from physical threats and injury, it can, in appropriate circumstances, include the protection of intangible assets which fall within the scope of the definition of an investment in the relevant treaty.\n\n906.\n\nOn the basis of the findings it has made in respect of the application of the FET standard, set out above, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants have not demonstrated a breach of the full protection and security standard in respect of their allegations relating to the regulatory framework governing airfares and the appointment and maintenance of Mr. Cirielli as the Undersecretary of Air Transportation. With respect to Claimants\u2019 allegations relating to the May 2008 Agreement and July 2008 Agreement and the expropriation of the Airlines, the Tribunal is of the view that these relate more closely to the standard of fair and equitable treatment and the standard for expropriation and are more appropriately considered as part of Claimants\u2019 claims under those standards.\n\n907.\n\nIn respect of Claimants\u2019 claim relating to the regulatory framework and the Airlines inability to charge economically reasonable airfares, the Tribunal has found that the conduct of Respondent of which Claimants complain does not amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. In that regard, the Tribunal found that although the airfares provided under the regulatory framework were not sufficient to cover the Airlines\u2019 costs, for various reasons this did not amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. As a result, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent\u2019s conduct in relation to the airfares amounts to a breach of the full protection and security standard.\n\n908.\n\nThe Tribunal reaches the same conclusion with respect to Claimants\u2019 allegations relating to the appointment and maintenance in office of Mr. Cirielli. For the reasons stated above at paragraphs 693 through 711, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent\u2019s conduct does not amount to a breach of the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment. As a result, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent\u2019s conduct in relation to the appointment and maintenance in office of Mr. Cirielli amounts to a breach of the full protection and security standard.\n\n909.\n\nAs indicated above, Claimants\u2019 allegations with respect to the May 2008 Agreement and July 2008 Agreement and the expropriation of the Airlines are more closely linked to and appropriately addressed under Claimants\u2019 claims for breaches of the fair and equitable treatment standard and the breach of Article V of the Treaty in respect of expropriation. As set out above at paragraphs 777 through 857, the Tribunal has found that Respondent breached the obligation of fair and equitable treatment in respect of the July 2008 Agreement.1103 The Tribunal addresses Claimants\u2019 allegations with respect to expropriation below.\n\nAs set out at paragraphs 760 - 776 above the Tribunal has dismissed Claimant\u2019s claim relating to the breach of the FET standard in respect of the May 2008 Agreement.\n\n910.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Claimants have not demonstrated a breach of the full protection and security standard in respect of its allegations relating to the regulatory framework, the appointment and maintenance of Mr. Cirielli as the Undersecretary of Air Transportation and the May 2008 Agreement. Further, the Tribunal finds that the claims relating to the July 2008 Agreement and the expropriation of the Airlines are more appropriately considered as part of Claimants\u2019 claims of a breach of the FET standard and of unlawful expropriation.\n\n**X. UNJUSTIFIED AND DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n911.\n\nClaimants also allege that Respondent breached Article III(1) of the Treaty. That provision reads as follows:\n\nProtection\n\n1. Each Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance with its legislation by investors of the other Party and shall not obstruct, by unjustified or discriminatory measures, the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and, where appropriate, liquidation of such investments.1104\n\nThe Spanish text of Article III(1) of the Treaty provides as follows:  \n*PROTECCION*  \n*1.- Cada Parte protegerd en su territorio las inversiones efectuadas, conforme a su legislation, o inversores de la otra Parte* v *no obstaculizard, mediante medidas injustificadas o discriminatorias, la gestion, el mantenimiento, la utilization, el dispute, la extension, la venta ni, en su caso, la liquidation de tales inversiones.*\n\n912.\n\nClaimants say that the phrase \"unjustified or discriminatory measures\" uses the disjunctive \"or\" and therefore either \"unjustified\" or \"discriminatory measures\" will violate Article III(1) of the Treaty.1105\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6480, citing *Azurix Corp.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12: C-282 \u00b6 391.\n\n913.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the ordinary meaning of \"unjustified\" is \"unreasonable\" or \"arbitrary\". They say there is no relevant distinction between these terms in the context of impairment clauses in BITs. In response to Respondent\u2019s arguments on the meaning of arbitrary, Claimants summarized that arbitrary treatment encompasses actions that: (i) bear no rational relation to their stated purposes; (ii) were coercive, retaliatory or in bad faith; and (iii) were taken in willful disregard of legal standards, due process and proper procedure.1106\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6482; Cl. Reply \u00b6 518-526.\n\n914.\n\nClaimants say that the following measures adopted by Respondent were all unjustified, unreasonable or arbitrary:\n\n\u2022 The maintenance of Ricardo Cirielli as the public official responsible for the air transportation sector, despite findings by a federal appellate court and the Argentine Anticorruption Office, that he had a conflict of interest with respect to the Argentine Airlines;\n\n\u2022 The GOA\u2019s rejection of the Argentine Airlines\u2019 requests for airfare increases and failure to respect the legal framework in place at the time of and throughout the Claimants\u2019 investment;\n\n\u2022 The GOA\u2019s judicial challenge of ARSA\u2019s financial statements;\n\n\u2022 The GOA\u2019s breach of the May 2008 Agreement; and\n\n\u2022 The GOA\u2019s breach of the July 2008 Agreement and expropriation of the Argentine Airlines.1107\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 483 (footnotes omitted). *See also* Cl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 527-530.\n\n915.\n\nClaimants also say that Respondent adopted discriminatory measures against their investments. In this regard, they say that discrimination entails two elements: the measures directed against a particular party must be for reasons unrelated to the substance of the matter; and, discrimination entails like persons being treated in an equivalent manner.1108\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 485. Claimants also say that anti-discrimination provisions in BITs prohibit measures that are discriminatory in effect as well as those which are intentionally discriminatory. Claimants contest Respondent\u2019s test for discriminatory treatment.\n\n916.\n\nClaimants say that Respondent and its officials treated their investments discriminatorily due to the fact that they were Spanish, and not Argentine. In this regard, Claimants point to the following examples: Mr. Cirielli\u2019s antagonism against Air Comet\u2019s purchase of a controlling share in the Airlines; favoring other Argentine airlines, including SOL, over the Airlines by, *inter alia,* subsidizing fuel costs for certain flights; targeting the Airlines by refusing to sufficiently raise airfares until it took control of them; expropriating the Airlines, at least in part, because Air Comet and Claimants were Spanish (noting that none of the other airlines in Argentina were expropriated).1109\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 486; Cl. Reply \u00b6 534.\n\n917.\n\nRespondent disputed Claimants\u2019 interpretation of both \"unjustified\" and \"discriminatory measures\". It also denied that any of the conduct identified by Claimants constituted either unjustified or discriminatory conduct.1110\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 719-756; Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 660-681.\n\n918.\n\nWith respect to unjustified measures, Respondent submitted that \"unjustified\" measures are very similar to the notion of arbitrariness. It relies on the definition of arbitrariness set out in the *ELSI* Decision of the International Court of Justice to the effect that arbitrariness is something opposed to the rule of law and is a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.1111 Respondent also relies upon the decision in *Noble Ventures* v. *Romania* for the proposition that in examining the existence of arbitrariness, account should be taken of whether the measures adopted by the State were a short-term solution to avoid collapse and whether they were reasonable and well founded. Accordingly, it says that it is important to consider the circumstances in which the measures were taken.1112\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 727, quoting from *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (United States v. Italy),* 1989 I.C.J. 15 \u00b6 128: ALRA-45.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 728-732. Respondent also argues that with reference to unjustified or discriminatory measures, these apply only to investments made in accordance with the law. In addition. Respondent argues that the Tribunal should also bear in mind that the investments invoked by Claimants caused serious economic losses to both Argentina and Spain.\n\n919.\n\nOn the merits of Claimants\u2019 claim of unjustified measures, Respondent contested each of the allegations on the following basis:\n\n\u2022 The Federal Court of Appeals and the Argentine Anti-Corruption Office addressed the potential conflict of interest of Mr. Cirielli and did not request his removal. Further, Mr. Cirielli took a leave of absence from his union duties upon appointment as Undersecretary of Air Transportation. Finally, Respondent submits that Claimants have not provided reliable evidence of any discriminatory conduct.\n\n\u2022 Respondent complied with the regulatory framework at the time the initial investment was made and throughout its course. The rejection of any request for airfare increases was justified on technical grounds and, even if these grounds were incorrect (which is not admitted), this would not convert well justified measures into unjustified measures. Further, the airfare increases granted were adequate.\n\n\u2022 The challenge of ARSA\u2019s financial statements before the courts was appropriate.\n\n\u2022 Even assuming that there was any breach of the May 2008 Agreement and the July 2008 Agreement (which is denied), that would be, at best, contrary to a contractual provision and would not amount to a breach of the standard of arbitrariness articulated in the *ELSI* case.\n\n\u2022 The expropriation of the shares in the Airlines was conducted in accordance with Argentine law and Article V of the Treaty, both of which were in place long before Claimants\u2019 investment was made.1113\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6734-742; Resp. Rei. \u00b6\u00b6 669-674.\n\n920.\n\nIn respect of the alleged discriminatory measures, Respondent submits that a breach of Article III(1) of the Treaty requires treatment: (a) that is different for a foreign investor by reason of its nationality; (b) that is less favorable than that accorded to other investors in like circumstances; (c) that is intended to harm the foreign investor; (d) that causes actual harm to the foreign investor; and (e) that is not justified by sufficient reasons. According to Respondent, these elements are cumulative and must all be present in order for a measure to be deemed di scriminatory.1114\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6743-751.\n\n921.\n\nIn respect of the substance of Claimants\u2019 allegation of discriminatory conduct, Respondent made the following points:\n\n\u2022 Claimants did not provide proof that either Mr. Cirielli or the Government denied airfare increases or expropriate the shares of the Airlines because they were owned by Spanish entities.\n\n\u2022 Claimants did not demonstrate how the other airlines alleged to have been favored over the Airlines were in a similar situation.\n\n\u2022 There was no evidence of a campaign to \"re-Argentinize\" the Airlines. If, in the end, the Airlines had to be expropriated, this was due to the condition of the Airlines which, in order to maintain public air transport service, left no other choice.1115\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6752-756; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 678-681.\n\n922.\n\nThe underlying facts and alleged measures relating to Claimants\u2019 allegations of unjustified and discriminatory conduct have been examined in detail by the Tribunal and addressed in the section above dealing with fair and equitable treatment. This permits the Tribunal to address and determine the claims relating to unjustified and discriminatory measures expeditiously. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusions set out below refer to and rely upon its earlier findings.\n\n923.\n\nCommencing with the claims relating to unjustified measures under Article III(1) of the Treaty, it appears to be common ground between the Parties that unjustified measures are equivalent to arbitrary measures. This is consistent with the Tribunal\u2019s view that the ordinary or plain meaning of unjustified and arbitrary is very similar. With respect to the Parties\u2019 difference over the interpretation of \"arbitrary\" or \"arbitrariness\", the Tribunal finds Claimants\u2019 position more persuasive. Since the *ELSI* decision, several tribunals have gone beyond the limited notion of arbitrariness set out in that case and, relying on the ordinary meaning of the term, have articulated a broader notion of arbitrary treatment. In this regard, the Tribunal finds the definition of \"arbitrary\", in the decisions in *Azurix, Siemens, LG&E* and *National Grid,* reasonable and persuasive.1116\n\nSee Cl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6 519-525 and the sources cited there. Among these. Claimants refer to Prof. Christophe Schreuer, who writes that various categories of measures can be described as arbitrary or unreasonable:  \n \u2022 a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent or legitimate purpose. The decisive criterion for the detennination of the unreasonable or arbitrary nature of a measure hanning the investor would be whether it can be justified in tenns of rational reasons that are related to the facts. Arbitrariness would be absent if the measure is a reasonable and proportionate reaction to objectively verifiable circumstances;  \n \u2022 a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference;  \n \u2022 a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker. This applies, in particular, where a public interest is put forward as a pretext to take measures that are designed to ltann the investor; and  \n \u2022 a measure taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure.  \n*See* C. Schreuer, *Protection against Arbitrary or Discriminatory Measures,* Chapter 10 in R.P. Alford & C.A. Rogers, eds. *The Future of Investment Arbitration* (Oxford: University Press, 2007): C-912.\n\n924.\n\nTurning to the measures that Claimants allege were unjustified or arbitrary, the Tribunal finds that with the exception of the measures related to the July 2008 Agreement and the expropriation of the shares of the Airlines, none of the impugned measures amount to unjustified or arbitrary measures. These measures are reviewed above in the context of the allegations of breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.1117 In each case, the Tribunal found that the alleged conduct did not amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. For the same reasons, the Tribunal finds that the measures in question were not unjustified or arbitrary in breach of Article III(1) of the Treaty.\n\nThe relevant **\u00b6** are as follows: (i) the conduct relating to Mr. Cirielli - **\u00b6** 693 - 711; (ii) the regulatory framework and the failure to grant economically reasonable airfares -\u00b6\u00b6 501 -602; (iii) the judicial challenge of ARSA\u2019s financial statements **- \u00b6** 725 - 729; and (iv) the May 2008 Agreement - **\u00b6** 760- 776.\n\n925.\n\nHowever, as set out above at paragraphs 823 through 857, the Tribunal has found that Respondent\u2019s conduct in respect of the July 2008 Agreement and its failure to observe its commitment to purchase the shares of the Airlines in accordance with the third party valuation mechanism contained in the agreement amounted to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. In reaching that conclusion, the Tribunal found that Respondent\u2019s objections to the Credit Suisse valuation submitted by Interinvest were artificial, that Respondent had sufficient information to assess that valuation and, despite this, on the basis of these excuses failed to proceed with the valuation procedure agreed with Interinvest. It then obtained an injunction to maintain its appointee as the General Manager of the Airlines and proceeded to expropriate the shares of the Airlines. The Tribunal has found that such conduct lacked transparency, was arbitrary and amounted to a breach of the FET standard. For the same reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the conduct in question also amounts to unjustified measures under Article III(1) of the Treaty.\n\n926.\n\nIn respect of Claimants\u2019 allegations that Respondent hindered by discriminatory measures Claimants\u2019 investments in the Airlines, the Tribunal finds that these have not been proved. For the reasons set out previously, Claimants have not demonstrated that the conduct of Mr. Cirielli or Respondent was discriminatory. Further, the conduct Claimants complain of in regard to the regulatory framework and the airfare increases applied to all airlines operating in Argentina and did not single out the Airlines for special treatment. In addition, in respect of the alleged favoring of rival airlines over ARSA and AUSA, Claimants have not sufficiently identified these incidents, nor have they established that the other airlines and ARSA and AUSA were in similar or like circumstances. Finally, with respect to the expropriation of the shares in the Airlines, Claimants have not demonstrated that the expropriation was carried out because the shares were owned by Spanish or foreign interests. Accordingly, Claimants\u2019 claims in respect of discriminatory measures have not been made out.\n\n927.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has not breached the obligation not to obstruct by discriminatory measures, but has breached the obligation not to hinder by unjustified measures the management, maintenance, use, and sale of Claimants\u2019 investment pursuant to Article III(1) of the Treaty.\n\n**XI. ALLEGED BREACHES - CREEPING EXPROPRIATION**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n928.\n\nIn addition to their central claim that the Airlines were illegally expropriated by Respondent, Claimants maintain that there was also an indirect or creeping expropriation of their investment. In this regard, Claimants point to a number of the measures already discussed above in the context of their claim for a breach of the FET standard:\n\n(a) The \"airfare squeeze\"1118\n\n(b) The \"serious conflict of interests\" posed by Undersecretary Cirielli1119\n\n(c) The acts taken by the \"government-supported\" air transportation unions1120\n\n(d) Respondent\u2019s acts with respect to the June 2006 Agreement, including Respondent\u2019s coercion of Claimants to obtain additional shares at no cost, its unilateral modification of the text of the June 2006 Agreement, and its breach of the June 2006 Agreement by failing to set TER-compliant airfares and contributing to the promised 15% stock option of ARSA1121\n\n(e) Respondent\u2019s \"lowball purchase offer,\" made by *de facto* Government representatives in early 20081122\n\n(f) Respondent\u2019s failure to comply with the May 2008 Agreement1123\n\n(g) Respondent\u2019s *de facto* confiscation in 20081124\n\nCl.

PHB \u00b6 117.\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6181.\n\n929.\n\nIn light of the overlap between the claims for breach of FET and creeping expropriation, the Tribunal considers it most efficient to address the creeping expropriation claims at this stage and before turning to the claims of direct expropriation.\n\n**A. Positions of the Parties on Indirect or Creeping Expropriation Claims**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n930.\n\nClaimants assert that the sum of Argentina\u2019s measures, including the formal expropriation of the Airlines and those measures constituting a breach of the FET obligation, also constitute creeping expropriation under Article V of the Treaty.1125 Claimants assert that \"[t]hrough its conduct, the GOA gradually deflated the value of Claimants\u2019 investment and deprived Claimants of legal and contractual rights fundamental to their investment, as well as the use and enjoyment of that investment.\"1126\n\nSee Claimants\u2019 Skeleton Submission \u00b6 47 for a list of the alleged acts that collectively constitute the creeping expropriation.\n\nC1. PHB \u00b6179.\n\n931.\n\nRespondent asserts that the acts cited by Claimants do not constitute creeping expropriation. According to Respondent, they are merely regulatory and contractual claims that fall outside the scope of this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and which, in any case, have not resulted in either a substantial deprivation of the alleged investment or a loss of control.1127\n\nRespondent\u2019s Skeleton submission \u00b664.\n\n**B. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n932.\n\nThe Tribunal will review the claims for unlawful expropriation in detail in the following section. At this stage of the Award, the Tribunal will address only the claims that there was also an indirect or creeping expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment. Claimants argue that the measures noted at paragraph 928 above, in addition to amounting to unfair and inequitable treatment, also resulted in a creeping expropriation of their investment that culminated in a formal taking at the end of 2008. In this regard, Claimants rely on Article V of the Treaty and the decisions of other arbitral tribunals which have developed the test for finding an indirect or \"creeping\" expropriation occurred. Article V of the Treaty provides:\n\nNationalization, expropriation or any other measure having similar characteristics or effects that might be adopted by the authorities of one Party against investments made in its territory by investors of the other Party shall be effected only in the public interest, in accordance with the law, and shall in no case be discriminatory. The Party adopting such measures shall pay the investor or his assignee appropriate compensation without undue delay and in freely convertible currency.\n\n[Emphasis added]\n\n933.\n\nClaimants note that Article V of the Treaty explicitly covers both direct and indirect expropriation, as it refers not only to nationalization and expropriation but also \"any other measure having similar characteristics or effects\".1128 The Tribunal agrees with this position. For an indirect expropriation, the focus of the analysis is on measures other than nationalization or expropriation that have \"similar characteristics or effects\" to those measures. Any measure with similar characteristics or effects in order to be lawful under Article V of the Treaty must be affected only in the public interest, in accordance with the law, without discrimination and must be accompanied by appropriate compensation. Tribunals have considered the nature of nationalization or expropriation in deciding whether certain measures had similar characteristics or effects so as to engage the requirements for expropriation under treaties or customary international law.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 378-381.\n\n934.\n\nIn the decision in *Santa Elena* v. *Costa Rica,* the tribunal considered the nature of expropriation in the following passage:\n\nWhat has to be identified is the extent to which the measures taken have deprived the owner of the normal control of his property...There is ample authority for the proposition that a property has been expropriated when the effect of the measures taken by the state has been to deprive the owner of title, possession or access to the benefit and economic use of his property...Stated differently, international law does not lay down any precise or automatic criterion, such as the date of the transfer of ownership [...] or judicial determination of the amount of compensation or by payment of compensation.... [what matters is] the date on which the governmental \"interference\" lias deprived the owner of his rights or lias made those rights practically useless... Although the expropriation by the decree of 5 May 1978 was only the first step in a process of transferring the Property to the Government, it cannot reasonably be maintained [...] that this Decree expressed no more than an \"intention\" to expropriate or that, in 1978, the Government merely \"sought to expropriate\"... As of that date, the practical and economic use of the Property by the Claimant was irretrievably lost, notwithstanding that [the Claimant] remained in possession of the property. As of 5 May 1978, Claimant\u2019s ownership of Santa Elena was effectively blighted or sterilized..\"1129\n\n*Compania del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A.* v. *Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award, February 17, 2000, \u00b6 76-81 [hereinafter: *Santa Elena]'.* C-292, as cited in Cl. Mem. \u00b6 352.\n\n935.\n\nThus, in *Santa Elena,* it was recognized that the essence of expropriatory measures is \"to deprive the owner of the normal control of his property\" and that this occurs when \"governmental \u2018interference\u2019 has deprived the owner of his [ownership] rights or has made those rights practically useless\".\n\n936.\n\nRelying on *Tippets, Abbett, McStratton* v. *TAMS-AFFA,* Claimants argue that an expropriation can occur even when legal title to the property has not been affected if \"events demonstrate that the owner was deprived of fundamental rights of ownership\" and noted that the appointment of a government manager has been found to be an act of expropriation, as it denied the investor\u2019s rights to manage and control their investment.1130 Claimants describe the 2008 formal expropriation as \"the culmination of a long process of financial strangulation and gradual expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment.\"1131\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6 353-354 citing *Tippetts, Abbett, McStratton* v. *TAMS-AFFA,* US-Iran Claims Tribunal Award No. 141-7-2 (June 22, 1984): C-293 and *Starrett Housing Corp.* v. *Iran,* 4 Iran-US CTR 123, (1984) 23 ILM 1090: C- 294.\n\nCl. Mem at \u00b6355.\n\n937.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that to the extent that Claimants argue that particular measures deprived them of their rights of ownership, including legal title to their shares, the right to manage the Airlines or actual control over them, it is clear that those measures would be expropriatory. The essence of expropriation is a taking or deprivation of *de facto* or *de jure* rights of ownership. There is no doubt that the formal taking of the Airlines through Law No. 26,466 on December 17, 2008 was expropriatory in that it authorized the expropriation of the investor\u2019s indirectly held shares of the Airlines and the exercise of the shares\u2019 corporate rights by the Government. Law 26,412, which was enacted on September 18, 2008 and which approved Government of Argentina\u2019s \"repossession\" of the Airlines, was also expropriatory in nature as it contemplated the taking of Claimants\u2019 shares following valuation of compensation by the TTN. Whether the formal taking of Claimants\u2019 investment was lawful will be discussed in the next section of this award. At this stage of the analysis, the Tribunal must consider whether any other acts in the series of measures in this case - short of the formal taking of their ownership rights - were also expropriatory.\n\n938.\n\nWorking back in time from these clearly expropriatory acts, the next measure that was alleged to be expropriatory in nature was the transition in day-to-day management of the Airlines from Claimants to Respondent through the appointment of a General Manager, Mr. Alak.\n\n939.\n\nAs has been discussed in detail in the section on FET, through the July 2008 Agreement, Claimants agreed to sell their shareholdings in both ARSA and AUSA to Respondent within 60 days. Claimants were to appoint valuators to value each airline on a DCF basis with specific agreed assumptions as to the cost of fuel and domestic airfares and Respondent was to seek the same valuations of the Airlines as a whole from the TTN. In the event of differing results, a third valuation was to be sought from an impartial, experienced and respected valuator.1132 During the 60-day transition period, the Parties were to set up a Transition Board made up of two representatives of Claimants and two representatives of Respondent to manage the operations of the Airlines.1133 The Transition Board was to manage the Airlines and instruct the General Manager to be appointed by Respondent and it was tasked with providing the necessary information for the stock transfer and valuation.1134 Although Mr. Alak\u2019s appointment was made pursuant to the July 2008 Agreement, which contemplated that the State-appointed General Manager would take instructions from a transition committee jointly appointed by Claimants and Respondent, the evidence indicates that, at some point in time, the General Manager began acting on his own and was no longer instructed by the Transition Board.\n\nC-190, Article 6.\n\nC-190, Article 3.\n\nC-190, Articles 3-4.\n\n940.\n\nOn July 21, 2008, Mr. Julio Alak assumed the role of the Airlines\u2019 General Manager.1135 Claimants, relying on the testimony of Mr. Munoz, submit that as of that date, the Government of Argentina took *de facto* control over the Airlines.1136 However, the contemporaneous documents indicate that Interinvest did not complain about the functioning of the Transition Committee until November 12, 2008. On that date, Interinvest wrote to Secretary Jaime to request that the Transition Committee meet indicating that Argentina\u2019s representatives had not attended any of the committee\u2019s weekly meetings since October 8, 2008.1137 Interinvest indicated that, as a result, Mr. Julio Alak as General Manager was managing the Airlines without the guidance of the Transition Committee.1138\n\nRA-3 78, Minute 1.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 124 citing Munoz testimony. Transcript p. 457, line 12 - p. 458, line 17.\n\nC-210.\n\nC-210. In addition, Interinvest again requested that Argentina provide a response to its request to appoint a third-party valuator. *See also* C-212, pp. 29-33: minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors of ARS A on November 19, 2008.\n\n941.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that taking over management of an investment constitutes an indirect expropriation and that there was evidence that Argentina did assume the management of the investment at some point after the July 2008 Agreement and before the formal expropriation of Claimants\u2019 shares. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this amounted to an indirect expropriation. However, the record is not entirely clear as to precisely when Argentina in fact took over the management of the Airlines such as to amount to an expropriation. In light of the fact that Argentina proceeded to formally expropriate Claimants\u2019 shares in the Airlines thereby completing a *de jure* taking, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to determine the precise date at which a *de facto* taking occurred. Accordingly, the Tribunal will discuss the consequences flowing from the indirect expropriation of the Airlines through the takeover of management in the following section on expropriation.\n\n942.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the events alleged to form part of the creeping expropriation that took place before July 2008. The expropriatory nature of the other individual impugned measures preceding the assumption of the day-to-day management is less clear. Having reviewed the events and found that an indirect expropriation occurred at some point during the course of events following the July 2008 Agreement, the Tribunal finds it convenient to address the other components of Claimants\u2019 creeping expropriation claims in chronological order.\n\n943.\n\nClaimants argue that the airfare squeeze \"gradually emptied the value of Claimants\u2019 investment and enabled the ultimate \u2018Argentinization\u2019 (nationalization) of the two airlines at an orchestrated, artificially-low price.\"1139 Claimants complain that in 2006, Respondent \"coerced Claimants to grant it an option to raise its stake in ARSA, first to 5% and then to 2O%.\"1140 In 2006, Respondent exercised its first option increasing its shareholding in ARSA from 1.2% to 5%. Then in 2007, Respondent exercised its second option to increase its ownership to 20%. The exercise of the second option was never perfected as Respondent failed to make the necessary capital contribution for the shares. Finally, in 2008, Respondent took full control over the Airlines. Claimants state that each progressive taking was without any compensation and that Respondent required Claimants to transfer shares in exchange for promises to increase airfares and approve the financial statements.1141 Claimants summarize their position as follows:\n\nArgentina\u2019s plan, initiated in late 2004, had finally come to fruition: After years of financial asphyxiation, instrumentalized by: (i) preventing the Argentine Airlines from charging economically reasonable airfares; (ii) blocking the adoption of ARSA accounts which, in turn, prevented the financial expansion of the airlines; and (iii) escalating government-supported union strikes and unreasonable salary demands leading to social unrest and a near paralysis in the operation of the airlines, the GOA had essentially eviscerated the value of Claimants\u2019 investment. Formal expropriation in December 2008 was but the *coup de grace,* delayed only so as to allow the authorities to walk away at lower cost. In the end, however, the GOA refused even to pay the deflated 2008 value of Claimants\u2019 investment. After four years of harassment, unfair treatment and fraudulent maneuvers, it simply decided not to pay any compensation at all.1142\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 356.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 363.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 363.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 371.\n\n944.\n\nClaimants argue that a \"creeping\" expropriation resulted from the series of measures, which over time substantially impaired the value of the investment, even though each individual measure standing alone would not appear to amount to expropriation.1143 In support of their position, Claimants also quote Professors Reisman and Sloane on creeping expropriation:\n\nDiscrete acts, analyzed in isolation rather than in the context of the overall flow of events, may, whether legal or not in themselves, seem innocuous vis-a-vis a potential expropriation. Some may not be expropriatory in themselves. Only in retrospect will it become evident that those acts comprised part of an accretion of deleterious acts and omissions, which in the aggregate expropriated the foreign investor\u2019s property rights.1144\n\nCl.

Further, Respondent emphasizes that Government of Argentina made contributions for the payment of the companies\u2019 fuel and wages;1147\n\n(b) that there was no evidence that any of the agreements entered into between Interinvest and Argentina were entered into under coercion;1148\n\n(c) that even in a creeping expropriation the final result of each measure must be an actual expropriation or deprivation of property rights;1149 and\n\n(d) that the impact required to give rise to a finding of expropriation must be substantial, i.e. an alleged partial reduction in the value of the shares does not amount to expropriation.1150\n\nResp.

CM \u00b6\u00b6 831-860.\n\n948.\n\nAs just summarized, the Parties disagree as to whether, in order to prove that a creeping expropriation occurred, the final result of each individual measure must be an actual expropriation or deprivation of property rights. The Tribunal agrees that the relevant focus of the inquiry for this purpose is the effect or result of the measure, as opposed to the purpose for which each measure was undertaken. A creeping expropriation is a particular type of indirect expropriation, which requires an inquiry into the particular facts. The use of the term \"creeping\" to describe this type of expropriation indicates that the entirety of the measures should be reviewed in the aggregate to determine their effect on the investment rather than each individual measure on its own. As summarized by Reisman and Sloane:\n\nA creeping expropriation therefore denotes, in the paradigmatic case, an expropriation accomplished by a cumulative series of regulatory acts or omissions over a prolonged period of time, no one of which can necessarily be identified as the decisive event that deprived the foreign national of the value of its investment. Moreover, they may be interspersed with entirely lawful state regulatory actions. By definition, then, creeping expropriations lack the vividness and transparency not only of formal expropriations, but also of many regulatory or otherwise indirect expropriations, which may be identified more closely with a few discrete events. The gradual and sometimes furtive nature of the acts and omissions that culminate in a creeping expropriation tends to obscure what tribunals ordinarily denominate the \u2018moment of expropriation\u2019.1152\n\nReisman and Sloane, C-296 at p. 128.\n\n949.\n\nHowever, it is still necessary for the individual measures to culminate in a taking or deprivation of property rights. The Tribunal has found that the takeover of the day-to-day management of the Airlines was an indirect expropriation; it was a substantial and permanent deprivation of property rights. This event was expropriatory on its own even without reference to the earlier impugned events. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, a substantial and permanent deprivation of property rights did not occur until the events of 2008. In order to conclude that a creeping expropriation took place, the Tribunal must conclude that the earlier impugned events formed part of the chain of events that led to the eventual substantial and permanent deprivation of property rights. In the circumstances of this case, the same measures are alleged to form the basis of both the FET claim and the creeping expropriation claim. The measures have already been reviewed in detail in the context of the FET claims in the previous section. Accordingly, the Tribunal will return to these only in a summary fashion here:\n\n(a) The \"airfare squeeze\" - the Tribunal has found that although airfares were not sufficient to cover the costs of airline operators and provide a rate of return, this did not amount to a breach of the FET standard. Further, the Secretariat of Transportation considered the requests for increases and did grant a number of increases;1153\n\n(b) The \"serious conflict of interests\" posed by Undersecretary Cirielli - the Tribunal has found that while Mr. Cirielli may have had an unfavorable view of the Spanish ownership of the Airlines, Claimants have not demonstrated that Mr. Cirielli\u2019s views or his conflict of interest caused the breach or impairment of the Airlines\u2019 rights;1154\n\n(c) The acts taken by the \"government-supported\" air transportation unions - the Tribunal has found that Claimants have not demonstrated that the Government controlled or sponsored the transportation unions or their strikes;1155\n\n(d) Respondent\u2019s acts with respect to the June 2006 Agreement, including Respondent\u2019s coercion of Claimants to obtain additional shares at no cost, its unilateral modification of the text of the June 2006 Agreement, and its breach of the June 2006 Agreement by failing to set TER-compliant airfares and contributing to the promised 15% stock option of ARSA - the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent coerced Claimants to accept the June 2006 Agreement nor that Respondent breached that agreement. Although Respondent did not contribute to increase its shareholdings in ARSA, this was an option and not an obligation on Respondent;1156\n\n(e) Respondent\u2019s \"lowball purchase offer,\" made by *de facto* Government representatives in early 2008 - while Respondent may have encouraged or facilitated the approach by Mr. Llorente, the Tribunal has been unable to conclude that the approach was made by *de facto* representatives of the Government or that the approach was an attempt to force out Claimants;1157 and\n\n(f) Respondent\u2019s failure to comply with the May 2008 Agreement - the Tribunal has found that neither Respondent nor Interinvest breached the May 2008 Agreement.1158\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 108-109; Cl. Mem. \u00b6356.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6361.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6362.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6\u00b6363-364; Cl. PHB \u00b6103.\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 108-109.\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6117.\n\n950.\n\nIn light of these findings, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that a creeping expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment occurred. In most instances, Claimants\u2019 underlying factual premises have not been made out. While Claimants have demonstrated that the conduct they complain of culminated in a deprivation of Claimants\u2019 rights of ownership, they have not demonstrated that there was a link between the individual measures and the ultimate taking.\n\n951.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that an indirect expropriation took place following the July 2008 Agreement, but that the Claimants have failed to make out their claim for creeping expropriation. Since there are also claims of unlawful expropriation, whether the indirect expropriatory acts that preceded the formal expropriation in December 2008 were unlawful will be discussed in the wider context of the claims related to the formal expropriation.\n\n**XII. ALLEGED BREACHES OF UNLAWFUL EXPROPRIATION**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n952.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent unlawfully expropriated their investment while Respondent maintains that its expropriation was entirely lawful.\n\n**A. Did Respondent Expropriate Claimants\u2019 Investment?**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n953.\n\nAs set out at paragraph 951, above, the Tribunal has determined that an indirect expropriation took place following the July 2008 Agreement, once Respondent took over the management of the Airlines when Mr. Alak continued to act as General Manager without reporting to the Transition Committee and following the injunction proceedings in the Argentine courts and the injunction of November 21, 2008. For completeness, the Tribunal will briefly set out the events related to the direct expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n**1. Argentine Judicial Expropriation Proceedings**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n954.\n\nAfter Interinvest rejected the TTN\u2019s January 2009 valuation prepared pursuant to Law No. 26,466 (see paragraphs 841 to 844, above), the Government of Argentina filed an expropriation lawsuit against Interinvest with the Argentine judiciary. On February 27, 2014, the Argentine Federal Administrative Court rendered its decision on expropriation against Interinvest. The decision perfected the expropriation of the shares by confirming the rejection of Interinvest\u2019s request for compensation and by transferring the title to the shares.1159\n\nC-1197.\n\n955.\n\nRespondent criticizes Interinvest\u2019s participation in the Argentine legal proceedings. It asserts that in answering the court complaint, Interinvest raised \"generic objections\" to Law No. 26,466, but did not specifically question the constitutionality of the act or the declaration of public interest or the non-discriminatory nature of the expropriation.1160 Respondent asserts that after the judge requested a valuation from the TTN, as required under the Expropriation Law, Interinvest was entitled to appoint a member to the TTN, ensuring an adequate right of defense.1161 However, Respondent alleges that Interinvest forfeited this right by failing to appoint a qualified individual.1162 Upon the TTN\u2019s report valuing the Airlines at ARS - 3,275 billion, Interinvest protested the valuation, arguing that the valuation was not fair and that the assessment methods used were not compatible with international standards. However, according to Respondent, Interinvest did not question the TTN\u2019s compliance with Law No. 21,499, the Law on Expropriation.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 532.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 521-522.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 542-543.\n\n956.\n\nRespondent also argues that throughout the pendency of the lawsuit, Interinvest needlessly delayed the court proceedings by petitioning for the suspension of proceedings and by failing to produce documentary evidence required by the judge.1163\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 537-540, 557-558.\n\n957.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that\n\n[T]he fact that Claimants\u2014through their controlled company Interinvest\u2014had the opportunity to object to the rules on expropriation and to the conclusion of the valuation in the case of expropriation, but deliberately chose not to do so, renders any challenge to those measures in this arbitration inadmissible. Claimants cannot assert something that is contrary to their own actions and adopt a legal position that is inconsistent with that taken at the expropriation proceedings (especially, without providing any justification for such change of mind).1164\n\nResp. PHB \u00b670.\n\n958.\n\nIn response, Claimants argue that Interinvest did in fact raise the argument, during the Argentine proceedings, that Law. No. 26,466 and the subsequent measures taken by Argentina were unconstitutional.1165 However, they note that \"in 100 years of the Argentine Supreme Court case law dealing with expropriation cases, there was not one declaration of unconstitutionality of either the general expropriation statute or the relevant individual expropriations approved by Congress under such statute.\"1166 Claimants also point to what they allege is \"the Argentine judiciary\u2019s lack of independence and vulnerability to political pressure.\"1167 Claimants allege that the judge granted Interinvest only five days to challenge the TTN\u2019s new report, after the TTN had 180 work days to prepare the report.1168\n\nCl.

Investment Directly and Indirectly Expropriated**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n960.\n\nAs set out at paragraph 951, above, the Tribunal has determined that an indirect expropriation took place following the July 2008 Agreement, once Respondent had taken over the management of the Airlines following injunction proceedings in the Argentine courts. That Respondent also formally expropriated Claimants\u2019 shares in the Airlines in December 2008 through Law 26,466 is not disputed.1171 The Tribunal pauses to note that it is possible, as occurred in the circumstances of this case, for a State to both indirectly and directly expropriate the same investment by different measures. The Tribunal notes that Claimants claim that both takings were unlawful, but did not argue that they should be treated separately in the analysis of whether the taking of shares complied with the expropriation provisions of the Treaty. Accordingly, in this section of the Award, the Tribunal will determine whether the expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment was in accordance with the Treaty in light of the events of late 2008.\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 181; Cl. Mem. \u00b6 349; Resp. CM \u00b6 **815** although Respondent submitted that the expropriation was not yet complete as of the date of the filing of that submission.\n\n961.\n\nAs has been discussed in detail in previous sections of this award,1172 Claimants and Respondent had reached an agreement in May 2008 whereby Claimants would reduce their shareholdings in the Airlines by selling their shares to Respondent, employees and other private investors. The private investor walked away from the deal leaving Claimants and Respondent to negotiate a different solution to the Airlines\u2019 distress.\n\n*See,* in particular, the discussion at paragraph 760 *et seq.,* above.\n\n962.\n\nThrough the July 2008 Agreement, Claimants agreed to sell their shareholdings in both ARSA and AUSA to Respondent following a 60 day transition period. Claimants were to appoint valuators to value each airline on a DCF basis with specific agreed assumptions as to the cost of fuel and domestic airfares and Respondent was to seek the same valuations of the Airlines as a whole from the TTN.1173 In the event of differing results, a third valuation was to be sought from an impartial, experienced and respected valuator.1174 During the 60-day transition period, the Parties were to set up a Transition Board made up of two representatives of Claimants and two representatives of Respondent to manage the operations of the Airlines.1175 The Transition Board was to manage the Airlines and instruct the General Manager appointed by Respondent. It was tasked with ensuring the performance of various tasks by the Parties, including the provision of necessary information, in order to perfect the purchase and sale of the shares.1176\n\nC-190, Article 6, which is reproduced at para. 779, above.\n\nC-190, Article 6.\n\nC-190, Article 3.\n\nC-190, Articles 3-4.\n\n963.\n\nOn July 21, 2008, Mr. Julio Alak assumed the role of the Airlines\u2019 General Manager.1177 Claimants, relying on the testimony of Mr. Munoz Perez, submit that as of that date, the Government of Argentina took *de facto* control over the Airlines.1178 However, the contemporaneous documents indicate that Interinvest did not complain about the functioning of the Transition Committee until November 12, 2008. On that date, Interinvest wrote to Secretary Jaime to request that the Transition Committee meet indicating that Argentina\u2019s representatives had not attended any of the committee\u2019s weekly meetings since October 8, 2008.1179 Interinvest indicated that, as a result, Mr. Julio Alak as General Manager was managing the Airlines without the guidance of the Transition Committee.1180\n\nRA-378, Minute 1.\n\nCl. PHB, para. 124 citing Munoz testimony. Transcript p. 457, line 12 - p. 458, line 17.\n\nC-210.\n\nC-210. In addition, Interinvest again requested that Argentina provide a response to its request to appoint a third-party valuator. *See also* C-212, pp. 29-33: minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors of ARS A on November 19, 2008.\n\n964.\n\nAs discussed above, the Tribunal agrees that taking over management of an investment can constitute expropriation of an investment and that there was evidence that Argentina did assume the management of the investment at some point after the July 2008 Agreement and before the formal expropriation of Claimants\u2019 shares. The Tribunal has concluded that in seeking and obtaining the injunction that prevented the removal of Mr. Alak as General Manager, Respondent indirectly expropriated Claimants\u2019 investment. However, the Tribunal does not agree with Claimants\u2019 position that this was a direct expropriation. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, a *de facto* taking, without a transfer of title or physical seizure of the investment, is not a direct expropriation. The classification of the expropriation as direct versus indirect has no consequence for the Tribunal\u2019s analysis as to its lawfulness, as Article V of the Treaty sets out Respondent\u2019s obligations with respect to both direct and indirect expropriation, which are identical. What is relevant is whether the takeover of the day-to-day management of the investment was done in accordance with Article V of the Treaty.\n\n965.\n\nIn addition, in light of the fact that Argentina proceeded to formally expropriate Claimants\u2019 shares in the Airlines thereby completing a *de jure* taking of the investment by separate measures, it is necessary to review the events surrounding the takings in order to determine whether they were carried out in accordance with the Treaty.\n\n**B. The Standard for Lawful Expropriation**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n966.\n\nClaimants\u2019 arguments with respect to unlawful expropriation relate to their claims of both direct and indirect expropriation, which rely on Article V of the Treaty, which provides:\n\nNationalization, expropriation or any other measure having similar characteristics or effects that might be adopted by the authorities of one Party against investments made in its territory by investors of the other Party shall be effected only in the public interest, in accordance with the law, and shall in no case be discriminatory. The Party adopting such measures shall pay the investor or his assignee appropriate compensation without undue delay and in freely convertible currency.\n\n967.\n\nRespondent agrees that Article V of the Treaty governs expropriation.1181\n\nResp. CM \u00b6816.\n\n968.\n\nArticle V of the Treaty provides that, in order for expropriation to be lawful: i) it must be affected in the public interest; ii) it must be carried out in accordance with the law; iii) it must not be discriminatory; and iv) it must be accompanied by appropriate compensation.\n\n969.\n\nClaimants allege that Respondent unlawfully expropriated Claimants\u2019 shares in the Airlines in 2008, in violation of Article V of the Treaty. Claimants\u2019 specific arguments relate to various omissions and acts taken by Respondent in the expropriation process. In summary, Claimants assert that Respondent failed to pay adequate compensation;1182 that the expropriation was not in the public interest;1183 that the expropriation was unlawful because it violated due process, the Argentine Constitution, and Argentina\u2019s statutory obligations;1184 and that the expropriation was discriminatory.1185 In addition, Claimants argue that Respondent, at the time of the taking, was of the view that some compensation was owed to Claimants and that Respondent\u2019s failed promise to subrogate Claimants\u2019 Airbus orders, which would have compensated Claimants for their expropriated investment in the amount of USD 366-466 million, was also unlawful.1186 Claimants submit that the unlawfulness of the expropriation is crucial in this arbitration, as it determines the date of valuation (date of the award) as well as the damages to which Claimants are entitled.1187\n\nCl.

Accordingly, this discussion will not be repeated in this section of the award and the factual background will only be set out to the extent it is necessary to review it in analyzing the lawfulness of the expropriation claims.\n\n**C. \"Only in the public interest\"**\n------------------------------------\n\n**1. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n972.\n\nClaimants assert that the expropriation was unlawful because it was not in the public interest. According to Claimants, Respondent\u2019s alleged desire stated in Law No. 26,466 \"to guarantee continuity and safety in the provision of the public service of commercial air transportation, the protection of the workers\u2019 jobs and the preservation of the assets of the airlines\" runs against its own actions.1188 Claimants assert that if Respondent had truly wanted to ensure the continuity and safety of the Airlines\u2019 operations, it would not have refused to raise airfares, appointed Undersecretary Cirielli, challenged ARSA\u2019s financial statements or failed to grant the promised tax benefits and subsidies.1189 According to Claimants, these acts by Respondent put the Airlines into their difficult situation in 2008.1190\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6165.\n\n*Id.*\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 166.\n\n973.\n\nClaimants argue that international law requires that expropriation only be carried out when it is necessary to serve the \"public interest\".1191 Claimants refer to various expressions of a genuine public interest as \"overriding purely individual or private interests\"1192 or \"a *bona fide* public purpose\".1193 Claimants submit that it is not sufficient for Argentina to declare that the Airlines\u2019 shares were of public interest - Respondent must demonstrate that its expropriation was in the public interest1194 and the Tribunal must determine that there was some genuine interest of the public.1195\n\nCl.

PHB \u00b6 167, citing Testimony of Professor Marina Donato, Transcript pp. 713-714.\n\n975.\n\nClaimants\u2019 argument with respect to the public interest is encapsulated in the following submission:\n\nIn the present case, there is no apparent reason why the GOA must own what were previously private airlines. Lest it be forgotten, this is not a case in which the GOA privatized public utilities such as water or electricity supply and subsequently withdrew the concession for supply of certain public services. In this dispute, no public utility or service is at stake. What were expropriated were shares in a private company, supplying a commercial service of air transportation, in competition with other, privately-held airlines.1198\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6385.\n\n976.\n\nClaimants state that \"any \u2018public interest\u2019 related to purely commercial air transportation would have been much better served if the GOA would simply have abided by its own rules and guarantees...[t]here was simply no need for an expropriation as higher tariff caps, subsidies and other compensation...could have ended the strikes and put the airlines back on track.\"1199 Claimants note that these measures were taken by Respondent after it took control of the Airlines.1200\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6391.\n\nCl.

Rej. \u00b6 743.\n\n980.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimants \"did not comply with the Argentine regulatory and company laws by engaging in a conduct that was terribly detrimental to the Argentine Airlines.\"1213 As a result, the Argentine State was forced \"to take control of an airline that was totally abandoned, which, in turn, implied a risk for the country\u2019s connectivity.\"1214 Respondent argues that expropriation \"was the only viable alternative left in order to ensure the continued and uninterrupted provision of the public service and connectivity in the country, considering the circumstances and, particularly, the behaviour of the Marsans Group with respect to the Airlines, which led to a situation of actual collapse.\"1215 Respondent therefore asserts that this is a case of public interest \"par excellence\".1216\n\nResp.

Respondent makes two submissions. First, Respondent submits that this airline does not present a viable alternative, as it is limited in its fleet and staff, and would not be in a position to take over the Airlines\u2019 routes.1218 Second, Respondent says that this argument is also legally irrelevant, as there is no \"only way\" standard that applies to expropriation for a public purpose.1219\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6 218.\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6 219.\n\n**2. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n983.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, the Tribunal is of the view that Respondent has adequately demonstrated that its expropriation of the shares of the Airlines (and their related entities) was done in the public interest.\n\n984.\n\nAs submitted by both Parties, the analysis of whether the expropriation was in the public interest must go beyond a State\u2019s declaration. In this case, the fact that the Airlines provided a public service was not in dispute. As is clear from the discussion elsewhere in this award, the entire regulatory regime is premised on air transport being a public service. In addition, Respondent consistently treated the Airlines\u2019 services as not only providing a public service, but also serving the identified public interest of connectivity. Argentina\u2019s geography makes regular air transport services for passengers and cargo necessary to ensure connectivity of remote areas within the country. The Tribunal considers the stated and demonstrated need for connectivity in Argentina to be a genuine public interest that overrides purely individual or private interests.1220\n\nThe evidence suggests that, although ultimately inadequate in the execution of measures, Respondent recognized the need to provide for higher airfares and other assistance for Airlines facing higher costs in order to maintain the industry as a whole, but also to ensure that lesser trafficked routes continued to have service despite their commercial unattractiveness. Respondent also provided bail out funds in 2008 in order to keep the Airlines in operation, which lends support to the conclusion that the Airlines provided an important public service and that Government of Argentina had an interest in their continued operation. In this context, the Tribunal is of the view that Respondent\u2019s decision to expropriate the Airlines\u2019 shares and to continue operating the Airlines were steps taken in the *bona fide* public interest to preserve connectivity.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6 383 citing Article 4 of the 1962 General Assembly Resolution No. 1803 on Permanent Sovereignty over Natural Resources.\n\n985.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has noted and considered Claimants\u2019 arguments with respect to whether there were other measures (short of expropriation of the Airlines) that Respondent could have taken in furtherance of its public interest and that the expropriation was not \"only\" in the public interest. The Tribunal agrees that a State must be accorded a certain amount of deference in determining how to best advance its public interest once a public interest has been demonstrated as the reason for which an expropriation occurred. Further, there is no requirement at international law that expropriation, in order to be in the public interest, must be the only means available for the State to meet that interest. Moreover, there is also no requirement that the entity being expropriated had to have previously been a State-owned entity. In light of the substantial proportion of the domestic market served by ARSA and AUSA and their ongoing financial difficulties, it was reasonable for Respondent to expropriate both airlines to ensure that the public interest of connectivity continued to be served.\n\n986.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal declines to find that the expropriation was not in the public interest. Claimants\u2019 challenge to the lawfulness of the expropriation on the basis that it was not in the public interest is rejected.\n\n**D. \"In accordance with the law\"**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n987.\n\nClaimants make several arguments to support their assertion that Respondent\u2019s expropriation of the Airlines was not \"in accordance with the law.\"\n\n988.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent\u2019s alleged creeping expropriation was not in accordance with the law. As discussed above at paragraphs 928 to 951, Claimants argue that from October 2004 to December 2008, Respondent\u2019s measures amounted to a creeping expropriation of their investment. Claimants argue that the measures constituting this alleged creeping expropriation violated Argentine law, including statutory rights and contractually agreed commitments and were contrary to basic principles of due process.1221\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6395.\n\n989.\n\nIn support of this aspect of their unlawful expropriation claim, Claimants import and rely upon their claims of breach of the FET standard as conduct \"a *fortiori* conduct not \u2018in accordance with the law\u2019\".1222 Claimants also say that in disregarding its contractual obligations under the July 2008 Agreement for a third-party valuation in the event of disagreement between valuations and in subsequently relying on the TTN \"who had already found that the airlines were worthless\", their basic due process rights were violated resulting in Respondent failing to expropriate the investment \"in accordance with the law\".1223 Further, in connection with this argument, Claimants assert that the Credit Suisse valuation they submitted fully complied with the provisions of the July 2008 Agreement, and that Respondent\u2019s rejection of their valuation was groundless.1224\n\nCl.

Respondent also points out that \"[t]he Argentine Republic has never had - and does not have - any contractual commitment to Claimants.\"1234 Accordingly, Respondent argues that it has no obligations to Claimants arising from either contract or the Treaty.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 841.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6842.\n\n995.\n\nRespondent argues that the due process of law requirement under the Treaty requires an applicable legal procedure regarding the expropriation that allows the affected party to have its claim heard and that such procedure must be followed1235 and that the \"in accordance with the law\" standard refers to \"the specifically-relevant law of the state whose expropriation is challenged.\"1236 By this standard, Respondent argues that the expropriation of Claimants\u2019 shares was conducted in accordance with the laws in force at the time of the expropriation\u2014laws that had been in place before Claimants took control of the Airlines and remained unaltered during their tenure.1237 Respondent cites *Kardassopolous* v. *Georgia* in support of its position:\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the reasoning of the ADC tribunal and, in particular, with the proposition that whatever the legal mechanism or procedure put in to place, it \"must be of a nature to grant an affected investor a reasonable chance within a reasonable time to claim its legitimate rights and have its claims heard\" if it is to be found to have been carried out under due process of the law.1238\n\nResp.

Respondent submits that \"[t]his fact has not been seriously questioned by Interinvest, which is controlled by Claimants, which are - in turn - party to these proceedings.\"1239 Respondent asserts, moreover, that Interinvest decided not to argue, during the course of the Argentine judicial proceedings, that the expropriation process was not conducted in accordance with the law.

Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1001.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its analysis by noting that in the circumstances of this case in order to determine whether the expropriation was \"in accordance with the law\", it must consider the process for both the indirect taking of the investment and the process for the direct taking of the investment through Law 26,466. The Parties agree that the \"law\" in issue for this branch of the test under the Treaty is Argentine law and the requirements of due process. An expropriation that is carried out in accordance with the local law will satisfy this branch of the test, but may still be unlawful at international law if the other conditions for lawful expropriation have not been met.\n\n1002.\n\nTurning first to Law 26,466 and the process for the direct expropriation of Interinvest\u2019s shares, the Tribunal notes that the evidence indicates that the law provided for expropriation in accordance with the provisions of the Expropriation Law. Claimants did not seriously dispute that the expropriation process provided Interinvest with a legal procedure that granted it \"a reasonable chance within a reasonable time to claim its legitimate rights and have its claims heard\". Regarding the direct expropriation process, the evidence demonstrates that Interinvest was afforded the opportunity to claim its rights before the Argentine courts and to have its claims heard. It appears that Claimants could have done so within a reasonable time and, in fact, Interinvest chose to seek a suspension of those proceedings to provide time for settlement negotiations to continue.\n\n1003.\n\nClaimants\u2019 arguments in this respect focused on the provision of Law 26,466 that allowed Respondent to effect an \"abnormal temporary occupation\" of the shares, thus circumventing the constitutional obligation to pay compensation before a taking. Both Parties submitted expert opinion evidence on the Argentine law of expropriation and agreed that Government of Argentina\u2019s power to expropriate is limited by the Argentine Constitution. In the ordinary course of expropriation proceedings in Argentina, in the event of a disagreement as to the value of the property being taken, Government of Argentina may take possession of the property once it has made a deposit of the value as determined by a tribunal.1250 However, as Professor Mata explained, \"the State is empowered, in its capacity as the conceding authority, to directly provide any public service in situations where its continuity or regularity is compromised.\"1251 While Claimants\u2019 expert, Professor Bianchi, challenges Government of Argentina\u2019s selection of the use of an \"abnormal temporary occupation\" for this purpose, he did not challenge Government of Argentina\u2019s ability to order temporary occupation. It was not shown that Respondent selected this method of occupation in order to circumvent Constitutional guarantees for compensation to be paid in advance. In addition, the evidence indicates that at the time Law 26,466 was passed Respondent had been advised that the Airlines had negative shareholders\u2019 equity. Whether or not this was correct, in these circumstances, it does not seem unreasonable for Government of Argentina to have proceeded on the basis of an abnormal temporary occupation pending the final valuation of the shares through the formal expropriation process. The formal expropriation as commenced by Law 26,466 and the process that followed appears to have been in accordance with Argentine law.\n\n*See, for example,* Mata ER3 \u00b6\u00b6 77-80.\n\nMata ER3, \u00b6 82.\n\n1004.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Claimants\u2019 argument that the local process, which allegedly did not provide for independent valuation, was in violation of due process is also without merit. While the TTN was a government-appointed body and therefore not \"independent\" of the government, the evidence indicated that the valuation process allows an affected party to challenge the TTN\u2019s valuations and submit its own evidence of value. The Tribunal considers this ability to provide for due process such that this element of the expropriation was also in accordance with the law.\n\n1005.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Respondent\u2019s admissibility argument: that Claimants could not argue in this arbitration that the expropriation was not in accordance with the law because Interinvest did not challenge the lawfulness of the expropriation before the Argentine courts. Respondent has not pointed to any requirement in the Treaty that the investor must have participated in and challenged the legality of the local proceedings in order to be able to argue that the expropriation was not in accordance with the law pursuant to the Treaty. While the failure to raise arguments in the local expropriation proceedings can cause practical issues when asking an international tribunal to assess whether those proceedings were in accordance with the local law, this does not affect the admissibility of the arguments or claims in the arbitration.\n\n1006.\n\nTurning next to Claimants\u2019 claims that the alleged creeping expropriation was not in accordance with the law, the Tribunal simply notes that Claimants have failed to make out their claims of creeping expropriation. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider those measures and whether they were in accordance with the law.\n\n1007.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal turns to Claimants\u2019 claims that the indirect expropriation of Interinvest\u2019s shares was not in accordance with the law. Claimants\u2019 main arguments in this respect are that the failure to accord the investment fair and equitable treatment is expropriation not in accordance with the law; that Respondent failed to carry out the valuation agreed to in the July 2008 Agreement; that Respondent\u2019s rejection of the Credit Suisse valuation was groundless; and that the TTN valued the wrong asset.\n\n1008.\n\nRespondent takes the position that the July 2008 Agreement (and Law 26,412) were not parts of the law applicable to the expropriation process and thus are irrelevant to a determination of whether the expropriation was conducted in accordance with the law.\n\n1009.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree with this position. The Tribunal has found that Respondent indirectly expropriated the Airlines by taking over the day-to-day management before it passed Law 26,466 purporting to directly expropriate the shares. In order to determine whether that indirect expropriation was in accordance with the law, it would not be appropriate to have recourse to the Expropriation Law, which was not the process by which Respondent indirectly took the investment. Accordingly, for the determination of whether the indirect expropriation was in accordance with the law, it is necessary to review whether Respondent\u2019s measures following the July 2008 Agreement met the requirements of due process and were in accordance with Argentine law.\n\n1010.\n\nAs an initial matter, Claimants have made out their claim of breach of FET, as it relates to Respondent\u2019s measures following the July 2008 Agreement. In particular, Respondent\u2019s lack of transparency in agreeing to the July 2008 Agreement, passing Law 26,412 which resulted in the TTN applying a valuation methodology that was inconsistent with that agreed to in the July 2008 Agreement and its arbitrary decision to expropriate the investment rather than proceed to a third-party valuation as agreed, have all been found to be a breach of the FET obligations. The Tribunal finds that Respondent\u2019s breach of the FET obligations also meant that the indirect expropriation of the investment was not in accordance with the law. Further, Claimants have demonstrated that, according to Argentine law, the July 2008 Agreement created a vested right to a DCF valuation of their shares, which they had agreed to sell to Respondent and that, as a result, Respondent\u2019s failure to carry out that valuation and instead indirectly expropriate the investment was also not in accordance with the law.\n\n1011.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that Respondent\u2019s expropriation of the shares was not in accordance with the law.\n\n**E. \"Shall in no case be discriminatory\"**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n1012.\n\nClaimants assert that the expropriation of the Airlines was also discriminatory.1252 In support of this argument, Claimants return to many of the allegations that also feature in their FET claims. Claimants submit that other airlines received more favorable treatment in the form of fuel subsidies and approval of new international routes. They also say that their investment in the Airlines was singled out for expropriation because ARSA was the former flag carrier now in foreign hands.\n\nCl. Mem \u00b6\u00b6 406-408; Cl. Reply \u00b6 439.\n\n1013.\n\nRegarding more favorable treatment, Claimants assert that Respondent provided fuel subsidies of between 70 - 100% for flights to Santa Fe to Sol, one of ARSA\u2019s and AUSA\u2019s competitors,1253 and that similar subsidies were not provided to the Airlines despite the fact that the stated purpose of the subsidies was to address the escalating cost of jet fuel and the issues this caused for the airline industry.1254 A second example of alleged discrimination raised by Claimants is evidenced by a 2006 report of the Argentine Chamber of Tourism. That report indicates that the only step taken by Respondent to address the emergency situation in the airline industry was the subsidization of fuel for one of ARSA\u2019s and AUSA\u2019s competitors, Southern Winds, which operated in cooperation with LAFSA.1255 This report criticizes the Government for using public funds to assist one carrier and not others.\n\nC-191.\n\nCl.

Claimants did not provide any concrete examples or evidence to support this allegation and its argument in this regard was not developed in its later pleadings. As a result, the Tribunal will not address this particular aspect of Claimants\u2019 discriminatory expropriation claim any further.\n\n1015.\n\nClaimants assert that Respondent\u2019s hostility towards the Airlines under Claimants\u2019 control was due to its desire to \"re-Argentinize\" the Airlines and remove them from the control of a Spanish owner.1256 Claimants submit that \"[a]n expropriation \u2018that singles out aliens generally, or aliens of a particular nationality, or particular aliens, would violate international law.\u2019\"1257 Claimants point to statements made by Mr. Cirielli during his tenure as Undersecretary of Air Transportation as evidence of the purpose behind the expropriation and claim that this was discriminatory.1258\n\nCl.

In reply, Claimants argue that Respondent failed to increase airfares despite repeated requests, that this refusal resulted in the financial strangulation of the Airlines. Further, Claimants submit that LAN could not be directly compared to ARSA and AUSA because it proposed air services only with respect to the busiest and most profitable routes. Claimants also note that LAN registered a positive net income in 2008, but that its income was negative from 2005 to 2007.1262\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 440.\n\n1018.\n\nIn reply to Respondent\u2019s position that Claimants could and should have made their discrimination arguments in the Argentine courts, Claimants say that Interinvest did participate in the domestic expropriation proceedings and challenged Government of Argentina\u2019s allegations and valuation.1263\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 441.\n\n**2. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1019.\n\nIn analyzing whether the expropriations were unlawful because they were discriminatory, the Tribunal must focus on the expropriations themselves and the evidence surrounding them. Claimants\u2019 arguments that Respondent discriminated against them in providing subsidies to competitors but not the Airlines relate to measures found not to have been linked to the expropriation of the investment.1264 In order to make out this element of their claim, Claimants must demonstrate that Respondent expropriated their investment in a discriminatory manner. Discrimination requires differential treatment of Claimants\u2019 investment from other similar investments in like circumstances.\n\nNee Section X, above.\n\n1020.\n\nAs has been discussed in detail above,1265 Claimants have failed to demonstrate that Mr. Cirielli\u2019s and other individual government members\u2019 statements about the alleged goal of \"re-Argentinizing\" the Airlines led to discriminatory treatment that was unfair or inequitable. Further, Claimants have not demonstrated that any of the government members alleged to have demanded the re-Argentinization of the Airlines were involved in or had any influence on Respondent\u2019s decision to expropriate. Claimants have failed to prove that their investment was expropriated because it was owned by foreigners.\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6693 to 706.\n\n1021.\n\nFurther, Claimants did not provide evidence of other similar investors in like circumstances whose investments were not expropriated. The evidence indicates that Claimants\u2019 investment was expropriated because its continued operation by Respondent would allow Government of Argentina to fulfil the public interest of connectivity.\n\n1022.\n\nAs set out above, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent\u2019s argument that an investment\u2019s failure to participate in the local expropriation proceedings affects the admissibility of the claims under the Treaty.\n\n**F. \"Adequate compensation\"**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n1023.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that Argentina did not pay Claimants when it expropriated the Airlines in December 2008. Rather, they dispute whether compensation was in fact owed to Claimants for the Airlines.\n\n1024.\n\nClaimants assert that Respondent did not pay Claimants \"appropriate compensation, without undue delay and in freely convertible currency\" as required by Article V of the Treaty. Claimants cite the following facts in support of their assertion that they were owed more than ARS 1 for the Airlines:\n\n(a) Just before the Government of Argentina started the process of creeping expropriation (in October 2004) and breaches of fair and equitable treatment (in September 2002), the Airlines generated net income of USD 47 million (in 2003) and USD 44 million (in 2004).1266\n\n(b) An advisor to the Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Vazquez, offered to buy the Airlines in May 2008 for USD 150 million. Claimants rejected this offer, because they considered it too low.1267\n\n(c) The valuations of Deloitte, Morgan Stanley, and PricewaterhouseCoopers for AUSA alone, done as a result of the May 2008 Agreement, averaged USD 450 million.1268\n\n(d) Claimants further allege that if Respondent had complied with the May 2008 Agreement and its option to purchase 15% of ARSA under the 2006 Agreement, it would have had to make a capital contribution in ARSA of at least USD 75 million (which is 15% of USD 450 million, which is the average valuation made by the three independent valuators under the May 2008 Agreement).1269\n\n(e) In October 2008, Credit Suisse valued the Airlines at between USD 330 and USD 540 million.1270\n\nCl.

Mem. \u00b6412.\n\n1026.\n\nMoreover, Claimants assert that, in fact, Argentina did attribute a positive value to Claimants\u2019 expropriated investment, as judged by its behavior. Claimants argue that the facts demonstrate that the Airlines could not have had a negative value because, in that situation, Claimants would not have wanted to keep the investment (but they did) and no rational government would be keen to take it (as Argentina was).1274 Again, Claimants assert that in April 2008 it offered (through Mr. Vazquez) USD 150 million for the purchase of the Airlines. They also note that in November 2008, Respondent valued AUSA at USD 79.9 million, and that in February 2009 it offered Claimants compensation of USD 150 million \u2018to solve the problem of the expropriation.\u20191275\n\nCl.

PHB \u00b6163.\n\n1027.\n\nAccordingly, Claimants submit that Respondent has not paid appropriate compensation for the shares of the Airlines, which it formally expropriated in 2008.\n\n1028.\n\nRespondent argues, on the other hand, that under international law, there are circumstances in which expropriation may be lawful even when the amount of compensation to be paid is zero.1276 Respondent argues that the circumstances of this case make it appropriate for Claimants not to receive any compensation for their shares in the Airlines because appropriate compensation must reflect the market value of the expropriated asset.1277 Respondent relies on *Biwater Gauff* v. *Tanzania* for the proposition that a company may have negative shareholders\u2019 equity at the time of expropriation and in those cases, the appropriate compensation is zero.1278\n\nResp.

In these circumstances, Respondent says that the appropriate compensation was zero.1280 It also notes that Claimants did not challenge the appraisal submitted by the TTN in the expropriation proceedings, nor did they exercise their right to submit an appraisal of their own or, alternatively, challenge the valuation of the TTN.1281\n\nResp.

They did not consistently apply the DCF method; the TTN lacked the technical know-how to assess the value of a going concern and, as a result, valued the Airlines\u2019 assets and liabilities rather than their shares; and the TTN is not an independent third party, but rather a public agency whose members are all appointed by the Executive.1285 Claimants argue that the valuation done by SEPI in 2001 is of little to no use in determining the value of the Airlines seven years later and that the date of valuation should be the date closest to the date of the award.1286 In reply to the suggestion that Claimants should have presented its own valuation expert in the domestic court proceedings, Claimants submit that Interinvest sought to suspend the domestic proceedings which overlapped with this arbitration for good and justified reasons.1287\n\nCl.

Rej. \u00b6761.\n\nResp. Rej. \u00b6762.\n\n**2. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n1033.\n\nArticle V of the Treaty and customary international law both require Respondent to pay prompt, adequate and effective compensation when an investment is expropriated. Tribunals have consistently concluded that adequate compensation is the fair market value of the investment immediately before the expropriation was known, i.e. the value of the investment unaffected by the State\u2019s decision to expropriate. As conveniently summarized in the World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment:\n\n1. A State may not expropriate or otherwise take in whole or in part a foreign private investment in its territory, or take measures which have similar effects, except where this is done in accordance with applicable legal procedures, in pursuance in good faith of a public purpose, without discrimination on the basis of nationality and against the payment of appropriate compensation.\n\n2. Compensation for a specific investment taken by the State will, according to the details provided below, be deemed \"appropriate\" if it is adequate, effective and prompt.\n\n3. Compensation will be deemed \"adequate\" if it is based on the fair market value of the taken asset as such value is determined immediately before the time at which the taking occurred or the decision to take the asset became publicly known.\n\n4. Determination of the \"fair market value\" will be acceptable if conducted according to a method agreed by the State and the foreign investor (hereinafter referred to as the parties) or by a tribunal or another body designated by the parties.\n\n5. In the absence of a determination agreed by, or based on the agreement of, the parties, the fair market value will be acceptable if determined by the State according to reasonable criteria related to the market value of the investment, i.e., in an amount that a willing buyer would normally pay to a willing seller after taking into account the nature of the investment, the circumstances in which it would operate in the future and its specific characteristics, including the period in which it lias been in existence, the proportion of tangible assets in the total investment and other relevant factors pertinent to the specific circumstances of each case.1290\n\nWorld Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment, Article IV. RA 481.\n\n1034.\n\nRespondent has argued that it paid adequate compensation by providing a representative ARS 1 for the shares of Interinvest because the investment was loss-making at the time of expropriation and that, as a result, the shareholders\u2019 equity had a negative valuation. Respondent has also argued that ARS 1 was adequate compensation, because that was the valuation attributed to the Airlines by SEPI when it sold the shares of Interinvest to Air Comet in 2001.\n\n1035.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the relevant time period for determining whether the compensation paid for the expropriation of an investment is adequate is immediately before the taking or immediately before the taking became known. Accordingly, the valuation of the Airlines\u2019 shares in 2001 is irrelevant to the amount of compensation to be paid for the taking of those shares by Respondent in 2008.\n\n1036.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that there are circumstances in which no compensation can be adequate compensation for an expropriation. This may be the case when an investment is loss-making and no longer a going concern. In these circumstances, the State can demonstrate that the investor did not suffer a financial loss as a result of the taking. In this case, had the formal expropriation of the Airlines\u2019 shares in December 2008 been the first measure taken by the Respondent and had the Respondent otherwise treated the investment fairly and equitably, it is possible that adequate compensation for the shares may have been ARS 1. However, in the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent paid adequate compensation for the taking of Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n1037.\n\nIn this case, there was a lengthy and politically-charged relationship between Claimants, their investment and Respondent that preceded Respondent\u2019s decision to directly expropriate the investment. The Tribunal has dismissed many of Claimants\u2019 claims with respect to the measures that pre-dated the July 2008 Agreement. However, the Tribunal has found that the Parties entered into that binding agreement, the purpose of which was to provide for Respondent to purchase the Airlines\u2019 shares at a price to be determined by a particular valuation technique.\n\n1038.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, the July 2008 Agreement coincides with the time at which the decision to take the asset became publicly known. In addition, the July 2008 Agreement recorded the method agreed by Government of Argentina and the investor to determine the fair market value of the investment. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, whether either Credit Suisse or the TTN conducted its respective DCF valuation in accordance with the July 2008 Agreement is irrelevant for the determination of whether adequate compensation was paid by Respondent. The July 2008 Agreement provided for an independent, third party valuation in the event that the Parties\u2019 respective valuations yielded different results and the Parties could not agree to a value. It was not open to Respondent to unilaterally change the agreed valuation method.\n\n1039.\n\nHad Respondent not breached the July 2008 Agreement and had the DCF analysis described in that agreement been conducted by a third independent valuator as agreed, the resulting valuation would have represented adequate compensation for the taking pursuant to the Treaty. This is because in these circumstances the Parties had agreed to the method for determining the fair market value of the investment being expropriated. In refusing to complete that valuation and instead proceeding to a formal expropriation on a different valuation methodology, Respondent failed to provide adequate compensation for the taking of the investment.\n\n**G. Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions on Unlawful Expropriation**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n1040.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the expropriation of the Airlines was unlawful, as that taking was not in accordance with the law and Respondent failed to pay adequate compensation.\n\n**XIII. THE DEFENSE OF NECESSITY**\n----------------------------------\n\n1041.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal were to find that Respondent breached the Treaty regarding its measures related to airfare increases, Respondent invokes the defense of necessity.1291 Respondent asserts that \"the crisis that hit Argentina in late 2001 amounts to a state of necessity precluding any potential international responsibility in relation to the increase in airfares granted to the airlines.\"1292 It argues that the Argentine Republic was forced to act as it did because it was the only way to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril, and it notes that all of the emergency measures were taken to the benefit of the commercial air sector.1293 Respondent submits that if the measures were not sufficient, as alleged by Claimants, it is entitled to rely on the defense of necessity to preclude any wrongfulness or liability under the Treaty with respect to the sufficiency of the measures granting airfare increases.1294\n\nResp.

CM \u00b6\u00b6 861 -866.\n\n1042.\n\nRespondent further argues that the emergency measures it adopted were critical to overcoming the crisis and regaining economic, social, political and institutional normalcy. Specifically, Respondent notes that the adoption of Emergency Law No. 25,561 and Presidential Decrees No. 1654/02 and 1012/06 and the grant of other benefits to Argentine airlines was \"the best that could be done to preserve the air transport public service without affecting other essential interests of the State, which were also at stake, in a historical context of acute national emergency.1295\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6873-875.\n\n1043.\n\nFor their part, Claimants argue that Argentina\u2019s refusal to grant airfare increases, to which the Airlines were legally entitled in the period between September 2002 and December 2008 and especially after 2004 and up to the formal expropriation in 2008, bears no logical or temporal connection with the 2001 economic crisis.1296\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6560.\n\n1044.\n\nBoth Parties agree that the standard for Respondent\u2019s necessity defense is Article 25 of the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility.1297 Article 25 provides as follows:\n\n1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:\n\n(a) is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and eminent peril; and\n\n(b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.\n\n2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if: \u2019\n\n(a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or\n\n(b) the State lias contributed to the situation of necessity.1298\n\n*See* Resp.

A/56/10 (2001), (hereinafter \"ILC Articles on State Responsibility & Commentary\"): C-925.\n\n1045.\n\nThe Parties each made detailed submissions on the applicability of the defense of necessity in the circumstances of the instant case and addressed each of the four components of the defense set out in Article 25 of the International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility.1299 Claimants also argued that, unlike other investment treaties entered into by Respondent, which formed the basis of other tribunals\u2019 findings that Argentina was entitled to rely on the defense of necessity, the Treaty has no analogous provision and thus the defense is unavailable.\n\n*See* Resp.

As Respondent only raises the defense of necessity in the event that the claim relating to the airfare increase was accepted, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to consider Respondent\u2019s defense of necessity or Claimants\u2019 specific arguments opposing that defense.\n\n**XIV. RESPONDENT\u2019S COUNTERCLAIM**\n----------------------------------\n\n1047.\n\nWhile maintaining its objections to jurisdiction and reserving its rights with respect to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction over Claimants\u2019 claims, Respondent submitted a Counterclaim seeking US $1,636,600.000 in damages for what it says were the losses it suffered because of the poor state of the Airlines at the time of expropriation.1300 Claimants submit that the alleged Counterclaim was vague and unsubstantiated and that it did not meet even the minimum requirements to constitute a claim to which they could properly respond. As a result, Claimants submit that the Counterclaim should be dismissed.1301\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 878 and 907.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6591 and 609.\n\n1048.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants\u2019 submission that Respondent\u2019s Cunterclaim should be dismissed.\n\n**A. Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n1049.\n\nRespondent submits that the rules applicable to its Counterclaim are Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 40. Article 46 of the Convention provides:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n1050.\n\nRespondent says that Article 46 of the Convention obliges an ICSID tribunal \"to determine a counter-claim filed by one party provided that it arises directly out of the subject matter of the dispute, is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"1302\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 880.\n\n1051.\n\nWhile Claimants agree that this article addresses counterclaims, they submit that Respondent\u2019s damages claim is not a counterclaim, which is required to \"be independent of the principal claim in so far as it constitutes a separate \u2018claim\u2019, that is to say an autonomous legal act the object of which is to submit a new claim[\u2026]\"1303 As such, Claimants submit that the Counterclaim fails to meet the threshold requirement in Article 46. Claimants say that Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim is more appropriately viewed as a set of arguments related to the valuation of the expropriated Airlines and a defense against Claimants\u2019 claims.1304\n\nCl.

Reply \u00b6\u00b6597 - 600.\n\n1052.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Respondent indicates that Claimants\u2019 interpretation of the requirement that counterclaims \"aris[e] directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute\" is inconsistent with a requirement that a counterclaim be independent of the principal claim.1305 Respondent also makes further submissions as to how its Counterclaim is a separate claim - the claim for damages goes beyond the value of the expropriated shares.1306 Respondent clarifies that the basis for its Counterclaim is \"article 46 of the ICSID Convention, Rule 40 of the Arbitration Rules and articles X.l and X.5 of the BIT, which grant the Tribunal jurisdiction to consider counterclaims \u2018in connection with investments\u2019, in accordance with the BIT, Argentine law and international law.\"1307\n\nResp.

Rej. \u00b6839.\n\n1053.\n\nThe Parties agree that Article 46 obliges the Tribunal to \"determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\" Accordingly, if Respondent establishes that (1 it has a counterclaim, (2) arising directly out of the subject matter of the dispute that is (3) within the scope of consent of the parties and otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre, the Tribunal agrees that it is obliged to determine Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim. However, if Respondent fails to establish any of these three requirements, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to resolve Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim.\n\n1054.\n\nRespondent notes that Arbitration Rule 40 also governs counterclaims and restates the requirements set forth in Article 46 of the ICSID Convention.1308 Rule 40 provides:\n\n(1 Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n(2) An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the reply and a counterclaim no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding.\n\n(3) The Tribunal shall fix a time limit within which the party against which an ancillary claim is presented may file its observations thereon.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 882.\n\n1055.\n\nRespondent takes the position that since its Counterclaim is included in its Counter Memorial filed in the case, it has fulfilled the temporal requirement contained in Rule 40.1309 Claimants respond that since Respondent has failed to even identify the legal cause of action for its Counterclaim, there is no claim to which to apply the provisions of the ICSID Convention or Rules.1310 Claimants elaborate that by not even identifying the legal cause of action for its claim, Respondent has failed to present any such claim as required by Rule 40.1311\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 882 - 883. The Tribunal notes that Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder did contain some vague references to \"the obligation not to harm and the responsibility for any damage caused\" being fundamental principles of law and to Article 1109 of the Argentine Civil Code, which imposes a duty to repair harm caused by fault or negligence. See Resp. Rej. \u00b6 839. However, Respondent did not indicate how those legal obligations related to Claimants or Interinvest, on what basis any such duties would be owed to Respondent or the basis on which causation could be shown. Even if these later formulations of a potential legal dispute had been elaborated, the Tribunal notes that these were not presented in time to meet the temporal requirement of Rule 40.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6\u00b6599 -605.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 605.\n\n1056.\n\nRespondent relies on these provisions of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules and submits that the parties are entitled to present ancillary claims, including counterclaims and that ICSID tribunals must determine such claims if all applicable conditions are met.1312 Claimants say that in addition to having to prove a legal basis for its claim, Respondent must also substantively prove and support its Counterclaim. Claimants argue that \"the gist of the counterclaim is to total two sums: (i) the Argentine Airlines\u2019 non-operating liabilities as of December 2008, and (ii) their expected losses from December 2008 onward.\"1313\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 884.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6 606.\n\n1057.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal agrees that the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules provide a procedural basis and, in fact, an obligation for the Tribunal to decide Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim if Respondent\u2019s claim meets the requirements in the applicable provisions. Respondent does not seem to argue that these provisions provide the legal basis for its Counterclaims, as it acknowledges that the counterclaim must be based on the substantive law that applies to the dispute.\n\n1058.\n\nRespondent cites the provisions of Article X.5 of the Treaty and submits that the counterclaim, like the Claimants\u2019 claim, must be decided on the basis of the Treaty and any other treaties in force between Argentina and Spain; Argentine law, including its norms of private international law; and the general principles of international law.1314 The Tribunal agrees with this submission as the proper construction of the provisions of the Treaty and the ICSID Convention. Article 46 of the Convention only permits a tribunal to determine counterclaims that \"are within the scope of the consent of the parties.\" The consent of the parties arises from the Treaty. Thus, the determination of whether the claims are within the scope of that consent requires that they arise from the Treaty and be disputes over which the parties granted their consent to ICSID arbitration. Respondent relies on the Decision on Jurisdiction as the basis for its argument that its Counterclaim falls within the scope of the consent of the parties.1315\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6885-886.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6887 -889.\n\n**B. Is Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim a Claim?**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n1059.\n\nAs noted above, Article 46 of the ICSID Convention applies to \"any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims\" and any such counterclaim must substantively be based on the provisions of the Treaty. The provision relates both to incidental or additional claims and counterclaims. Thus, the first requirement is that Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim be a counterclaim.\n\n1060.\n\nRespondent submits that its Counterclaim \"is based on the damage it suffered and which resulted from Claimants\u2019 administration of the Argentine Airlines and the state of such companies as a consequence of such administration.\"1316 Claimants submit that this is not a counterclaim because, in order to be a counterclaim, it must be \"an autonomous legal act the object of which is to submit a new claim to the Court.\"1317 Claimants submit that the counterclaim is really a defense against Claimants\u2019 compensation claim for expropriation and other Treaty breaches and not a separate claim.1318\n\nResp.

Reply \u00b6 598.\n\n1061.\n\nIn its Counter Memorial, Respondent does not set out a legal basis for its Counterclaim. Other than the general reference above to Article X.5 and the statement that the counterclaim must be based on the Treaty, Respondent does not cite any obligations contained in the Treaty (or other treaties, Argentine law or international law referenced as potential sources of substantive law contained in the Treaty) that were allegedly breached by Claimants.1319 Instead, Respondent refers to the Tribunal\u2019s characterization of Claimants\u2019 claims in the Decision on Jurisdiction as the basis for its argument that the counterclaim meets the relevant requirements.\n\n*See* note 1309, above.\n\n1062.\n\nRespondent summarizes the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction as having been asserted \"on the basis of a dispute whose purpose would be: i) Respondent\u2019s \u2018regulatory treatment\u2019 \u2018of Claimants\u2019 investments in the Argentine Airlines and Interinvest,\u2019 and ii) \u2018the valuation of Interinvest\u2019s shares in the Argentine Airlines.\u2019\"1320 Respondent also suggests that \"the Tribunal concluded that the dispute is not limited to claims based on alleged Treaty violations, but also extends to contract issues and matters of domestic law.\"1321 Leaving aside the accuracy of Respondent\u2019s summary of the Decision on Jurisdiction, Respondent did not suggest that it had a counterclaim independent of the claims submitted by Claimants and over which the Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 887 -889.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6889.\n\n1063.\n\nRespondent did not present its Counterclaim as a claim that was based on specific provisions of the Treaty and that would fall within the scope of the jurisdiction as found by the Tribunal. Respondent instead relies upon its summary of the Decision on Jurisdiction to submit that because:\n\n...Claimants seek damages allegedly arising out of the treatment received during their administration of the Argentine Airlines and Argentina seeks damages arising out of that administration, the relationship between the claim and counter-claim is direct. They are two sides of the coin, two competing claims based on the same facts : the administration of the Argentine Airlines by the Marsans Group. [Emphasis added]\n\n1064.\n\nAccording to this submission, Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim is based on the treatment received by Claimants during their administration of the Airlines. While the Treaty imposes obligations on the States party to the Treaty to accord certain treatment to investments made by investors, it does not impose reciprocal obligations on investments or investors. Respondent has not pointed to any right that it has under the Treaty to certain treatment by an investment or an investor. Similarly, in its Counter Memorial, Respondent pointed to no other right under Argentine law or general principles of international law on which it based its Counterclaim.\n\n1065.\n\nIn its submissions regarding whether its Counterclaim was \"otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre\", Respondent noted that in order to meet this requirement the counterclaim must involve \"a legal dispute\".1322 Paragraph 26 of the Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention addresses this fundamental jurisdictional requirement:1323\n\n26. Article 25(1 requires that the dispute must be a \"legal dispute arising directly out of an investment.\" The expression \"legal dispute\" lias been used to make clear that while conflicts of rights are within the jurisdiction of the Centre, mere conflicts of interests are not. The dispute must concern the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation, or the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for breach of a legal obligation. [Emphasis added]\n\nResp. CM \u00b6894.\n\nRA - 440.\n\n1066.\n\nThus, in order to come within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for determination, Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim must meet this threshold; it must concern the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation (and be a dispute arising directly out of an investment). Again, in its Counter Memorial, Respondent did not identify any legal right or obligation on which it relied for its Counterclaim. In its Rejoinder, Respondent focuses again on the relationship of the matters in the counterclaim to the investment as the basis for jurisdiction *ratione materiae,1324* but does not address a legal basis for its claim based on the Treaty. At best, Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim is a defense to Claimants\u2019 claims for the damages arising from Respondent\u2019s alleged breaches of the Treaty. As concluded by the *Hamester* tribunal, \"in the absence of any submissions on the nature of the Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim under the BIT, the Tribunal is unable to analyse whether it is capable, in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, of falling within the parties\u2019 scope of consent.\"1325 Argentina\u2019s Counterclaim suffers the same deficiencies and precludes an analysis of whether its claims fall within the scope of consent.\n\nResp.

Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion with respect to Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1067.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim.\n\n**XV. DAMAGES**\n---------------\n\n1068.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that Respondent is liable for the following breaches of the Treaty:\n\n(a) The obligations of fair and equitable treatment and not to take unjustified or discriminatory measures, by breaching the July 2008 Agreement and by its nontransparent and arbitrary behavior following the signing of that agreement; and\n\n(b) Unlawful expropriation for its taking of the Airlines \"not in accordance with the law\" and without payment of appropriate compensation.\n\n1069.\n\nOf relevance to the damages assessment, Claimants have failed to prove that the facts related to the Airfare Squeeze amounted to a breach of the Treaty.\n\n1070.\n\nClaimants rely upon their valuation experts to quantify their damages claims. They instructed the experts to provide their opinion on the damages flowing from the following measures, which Claimants alleged to be unlawful: the Airfare Squeeze and the expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment. Claimants alleged breaches of a number of treaty provisions in relation to the same measures, but the measure of damages claimed does not depend upon the particular provision of the Treaty alleged to have been breached. Therefore, their approach to damages related to the particular measures and was independent from the legal theories upon which those measures were said to be unlawful. However, Claimants submitted that the timing of the assessment of damages could vary depending on the Tribunal\u2019s findings with respect to the lawfulness of the expropriation. In support of their damages claims, Claimants submitted evidence of the alleged historical losses related to the Airfare Squeeze and the value of the Airlines in 2008, 2010 and 2013.\n\n1071.\n\nAt the hearing and in their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants\u2019 request for damages is structured upon the Tribunal\u2019s finding one of three potential \"Scenarios\" of liability under the Treaty.\n\n(a) Scenario 1 envisions that this Tribunal would find that Respondent\u2019s formal expropriation of the Airlines was lawful and that there were no Treaty breaches prior to the Airlines\u2019 nationalization. In this case, Respondent would owe Claimants compensation for the lawful expropriation of the Airlines in the middle of 2008.1326 Claimants calculate this amount at USD 445 million, based on the \"as is\" value of AUSA,1327 as of January 1, 2008, before interest as of the date of this Award.1328\n\n(b) Scenario 2 envisions that this Tribunal would find that Respondent\u2019s formal expropriation was lawful, but that Respondent breached the Treaty prior to the expropriation.1329 Specifically, Claimants point to the \"airfare squeeze\" that preceded formal expropriation.1330 In this case, Respondent would owe USD 625 million, measured as the as-is value of AUSA plus damages from the airfare squeeze in the amount of USD 268 million, before interest as of the date of the Award.1331\n\n(c) Scenario 3 envisions that this Tribunal would find that Respondent\u2019s formal expropriation was unlawful, and that Respondent also breached the Treaty prior to the expropriation. Under this scenario, the Tribunal would value the Airlines as of today, as if Claimants continued to operate them.1332 The calculation for this Scenario 3 is USD 1.3357 billion for AUSA and USD 254.3 million for ARSA, for a total of USD 1.59 billion calculated with interest through July 31, 2013.1333\n\nCl.

Claimants\u2019 calculations have varied during the course of their pleadings and during the hearing. *See, e.g..* Claimants\u2019 Closing, Transcript p. 1677-1678.\n\nClaimants also include interest calculations including two different levels of interest on the two different 2008 valuations provided, the average of the contemporaneous third party valuations and CL\u2019s AUSA valuation: at an interest rate of LIBOR + 2%, or at an interest rate of 8.75%. *See* Cl.

In this case, there are three components to Claimants\u2019 damages calculation: \u00b6 losses sustained by the Airlines between 2002-2008 due to the unfairly low airfares; 2) the but-for cash flows from the Airlines between 2009 and 2010; and 3) expected cash-flows from 2010 and onward. Claimants\u2019 calculation here is a date-of-award calculation, and no pre-award interest is needed. Claimants\u2019 Closing, Transcript p. 1694.\n\n1072.\n\nRespondent took issue with Claimants\u2019 Scenarios arguing that they were new valuation methods that were not supported by Claimants\u2019 experts.1334\n\n*See, for example,* Resp. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 266 - 270.\n\n1073.\n\nIn response to this particular criticism, Claimants submit that there is no requirement at international law that it present a litigation valuation by a party-retained expert. Claimants submit that \"true third-party contemporaneous non-litigation valuations, as exist here, are widely considered to be the best and most reliable indicators of value.\"1335\n\n*See* Cl. PHB note 307.\n\n1074.\n\nIn light of the fact that none of the various scenarios presented by Claimants precisely reflects the Tribunal\u2019s liability findings, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to review in detail all three scenarios presented. The Tribunal notes that Scenario 1 is the most suitable starting point, as it proposes valuations not based on the Airfare Squeeze. The specifics of the 2008 valuations and the criticisms of those valuations by Respondent will be discussed further below in the context of the evidence on damages. The Tribunal\u2019s damages analysis will look first to the legal basis for damages and then turn to the evidence submitted by Claimants to support those damages claims.\n\n**A. Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n1075.\n\nClaimants submit that the remedy for unlawful expropriation is not found in the Treaty; instead it is found in customary international law and is usually referred to as \"damages\" or \"reparation\".1336 Claimants argue that when a State lawfully expropriates an investor\u2019s property, it must pay compensation, usually described as appropriate or adequate compensation payable without undue delay as provided by the Treaty. However, Claimants submit that when an investment is unlawfully expropriated, customary international law principles apply to the amount of compensation to be paid. Claimants say that customary international law requires the State to pay damages that restore the investor to the position that it would have been in but for the unlawful acts. Claimants submit that these damages include either restitution in kind or its monetary equivalent and any additional loss that flows from the breach that has been proven to have been suffered by the investor.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6503.\n\n1076.\n\nClaimants rely on the oft-cited articulation of reparation as a principle of customary international law found in the *Chorzow Factory* case:\n\nThe essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act - a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by decisions of arbitral tribunals - is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all of the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\n\n\u2026\n\nIt follows that the compensation due to the German Government is not necessarily limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession, plus interest to the day of payment. This limitation would only be admissible if the Polish Government had had the right to expropriate.\n\n\u2026\n\nRestitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it.1337\n\n*Factory at Chorzow* Case, PCIJ 1928, Ser. A, No 17 at 47. C- 363.\n\n1077.\n\nClaimants also rely upon the 2001 Draft Articles on State Responsibility of the International Law Commission (\"ILC Articles\"), which address the elements of internationally wrongful acts of States, attribution and the legal consequences of those acts. Article 31 contains the general principle that a State must make reparation:\n\n*Article 31*\n\n*Reparation*\n\n1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.\n\n1078.\n\nChapter II of the ILC Articles deal with reparation for injury and Claimants have specifically invoked Articles 35 and 36 in support of their claim for damages. The Tribunal considers it useful to set out here the text of Articles 34 through 36:\n\n*Chapter 11*\n\n*Reparation for Injury*\n\n*Article 34*\n\n*Forms of reparation*\n\nFull reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act shall take the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either singly or in combination, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\n\n*Article 35*\n\n*Restitution*\n\nA State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to make restitution, that is, to re-establish the situation which existed before the wrongful act was committed, provided and to the extent that restitution:\n\n(a) is not materially impossible;\n\n(b) does not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from restitution instead of compensation.\n\n*Article 36*\n\n*Compensation*\n\n1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution.\n\n2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\n\n1079.\n\nRespondent submits that the compensation standard for lawful expropriation and unlawful expropriation (if unlawful for failure to pay compensation) is the same and is the one provided for by the Treaty.1338 With respect to compensation for other Treaty breaches or expropriation that is unlawful for reasons unrelated to compensation, Respondent agrees that the principles of customary international law apply but disputes that those principles arise from either the *Chorzow Factory* case or the ILC Articles.1339 Respondent submits that customary international law \"requires evidence of a general practice of the States with *opinio* iuris.\"1340 Respondent says that neither the *Chorzow* decision nor the Draft Articles on State Responsibility are sources of international law *per se.1341*\n\nResp.

CM \u00b6910.\n\n1080.\n\nRespondent argues that international customary law as it relates to compensation for expropriation is reflected in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations with 120 votes in favor.1342 Article II(2)(c) provides:\n\nEach State lias the right [t]o nationalize, expropriate or transfer ownership of foreign property, in which case appropriate compensation should be paid by the State adopting such measures, taking into account its relevant laws and regulations and all circumstances that the State considers pertinent.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6911 citing UN Resolution 3281 (XXIX). AL RA 338.\n\n1081.\n\nBased on this, Respondent submits that the applicable principle evidenced by the practice of States accepted as law is that of \"appropriate\" or \"fair\" compensation.1343\n\nResp. CM \u00b6911.\n\n1082.\n\nFurther, Respondent states that the ILC Articles are not *prima facie* applicable *per se* to any compensation for damage sustained by a person or entity other than a State.1344 Respondent relies on the ILC\u2019s Report commentary to Article 28, which states that \"[Part Two] does not apply to obligations of reparation to the extent that these arise towards or are invoked by a person or entity other than a State.\" Respondent accepts that \"certain general principles of international customary law may be derived from the [ILC Articles]\" but submits that they are not fully applicable to this case.1345\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 912.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6 912.\n\n1083.\n\nRespondent notes that the ILC considered the significance of proportionality of compensation in relation to damage caused, which Respondent says impacts the principle of full reparation allegedly arising from or as articulated in the *Chorzow* case. Respondent cites the ILC\u2019s Report as it relates to Article 34 of the ILC Articles:\n\nConcerns have sometimes been expressed that the principle of full reparation may lead to disproportionate and even crippling requirements so far as the responsible State is concerned. The issue is whether the principle of proportionality should be articulated as an aspect of the obligation to make full reparation. In these articles, proportionality is addressed in the context of each form of reparation, taking into account its specific character. Thus restitution is excluded if it would involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit gained by the injured State or other party. Compensation is limited to damage actually suffered as a result of the internationally wrongful act, and excludes damage which is indirect or remote. Satisfaction must \"not be out of proportion to the injury\". Thus, each of the forms of reparation takes such considerations into account.1346\n\nResp.

Doc A/56/10 (2001) - AL RA 69.\n\n1084.\n\nRespondent submits that the general principles that must govern the quantification of damages in this case are the specific content of the primary obligations allegedly breached, the behavior of both parties, and the achievement of an equitable outcome.1347 Respondent says that the relevant criteria for fair compensation set forth by the general principles of international law are the following:\n\n\u2022 There must be a close causal link between the damage sustained by the Claimant and the violation of international law;\n\n\u2022 Compensation must be reasonable;\n\n\u2022 The damage must be certain, not hypothetical or vague;\n\n\u2022 Compensation must only cover the period during which the wrongful act took place;\n\n\u2022 The investor is under an obligation to mitigate the damage;\n\n\u2022 The tribunal must not run the risk of compensating the same damage twice; and\n\n\u2022 The investor must prove the causal link, the amount of the damages sought and\n\n\u2022 The fact that damages are recoverable in accordance with the applicable law.1348\n\n[Footnotes with citations omitted]\n\nResp.

Claimants submit that their damages claim is consistent with these principles.1350 Claimants maintain that the standard of compensation in international law for unlawful expropriation is \"full reparation\" measured as the higher of the value of the expropriated asset on the date of the taking or date of the award.1351 Claimants say that this theory is sound because it may be necessary to account for post-expropriation events that would have accrued to a claimant\u2019s benefit in absence of the unlawful taking.1352 Further, Claimants submit that \"current value is necessary as an alternative to restitution, since if the State refuses to restore the expropriated asset in response to an arbitral award to that effect, the investor should receive the asset\u2019s value as of the date of the State\u2019s refusal.\"1353\n\nCl.

Reply \u00b6 619.\n\n1088.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties are in substantial agreement regarding the principles applicable to damages in international law with one significant exception. Respondent takes the position that compensation for expropriation, whether lawful or unlawful because of a failure to pay adequate compensation at the time of taking, is governed by the appropriate compensation standard in the Treaty. With respect to all other breaches, Respondent seems to argue that fair compensation must be paid with regard to a number of criteria, but denies that there is a general principle of customary international law to provide full reparation in these circumstances. Respondent does not seem to dispute that the ILC Articles in general codify principles of international law, including the obligation for a State to make full reparation in the event of a breach of an international obligation. Instead, Respondent submits that that because of the scope of the ILC Articles, the obligation to make reparation is only owed to other States. Respondent also takes the position that the *Chorzow Factory* case cannot be used on its own as a source of customary international law, as customary international law requires *opinio iuris.*\n\n1089.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept these technical objections. The *Chorzow Factory* case is not the source of the customary international law principle of full reparation, but the tribunal in that case determined that that principle was one that had been established by international practice. The adoption of the ILC Articles, which clearly articulate a State\u2019s obligation to provide full reparation in the event of a breach of an international obligation, and the practice of States in paying reparations in these circumstances, suggest that States accept this obligation. This is not to say that the general principle of international law that a State that has been found to have breached an international obligation must make full reparation for any damages caused by its breach has any impact on a State\u2019s right to expropriate a foreigner\u2019s property at international law. A State\u2019s right to do so exists at international law and, so long as the property is lawfully expropriated, there is an obligation to compensate the owner, but not to make full reparation. The State\u2019s obligation to make full reparation is related to its breach of international law. Respondent\u2019s concerns about the obligation to make full reparation leading to disproportionate compensation are dealt with in the limiting factors that the Parties agree are principles relating to damages in international law. With respect to compensation, the ILC noted that \"[c]ompensation is limited to damage actually suffered as a result of the internationally wrongful act, and excludes damage which is indirect or remote.\" This is consistent with Respondent\u2019s submissions on the \"requirements\" before damages can be awarded, as set out above.\n\n1090.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the principle of full reparation has been consistently applied by tribunals. For example, the Vivendi *II* tribunal concluded:\n\n...it is generally accepted today that, regardless of the type of investment, and regardless of the nature of the illegitimate measure, the level of damages awarded in international investment arbitration is supposed to be sufficient to compensate the affected party fully and to eliminate the consequences of the state\u2019s action.\n\n1091.\n\nThe Annulment Committee in *Azurix* stated this in slightly different terms:\n\nIt is not in dispute between the parties, nor in the Committee\u2019s view could it seriously be disputed, that the Tribunal had the power in this case to award damages for any loss that the Tribunal found to have been suffered by Azurix as a result of breaches of the BIT for which Argentina was responsible.1355\n\n*Azurix Corp.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12,, Decision of the Application for Annulment, September 1, 2009,\u00b6315.\n\n1092.\n\nAccordingly, international law requires Respondent to make reparation to Claimants for Respondent\u2019s breaches of the Treaty and the Tribunal\u2019s award of damages should seek to put Claimants in the position they would have been in but for Respondent\u2019s breaches. As with any claim, it is for Claimants to prove that the damages suffered were caused by Respondent\u2019s breaches and the quantum of those damages.\n\n**B. Restitution in Kind**\n--------------------------\n\n1093.\n\nAt the hearing and in their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants indicated that their preferred remedy was the \"restitution of their corporate rights in the Argentine Airlines (through Interinvest)\". Claimants said that Respondent did not question their right to restitution and that, as a result, the Tribunal should award it as the primary form of relief. In addition, Claimants suggest that the Tribunal\u2019s award should also include compensation as an alternative, since an award of restitution is not easily enforceable in the event Respondent refuses to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s award.1356\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6 182.\n\n1094.\n\nAlthough Claimants\u2019 request for relief in their Memorial includes a request for an award of \"restitution or the monetary equivalent of all damages caused\",1357 the Tribunal notes that Claimants initially indicated that they were not seeking the return of their corporate rights in this arbitration:\n\nArgentina must, therefore, \"re-establish the situation which existed\" before the wrongful act, that is, before the expropriation, was committed. Since Claimants are **not** requesting restitution in kind of their investment. Argentina must pay the monetary equivalent, that is, in the words of the *Chorzow Factory* case, a sum which would \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\" In addition, Argentina must pay \"damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it. [Emphasis added]1358\n\nCl. Mem \u00b6542(iii).\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6508.\n\n1095.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial does not specifically address Claimants\u2019 request for restitution in kind. Respondent does, in the context of its submissions on the requirement of proportionality of compensation in relation to the damage caused, refer to the principle that restitution is excluded \"if it would involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit gained by the injured State or other party.\"1359\n\nResp. CM. \u00b6 913.\n\n1096.\n\nIn their Reply, for the first time Claimants make clear that they \"seek first and foremost restitution of the corporate rights attached to their shares in the expropriated Argentine Airlines, plus all historical and consequential damages, including interest up to the effective payment of the award.\"1360 Claimants argue that although they still hold legal title to their shares in the Airlines, Respondent confiscated their legal corporate rights attached to those shares. Claimants allege that \"Argentina has not challenged Claimants\u2019 right to restitution of their investment.\"1361\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6610.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6610.\n\n1097.\n\nIn light of the confusion created by the way restitution in kind is addressed in Claimants\u2019 Memorial, the Tribunal is of the view that it was not a fair characterization of Argentina\u2019s position in the Claimants\u2019 Reply to say that it had not challenged Claimants\u2019 right to restitution. In any event, Claimants did not address Argentina\u2019s general argument that the damages awarded, including the possibility of restitution, must be proportionate to the benefit gained by Respondent. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, if Claimants were serious that restitution of their corporate rights was their primary claim for damages, then they were under an obligation to establish that right in the circumstances of this case and demonstrate that such an award was reasonable and proportionate.1362 The Tribunal notes that through the July 2008 Agreement Claimants agreed to sell their shares in the Airlines to Respondent, thereby exiting the market. This indicates Claimants\u2019 acknowledgment that damages are a sufficient remedy.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants\u2019 submissions did not set out a different damages scenario based on the return of the shares to Interinvest, as opposed to the appropriate compensation for the expropriation of those shares. In this case, it would be inconsistent with restitution in kind to award both appropriate compensation for the shares and the return of those shares to Interinvest.\n\n1098.\n\nFurther and in any event, the Tribunal is of the view that, in the circumstances of this case, restitution in kind is neither practical nor practicable. Claimants are in bankruptcy and the Airlines have now been operated by Respondent for a number of years. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses Claimants\u2019 request for restitution in kind and turns now to the assessment of their alternative claim for the monetary equivalent of all damages caused to its investments.\n\n**C. Assessment of Damages**\n----------------------------\n\n1099.\n\nClaimants argued that Respondent\u2019s measures, the Airfare Squeeze and expropriation of their investment, were breaches of the Treaty and caused them damages. The Tribunal has rejected Claimants\u2019 contention that the Airfare Squeeze rose to the level of a Treaty breach. The Tribunal has found a breach of the FET standard related to Respondent\u2019s measures following the July 2008 Agreement and its subsequent breach of that agreement. The Tribunal has also found that Respondent\u2019s expropriation of the Airlines was unlawful.\n\n1100.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that while there were multiple breaches of the Treaty, there was only one set of consequences flowing from those breaches. The Tribunal found that the July 2008 Agreement was a binding agreement in which Respondent agreed to purchase the shares of Interinvest based on an agreed valuation methodology with certain agreed parameters. As has been discussed in detail in earlier sections of this Award, Respondent, after executing the July 2008 Agreement, comported itself in an arbitrary and non-transparent manner and, eventually, refused to carry out the valuation process set out in that agreement. Instead of purchasing the shares as agreed, Respondent unlawfully expropriated those shares and the ownership rights that attached to them. Accordingly, Respondent\u2019s Treaty breaches deprived Claimants of the payment for their shares of Interinvest as determined by the agreed valuation methodology in the July 2008 Agreement. This is the consequence of Respondent\u2019s breach of the FET standard. It is also the consequence of Respondent\u2019s unlawful expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n1101.\n\nAs has been noted above, Claimants provided a simplified summary of their damages submissions based on various possible liability findings. They referred to these as Scenarios 1, 2 and 3.1363 Claimants explained their rationale for presenting multiple damages scenarios: \"we wanted to draw the Tribunal\u2019s attention to how it could reasonably quantify damages based on the existing record regardless of its ultimate determinations on liability.\"1364 Claimants indicated that they wished to avoid a further, separate quantum phase after a full hearing on liability, merits and quantum had already been concluded.1365 In this context, Claimants provided references to evidence in the record of the value of the Airlines in 2008.\n\nClaimants submitted Scenarios 2 and 3 in the event that the Tribunal found that there had been an Airfare Squeeze that amounted to a breach of the Treaty. Since this lias not been proved, these scenarios will not be discussed further.\n\nCl. Closing Argument, Transcript p. 1670:4-7.\n\nCl.

Claimants note that these valuations were performed by Deloitte, Morgan Stanley and PwC in the context of the May 2008 Agreement and that the average valuation of AUSA averaged USD 415 million and for ARSA the average was USD 30 million. Claimants also referred to the valuation prepared by Credit Suisse in the context of the July 2008 Agreement.\n\nCl.

Claimants submit that \"true third-party contemporaneous non-litigation valuations, as exist here, are widely considered to be the best and most reliable indicators of value.\"1370\n\nCl.

Claimants say that Compass Lexecon\u2019s calculation confirms the reliability of the other third-party valuations performed in 2008. Claimants submit that there was a convergence in these valuations, which supports their reliability as evidence of the Airlines\u2019 value in 2008.\n\nC-375, C-376, C-377 and C-201. *Also see* note 389, above.\n\nCl.

Reply note 1017.\n\nCLEX ER3.\n\nAbdala Testimony, Transcript p. 1366.\n\n1106.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the third-party valuations of the Airlines in the record are evidence of the Airlines\u2019 value in 2008. There is no requirement for a claimant to submit an expert valuation prepared for the arbitration in order to found its claim for damages. While expert evidence is often used to support a damages analysis, this is not necessarily a requirement if other reliable evidence exists to support quantification of damages. This case is unusual in that there are a number of contemporaneous valuations in the record. While those valuations were not prepared for the purpose of the arbitration, the Tribunal does not consider that a factor that makes them less reliable indicators of value. In fact, the fact that they were prepared to support arm\u2019s length negotiations for the sale of the Airlines makes them sound indicators of the fair market value in 2008. However, because they were not prepared for the arbitration, the third party valuations may not perfectly address the specific damages to be awarded. The Tribunal must be cautious to consider the basis on which the valuations were performed in order to determine their relevance to the damages being claimed in this case in light of the Tribunal\u2019s liability findings.\n\n1107.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the third-party valuations prepared in relation to the May 2008 Agreement were all DCF valuations based on the Airlines\u2019 projections as of early 2008. The May 2008 Agreement contemplated the share price being established by the average of three valuations, but that deal did not complete. The evidence indicates that the financial status of the Airlines worsened between May and July 2008. Accordingly, these third-party valuations are not of direct value in determining Claimants\u2019 damages. They do, however, provide support for the general range in values for the Airlines in the period preceding the July 2008 Agreement.\n\n1108.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that Respondent\u2019s complaints about lack of access to financial information about the Airlines or the true state of the extent of the Airlines\u2019 financial difficulties when they entered into the July 2008 Agreement were unfounded.1376 The July 2008 Agreement was negotiated with the express intent of keeping the Airlines in operation in order to maintain Respondent\u2019s public interest in connectivity. Respondent was purchasing two operating airlines with the intention of continuing to operate them. At the time, with knowledge of the financial circumstances, the Parties - negotiating at arm\u2019s length - agreed that the purchase price would be determined using a DCF valuation.\n\nSee paras. 852 - 853, above.\n\n1109.\n\nAs the Tribunal has noted, although Claimants have proved multiple breaches of the Treaty, the damages flowing from those breaches are all related. But for the breach of FET, Claimants would have transferred their shares to Respondent at a price arrived at pursuant to an agreed methodology. But for the unlawful expropriation, Claimants would have been paid fair market value for their investment in 2008. As the Tribunal will discuss further below, it considers the best evidence of fair market value to be the price for the shares to be determined by the pricing mechanism agreed by Interinvest and Respondent in July 2008.\n\n1110.\n\nThe DCF methodology and parameters agreed in the July 2008 Agreement were a negotiated compromise. In this way, the Credit Suisse valuation (performed pursuant to the July 2008 Agreement) differed from the other third-party valuations prepared in the context of the May 2008 Agreement, which did not have similar negotiated constraints on the cash flow estimates. Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement provided (in relevant part):\n\nThe valuation shall be performed using the discounted cash flow method. Such future cash flows shall be calculated using the following assumptions: (i) the cost of fuel at its current subsidized value of $1.85 (one Argentine peso and eighty-five cents) per liter plus VAT; said price is to be changed using reference prices and proportionately to price variations in the market; and (ii) the current fare for domestic flights, modified proportionately to any changes projected for all other costs.\n\n1111.\n\nThus, the Parties agreed to limit both the extent of the costs (through the subsidized fuel price with market increases) and the projected revenues (by using current fares increased proportionately by projected costs). This was the best valuation that Claimants were able to negotiate in the then financial circumstances of the Airlines, which were known to Respondent. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the result of this valuation is the best approximation of fair market value of the Airlines in July 2008.\n\n1112.\n\nAs discussed in detail at paragraphs 813 through 829, Credit Suisse prepared its valuation pursuant to the July 2008 Agreement and returned a value of between USD 0 to USD 60 million for ARSA and USD 330 million to USD 480 million for AUSA.1377 Respondent made a number of formalistic objections to the Credit Suisse valuation, which the Tribunal has rejected.1378 The evidence indicates that the TTN was able to assess the Credit Suisse valuation and that the controversies at the time did not focus on the substance of the valuation.1379 The TTN clearly disagreed with the use of a DCF methodology for the valuation of the Airlines.1380 However, that was the methodology agreed by the Parties. The Tribunal has found that the DCF analysis that was performed by the TTN did not breach the July 2008 Agreement. Nevertheless, a number of issues related to the substance and methodology of the TTN\u2019s DCF valuation were raised at the time and appear to be valid criticisms.1381 In these circumstances, the Tribunal considers the Credit Suisse valuation to be the most reliable expression of the value of the Airlines as agreed by the Parties under the July 2008 Agreement and the best evidence of the fair market value of the Airlines in late 2008.\n\nC-201, p. 7.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 823 -825.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 826 - 828 and the sources cited there.\n\nThe TTN\u2019s valuations were based on the liquidation value approach. Compass Lexecon explains that this approach is also inappropriate from an economic perspective, as it attributes no value to the intangible assets of the Airlines, it only values assets owned by the Airlines and most of the assets were leased, and it fails to value any synergies between the assets, which is inappropriate for a business that operates its assets in a network rather than as individual assets. *See* CLEX ER Supp. pp. 108 - 109\n\n*See* \u00b6 830.\n\n1113.\n\nIn addition, Claimants\u2019 experts adjusted their model in order to provide a proxy for the value of AUSA in 2008 assuming no breaches of the Treaty and determined that value to be USD 357 million.1382 This provides the Tribunal with a check on the reasonableness of the Credit Suisse valuation. The Tribunal does not accept Respondent\u2019s criticism that this calculation did not represent a value as of 2008 because the experts discounted from the 2010 valuation to arrive at the figure. The valuation date does not change the underlying cash flows (Compass Lexecon added in the cash flows for 2009 and 2010). Thus, the difference between the value at the two different dates is a simple mathematical exercise to account for the time value of money (discounting by the WACC). The Tribunal notes that this valuation proxy was provided to value AUSA as of January 2008 and that the value of the Airlines deteriorated during 2008. Also, this proxy was provided for AUSA only, as the negative cash flows for ARSA in 2009 and 2010 did not permit a similar exercise for ARSA.\n\nCLEX ER Supp. \u00b6146 and CLEX ER3.\n\n1114.\n\nAccordingly, Claimants have proved that the fair market value of the Airlines in 2008 was at least USD 330 million (USD 0 for ARSA and USD 330 million for AUSA) and that they suffered damages of at least USD 320,760,000, which corresponds to their 97.2 percent shareholding in AUSA.1383 In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has considered Respondent\u2019s position that the two Airlines must be valued together because the claim in the arbitration was brought with respect to Claimants\u2019 share in Interinvest as the holding company that controlled both Airlines.1384 Since the Tribunal has accepted the Credit Suisse valuation performed on the basis of the agreed DCF methodology in the July 2008 Agreement as the basis for Claimants\u2019 damages and that valuation did not return a negative valuation for either ARSA or AUSA, Respondent\u2019s argument in this respect is irrelevant. Further and in any event, the July 2008 Agreement clearly provided for separate valuations of the shares of AUSA and ARSA.\n\nClaimants acquired a 97.4% participation in ARSA and 96.6% participation in AUSA in 2001. After Claimants increased their participation in Interinvest, they had a 98.0% share in ARSA and 97.2% share in AUSA. As a result of the June 2006 Agreement, Claimants transferred a 3.8% stake in ARSA to Respondent leaving them with 94.2% participation in ARSA. *See* LECG ER11 \u00b6 21.\n\nResp. Closing, Transcript pp. 1794:17 - 1795:12.\n\n1115.\n\nClaimants argued that in an unlawful expropriation scenario, they were entitled to the greater of the fair market value at the time of the taking and the fair market value at the date of the Award. While the Tribunal agrees that this may be an appropriate determination of reparation when a State expropriates an obviously profitable asset, it is not appropriate in these circumstances. The Airlines were in financial difficulty and the record indicated that significant cash investments were required to allow them to continue to operate. Even if it were appropriate to award Claimants a value that reflected a restructured and refinanced asset, the Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimants have adequately proved a higher value for the shares of the Airlines than the USD 330 million, which reflects the minimum value calculated in the Credit Suisse valuation.\n\n1116.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal finds that Claimants have proved damages in the amount of USD 320,760,000 for their shareholding in AUSA and ARSA flowing from Respondent\u2019s breaches of the Treaty.\n\n**D. Interest**\n---------------\n\n1117.\n\nClaimants have requested the payment of pre-award and post-award compound interest until the effective date of payment.1385 In their Memorial, Claimants requested the payment of post-award interest at an \"appropriate rate of interest, compounded at least semi-annually.\" According to Claimants, the award of compound interest is becoming widely accepted as an appropriate and necessary component of compensation for expropriation.1386\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6541; Cl. Reply \u00b6643; Cl. PHB \u00b6219.\n\nCl. Mem. \u00b6541. Claimants rely on the award in *Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, \u2018 595 [hereinafter: *Siag* v. *Egypt]:* C-342. Claimants refer to the tribunal\u2019s statement in *Siag* v. *Egypt* that interest compounded at half yearly intervals is a modest and appropriate request.\n\n1118.\n\nClaimants request that if the Tribunal chooses a historical date of valuation, such as 2008, that it calculate the value of pre-award interest as of the date of the award.1387 With respect to the applicable rate of interest, Claimants submit that the Tribunal should award interest at either LIBOR plus 2% or \"the 8.75% rate that Argentina used in its recent settlement with Repsol\".1388 In their Reply submission, Claimants submitted that the post-award rate should be at the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate, compounded quarterly, until the date of payment.1389\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6212. They say that if the Tribunal were to award damages in accordance with the scenarios 1 or 2, then pre-award interest would be due. However, if the Tribunal were to apply Claimants\u2019 scenario 3, which used a valuation date of July 31, 2013, no pre-award interest would be payable since it involves a date-of-award valuation.\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6\u00b6 190, 200. This was with respect to its scenarios 1 and 2.\n\nCl. Reply \u00b6642. Claimants do not specify that rate nor justify its application in their Reply or their Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n1119.\n\nRespondent takes the position that any interest awarded should be at a risk-free rate, which it says is the usual practice in international arbitration. It also says that compound interest is exceptional.1390 With respect to the appropriate risk-free rate, Respondent points to a number of awards in which the tribunals awarded interest at a risk-free rate using the US six-month Treasury Bill rate or the rate for US six-month Certificates of Deposit.1391\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 963-966, 987-989.\n\nResp. CM \u00b6\u00b6976-977; Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 965-966.\n\n1120.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the ILC Articles also address interest as a component of a State\u2019s obligation to make full reparation. Article 38 provides:\n\n*Interest*\n\n1. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.\n\n2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.\n\n1121.\n\nThe Tribunal has no hesitation in accepting that the payment of interest forms part of the obligation to make full reparation for a breach of an international obligation. This appears to be common ground between the Parties. Accordingly, as the Tribunal has found breaches by Respondent of its obligations under the Treaty, it is appropriate to award interest. The relevant questions are the appropriate rate of interest, whether interest should be simple or compound and the date from which interest should run.\n\n1122.\n\nClaimants have proposed two alternative rates of interest: (i) LIBOR plus 2% or (ii) the rate of 8.75% which they say is the rate Respondent agreed to use in a recent settlement. However, Claimants have not supported these rates of interest in any way nor demonstrated how they relate to the harm suffered by the delay in payment to them of the sums awarded. In this case, unlike in *Siag,* the Treaty does not provide any guidance on the rate of interest applicable to compensation due under the Treaty.1392\n\nC-342: *Siag* v. *Egypt* \u00b6 597 where the tribunal notes that Article V of the Italy-Egypt BIT at issue in that case provided that compensation for expropriation should include interest at the current six-month LIBOR rate of interest.\n\n1123.\n\nOn the other hand, Respondent submits that any interest payable should be at a risk-free rate and it points to a number of awards in which such a rate was awarded and, in particular, the rate for 6-month US Treasury Bills.1393\n\n*See* Resp. CM \u00b6\u00b6 976-977; Resp. Rej. \u00b6\u00b6 965-966 and the awards cited there.\n\n1124.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal is not persuaded that it should award either of the higher rates proposed by Claimants. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the appropriate interest rate is the US six-month Treasury Bill rate.\n\n1125.\n\nWith respect to whether interest should be awarded on a simple or a compound basis, the Tribunal is persuaded that the latter is appropriate. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in the *Siag* award that compound interest has been awarded more often than not and is becoming widely accepted as an appropriate and necessary component of compensation. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, compound interest will better compensate for actual damages suffered since it is consistent with contemporary financial practice and would have been available had the amount awarded been paid in a timely manner.1394 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, compounding on a semi-annual basis would be appropriate.\n\nIn this regard, *see,* for example, *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, July 9, 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 103,105: C-326.\n\n1126.\n\nWith respect to the date from which interest should commence, the Tribunal finds that December 30, 2008 is the appropriate date. This is the date on which the Argentine Congress adopted Decree 2347/2008 by which Respondent declared that all the rights granted by the shares of the Airlines were to be exercised by the administrative entity appointed by the Government until the expropriation process had been completed. While various aspects of Respondent\u2019s breach of the FET standard occurred somewhat earlier than this date, the Tribunal finds this an appropriate and practical point from which to calculate interest.\n\n1127.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal grants interest at the US six-month Treasury Bill rate compounded semi-annually on the principal sum awarded as of December 30, 2008 until payment in full.\n\n1128.\n\nWith respect to the amount awarded for costs in the next section, the Tribunal believes that interest on the amount awarded should be at the same six-month US Treasury Bill rate as of the date of this Award. The Tribunal fixes this date on the basis that it is not in a position to determine the dates on which the various costs were incurred by Claimants.\n\n1129.\n\nFinally, Claimants requested that the Tribunal calculate the value of pre-award interest. Given the variable nature of the interest rate awarded over the relevant period, the Tribunal declines this request.\n\n**XVI. COSTS OF THE PROCEEDING**\n--------------------------------\n\n1130.\n\nClaimants and Respondent each requested an award of costs against the other.1395\n\nThe Parties\u2019 requests for costs were set out in their pleadings in general terms and further specified in their posthearing briefs. Pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s instruction, the Parties made additional submissions in which they quantified their claims for costs. These were made by way of initial statements on July 7, 2014 and updated statements on December 16, 2016.\n\n1131.\n\nClaimants submitted that they should be granted an award of all their costs and expenses, including legal and experts\u2019 fees on the basis of the principle of \"loser pays\" or that costs follow the event. They also submitted that Respondent\u2019s conduct justified such an award. In this regard, Claimants pointed to Respondent\u2019s reluctance or failure to provide access to certain documentation as one example of that conduct. Claimants also say that Respondent\u2019s conduct increased their costs and this also supports their payment by Respondent.1396\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6215. In this regard. Claimants rely on the award in *Siag* v. *Egypt:* C-342 \u00b6\u00b6 621-622.\n\n1132.\n\nIn addition, Claimants submitted that the unlawful expropriation of their investment was at the core of this case and that through one of its witnesses Respondent had acknowledged that it owed Claimants at least USD 150 million for that expropriation. As a result, Claimants were forced to incur significant costs and to wait a number of years to be compensated. They say that if they are not compensated for these costs, they would not be made whole as required by international law.1397\n\nCl. PHB \u00b6216, relying *onADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited* v. *Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, October 2, 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 532-533: C-280; and a number of other awards.\n\n1133.\n\nIn their First Statement Quantifying Costs, Claimants set out a breakdown of legal fees and expenses and experts\u2019 fees and expenses as well as other related expenses including translation and reporting fees and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal. The total amount claimed was USD 16,115,716.06. Claimants submitted that the fees and expenses claimed were necessary for the proper conduct of the case and are reasonable and appropriate given the complex circumstances of the case and the amount in controversy.\n\n1134.\n\nIn their Second Statement on Costs, Claimants updated their previous claim, again providing a breakdown. Claimants\u2019 updated claim for costs was as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **CATEGORY** | **AMOUNT (IN US$)** |  |\n| **Legal Fees & Expenses** |  |  |\n| \u2022 King & Spalding |  |  |\n| *Fees* | $ 11,976,662.00 |  |\n| *Expenses* | $727,837.00 |  |\n| \u2022 Fargosi & Asociados |  |  |\n| *Fees* | $ 815,056.00 |  |\n| *Expenses* | $ 104,623.00 |  |\n| Experts\u2019 Fees & Expenses | $ 2,424,857.00 |  |\n| \u2022 ICSID Payments | $ 1,425,000.00 |  |\n| **Total** | **$ 17,474,035.00** | 1398 |\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Statement of Costs \u00b6 5.\n\n1135.\n\nIn its request for costs, Respondent reviewed the various practices regarding the allocation of costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, including a *pro rata* allocation according to the outcome of the dispute and that each party bears its own costs. Respondent also submitted that the conduct of the parties during the proceedings, as well as the circumstances of the case as a whole, are significant and should be taken into account.\n\n1136.\n\nRespondent submitted that on the basis of Claimants\u2019 conduct, the Tribunal should order Claimants to pay all costs, including the fees and expenses incurred by it as well as the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and other charges. Respondent says this is appropriate since Claimants\u2019 resort to arbitration was abusive when, in the local expropriation proceedings which were lawful, Claimants adopted a passive stance. Further, Respondent says that Claimants adopted an obstructive approach and concealed information.1399\n\nResp. PHB \u00b6\u00b6293-296.\n\n1137.\n\nIn its First Statement on Costs, Respondent provided a breakdown of its costs which totalled USD 2,243,572.44. Those costs were broken down as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CONCEPTO** | **PESOS** | **EUROS** | **LIBRAS** | **DOLARES** |  |\n| TRADUCCIONES | 77,134.81 |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| subtotales | 77,134.81 |  |  |  |  |\n| EXPERTOS |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | 1,383,490.00 | 36,948.00 |  | 25,000.00 |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| subtotales | 1,460,624.81 | 36,948.00 |  | 25,000.00 |  |\n| CORREO | 17,843.80 |  |  |  |  |\n| PASAJES, HOTEL Y VIATICOS |  |  |  | 168,800.00 |  |\n| COMUNICACIONES | 18,000.00 |  |  |  |  |\n| LIBRERIA | 30,000.00 |  |  |  |  |\n| FOTOCOPIADO | 30,849.75 |  |  |  |  |\n| COSTOS CIADI |  |  |  | 950,000.00 |  |\n| COSTOS PERSONAL DE LA PTN | 6,900,629.24 |  |  |  |  |\n| TOTALES | 8,535,082.41 | 36,948.00 | **-** | 1,143,800.00 |  |\n| DOLAR AL CAMBIO | 8.13 |  |\n| TOTALES EN DOLARES | 1,049,567.44 | 50,205.00 | | 1,143,800.00 |  |\n| COSTO TOTAL EN DOLARES | **2,243,572.44** | 1400 |\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Statement of Costs. While this statement includes an amount for expert fees and expenses, it appears not to have included other legal fees since it was represented by members of the Treasury Attorney General\u2019s Office.\n\n1138.\n\nIn its Second Statement on Costs, Respondent updated this figure to include additional costs and expenses which were set out as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **DESCRIPTION** | **DOLLARS (USD** | 1401 |\n| Argentina's statement of costs dated 7 July 2014 | 2,243,572.44 |\n| ICSID Costs | 300,000.00 |\n| Treasury Attorney-General's Office personnel cost | 33,910.22 |\n| Airline tickets, hotel and travel expenses | 125,579.80 |\n| External legal assistance | 33,580.69 |\n| Translations | 5,673.71 |\n| Stationery | 1,592.36 |\n| Telecommunications | 191.08 |\n| **TOTAL** | **USD 2,744,100.30** |\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Submission on Costs, December 16, 2016.\n\n1139.\n\nIt was common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal is required to assess the expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with the arbitration and decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. In addition, Rule 28 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides how the Tribunal may fix and allocate costs. Each of the Parties based their arguments on the exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s discretion.\n\n1140.\n\nIn regard to the allocation of costs, having carefully considered the various pleadings and applications, including Claimants\u2019 various applications for interim measures, during the course of these lengthy and complex proceedings, the Tribunal has determined that the appropriate basis on which to allocate costs is the *pro rata* or proportional approach since Claimants were, ultimately, successful in respect of a substantial part of their claim.\n\n1141.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has considered the degree of success of each of the Parties in the various interim measures and other applications made during the course of the arbitration. In this regard, Claimants achieved mixed success. On the other hand, Claimants were successful in defending against Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and its Counterclaim.\n\n1142.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered the Parties\u2019 respective submissions regarding the conduct of the other during the course of the arbitration. In that regard, the Tribunal is not persuaded that either Party\u2019s conduct was such as to justify a special allocation of costs or departure from the proportional approach adopted.\n\n1143.\n\nIn their claim, Claimants claimed restitution or the monetary equivalent of all damages caused to their investments, including historical and consequential damages. The Tribunal has found that restitution is not practical and has awarded approximately 20% of Claimants\u2019 claim of USD 1.59 billion under its scenario 3. The Tribunal believes that it would be appropriate to allocate to Claimants their costs in approximately the same proportion. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that Claimants are entitled to payment of 20% of their costs claimed.\n\n1144.\n\nTurning to the quantum of the costs claimed, the Tribunal notes that the Parties did not raise any objections to the amounts claimed by the other. The Tribunal recognizes that Claimants\u2019 costs are substantially higher than those of Respondent, primarily due to the difference in the legal fees and expenses of external counsel. In this regard, Respondent was represented by the Treasury Attorney General\u2019s department, in respect of which Respondent have not made any claim for legal fees.\n\n1145.\n\nIn respect of the legal costs sought by Claimants, the Tribunal is satisfied that the amount claimed for legal fees and expenses is in line with the level of fees charged by a major international law firm in a case of this size and complexity. As a result, the Tribunal concludes the legal fees and expenses claimed by Claimants are reasonable.\n\n1146.\n\nAccordingly, taking into account all of the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal concludes that it would be appropriate, in the exercise of its discretion, to order Respondent to pay to Claimants the sum of USD 3,494,807 as a reasonable contribution towards their costs and expenses. To this amount is added interest at the rate determined above at paragraph 1128 commencing as of the date of this award.\n\n**XVII. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n----------------------------------\n\n1147.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal issues the following award. The Tribunal:\n\n(a) declares that Respondent, the Argentine Republic, has acted in breach of Article IV(1 of the Treaty by failing to grant Claimants fair and equitable treatment of their investments;\n\n(b) declares that Respondent, the Argentine Republic, has acted in breach of Article III(1) of the Treaty by its unjustified measures in interfering with Claimants\u2019 rights in respect of their investments;\n\n(c) declares that Respondent, the Argentine Republic, has breached Article V of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating Claimants\u2019 investments;\n\n(d) directs Respondent, the Argentine Republic, to pay compensation to Claimants in the amount of USD 320,760,000;\n\n(e) directs Respondent, the Argentine Republic, to pay to Claimants interest compounded semi-annually at the six-month US Treasury Bill rate commencing on December 30, 2008 until payment in full;\n\n(f) directs Respondent, the Argentine Republic, to pay to Claimants the sum of USD 3,494,807, being a contribution toward their reasonable legal and other costs of these proceedings, such costs to bear interest at the six-month US Treasury Bill rate compounded semi-annually from the date of this Award until payment in full; and\n\n(g) declares that Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim and all other claims are hereby dismissed.\n\nMade in Washington, D.C., in English and Spanish, both versions equally authentic."}, {"Title": "Decision on Argentina's Application for Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2019-05-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Argentina's Application for Annulment\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF [SELECTED] ABBREVIATIONS/DEFINED TERMS** | |\n| Annulment Memorial | Argentina's Memorial on Annulment dated May 15, 2018 |\n| Annulment Counter-Memorial | Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A.'s Counter-Memorial on Annulment dated July 30, 2018 |\n| Annulment Reply | Argentina's Reply on Annulment dated October 1, 2018 |\n| Annulment Rejoinder | Teinver's Rejoinder on Annulment dated December 3, 2018 |\n| Annulment Hearing | Hearing on Annulment held on February 5 and 6, 2019 at the World Bank in Washington D.C. |\n| Award | Award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on July 21, 2017 |\n| Application for Annulment | Argentina's application for annulment of the Award dated November 17, 2017 |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| Argentina/Respondent/Applicant | the Argentine Republic |\n| Assignment Agreement | Assignment agreement dated January 18, 2010, pursuant to which the Claimants assigned to Air Comet their rights arising out of this arbitration for no price or consideration |\n| Claimants | Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. |\n| Committee | *Ad hoc* Committee |\n| Decision on Jurisdiction | Decision on Jurisdiction dated December 21, 2012 issued in the case of Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns an application by the Argentine Republic for annulment (\"**Argentina's****Application**\" or the \"**Application for Annulment**\") of the Award rendered in the underlying arbitration proceedings on July 21, 2017 (the \"**Award**\"), also comprising the Dissenting Opinion of Kamal Hossain, and the Decision on Jurisdiction dated December 21, 2012 (the \"**Decision on Jurisdiction**\"), including the Dissenting Opinion of Kamal Hossain.\n\n2.\n\nThe Award related to a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\"\" or \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain on the Promotion and Protection of Investments, dated October 3, 1991, which entered into force on September 28, 1992 (the \"**Treaty\" or the \"BIT**\"), as well as the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Parties are the Argentine Republic (\"**Argentina**\" or the \"**Applicant**\"), and the Claimants in the original arbitration proceeding: Teinver S.A. (\"Teinver\"), Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. (\"Transportes de Cercan\u00edas\") and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. (\"Autobuses Urbanos\") (collectively, the \"**Claimants**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Applicant and the Claimants are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**\", and individually referred to as a \"**Party**\". The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n5.\n\nThe dispute in the underlying arbitration proceeding related to the Claimants' allegations that Argentina had violated the Treaty, international law, and Argentine law, as well as commitments and representations made by Argentina to the Claimants, by unlawfully renationalizing and taking other measures regarding the Claimants' investments in two Argentine airlines: Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas S.A. (\"**ARSA**\") and Austral-Cielos del Sur S.A. (\"**AUSA**\") (collectively, the \"**Airlines**\" or the \"**Argentine Airlines**\") and their subsidiaries. Argentina also made a Counterclaim.\n\n6.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal, by majority, found that Argentina breached: (a) Art. III(1) of the BIT by its unjustified measures in interfering with the Claimants' rights in respect of their investments; (b) Art. IV(1) of the BIT by failing to accord the Claimants a fair and equitable treatment; and (c) Art. V of the BIT by unlawfully expropriating the Claimants' investments in two Argentine airlines. The majority awarded the Claimants USD 320.7 million in damages plus pre-and-post Award compounded interest and USD 3.5 million in legal costs and expenses. Dr. Kamal Hossain attached a Dissenting Opinion concluding that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction, as, in his view, the Claimants failed to establish that they were investors entitled to protection under the Treaty or the ICSID Convention. Dr. Hossain noted that, through a series of agreements, the ultimate beneficiaries of the Award would be a Third-Party Funder and counsel for the Claimants (not the Claimants).\n\n7.\n\nArgentina seeks the annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds for annulment set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention: (i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b)); (ii) there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and (iii) the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 52(1)(e)).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn November 17, 2017, the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes received an application from Argentina seeking the annulment of the Award and requesting that enforcement of the Award be stayed until the Application was decided.\n\n9.\n\nOn November 22, 2017, the Secretary-General registered Argentina's Application. The Parties were also notified that the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed pursuant to Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated December 21, 2017, the Parties were notified that, in accordance with Rules 6 and 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, an *ad hoc* Committee composed of Mr. Alexis Mourre (a national of France), Prof. Fernando Cantuarias Salaverry (a national of Peru), and Prof. Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez (a national of Mexico) (the \"**Committee**\") had been constituted. The Parties were also informed that Mr. Mourre would be the President of the Committee and Ms. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, Legal Counsel at ICSID, would serve as Secretary.\n\n11.\n\nAs agreed by the Parties, the first session of the Committee was held on March 1, 2018, by telephone conference (the \"**First Session**\").\n\n12.\n\nThe Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 on March 6, 2018, concerning various procedural matters. The Parties confirmed, among others, that the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules would apply to the annulment proceedings.\n\n13.\n\nOn May 3, 2018, Argentina requested the admission of new evidence into the record.\n\n14.\n\nOn May 11, 2018, the Claimants filed their observations on Argentina's request to introduce new evidence.\n\n15.\n\nOn May 15, 2018, in accordance with the procedural calendar set out in Procedural Order No. 1, Argentina filed its Memorial on Annulment (\"**Annulment Memorial**\"), accompanied by 90 Exhibits and 153 Legal Authorities.\n\n16.\n\nOn May 17, 2018, the Committee, after considering the Parties' positions on Argentina's request to introduce new documents into the record, denied Argentina's request mainly because pursuant to section 15.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, \"[i]*n principle, no new evidence shall be admitted in this proceeding*\", and because in the Committee's view Argentina did not elaborate or provide a detailed explanation as to why the introduction of the new evidence would be necessary.\n\n17.\n\nOn June 4, 2018, the Claimants submitted a request to exclude certain new evidence introduced by Argentina in its Memorial, and for the Committee to order Argentina to submit a revised Memorial removing all citation and references to those documents, as well as any arguments relying upon the same.\n\n18.\n\nOn June 5, 2018, Argentina filed observations on the Claimants' request for exclusion of evidence.\n\n19.\n\nOn June 11, 2018, at the Committee's request, the Claimants provided specific indication of the footnotes in Argentina's Memorial (128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 163, 164, 366 and 367) that included reference to the objected documents. Subsequently, by communication of June 11, 2018, the Committee informed the Parties that subject to any eventual observations by Argentina, the references made by Argentina in its Memorial on Annulment, identified in the Claimants' letter, shall not be taken into account by the Committee.\n\n20.\n\nOn July 30, 2018, the Claimants filed a Counter-Memorial on Annulment (\"**Annulment Counter-Memorial**\"), accompanied by Exhibits C-1216 to C-1237. A revised CounterMemorial on Annulment in red lined and clean versions was subsequently filed on August 21, 2018.\n\n21.\n\nOn October 1, 2018, Argentina filed a Reply on Annulment (\"**Annulment Reply**\"), accompanied by 21 Exhibits and 41 Legal Authorities.\n\n22.\n\nOn December 3, 2018, the Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Annulment (\"**Annulment Rejoinder**\"), accompanied by Exhibits C-1233 and C-1238.\n\n23.\n\nOn December 17, 2018, the Committee informed the Parties of its availability to hold a Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting on January 8, 2019, by telephone conference. A Draft Agenda was subsequently sent to the Parties on December 18, 2018. On December 20, 2018, both Parties confirmed their availability on the proposed date.\n\n24.\n\nOn January 3, 2019, at the invitation of the Committee, the Parties informed the Committee of their agreements on the items of the Draft Agenda for the Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting, concerning the organization of the Hearing on Annulment and informed the Committee that the Parties were of the view that the Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting was no longer necessary.\n\n25.\n\nOn January 8, 2019, the Committee confirmed that the Pre-Hearing Organizational Meeting, scheduled to be held on that day, had been cancelled, as agreed by the Parties.\n\n26.\n\nOn January 8, 2019, the Claimants filed a request for the Tribunal to authorize the Claimants' insolvency administrators to attend the Hearing on Annulment, scheduled to be held on February 4 and 5, 2019 in Washington, D.C., via videoconference (i.e., Webex).\n\n27.\n\nOn January 9, 2019, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the organization of the Hearing.\n\n28.\n\nOn January 11, 2019, Argentina filed observations on the Claimants' request of January 8, 2019 for the insolvency administrators to attend the Hearing via videoconference.\n\n29.\n\nOn January 15, 2019, the Claimants filed a response to Argentina's observations of January 11, 2019.\n\n30.\n\nOn January 16, 2019, each Party provided its list of participants for the Hearing. Subsequently, on January 17, 2019, the Secretary of the Committee circulated a consolidated List of Participants to the Parties and the Committee.\n\n31.\n\nOn January 16, 2019, Argentina filed further observations on the Claimants' requests for the insolvency administrators to attend the Hearing via videoconference in light of the Claimants' list of participants.\n\n32.\n\nOn January 17, 2019, the Committee directed the Claimants to submit by January 22, 2019, a request from each of the insolvency administrators who wished to attend the Hearing via videoconference, who would be authorized to do so. The ICSID Secretariat would make the relevant arrangements for a secure videoconference and would inform the Parties.\n\n33.\n\nOn January 18, 2019, the Secretary of the Committee informed the Parties of the possibility of holding the videoconference from a venue in Madrid, and of the related costs.\n\n34.\n\nOn January 18, 2019, the Claimants informed the Committee the names of the insolvency administrators for Teinver and Air Comet, who would be attending the Hearing in person (instead of by videoconference).\n\n35.\n\nOn January 18, 2019, Argentina filed observations on the Claimants' letter of January 18, 2019.\n\n36.\n\nOn the same date, the Committee invited the Parties to agree on who would bear the additional costs of the secured platform for the videoconference, and to inform the Committee.\n\n37.\n\nOn January 19, 2019, the Committee invited the Claimants to comment on Argentina's communications of January 17 and 18, 2019, regarding the insolvency administrators.\n\n38.\n\nOn January 22, 2019, the Claimants provided responses to the Committee's inquiry as to (i) which party shall bear the costs of securing a video conference in Madrid; (ii) Argentina's objections to the insolvency administrators attending the hearing unless they act in a joint manner; and (iii) Argentina's arguments that Air Comet's insolvency administrators may not attend the annulment hearing. Attached to the Claimants' letter were letters from Mr. Luis Arqued and Ms. Antonia Magdaleno, insolvency administrators for Teinver, S.A., and from Messrs. Jes\u00fas Verdes and Miguel Villela Barranchina, insolvency administrators for Transportes de Cercan\u00edas regarding their participation in the Hearing by video conference.\n\n39.\n\nOn January 23, 2019, the Committee authorized the insolvency administrators Mr. Arqued, Ms. Magdaleno, Mr. Verdes and Mr. Villela Barranchina to participate in the hearing by video conference, and the insolvency administrator for Air Comet: Mr. Mariano Hern\u00e1ndez and his assistant, Mr. \u00c1lvaro Mart\u00ednez Domingo, to participate in the hearing in person. It was noted that Mr. Arqued might be participating in person. The Committee also decided that the costs related to the video conference in Madrid will be covered with the funds in the case account, subject to the Committee's final decision on costs.\n\n40.\n\nOn January 30, 2019, following the Claimants' request of January 28, 2019 and Argentina's observations of January 29, 2019, the Committee authorized Mr. Diego Fargosi, the Claimants' co-counsel during the original arbitration proceeding, to attend the Hearing in Washington, D.C.\n\n41.\n\nOn February 5 and 6, 2019, the Committee held a Hearing on Annulment at the World Bank's headquarters in Washington D.C. (the \"**Annulment Hearing**\").\n\n42.\n\nThe following persons were present at the Hearing:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **COMMITTEE** |\n| Mr. Alexis Mourre | President |\n| Mr. Fernando Cantuarias Salaverry | Member |\n| Mr. Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez | Member |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **ICSID SECRETARIAT** |\n| Ms. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski | Secretary of the Committee |\n| Mr. Sebasti\u00e1n Canon | Intern |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **ARGENTINA** |\n| ***Counsel:*** |  |\n| Mr. Bernardo Saravia Fr\u00edas | Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n |\n| Ms. Mar\u00eda Teresa Gianelli | Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n |\n| Ms. Mar\u00eda Alejandra Etchegorry | Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n |\n| Mr. Francisco Javier Garc\u00eda Elorrio | Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n |\n| Ms. Inda Valeria Etchechoury | Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n |\n| Mr. Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00edn Ryb | Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n |\n| Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Duhalde | Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **CLAIMANTS** |\n| ***Counsel:*** |  |\n| Mr. Doak R.

THE SCOPE OF ANNULMENT**\n-------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n45.\n\nArgentina highlights the importance of the annulment proceedings for the integrity of the ICSID system, and it accordingly submits that the scope of annulment proceedings should not be construed restrictively.1\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 32.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the grounds for annulment provided in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention are \"*narrow and limited and that a substantive, or appellate, review of ICSID awards is foreclosed*.\"2 The Claimants also contend that '[t]*hese Proceedings are neither an appeal nor a generalized review of the correctness or persuasiveness of the Tribunal's decision-making (though neither of these aspects is seriously contestable). Rather, the Committee's mandate is limited to ensuring the integrity of the underlying Arbitration. Accordingly, for Argentina to prevail on its annulment claims, it must show that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers; seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure; or failed to state its reasons for the decisions it reached*.\"3\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 99-107.\n\nAnnulment Rejoinder, \u00b6 2.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nThe Committee, as a starting point, notes that there is no disagreement between the Parties as to the fact that an annulment committee under Art. 52 of the Convention does not sit in appeal of the arbitral tribunal's decision. As rightly pointed out by the ICSID Updated Background Paper on Annulment, the scope of review that an annulment committee is entitled to perform under Article 52 is limited. Because \"*the drafting history of the ICSID Convention demonstrates that assuring the finality of ICSID arbitration awards was a fundamental goal for the ICSID system*\", annulment \"*was designed purposefully to confer a limited scope of review which would safeguard against 'violation of the fundamental principles of law governing the Tribunal's proceedings*\".4\n\nICSID, Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, (\"**ICSID's Updated Background Paper on Annulment**\"), \u00b6 71 (C-1217) (**AL RA 421 bis**), \u00b6 71.\n\n48.\n\nIn view of the Committee, no question of interpretation of Article 52 is at stake here, and defining the scope of the Committee's review does not require any analysis of whether Article 52 should be construed narrowly or broadly. Article 52 must be applied in accordance with its clear terms, which are exclusive of any review of the substance of the award. In substance, annulment is not an appeal allowing reconsideration of the merits of the case. As a consequence, an award may only be annulled on the limited grounds listed in Article 52(1).\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS AND THE ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nArgentina has argued that the Award should be annulled on grounds of manifest excess of powers (**A**), departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (**B**), and failure to provide reasons (**C**). The Committee will address each of these annulment grounds in turn.\n\n**A. MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS**\n--------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe Committee will first address the Parties' contentions concerning the legal standard that is applicable to assess whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (**1**). The Committee will then address each of the grounds invoked by Argentina to submit that the Award should be annulled on that basis, namely lack of jurisdiction (**2**), the alleged lack of powers of the attorneys representing the Claimants (**3**), the existence of a fraud relating to the use of the SEPI funds (**4**), and the Award's reliance on the July 2008 Agreement (**5**).\n\n**(1) Legal Standard**\n----------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n51.\n\nArgentina submits that tribunals derive their power from the parties' consent, and therefore exceed their powers when they act beyond or in breach of such consent.5\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 35, relying on *CDC Group plc v. the Republic of Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14 (\"***CDC***\"), Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, \u00b6 40 (**AL RA 420**).\n\n52.\n\nIn the instant case, Argentina contends that the Tribunal exceeded its powers with respect to its exercise of jurisdiction by failing to apply the applicable law and to address all the issues raised by the Parties.6\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 36.\n\n53.\n\nWith regard to jurisdiction, Argentina contends that there is an excess of powers when a tribunal assumes jurisdiction when jurisdiction is lacking, when it exceeds the scope of its jurisdiction, or when it does not exercise jurisdiction when jurisdiction exists.7 A tribunal also exceeds its powers when it fails to apply the applicable law, or applies a law different from the applicable law.8 Finally, a tribunal exceeds its powers when it decides on issues not submitted to it for resolution, or fails to address an issue raised by the parties.9\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 37-40, relying on (i) ICSID's Updated Background Paper on Annulment, \u00b6 87 (**AL RA 421 bis**); (ii) *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v.

However, Argentina submits, by relying on *Caratube*, *Occidental*, and *EDF*, that assessing a manifest excess of powers may in some cases require an extensive argumentation and analysis.10\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 43-45, citing, among others, (i) *EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v.

The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimants submit that pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, only instances of \"manifest\" excess of a tribunal's powers may lead to an annulment.11 The Claimants point out that the ordinary meaning of \"manifest\" is \"obvious or clear\", and that Argentina agrees with such interpretation.12\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 108.\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 109.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants rely on several *ad hoc* committees' decisions supporting the above interpretation and note that the ICSID Updated Background Paper on Annulment confirms that \"*the 'manifest' nature of the excess of powers has been interpreted by most ad hoc committees to mean an excess that is obvious, clear or self-evident, discernible without the need for an elaborate analysis of the award*.\"13 Annulment Committees, in line with the *kompetenz-kompetenz* principle, have affirmed that principle when annulment is sought on jurisdictional grounds.14 The Claimants point out, in this regard, that in *Lucchetti,* the committee declined to opine whether it agreed with the tribunal's interpretation of jurisdiction, decided that the interpretation was \"tenable\", and therefore refused to annul the award.15\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 110.\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 111-112.\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 113, citing *Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A. and Indalsa Per\u00fa, S.A. (formerly Empresas Lucchetti, S.A. and Lucchetti Per\u00fa, S.A.) v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4 (\"**Lucchetti**\"), Decision on Annulment of September 5, 2007 \u00b6 100-101, (**AL RA 444**). Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 113, citing Lucchetti.\n\n57.\n\nAs to the application of the law, the Claimants submit that \"if a tribunal discusses and considers the proper law, its application (even if incorrect) cannot constitute a failure to apply the applicable law unless that application is so untenable and arbitrary as to raise legitimate questions regarding the tribunal members' integrity.\"16\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 116.\n\n58.\n\nFinally, as to the alleged failure of the Tribunal to address all issues raised by the Parties, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal did address all the issues raised by the Parties, and even if it had failed to do so with respect to certain arguments, that would not constitute a ground for annulment.17\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 129.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nConcerning first of all the exercise of jurisdiction, the starting point is that the powers of a tribunal are defined by the boundaries of the arbitration agreement. A tribunal can therefore not exercise jurisdiction beyond those boundaries, and it has the duty to exercise the jurisdiction that is conferred to it by the agreement. As a consequence, exercise of jurisdiction that is not conferred upon the tribunal is in principle an excess of powers.18 Likewise, refusal by a tribunal to exercise the jurisdiction conferred to it by the parties is also an excess of powers.19 However, a mere error in the tribunal's jurisdictional findings does not constitute a ground for annulment. Such an error also needs to be manifest. As decided by many annulment committees, an excess of powers is manifest if it is obvious, clear or self-evident.20 In this regard, the fact that a tribunal has relied to make its decision on tenable solutions adopted in several previous cases may be considered as an indication that an excess of powers is not manifest.\n\nICSID's Updated Background Paper on Annulment, \u00b6 87, relying on *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

As a consequence, whenever the parties have agreed on the applicable rules of law, failure to apply the same would normally result in an excess of powers.21 Nonetheless, because annulment committees do not sit in appeal of the tribunal's decisions, a clear distinction must be made between a failure to apply the proper law and an error in the application of the same.22 Here again, the requirement that an excess of powers be manifest in order to entail annulment comes into play. While entirely disregarding the proper law would normally constitute a manifest excess of powers, an incorrect or imperfect application of such law would not, unless it is so egregious as to amount to a complete failure to apply it.23\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment v.

The Committee considers in this respect necessary to distinguish between an alleged failure to address one of the parties' claims, which may be considered as an excess of power for failure to exercise jurisdiction, and an alleged failure to respond to each and every argument or sub-argument raised by the parties, which would normally not.24 The Committee will now turn to each of the grounds invoked by Argentina to submit that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\nConcerning failure to provide reasons: *Vivendi I*, Decision on Annulment \u00b6 64, (**AL RA 431**). *Wena Hotels Limited v.

Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n62.\n\nArgentina's avers, first of all, that the Claimants did not make any protected investment. The Claimants, as a matter of fact, invested in Air Comet, a Spanish company. That same Spanish company, pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated October 2, 2001 (\"**SPA**\"), acquired from Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales del Reino de Espa\u00f1a (\"**SEPI**\"), another Spanish company, shares in the Argentine company Interinvest S.A. (\"**Interinvest**\"), the holding of ARSA and AUSA.25 Argentina therefore contends that the alleged investment was an indirect one which does not fall under the protection of the BIT. Any claim against Argentine should therefore have been brought by Air Comet, not by the Claimants.26\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 64. Argentina's Opening, slide 10.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 66.\n\n63.\n\nArgentina submits, in this regard, that the clear terms of Article I(2) of the BIT, which defines the term \"investment\", refers to goods and rights \"*acquired or undertaken in accordance with the legislation of the investment's host country*\".27 As a consequence, shares acquired in a Spanish company cannot qualify as an investment made in Argentina.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 69. Argentina's Opening, slide 14.\n\n64.\n\nFurthermore, there was no protected investor under the Argentina-Spain BIT given that the Claimants were not parties to the SPA.28\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 64.\n\n65.\n\nArgentina also contends that for an investment to be considered as such under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, four elements must be present: (i) a contribution of money or other assets; (ii) a certain duration; (iii) an element of risk and (iv) a contribution to the hots State's development (the \"*Salini* test\"). Argentina submits that the SPA did not entail a contribution by the Claimants to the host State (Argentina), an assumption of risk by the Claimants, or a significant contribution by the Claimants to Argentina's development.29\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 68. Also, Annulment Reply, \u00b6 42. Argentina's Opening, slide 16.\n\n66.\n\nArgentina relies, as evidence that the Claimants never had the quality of investors under the BIT, on an assignment agreement dated January 18, 2010, pursuant to which the Claimants assigned to Air Comet their rights arising out of this arbitration for no price or consideration (\"**Assignment Agreement**\").30\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 72.

Argentina relies, in this regard, on the Funding Agreement dated April 14, 2010 between Burford and the Claimants (\"**Funding Agreement**\"), and submits that under said Funding Agreement, Burford along with the Nominated Lawyers (King & Spalding), were intended to be the principal beneficiaries of the proceeds of any award in the case.31\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 76-78.

This argument will be dealt with in Section 5 thereafter.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nConcerning, first of all, Argentina's argument that there is no protected investment under the BIT, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal fully addressed this issue and explained that the definition of \"investment\" in the BIT applies to both directly and indirectly held assets.37 The Tribunal further explained that, under Article I(2) of the BIT, the term \"investment\" refers to \"*any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind, acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment*\", and therefore include \"*in particular* [\u2026] *shares and other forms of participation in companies*\". The Tribunal further noted that while \"*Article 1(2) of the* [BIT] *does not explicitly include or exclude 'indirect' investments from its coverage\u2026 the broad and inclusive language of this provision suggests that 'indirect' shareholders are protected by the* [BIT].\"38\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 191-192.\n\nAnnulment Rejoinder, \u00b6 28, citing the Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 209. Tr. Day 1, 179:8.\n\n73.\n\nIn light of the above, the Claimants conclude that the Tribunal correctly held that the Claimants' shares in Interinvest, ARSA and AUSA were clearly \"*shares and other forms of participation*\" in Argentine companies that fell within the BIT's definition of \"investment\", and that the fact those shares were held indirectly by the Claimants does not allow to conclude that they are not protected investments under the BIT.39\n\nAnnulment Rejoinder, \u00b6 29.\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that many other tribunals have considered the same arguments in the same context, including under the same BIT, and found that indirect investments are protected.40\n\nTr. Day 1, 180:17. Claimants' Opening, slide 92.\n\n75.\n\nIn addition, a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) requires an error that is obvious and self-evident, and Argentina has not met that burden.41\n\nAnnulment Rejoinder, \u00b6 27.\n\n76.\n\nAs to Argentina's argument that the shares in Interinvest are in any event not an investment because their acquisition does not meet the *Salini* test, the Claimants first of all submit that the Tribunal substantially adhered to these criteria and verified that the investment complied with the conditions of contribution of assets,42 assumption of risk,43 and contributed to Argentina's economic development.44 The Claimants further submit that the *Salini* criteria are mere indicators for the existence of an investment, which a tribunal is not bound to apply.45 As a consequence, even if the Tribunal had not strictly adhered to each of the *Salini* criteria, there would be no \"manifest\" error warranting annulment.46\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 35.

First, the Claimants submit that they never assigned the claims prosecuted in the arbitration, but only the proceeds of the arbitration, and that the Tribunal rightly concluded that this assignment did not affect their standing. As to the argument that Burford would be the real beneficiary of the Award, the Tribunal rightly held that it was irrelevant to its jurisdiction.47 The Claimants submit in this respect that the Funding Agreement was executed on April 14, 2010, one year after the arbitral proceedings were instituted.48 The Tribunal first correctly determined that jurisdiction is to be assessed as of the date when the case is filed.49 The Tribunal then looked at the relevant facts, and correctly found that both the Assignment Agreement and the Funding Agreement postdate the filing of arbitration.50 The Tribunal concluded that Burford's rights under the Funding Agreement are irrelevant to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.51\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 194-195.

The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nConcerning, first of all, the Tribunal's finding that the Claimants' indirect ownership of shares in Interinvest qualifies as an investment under the BIT, the Committee does not find any reason to annul the Award for manifest excess of powers.\n\n80.\n\nThe Committee recalls that for an error of law to be annullable, it must be manifest. As said above, for an error to be manifest, it needs to be obvious, clear or self-evident, and whenever the tribunal has relied to make its decision on tenable solutions that have been consistently adopted in previous cases, there should as a matter of principle be no annulment. For an incorrect or imperfect application of law to be annullable, it needs to be so egregious as to amount to a complete failure to apply the law.\n\n81.\n\nTurning to the Tribunal's analysis, the Tribunal made a distinction between what it defined as Respondents \"*derivative claim*\" argument,53 and its \"*intermediary investor*\" argument.54 In so doing, it appears to have followed the structure of Argentina's pleadings. The distinction between the two arguments is however unclear, for both appear to rely on the fact that the Claimants had no direct rights in Interinvest. And both arguments were in fact rejected on the same basis that an indirectly-held shareholding is a protected investment.55 Argentina's annulment arguments rest on the argument that the Claimants' shareholding in Air Comet is not an investment acquired in accordance with Argentine law pursuant to the BIT, with no distinction between a \"derivative claim\" and an \"intermediary investor\" claim.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 208 seq.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 229 seq.\n\nFor the \"derivative claim\" argument, \u00b6 209; for the \"intermediary investor\" argument, \u00b6 232.\n\n82.\n\nThe starting point of the analysis should be Article I(2) of the BIT, defining as investment \"*any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind, acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment*\". The Tribunal noted the broad language of the clause and deducted that it does not exclude indirect investments.56 The Tribunal concluded that the Claimants' indirect nature of their ownership of shares in Interinvest, ARSA and AUSA did not exclude such shares from the definition of an investment under the BIT.57 The Arbitral Tribunal, in so doing, rejected Argentina's argument that the terms \"*acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment*\" mean that the investment needed to be directly acquired in Argentina.58 The Tribunal concluded that shares indirectly acquired by the Claimants in an Argentine company and in accordance with the laws of Argentina were protected by the BIT. The Tribunal also discussed Argentina's arguments based on Barcelona Traction and general international law,59 and found that they were not applicable in the context of a BIT. It also concluded that the ICSID Convention does not reject the possibility for the indirect shareholders of a domestic company to bring claims for the harm caused to their investment.60 The Tribunal then rejected Argentina's arguments based on Argentine law as irrelevant to the decision on its jurisdiction,61 and rejected what it called the \"*policy argument*\" according to which it would be inappropriate to award damages to a shareholder rather than to the company that has actually suffered injury.62\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 209 seq.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 207-238; Award, \u00b6 249.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 214.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 215-221.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 222-225.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 226-228.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 233.\n\n83.\n\nThe Committee finds no manifest excess of powers in the Tribunal's interpretation of the BIT and of the other legal rules invoked by Argentina. Ultimately, the Tribunal's jurisdiction had to be assessed having regard to the BIT. The Tribunal considered that Article I(2) of the BIT encompasses indirect investments, and in so doing it interpreted the terms \"*any kind of assets*\" as referring to both directly and indirectly owned assets. It follows, according to the Tribunal, that by acquiring shares in Air Comet, a Spanish company which in turn held 99.2% of Interinvest, the Argentine holding company of ARSA y AUSA, the Claimants made an indirect investment in said Argentine companies and that such investment is protected by the BIT. Irrespective of whether these conclusions are correct or not, there is no manifest error in such reasoning. Nor is there any demonstration on the part of Argentina that such interpretation would be contrary to good faith or inconsistent with the object and purpose of the BIT.\n\n84.\n\nThe Committee notes, in this regard, that in making its decision, the Tribunal has relied on a number of past jurisdictional decisions, some made under the same Spain/Argentina BIT63 and others under treaties using similar language,64 having all concluded that indirectly owned assets qualify as protected investments. The Committee also notes that Argentina did not refer to any past decision having in similar circumstances concluded to the contrary. Although this Committee does not need to opine as to whether such past decisions were correct or not, these circumstances lead the Committee to consider that any possible error in the Tribunal's conclusion that indirectly owned assets fall under Article I(2) of the BIT would in any event not qualify as a manifest excess of powers.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 210-213, citing *Gas Natural SDG SA v.

Circuit decided the appeal on the basis of arbitrability, finding that BG and Argentina had not agreed to submit the arbitrability question itself to arbitration, and that the BG tribunal did not have jurisdiction to consider the matter of its own competence. *See Republic of Argentina v. BG Group plc*, D.C. Cir., No. 11-7021 (January 17, 2012).\n\n85.\n\nSecond, Argentina has averred before the Committee that the Tribunal would have exceeded its powers by upholding its jurisdiction in spite of the fact that the investment did not comply with the objective requirements established by the so-called *Salini* test.65\n\nAnnulment Memorial \u00b6 68. Annulment Reply, \u00b6 42, Argentina's Opening, slide 16.\n\n86.\n\nAs an initial observation, the Committee notes that the *Salini* test has not been raised by Argentina before the Tribunal as a jurisdictional argument, which is the reason why it is not dealt with in the Decision on Jurisdiction. The argument is rather addressed in different parts of the Award dealing with admissibility,66 where the Tribunal addresses issues of contribution and risk in the context of a debate on the existence of other investments made by the Claimants beyond their indirect acquisition of shares in Interinvest.67 It is unclear to the Committee why these questions are dealt with in the Award as part of a section on admissibility. At any rate, framed as a jurisdictional question, the argument is inadmissible before the Committee. A rightly explained by Christoph Schreuer: \"*a party may not present new arguments on fact and law that it failed to put forward in the original arbitration proceeding*\".68 Because Argentina did not argue the *Salini* test as part of its jurisdictional objections before the Tribunal, it cannot rely on such argument before the Committee to submit that the Tribunal's jurisdictional findings would amount to a manifest excess of powers.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 251, 253, 254, 260, 261, 262.\n\nAward, \u00b6 250.\n\nThe ICSID Convention, a Commentary, Second Edition, p. 932, \u00b6 108.\n\n87.\n\nEven if non-compliance with the *Salini* test were admissible as a jurisdictional annulment argument (which it is not), it would in any event not succeed. Whether the argument relates to jurisdiction or admissibility, the Claimants correctly point out69 that whether the standards established by the arbitral tribunal in the *Salini v. Morocco* case are mandatory has been much debated. Christoph Schreuer writes in this respect that \"*it is not entirely clear whether the tribunals regarded the criteria as essential requirements for the existence of investments or merely as typical characteristics or indicators*\",70 and that \"*the development in practice from a descriptive list of typical features towards a set of mandatory legal requirements is unfortunate*. [\u2026] *To the extent that the 'Salini' test is applied to determine the existence of an investment, its criteria should not be seen as distinct jurisdictional requirements each of which must be met separately. In fact, tribunals have pointed out repeatedly that the criteria that they applied were interrelated and should be looked at not in isolation but in conjunction*\".71 An annulment committee has in this respect annulled an award for having elevated one of the *Salini* criteria to the level of a jurisdictional requirement.72 It follows that a failure to apply the so-called *Salini* test would not in itself constitute a manifest excess of powers.\n\nAnnulment Rejoinder, \u00b6 33.\n\nThe ICSID Convention, a Commentary, p. 130, \u00b6 159.\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 133, \u00b6 171.\n\n*Malaysian Historical Salvors v. Malaysia*, ICSID Case ARB/05/10, Decision on the Application for Annulment, April 16, 2009.\n\n88.\n\nThe Committee is furthermore satisfied that the *Salini* criteria, had they been relevant to this case, were in any event complied with. The Tribunal accordingly found that the conditions of contribution,73 risk,74 and contribution to the host State's economic development75 had been met. As to the criteria of duration, it does not appear to have been discussed by Argentina, but it was clearly met as well in the context of the acquisition of two airlines, which are businesses requiring long term investments and planning.\n\nAnnulment Rejoinder, \u00b6 35; Award, \u00b6\u00b6 251, 254.\n\nAnnulment Rejoinder, \u00b6 36; Award, \u00b6\u00b6 253, 261, 262, 373.\n\nAnnulment Rejoinder, \u00b6 37; Award, \u00b6\u00b6 255, 256, 315.\n\n89.\n\nThe Committee now turns to Argentina's arguments relating to the alleged simulation that would be evidenced by the assignment, for no consideration, of the proceeds of the Award to Air Comet. Argentina submits that this assignment is an acknowledgement that the claims brought forward in the arbitration belonged in reality to Air Comet, and not to the Claimants.76\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 72.\n\n90.\n\nThis Assignment Agreement77 was however entered into in January 2010, almost 9 years after the investment and more than one year after the Request for Arbitration. The Tribunal held that, in accordance with international case law, jurisdiction is generally to be assessed as of the date the case is filed.78 This point has not been disputed by Argentina. As a consequence, and as the Claimants rightly point out, the 2010 Assignment Agreement could not affect the Tribunal's jurisdiction.79 Moreover, as the Claimants also argued, the assignment did not apply to the interests in dispute in the arbitration, but to the claim to money that would possibly arise from the Award.80 It is therefore clear that the Claimants continued to own their disputed rights against Argentina until the Award, and that their standing to pursue the claims was not affected. The Tribunal finally held that any possible illegality of the assignment would also be irrelevant to jurisdiction as long as the investment had been legally acquired.81 The Assignment Agreement can therefore not sustain the argument that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction, that the Claimants had no legal standing in the arbitration, or that the arbitration was a simulation.\n\nRA 159.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 255.\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 195.\n\n\"*Los cedentes acuerdan expresamente la cesi\u00f3n de los derechos netos de cobro que se obtengan de la demanda presentada ante el Tribunal Internacional CIADI*\", RA 159, Clause 1.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 257.\n\n91.\n\nThe Committee will now address Argentina's argument that the Burford Funding Agreement was the vehicle of a fraud to the ICSID system by allowing a third party, who was not an investor, to act against Argentina.82 According to Argentina, as a consequence, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in accepting to entertain a claim made in bad faith and in fraud of Argentina's rights.83 The Committee does not find merits to the argument.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 78.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 79.\n\n92.\n\nFirst, the Funding Agreement was made between the Claimants and Burford Capital in April 2010, which is 16 months after the Request for Arbitration. The Tribunal found that, because it postdates the filing of the case, it is irrelevant to the assessment of both the Tribunal's jurisdiction and the Claimants' standing.84 That decision finds support in international case law and past investment awards, as analysed by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction.85\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 256-257.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 255-257, citing *Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of Congo v.

There is nothing in the Funding Agreement that would allow concluding that Burford had become the owner of the claims and the real claimant in the arbitration. The Claimants continued to instruct the Nominated Lawyers. Clause 6.1 of the Funding Agreement provides in this respect that \"*in consideration of the Funder's undertakings in this Agreement, the Claimant agrees to pay to the Funder the Recovery Amount immediately following receipt of all or any part of the Award*\". As a consequence, pursuant to this provision, the right to enforce the Award and to collect against Argentina continues to belong to the Claimants. Clause 6.2 provides, as a guarantee of the Funder's right, the setting up of an escrow account on which the proceeds of the Award would have to be paid, but this remains an *inter partes* arrangement that would not in any way affect the Claimants' standing in the arbitration. As a consequence, the Committee does not find support to Argentina's submission that, based on the Funding Agreement, the real claimant in the arbitration was Burford.\n\nRA 160.\n\n94.\n\nArgentina notes that the Funding Agreement gave rise to an exchange of letters between the insolvency administrators of Air Comet and Burford as to the entitlement to the proceeds of the Award.87 The Committee fails to see how this exchange can be relevant to the annulment proceedings. The Award was in fact made in favour of the Claimants, and neither Air Comet nor Burford have any right to enforce it. Nor was there any uncertainty in the arbitration as to who the claimant parties were. Argentina states in the Reply that this \"dispute\" between Air Comet and Burford would show the serious consequences deriving from the Tribunal's decision to uphold its jurisdiction.88 But it fails to explain what these consequences are and why the role of a Funder should be characterized as an abuse of process or a breach of the BIT or the ICSID Convention. Argentina also invokes the recent release by Burford of a communication according to which it transferred its rights on the proceeds of the Award,89 without however any explanation as to why this circumstance is relevant to its argument that by affirming its jurisdiction the Tribunal exceeded its powers.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 81-83.\n\nAnnulment Reply, \u00b6 53.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 84.\n\n95.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Committee concludes that there is no manifest excess of powers in the Tribunal's Decisions on Jurisdiction.\n\n**(3) Lack of Capacity of the Claimants' Counsel**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n96.\n\nArgentina points out that \"[a]*fter the original arbitration proceeding was commenced, the three Claimant companies became subject to insolvency proceedings in Spain between late 2010 and early 2011.

Annulment Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.\n\n98.\n\nArgentina contends that although the Tribunal recognized that the law applicable to the Claimants' capacity and representation was Spanish law, it nonetheless failed to apply it by holding that: \"[I]*n the circumstances of an international arbitration which has been ongoing for a number of years, one must question whether the strict application of the formalities of granting powers of attorney at Spanish law appropriately apply*.\"92\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 98, 100 citing Award, \u00b6\u00b6 221-222.

The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimants argues that Argentina's submission is nothing more than a disagreement with the Tribunal's decision.97 The Tribunal found that, because the Claimants are Spanish nationals, the law applicable to their capacity and to the powers of attorney in dispute is Spanish law,98 in particular the Spanish Bankruptcy Law. Under that law, the Tribunal found that \"*the re-organization administrators step into the shoes of the debtor upon the commencement of liquidation proceedings/suspension of powers of administration and disposition of assets*.\"99 The Tribunal also noted that \"*each set of re-organization administrators had reaffirmed King & Spalding's powers of representation and ratified the actions taken by that firm on behalf of Claimants*.\"100\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 143.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 144.

The correct interpretation of Spanish law is that \"*the powers of attorney of company administrators (or liquidators) will be affected only to the same extent as the powers of administration and disposition of the bankruptcy estate*\".102 Since the insolvency administrators remain \"*able to perform all other acts provided such acts do not consist in the administration or disposition of the estate*\",103 including the pursuit of claims in arbitration, the powers of attorney relating to the arbitration necessarily remain valid. In its analysis of this matter, the Tribunal observed that when Spanish law does seek to extinguish contractual arrangements through the operation of law, it does so expressly.104\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 146, citing Award, \u00b6 209.\n\nExpert Report of Dr. Aurora Mart\u00ednez Fl\u00f3rez, July 31, 2013, (\"***Expert Report of Dr. Mart\u00ednez Fl\u00f3rez***\") \u00b6 34.\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 146.\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 146, citing Award, \u00b6 220.\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, based on Spanish law, the Tribunal held that \"*the powers of attorney granted to King & Spalding were initially, and have continued throughout these proceedings to be, valid*\", so that \"*Claimants ha*[d] *proved that there was no obligation at Spanish law to produce a new power of attorney in the circumstances of this case*.\"105\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 147, citing Award, \u00b6 223.\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimants also point out that the insolvency administrators ratified the Claimants' power of attorney by (i) letters from the insolvency administrators of all three Claimants filed on June 16, 2011; (ii) three additional letters, one from each of the three insolvency administrators, submitted with the Claimants' Reply in August 2013; and (iii) public deeds executed by the insolvency administrators, attesting to King & Spalding's powers to act in the arbitration, filed in October 2015.106\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 148-150.\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal found on this issue that (i) \"*the* [se] *public deeds submitted by the court-appointed receivers should be admitted into evidence in the* [\u2026arbitration] *proceedings*\";107 (ii) \"[t]*he public deeds are relevant to a number of issues before the Tribunal* [\u2026 and] *they clearly relate to the question of the validity of King & Spalding's powers of attorney and their authority to represent Claimants in the arbitration*\";108 and (iii) \"*the statements made in the public deeds are consistent with the previous statements in evidence from the receivers*.\"109\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 172.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 172.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 172.

The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nThe thrust of Argentina's argument is that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the relevant Spanish law rules to the question of the validity of King & Spalding's powers of representation after the three claimant companies versed into receivership at the end of 2010 and at the beginning of 2011. More specifically, the Parties disagree on the consequences of the suspension provided by Article 145 of Spanish Bankruptcy law, and as to whether Articles 48.3 and 52.1 of the same law, as well as Article 1732(3) of the Spanish Civil Code (relating to termination of the mandate), were properly applied.\n\n110.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Committee agrees that failure to apply the law agreed by the parties may be a basis for annulment for excess of powers. This is because, as rightly pointed out by Christoph Schreuer, \"*the provisions on applicable law are essential elements of the parties' agreement to arbitrate*\".116 The Committee also holds that choice of law can be made implicitly, in particular by common reliance on a given law.117 In the case at hand, both Parties have relied on Spanish law to discuss the question of representation in dispute. As a consequence, a failure by the Tribunal to apply that law may be characterized as an excess of powers. However, because annulment committees do not sit in appeal of the tribunal's decision, a clear distinction needs to be made between non-application of the proper law and a mere error in its application: while a complete disregard of the applicable rule of law may be an excess of power, an incorrect or imperfect interpretation or application of such rule will as a matter of principle not. While the distinction between the two situations may be in practice difficult to draw, the requirement that the excess of power be manifest is of particular relevance to assist committees in deciding whether an award should be annulled. As rightly decided by the *MTD v. Chile ad hoc* committee: \"*an award will not escape annulment if the tribunal while purporting to apply the relevant law actually applies another, quite different law. But in such a case the error must be 'manifest', not arguable, and a misapprehension (still less mere disagreement) as to the content of a particular rules is not enough*\".118\n\nCommentary, p. 954, \u00b6 192.\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 573, \u00b6 70.\n\nDecision on Annulment, March 21, 2007, \u00b6 47.\n\n111.\n\nAs an initial matter, Argentina has put much emphasis119 on the first sentence of paragraph 222 of the Award, where the Tribunal says that \"*in the circumstances of an international arbitration which has been ongoing for a number of years, one must question whether the strict application of the formalities of granting powers of attorney at Spanish law appropriately apply*\". Argentina sees that statement as evidence that instead of applying Spanish law, the Tribunal decided to disregard it in favour of a solution of its own. The Committee, however, does not give relevance to that statement. It is unclear to what formalities the Tribunal referred to, and what is exactly meant by their \"*strict application*\". As any rate, even if that sentence was perhaps unfortunate, it was surely superfluous to substantiate the Tribunal's reasoning. The basis for the Tribunal's decision that the powers of attorney granted to King & Spalding remained valid throughout the arbitration are to be found elsewhere in the Award. As a consequence, the Committee finds that particular sentence to be irrelevant.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 100-101, 225, 258. Annulment Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 60, 77.\n\n112.\n\nThe crux of the dispute was whether, in spite of the insolvency proceedings initiated against each of the three claimant parties at the end of 2010 and at the beginning of 2011, and in spite of court decisions made on April 10, 2013 (Autobuses Urbanos), April 22, 2013 (Teinver), and April 23, 2013 (Transportes) to dissolve the three claimant parties, to suspend the representative powers of their legal representatives, and to empower the insolvency administrators to represent the bankruptcy, the Representation Contract and powers of attorney granted by the Claimants to King & Spalding in November 2008 remained valid.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal's starting point was Article 52 of the Spanish bankruptcy law, according to which \"*arbitration proceedings that are pending at the time of the reorganization proceedings declaration shall continue until the award becomes final*\".120 The Tribunal noted however that pursuant to Article 51(2) of that same law, in case of a suspension of the debtor's powers of administration and disposition, the insolvency administrators would have to replace the Claimants in the arbitration with no need of a specific authorization by the court.121 The Tribunal then noted that the three insolvency administrators each signed an undated letter (which letters were submitted with the Reply in August 2013) ratifying the existing powers of attorneys and stating their intention to appear before the Tribunal. The Tribunal further states that the March 4, 2014 (merits) and November 3, 2015 (provisional measures) hearings were attended by the insolvency administrators Messrs. Arqued, Hern\u00e1ndez and Mart\u00ednez.122 The Claimants submitted to the Tribunal, on October 22, 2015, the public deeds confirming the capacity of the insolvency administrators.123\n\nAward, \u00b6 203.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 204-205.\n\nAward, \u00b6 208.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal then made a number of findings. First, the Tribunal relied on the opinion of the legal expert witness presented by the Claimants to hold that Article 1732(3) of the Spanish Civil Code (which provides that a mandate terminates in case of insolvency or incapacity of the debtor) \"*does not apply to contracts like the Representation Agreement*\" between the Claimants and King & Spalding.124 In that same paragraph, the Tribunal also seemed to accept that, although Article 1732(3) does not apply to the Representation Agreement because it is \"*a bilateral service agreement*\", it may have applied to the power of attorney \"*which was granted separately*\".125 Oddly, however, the Tribunal had previously ruled that the Spanish Bankruptcy law should \"*primarily*\" prevail, as *lex specialis*, over Article 1732.126 Although these two findings may seem contradictory, the Committee understands that the Tribunal intended to say that whether the Representation contract with King & Spalding and the powers of attorney remained valid or not is an issue that should be resolved by reference to the Bankruptcy law.\n\nAward, \u00b6 219.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nAward, \u00b6 214.\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal then held that \"*Article 61(2) of the Spanish Bankruptcy law provides that bilateral contracts to which the debtor is a party remain in effect despite the commencement of the re-organization proceedings and their validity is not affected*\", that \"*the re-organization administrators* [\u2026] *may request from the court the termination of a contract if it is deemed in the interests of the insolvency proceedings*\", and that \"*the reorganization administrators have not requested the termination of the Retainer Agreement between Claimants and King & Spalding*\".127 As a consequence, the Representation Contract was unaffected by the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nAward, \u00b6 218.\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal went on by rejecting Argentina's contention that the powers of attorney had terminated by effect of Article 48(3) of the Spanish Bankruptcy law, by holding that the provision of said article - according to which the existing powers of attorney are \"affected\" by the suspension - does not mean that they are terminated, but rather that \"*the actions of the debtor through its counsel/authorized representative are subject to the approval of the re-organization administrators*\".128\n\nAward, \u00b6 220.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal held that the powers of attorney were in any event ratified by way of the letters submitted to the Tribunal in August 2013, and decided that the objections raised by Argentina to the legal effects of these letters are \"*highly formal and somewhat arbitrary*\".129 In this regard, Argentina has submitted that in Spanish law, these letters could not be executed unilaterally by the insolvency administrators, and should have been authorized by the Court.130 The Tribunal addressed these arguments by saying that \"*the Spanish bankruptcy law does not require any particular form in which the re-organization administrators must appear in arbitral proceedings or ratify the conduct of the proceedings. The only specific instances in which court authorization is required are for the withdrawal, acceptance or settlement of claims against the debtor*\".131 The Tribunal added that, in any event, \"*as they have been appointed by the court and regularly appeared before it, it is reasonable to assume that they are not likely to engage into unauthorized action, particularly with respect to the pursuance of this arbitration, which is known to the court*\".132\n\nAward, \u00b6 221.\n\nAward, \u00b6 198; Annulment Memorial, \u00b6 103.\n\nAward, \u00b6 217\n\nAward, \u00b6 221.\n\n118.\n\nAgain, it is not the Committee's role to act as an appellate body and to assess whether that reasoning was correct in Spanish law. The relevant question here is whether in reaching its conclusion, the Tribunal applied Spanish law. The Committee considers that it did. The reasoning is based on an analysis of the various legal provisions at stake, in view of the legal opinion of a Spanish law professor upon which the Claimants relied. It essentially rests on (i) the Tribunal's analysis of Article 61(2) of the Spanish Bankruptcy law, according to which the Retainer Agreement between the Claimants and King & Spalding was still in force in absence of termination, (ii) the Tribunal's analysis of Article 48(3) of that same law, according to which the powers of attorney had been \"*affected or limited*\" but not terminated as a consequence of the suspension, and (iii) its finding that said powers had in any event been ratified by way of the undated letters signed by the insolvency administrators and that said ratification was not subject in Spanish law to a specific form. The Tribunal also found that the October 2015 public deeds were relevant to the question of the validity of the King & Spalding's powers of attorney and their authority to represent the Claimants in the arbitration.133 Irrespective of whether these reasons are correct or convincing, there is no doubt in the eyes of the Committee that in reaching its conclusions, the Tribunal applied Spanish law. As a consequence, there is no manifest excess of powers.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 172.\n\n**(4) Misappropriation of the SEPI Funds**\n------------------------------------------\n\n***a.

Any complaint as to the use of funds provided by the SPA should have been raised by SEPI.141 As found by the Tribunal: \"*As in the case of USD 300 million, the evidence indicates that SEPI was aware of how Air Comet was using the USD 248 million intended for the execution or implementation of the Industrial Plan. Apart from applying a penalty of USD 86,957 for failure to supply one airplane, SEPI does not appear to have invoked any contractual remedies against Air Comet for the possible failures to comply with the terms of the SPA.

The Tribunal first explained in its Decision on Jurisdiction that Air Comet's alleged breaches \"*could not affect jurisdiction because they would have only occurred subsequent to Claimants' acquisition of the investment*.\"143 Regarding the USD 300 million, the Tribunal observed the there was no doubt that SEPI was aware of how these funds were being used: \"*Although Respondent argues that the purchase of ARSA's debt and subrogation to ARSA's creditor's claims was not in compliance with the terms of the SPA, the references above indicate that SEPI was, indeed, aware of the purchase of the debt and subrogation by Air Comet and consented, as found by the Spanish audit court. In these circumstances, it appears that while the acquisition and subrogation may not have been in accordance with the SPA as originally contemplated, the parties subsequently agreed to a different handling of the USD 300 million contributed by SEPI. There is no indication that SEPI ever complained of this or that it sought to annul the SPA on this basis.

Day 1, 198:20 -201:4.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nAs said above, Argentina's argument is that, because of the alleged breach of the principle of good faith in the use of funds contributed by SEPI and of the non-compliance by Air Comet with the terms of the SPA, \"*the investment invoked by Claimants could not benefit from the protection of the BIT and such conduct triggered the inadmissibility of the claim under international law\".*147 The argument, therefore, does not go to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal. In fact, as correctly pointed out by the Claimants,148 the alleged breaches of the SPA all occurred after the acquisition of the investment and could not form the basis for a jurisdictional argument.\n\nAnnulment Reply, \u00b6 120.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 80; 109.\n\n128.\n\nArgentina's argument is that the misuse of the SEPI funds by Air Comet amounted to a fraud which should have led the Tribunal to dismiss the claim on its merits as inadmissible, and that failing to do so was a manifest excess of powers.149 Argentina also avers that the Tribunal failed to address its argument relating to the use of the USD 205 million aimed at covering the Airlines' liabilities, and that such omission is also a manifest excess of powers. The Committee will address each of these two arguments in turn.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 138.\n\n129.\n\nConcerning, first of all, the alleged breach of the principle of good faith, Argentina relies on the award in *Churchill Mining*150 to submit that the existence of a fraud in the operation of an investment renders an international claim arising from that investment inadmissible. The Committee notes, in this regard, that from Argentina's own argument, the case in *Churchill Mining* was related to frauds and falsifications committed by the investor in the intent to obtain additional mining licenses. The Committee agrees, in this respect, that the fact for an investor to use the investment to commit a fraud to the detriment of the host State may be considered as depriving the investment from the protection granted to it by international law. In the Committee's view, however, not every breach of an obligation, whether or not contractual, is susceptible to be characterized as a fraud in international law. In order for a breach to constitute a fraud, it needs to be wilful, and to have been orchestrated to obtain an undue advantage to the detriment of the host State. In the instant case, Argentina does not explain why the facts in dispute should be considered as such a breach of good faith in international law, why they affected the Airlines, and why they should lead to deprive the investors of the protection afforded to them by the BIT.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 136-137.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal has, in the Award, carefully analysed the grievances of Argentina with respect to the use of the SEPI funds.\n\n131.\n\nAs to the use of the USD 300 million which, in accordance with the SPA, had to be used to pay off certain liabilities of the Airlines, Argentina complains that instead of paying off liabilities, Air Comet purchased the debts, subrogated itself in the rights of the creditors, to then transfer them to Interinvest which then turned them into capital contributions, thus increasing its stockholding and thereby lowering that of Argentina in ARSA.151 The Tribunal found that Air Comet's use of the funds did not violate the SPA and was not in breach of any law.152 That conclusion was not contradicted by its review of the Spanish criminal proceedings, which appear to be related to allegations of tax evasion to the prejudice of the Spanish treasury.153 Concerning, in particular, the December 9, 2013 judgment of Criminal Court of Madrid, upon which Argentina relies,154 The Tribunal found that such judgment had made \"*no finding of fraud or harm, as it relates to the actual use of the funds Air Comet received from SEPI, to the airlines, its creditors, or otherwise*\".155\n\nAnnulment Reply, \u00b6 87.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 263-315.\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 214.\n\nAnnulment Reply, \u00b6 92.\n\nAward, \u00b6 320 n. 237.\n\n132.\n\nThe Committee does not find any reason to question such findings. It is undisputed that, through the assignment of the relevant credits to Air Comet and their subsequent conversion into a capital contribution, the relevant liabilities of ARSA were indeed extinguished. There is no evidence that such conversion ran against the SPA or any other commitment or obligation of Air Comet, and even less that it amounts to a fraud to the prejudice of Argentina that could entail the inadmissibility of the claim for breach of the principle of good faith in international law.\n\n133.\n\nWith respect to the allegation that the USD 248 million contributed by SEPI to carry out the industrial plan was not used to that end but to finance operating costs, Argentina provides no explanation as to why this would amount to a fraud to the prejudice of the Airlines.156 The Tribunal, in this respect, noted that SEPI was aware of the way the funds were used and had approved it.157\n\nAnnulment Reply, \u00b6 102.\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 216.\n\n134.\n\nAs to the USD 50 million capital contribution, the Tribunal noted that \"*neither Party indicate[* d] *that Air Comet was ever found to be in default of its obligations to make the USD 50 million investment, nor that SEPI took any steps under the SPA or otherwise in this regard*\".158 The Tribunal also noted that \"*in its report N\u00b0 765, the Spanish Audit Court concluded that Air Comet had complied with its obligation to increase the capital of ARSA by USD 50 million (albeit somewhat late)*\", and that \"*The Tribunal de Cuentas determined that Air Comet paid in cash approximately 25% of the amount on February 19, 2003 and the balance by February 11, 2005*\".159 Argentina has not demonstrated, in addition, why the alleged failure to proceed to the capital contribution would amount, beyond being a breach of the SPA, to a fraud to the prejudice of the Airlines.\n\nAward, \u00b6 304.\n\nAnnulment Rejoinder, \u00b6 77.\n\n135.\n\nThe Committee now turns to Argentina's argument that the Tribunal failed to address its argument that the USD 205 million contributed by SEPI to cover the Airlines' debts were instead used to pay for operational expenses, and that such failure is a manifest excess of powers.\n\n136.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Committee considers that while a failure to decide a claim may amount to a manifest excess of powers, the failure to address a factual or legal argument supporting a claim normally does not. As a matter of fact, a tribunal has the obligation to fulfil its mandate, which is to resolve the dispute brought before it by the parties by deciding on their respective claims. Failing to do so may therefore amount to a manifest excess of powers. To the contrary, the Tribunal has no obligation to address each and every single argument or sub-argument advanced by the parties in support of their claims.\n\n137.\n\nIn the instant case, the alleged misuse of the USD 205 million is one of the arguments that Argentina has put forward before the Committee to sustain its claim that the Tribunal's decision with respect to the SEPI fund amounts to a manifest excess of powers. As such, even if the argument had not been addressed, there would be no manifest excess of powers.\n\n138.\n\nIn any event, as rightly pointed out by the Claimants, the Tribunal did address the question and decided that these sums could be used to cover operational losses.160 Argentina's argument was also rejected implicitly by the Tribunal's finding that SEPI was generally aware of the use of funds by Air Comet and did not object to it.161 Finally, there is no explanation on the part of Argentina of the reason why the use of the USD 205 million to cover operational losses instead of debts would constitute a fraud to the detriment of the Airlines and a breach of the principle of good faith under international law.\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 220; Annulment Rejoinder, \u00b6 77; Award, \u00b6 377.\n\nAward, \u00b6 300, fn 178.\n\n139.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Committee holds that the Tribunal did not commit a manifest excess of powers in rejecting Argentina's arguments based on the alleged misuse of the SEPI funds.\n\n**(5) The July 2008 Agreement**\n-------------------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n140.\n\nArgentina submits that the only basis for the Tribunal's finding that Argentina breached the BIT was its alleged non-compliance with the July 2008 Agreement.162 Such contract was concluded between Argentina and Interinvest in the context of the delicate financial situation of the Argentine Airlines,163 and its purpose was to determine the price of the Airlines' shares, which were to be purchased by Argentina.164\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 144.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 145.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 146.\n\n141.\n\nArticle 6 of the July 2008 Agreement reads as follows:\n\n\"*ARTICLE 6: The prices for the purchase of the stock interests in AEROL\u00cdNEAS and AUSTRAL shall be determined as follows:*\n\n*(i) The purchase price for AUSTRAL's stock interest shall be determined based on the valuation provided by a valuation entity to be appointed therefor by IV and the valuation to be performed at the request of the STATE OF ARGENTINA*\n\n*(ii) The purchase price for AEROL\u00cdNEAS's stock interest shall be determined based on the valuation provided by a valuation entity to be appointed therefor by IV and the valuation to be performed at the request of the STATE OF ARGENTINA*\n\n*The STATE OF ARGENTINA shall seek the abovementioned valuations from the Appraisal Board, which agency shall assess the value of the airlines as a whole. Should the valuations thus performed yield different results and/or if an agreement cannot be otherwise reached as to the price of the two stock interests, a third valuation shall be sought from an impartial local or foreign entity of international renown specialized in the purchase and sale and/or valuation of international airlines; the valuation thus obtained shall be final and definitive as between the Parties.*\n\n*The valuation shall be performed using the discounted cash flow method. Such future cash flows shall be calculated using the following assumptions: (i) the cost of fuel at its current subsidized value of $1.85 (one Argentine peso and eighty-five cents) per liter plus VAT; said price is to be changed using reference prices and proportionately to price variations in the market; and (ii) the current fare for domestic flights, modified proportionately to any changes projected for all other costs.*\"165\n\nJuly 2008 Agreement, Article 6 (**RA-559**).\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that \"*there had been no agreement on the transfer price for the shares in the Airlines*\" and that Interinvest therefore \"*request* [ed] *the selection of a third-party valuator, pursuant to the terms of the July 2008 Agreement*.\"166 Given the disagreements between Interinvest and the Argentine State, the third valuator was however not appointed. Thereafter, the Argentine Congress enacted a law declaring the shares of the Argentine Airlines of public interest and subject to expropriation.167\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 148, citing the Award, \u00b6 448.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 148.\n\n143.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the Argentine Republic was liable for breaching the July 2008 Agreement by failing to comply with its obligation to purchase Interinvest's shares in the Argentine Airlines pursuant to the mechanism set forth under Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement, and that such breach was a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard established by the BIT168 and an unjustified measure.169 The Tribunal also concluded that the expropriation was unlawful, for Argentina failed to perform the procedure established in the July 2008 Agreement and the expropriation of the shares had therefore not been carried out in accordance with the Argentine law.170\n\nAward, \u00b6 857.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 925.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 149.\n\n144.\n\nArgentina first submits that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to base its findings on the July 2008 Agreement, because (i) the Claimants are not party to that contract, and (ii) the breach of the July 2008 Agreement was a contractual breach that could not be elevated to the level of a treaty breach.171\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 174 and 264.\n\n145.\n\nArgentina further submits that \"*the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in completely failing to apply the guidelines it had identified as legal principles applicable to Claimants' compensation. The Tribunal arbitrarily decided to adopt the valuation submitted by one of the parties to the July 2008 Agreement\u2014the Credit Suisse valuation submitted by Interinvest\u2014*172*in direct contradiction to the guidelines the Tribunal itself had determined were applicable to the case, i.e. that the value of the shares of Interinvest in the Argentine Airlines was to be assessed in accordance with the valuation methodology set out in Article six of the July 2008 Agreement, by means of a valuation prepared by a third independent valuator specialised in the sector*.\"173\n\nAward, \u00b6 1114.\n\nAnnulment Reply, \u00b6 143\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the question of whether a breach of the July 2008 Agreement may *also* cause a violation of the FET standard is a question that pertains to the merits and not to jurisdiction.174\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 238\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimants point out that the Tribunal's finding of a violation by Argentina of the FET standard was not only based on its breach of Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. It rather had a wider scope and included: \"*Respondent's lack of transparency in agreeing to the July 2008 Agreement, passing Law 26,412 which resulted in the TTN applying a valuation methodology that was inconsistent with that agreed to in the July 2008 Agreement and its arbitrary decision to expropriate the investment rather than proceed to a third-party valuation as agreed*.\"175\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 239; Award, \u00b6 1010.\n\n148.\n\nThe Claimants submit that other tribunals, such as the *Murphy II* tribunal, found that conduct giving rise to a breach of contract may also breach the FET standard.176 The Claimants conclude that \"*the Tribunal properly and clearly held that Argentina's conduct, including but not limited to its breach of Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement, violated the FET standard. The Tribunal provided logical and sound reasons for its finding, and fully addressed Argentina's arguments in this respect. In addition, the Tribunal found Argentina liable under the Treaty on two additional grounds separate from the FET standard*.\"177\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 240 (footnotes omitted).\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 244.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nThe Committee will first address Argentina's argument that the alleged breach of the July 2008 Agreement was a contract breach on which the Tribunal had no jurisdiction, to then deal with the argument that the Tribunal could not without exceeding its powers assess damages in disregard of the procedure established by that Agreement.\n\n150.\n\nConcerning, first of all, the argument that the breach of the July 2008 Agreement was a contract breach falling outside the scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Committee will as an initial matter note that the Tribunal rejected the arguments made by the Claimants, based on the BIT's MFN clause, to the effect that they would be entitled to rely on an umbrella clause.178 That is undisputed*.* The Committee however finds the discussion on this point179 to be irrelevant to the question whether the Tribunal could without exceeding its powers find that in breaching the July 2008 Agreement, Argentine also breached the BIT.\n\nAward, \u00b6 892.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 177; Annulment Rejoinder, \u00b6 136.\n\n151.\n\nThe fact that the Claimants could not rely on an umbrella clause may have been relevant to the question whether a breach of a contractual obligation entered into between the parties could be elevated to the level of a treaty breach. In the case at hand, however, the findings of the Tribunal were based on breaches by Argentina of its treaty obligations, rather than on its contractual conduct. In finding that the refusal by Argentina to comply with Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement was a breach of the FET standard, the Tribunal noted that Argentina had acted, in so doing, in its capacity as sovereign, and not merely as a contracting party. The Tribunal first noted that \"*Argentina's purpose for entering into the July 2008 Agreement was to fulfil its obligation to guarantee the provision and continuity of air transportation services in Argentina*\".180 The Tribunal concluded that \"*the July 2008 Agreement was not simply a commercial agreement*\".181\n\nAward, \u00b6 854.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n152.\n\nThe July 2008 Agreement was part of the legal framework established by Argentina for the operation of the investment and the possible sale of the Airlines by Interinvest.182 As such, a breach by Argentina of that contract could also be a breach of Argentina's treaty obligations, irrespective of the existence of an umbrella clause. And this is precisely the conclusion that the Tribunal reached by finding, with respect to the measures following the July 2008 Agreement, that \"*Respondent's lack of transparency in agreeing to the July 2008 Agreement, passing Law 26,412 which resulted in the TTN applying a valuation methodology that was inconsistent with that agreed to in the July 2008 Agreement and its arbitrary decision to expropriate the investment rather than to proceed to a third-party valuation as agreed, have all been found to be a breach of the FET obligations*\".183\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 435, 778. *Acta Acuerdo* (Agreement) between the Argentine State and Interinvest dated July 21, 2008 (\"***July 2008 Agreement***\"), Article 3. (**C-190**).\n\nAward, \u00b6 1010.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal has therefore not elevated mere contract breaches to the international plane. It has rather found that the facts in dispute, irrespective of whether they were also contract breaches, were inconsistent with the state's international obligations. The Tribunal, to that effect, has considered that the July 2008 Agreement was part of the legal framework applicable to the investment,184 and that the Claimants had a legitimate expectation that Argentina would act consistently with that legal framework.185 In so doing, the Tribunal did not exceed its powers. As a matter of fact, a tribunal may without exceeding its powers hold that a breach by a state of its obligations under a contract is also a breach of its international obligations under a treaty. In so doing, a tribunal does not ignore the distinction between contract claims and treaty claims.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 782, 850.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 850-851, 854.\n\n154.\n\nThe foregoing also disposes of Argentina's argument that the Tribunal could not base its findings on the July 2008 Agreement because the Claimants were not parties to that contract and had no right to invoke that contract.186 Although the Claimants were not part to the July 2008 Agreement, the Tribunal found that they had a legitimate expectation that it would be complied with as part of the general legal framework applicable to the investment.187 Having found that its obligations under the July 2008 Agreement were assumed to fulfil its public obligation to guarantee the provision and continuity of air transportation services in Argentina, and that the Claimants had a legitimate expectation that the July 2008 Agreement would be complied with, the Tribunal could conclude without exceeding its powers that Argentina's refusal to comply with the procedure established by Article 6 of said contract was also a breach of its international obligations.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 186 seq.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 850-851, 854. Annulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 87.\n\n155.\n\nThe Committee will now address Argentina's argument that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by adopting the Credit Suisse valuation as a basis to assess damages. The Tribunal, in this regard, held that \"[T]*he Tribunal considers the Credit Suisse valuation to be the most reliable expression of the value of the Airlines as agreed by the Parties under the July 2008 Agreement and the best evidence of the fair market value of the Airlines in late 2008*.\"188\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 161, citing the Award, \u00b6 1112.\n\n156.\n\nAccording to Argentina, in so doing, the Tribunal disregarded the July 2008 Agreement, upon which it has relied to find Argentina liable for breach of its FET obligations. Because Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement provided that the price would be established, in case of a disagreement on the valuations submitted by the parties, on the basis on an independent valuation, the Tribunal should have appointed an independent expert to proceed to the valuation.189 Argentina therefore submits that, in modifying the agreed valuation method, the Tribunal failed to apply the international law principle according to which the damages should replace the parties in the situation in which they would have found themselves in absence of breach, and that by doing so it manifestly exceeded its powers.190\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 152.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 159 seq.\n\n157.\n\nThe argument, however, erroneously assumes that the proper remedy should have been the specific performance of the price fixing mechanism provided by Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. However, the Tribunal has rejected the Claimants' argument that specific performance should be ordered, and the Claimants reinstated in their investment.191 That part of the decision is not challenged by either party. As a consequence, the Tribunal had to assess reparation by equivalent, i.e. by fixing damages corresponding to the fair market value of the shares.\n\nAward, \u00b6 1098.\n\n158.\n\nThe question then becomes a question of the assessment by the Tribunal of the evidence before it, which an annulment committee cannot revisit on the merits. The Tribunal, in this respect, relied on the Credit Suisse valuation not as part of the mechanism established by Article 6, but as reliable evidence of the fair market value of the shares at the time. The Tribunal, in so doing, also relied on three other contemporaneous valuations by PriceWaterHouseCoopers, Deloitte and Morgan Stanley, as well as on Compass Lexecon's adjusted valuation.192 It held that the fact that Claimants' experts adjusted their model to provide a proxy for the value of AUSA in 2008 assuming no breaches of the Treaty provided a check on the reasonableness of the Credit Suisse valuation.193 The Tribunal then concluded that the Credit Suisse provided the most reliable valuation and was therefore an acceptable evidence of the fair market value of the shares at the time of the taking.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 1107, 1113.\n\nAward \u00b6 1113.\n\n159.\n\nAlthough a more detailed analysis of the Credit Suisse valuation could perhaps have been provided in the Award, it is not up to the Committee to assess whether that decision was correct and whether the Credit Suisse overvalued the shares. What matters is only whether in the assessment of damages the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by relying on the Credit Suisse report. It did not.\n\n160.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers in its assessment of damages.\n\n**B. SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Legal Standard**\n----------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n161.\n\nArgentina submits that this ground is concerned with principles of natural justice, and with the integrity and fairness of the arbitral process.194 Argentina gives some examples of fundamental rules of procedure under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention: \"*due process, the right of defence, the right of both parties to be heard and to submit their claim or defence by presenting any arguments and evidence in support of their position, the right of each party to properly respond to the arguments and evidence presented by the other party, equality between the parties, deliberation among the members of the tribunal, independence and impartiality of the members of the tribunal, the treatment of evidence, the burden of proof, and the rules on legal standing, among others*.\"195\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 46, citing ICSID's Updated Background Paper on Annulment, \u00b6 98 (**AL RA 421**).\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 48.\n\n162.\n\nWith regard to the seriousness of the departure that is required to entail annulment, Argentina, relying on the *Pey Casado* and *TECO* 's annulment committees' decisions, contends that \"*the party applying for annulment must simply demonstrate the impact that the situation could have had on the award, that is to say, that observance of the rule departed from had the potential of causing the tribunal to render a substantially different award from the one it actually rendered*.\"196\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 49- 51.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe Claimants submit that this ground of annulment is concerned with the integrity and fairness of the arbitral process.197 The Claimants contend that the threshold for a procedural violation to constitute a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention is very high, and rely on Professor Schreuer's view that: \"*Even a serious violation of a rule of procedure would not constitute a ground for annulment if the particular rule was not fundamental. Conversely, the violation of even a fundamental rule could not lead to annulment if the violation was not serious. All of this makes clear that proof of a procedural impropriety in the proceedings before the tribunal will not be enough. In particular, a simple violation of the Arbitration rules is not, by itself, a ground for annulment*.\"198\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 117-121.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 117, citing *Schreuer*, **(C-1233)**.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n164.\n\nThe Committee holds that this ground of annulment applies to protect the integrity and fairness of the proceedings, in particular the fundamental principles of due process, such as the right to be heard, the principle of equal treatment of the parties, and the independence and impartiality of the arbitral tribunal. To the contrary, the ground of serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure does not allow a party to seek a review of the substance of the award, which would convert an *ad hoc* committee into an appellate body. Only serious matters of procedure can be argued under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(2) Exercise of Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n165.\n\nArgentina submits that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by (i) exercising jurisdiction in this proceeding despite the fact that the Claimants did not discharge their burden of proof to show their capacity as investors under the Treaty or their investment in Argentina under the terms of the BIT; (ii) allowing counsel deprived of powers to appear before it; and (iii) allowing Burford, which is not an investor under the BIT, to be the principal beneficiary, together with King & Spalding, of the proceeds of the Award,199 which in Argentina's view was an evident abuse of process.200\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 194; Annulment Reply, \u00b6 166.

The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nThe Claimants refute Argentina's submission that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure when affirming jurisdiction over the underlying dispute.\n\n172.\n\nRegarding Argentina's argument that the Tribunal violated Argentina's due process rights when it rejected its objection concerning the absence of a protected investment, the Claimants submit that this argument does not involve any question of \"due process\" because Argentina's submissions were thoroughly addressed by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction.211\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 198-202.\n\n173.\n\nAs to Argentina's submission that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by failing to refrain from benefiting Burford under the Funding Agreement, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal did not take and did not have to take any position on the validity of the Funding Agreement.212\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 203-204.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe Committee will first address Argentina's argument that the Tribunal's jurisdictional findings were a serious departure from the rules applicable to the burden of proof. The Committee will then deal with Argentina's arguments regarding the lack of powers of King & Spalding, and with the Funding Agreement and the role of Burford.\n\n175.\n\nConcerning the argument relating to the burden of proof, the Committee considers, first of all, that an annulment committee has no powers to revisit the assessment of evidence made by the tribunal. Pursuant to Arbitration Rule 34(1), the tribunal is the judge of the admissibility as well as of the probative value of the evidence, and it is not up to an annulment committee to second-guess its findings in this regard. As rightly held by the *ad hoc* Committee in *CDC v. Seychelles*, an error in the tribunal's appreciation of the evidence does not in itself constitute a ground for annulment.213\n\n*CDC,* \u00b6\u00b6 59-61. See also *Schreuer*, \u00b6\u00b6 52, 330-331.\n\n176.\n\nArgentina sustains that the Claimants did not discharge their burden of proving their quality of investors and the existence of an investment under the BIT. As an initial matter, Argentina does not explain which fundamental rule of procedure would have been breached by the Tribunal in assessing the Claimants' arguments in this regard. There does not seem to have been any substantial difference between the Parties as to the facts that were relevant to the assessment of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The factual matrix was essentially agreed. The matters in dispute were therefore of a legal nature, and essentially bore on the interpretation of Article 1 of the BIT (and whether indirect ownership of the shares deprived the Claimants to claim the existence of an investment), on the objective criteria for the existence of an investment, and on the arguments relating to the lack of powers of King & Spalding and the existence of funding on the part of Burford. On each of these matters, the Claimants put forward their arguments, with the support of legal evidence. The Tribunal found these arguments to be convincing. There was therefore no reversal of the burden of proof. Argentina considers that the Tribunal erred in its assessment of the legal questions involved by its jurisdictional objections. However, it is not up to an annulment committee to review the tribunal's assessment of the evidence.\n\n177.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Committee finds that there was no serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in the Tribunal's jurisdictional findings.\n\n**(3) Lack of Capacity of the Claimants' Counsel**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n178.\n\nArgentina contends that \"*in considering that King & Spalding's attorneys had capacity of representation for the arbitration proceeding, following the suspension of the Claimant companies' management and disposition powers and their replacement by the respective trustees in insolvency, the majority of the Tribunal acted in breach of basic standing and representation principles. This amounts to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention*.\"214\n\nAnnulment Reply, \u00b6 177. *See also*, Annulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 220-227 and Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 177-182.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the argument is no more than an attempt to review the Tribunal's findings on the matters in dispute, which is not within the powers of an annulment committee.215 In addition, Argentina has not established whether the principles of representation relied upon by Argentina are a fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d), or that the alleged departure was a serious one.216\n\nAnnulment Rejoinder, \u00b6 69.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 71.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nArgentina avers that the Tribunal's decision that King & Spalding had valid powers of attorney to represent the Claimants is a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.217 The Committee of course accepts that false representation may be a breach of a fundamental rule of procedure. Allowing a person that is deprived of powers to purportedly represent a party may be a procedural breach entailing the annulment of the award. To the contrary, a mere procedural irregularity in the release of a power of attorney should not, under Article 52(1)(d), result in the annulment of the award.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 220 seq.\n\n181.\n\nIn the case at hand, Argentina's complaints are formal in nature. The will of the insolvency administrators to be represented by King & Spalding in the arbitration has clearly been confirmed in the 2013 letters. The Committee has no reason to doubt that these letters are authentic and that they express the genuine intention of their authors. The insolvency administrators were aware of the arbitration and of the fact that King & Spalding was representing them, and they did not object to that situation or appoint another counsel; to the contrary, they even appeared to several hearings in the arbitration in the presence of the King & Spalding team. There is therefore no doubt, in the eyes of the Committee, that the insolvency administrators intended to be represented by King & Spalding in the arbitration.\n\n182.\n\nThe alleged irregularities, in reality, lie in the fact that King & Spalding should, according to Argentina, have obtained fresh powers of attorney from the insolvency administrators after the dissolution of each of the claimant parties, and that the 2013 letters did purportedly not comply with requirements of form established by Spanish law. In the Committee's view, in absence of any evidence that the insolvency administrators did not intend to be represented in the arbitration by King & Spalding, a failure to comply with purported requirements of form established by Spanish law does not establish a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n**(4) Funding Agreement and role of Burford**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n183.\n\nArgentina first submits that the Funding Agreement amounts to a substitution of Burford as the real party in the arbitration, and that agreements based on principles of *champerty* and *maintenance* are an abuse of process that is contrary to public policy,218 as well as to international law and the ICSID Convention.219 According to Argentina, the Tribunal failed to verify that the Funding Agreement complied with good practices applicable to third-party funding, so as to avoid any situation of conflicts of interest and the improper exercise of an undue control on the arbitration.220 As a consequence, the Tribunal's decision to take jurisdiction in spite of the illegal Funding Agreement was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.221\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 217.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 205-208.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 209-217.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 219.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimants object that the Tribunal did not have to take any position on the validity of the Funding Agreement, which is irrelevant to the resolution of the dispute between the Claimants and Argentina.222 The Claimants also submit that Argentina failed to identify the fundamental rule of procedure at issue223 and that there is no evidence that Burford exercised any control on the arbitration.224\n\nAnnulment Rejoinder, \u00b6 46.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 48.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 49.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe thrust of Argentina's argument is that the Funding Agreement is illegal, first because it implied a transfer to Burford of the Claimants' interest in the arbitration,225 and second because it allowed Burford to exercise control over the arbitration in disregard of recognized good practices aimed at avoiding conflicts of interest.226\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 205 and 209.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 211-217.\n\n186.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Committee considers that the fact that the Funding Agreement may be contrary to public policy227 or to international law and to the object and purposes of the ICSID Convention228 would not necessarily be in itself sufficient to entail annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. In order for the Committee to annul the Award on that ground, Argentina needs to identify a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in the arbitration proceedings. The simple fact that the Funding Agreement may be illegal or contrary to public policy does not necessarily imply a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 218.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 207.\n\n187.\n\nThe Committee also finds that Argentina has not demonstrated that the prohibition of *maintenance* and *champerty* applies in the context of a treaty-based ICSID arbitration. Nor has Argentina demonstrated that the best practices for third-party funding, such as those identified by Prof Catherine Kessedjian229 or the Code of Conduct of litigation funders,230 are a fundamental rule of procedure that should mandatorily be complied with in an ICSID arbitration. The Committee accepts that disregard on the part of the funded party and the funder of recognized good practices may in certain egregious cases be relevant to the assessment of whether a fundamental rule of procedure applying to the arbitration was breached. However, the applicant still has the onus of identifying the rule of procedure applying to the arbitration that has so been breached. Argentina did not identify any such breach in this case.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 211.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 212-215.\n\n188.\n\nAs to the allegation that the Funding Agreement entailed a transfer of the rights in dispute in the arbitration,231 so that Burford would have become the real claimant party,232 the Committee considers that it is a fundamental rule of procedure that a party may not appear on behalf of another without disclosing the representation and being empowered to that effect. As a matter of fact, a party is entitled to know against whom it is litigating.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 209.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 205.\n\n189.\n\nIn the instant case, however, the Committee already found that the Funding Agreement did not operate a transfer to Burford of the rights in dispute in the arbitration.233 Article 3.1 of the Funding Agreement states that its purpose is to \"*enable the Claimant to pursue its Claim*\", thus confirming the Claimants' ownership of the claim. Article 3.2 further states that \"*the Claimant may at any time without the consent of the Funder settle the claim for any amount or on any basis*\". Also, Article 6 of the Funding Agreement confirms that the Claimants will receive the proceeds of the Award (\"*the Claimant agrees to pay to the Funder the Recovery Amount immediately following receipt of all or any part of the Award*\"), which confirms that the Claimants continued to own the claims in dispute at all times during the arbitration. In sum, there is nothing in the Funding Agreement suggesting that the rights in dispute would have been transferred to the Funder. The fact that the Claimants agreed to pay to Burford the Recovery Amount (as defined in Schedule 2 to the Funding Agreement), i.e. a portion of the proceeds of the Award, does not mean that Burford had acquired ownership of the rights in dispute, and even less that it had become the real party to the arbitration. In conclusion, the Funding Agreement has not deprived the Claimants of their standing to pursue their claims.\n\n*See* \u00b6 92 *Supra*.\n\n190.\n\nArgentina contends, in this regard, that the Funding Agreement improperly imposed the presence as counsel of King & Spalding, which would amount to exercising control over the dispute.234\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 274.\n\n191.\n\nArticle 5.1 of the Funding Agreement provides, in this regard, that \"*the Claimant, (having taken or had* (sic) *the opportunity to take legal advice for itself in relation to this agreement* [\u2026] *and all other arrangements between itself), the Funder and the Nominated Lawyers, shall promptly appoint the Nominated Lawyers to prepare the Claim, submit the Claim to the Arbitration, prosecute the arbitration proceedings and enforce and recover any resulting Award favourable to the Claimant*\". The Nominated Lawyers are King & Spalding.\n\n192.\n\nAs an initial matter, it is to be noted that the presence of King & Spalding as the Claimants' counsel in the case predates the Funding Agreement. There can therefore be no doubt that King & Spalding was selected by the Claimants, and not by Burford. The Committee, in addition, fails to see why the inclusion in a funding agreement of provisions identifying the counsel in charge of representing the funded party, and providing that there shall be no non-agreed change in representation,235 would amount to an abusive control of the funder on the case. As a matter of fact, it seems entirely reasonable that funding be released in consideration of an agreement between the funder and the funded party on the identity of counsel in charge of the case. Also, the fact that the funded party assumes the obligation to instruct the agreed counsel does not mean that such counsel would cease to represent that funded party, or that that the funder would in any way take control over the case. In any event, Argentina failed to identify the fundamental rule of procedure that these provisions of the Funding Agreement would offend.\n\nFunding Agreement, Art. 6.3.\n\n193.\n\nArgentina further contends that the Funding Agreement resulted into an undue interference236 in the arbitration by Burford. Argentina relies,237 in this regard, on the fact that the Funding Agreement provides for the Claimants' obligation to accept a settlement agreement at certain conditions,238 that the Funding Agreement establishes a duty of cooperation,239 on the existence of limitations to the Claimants' right to initiate other legal proceedings,240 and on the fact that Burford had a right of access to information relating to the case.241\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 216.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 215.\n\nFunding Agreement, Art. 3.2 *in fine*.\n\n*Ibid.,* Art. 4.1.\n\n*Ibid.,* Art. 4.3.\n\n*Ibid.,* Art. 12.1.\n\n194.\n\nArgentina, again, does not identify the fundamental rule of procedure that these provisions of the Funding Agreement would breach. As said above, the Code of Conduct of the Litigation Funders Association is not a fundamental rule of procedure in an ICSID proceeding. Nor are the opinion of Prof. Catherine Kessedjian on funding good practices or the ruling of the Paris Bar referred to by Argentina.242 In addition, Argentina does not show that any of the provisions of the Funding Agreement it criticizes could amount in any way to an improper interference by Burford in the arbitration. Art. 3.2 essentially provides for an agreement between the Funder and the Claimants that any settlement agreement for an amount at least equal to USD 250 million shall be accepted with no need of a further agreement on the part of the Claimants. This is no more than an agreement between the parties to the Funding Agreement on what a reasonable settlement amount would be. The Committee does not find in Argentina's case any demonstration that such an agreement deprives the Claimants of their control over the case. Likewise, the provisions relating to the Claimants' duty of cooperation243 essentially aim at ensuring that the Claimants will provide King & Spalding with the necessary support and information for the claim to succeed. If anything, these provisions demonstrate that King & Spalding was at all times being instructed by the Claimants, not by Burford. The fact that the Claimants undertook not to initiate other legal proceedings that could prejudice the arbitration also seems to be entirely reasonable. Finally, the Committee fails to understand why the Funder's right to receive information relating to the case would amount into an impermissible interference in the conduct of the Claimants' defence by King & Spalding.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 216.\n\nFunding Agreement, Art. 4.1 and 4.2.\n\n195.\n\nFinally, Argentina has referred to the possibility that the Funding Agreement would result in conflicts of interest between King & Spalding and the Funder.244 Argentina, however did not specify to what conflicts of interests it referred to, and why they should be relevant to the decision of the Committee. There is indeed no demonstration whatsoever by Argentina of any conflict of interest arising from the Funding Agreement, involving either the Claimants, King & Spalding or any member of the Tribunal.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 212-213; Argentina's Opening, slide 35.\n\n196.\n\nIn sum, Argentina has not identified any fundamental rule of procedure that would be inconsistent with the Funding Agreement. It has also not provided any demonstration of the reason why the Funding Agreement amounted to an improper or abusive control on the case by Burford. Based on the foregoing, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not depart from any fundamental rule of procedure with respect of the Funding Agreement and the role of Burford.\n\n**(5) Misappropriation of Funds Received from SEPI**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n197.\n\nArgentina submits that the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure by granting protection to the investment in spite of the improper use by Air Comet of funds received from SEPI.245 Argentina, in this respect, makes two arguments. First, the Tribunal reversed the burden of proof regarding the capital increase of USD 50 million by imposing on Argentina the burden of proving the Claimants' investment.246 Second, the Tribunal failed to deal with its argument relating to the misuse of USD 205 million received from SEPI for the payment of debts of the Airlines.247\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 228-237; Annulment Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 183-191.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 229, 232; Argentina's Opening, slides, 104-106.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 236.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nThe Claimants point out that the Tribunal explained in its Decision on Jurisdiction and in the Award that Air Comet's alleged breaches could not affect jurisdiction because they would have occurred subsequent to the Claimants' acquisition of the investment.248 The Claimants also aver that the Tribunal dealt in the Award with all the issues relating to the use of funds provided by SEPI, and did not reverse the burden of proof concerning the USD 50 million capital contribution.249\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 210. See also, Award, \u00b6 267; and Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 324-328.\n\nAnnulment Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 107-108.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nIn the Committee's views, the arguments raised by Argentina concerning the misappropriation of the SEPI funds do not establish a ground for annulment for breach of a fundamental rule of procedure. Argentina's argument rather goes to the assessment of the evidence. An annulment committee has no powers to revisit the assessment of evidence made by the tribunal. Pursuant to Arbitration Rule 34(1), the tribunal is the judge of the admissibility as well as of the probative value of the evidence, and it is not up to an annulment committee to second-guess its findings in this regard. As a consequence, as said above,250 an error in the assessment of the evidence is no ground for annulment under Article 52.\n\n*See* \u00b6 174 s *upra*.\n\n200.\n\nArgentina first claims that the Tribunal reversed the burden of proof with respect to the USD 50 million capital contribution. In *Kl\u00f6ckner II*, the *ad hoc* Committee found that the burden of evidence is a procedural rather than a substantive issue, and that a reversal of the burden of proof may therefore amount to a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.251 In such a case, however, the departure must also be serious, meaning that it needs to have seriously affected the other party's right to present its case. At any rate, the Committee does not need to opine on whether, as a general matter, a reversal of the burden of proof may entail annulment, for in this case it is clear that there was no such reversal.\n\n*Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2 (\"***Kl\u00f6ckner II***\"), Decision on Annulment, May 17, 1990, \u00b6 6.80, unpublished and quoted in *Schreuer*, 52,327.\n\n201.\n\nArgentina refers to paragraphs 303 and 305 of the Award to submit that there was a reversal of the burden of proof with respect to this matter.252 At paragraph 303 of the Award (and footnote 202), however, the Tribunal makes clear reference to the arguments and evidence put forward by the Claimants to submit that contributions were made. Based on that evidence, the Tribunal found that \"*Respondent has failed to demonstrate the alleged breach of the SPA and that Claimants made additional capital contributions to the Airlines after their initial investment*\".253 The Tribunal, as a consequence, reached its conclusion on the basis on arguments and evidence put forward by the Claimants. There was no reversal of the burden of proof.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 232.\n\nAward, \u00b6 305.\n\n202.\n\nArgentina also makes the argument that the Tribunal failed to address its arguments relating to the misuse of USD 205 million provided by SEPI to Air Comet. The Committee has however already decided that a tribunal has no obligation to address each and every single argument advanced by the parties in support of their claims, and that a failure to address the alleged misuse of the USD 205 million would not amount to a manifest excess of powers.254 For the same reasons, the same argument cannot serve as a basis for annulment for serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Committee has also found255 that, in any event, the Tribunal did address the question and decided, explicitly and implicitly, that these sums could validly have been used to cover operational losses.256\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 135, 137 *supra*.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 138-139 *supra*.\n\nAward, \u00b6 377.\n\n203.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Committee decides that the Tribunal did not depart from a fundamental rule of procedure in its findings relating to the SEPI funds.\n\n**C. FAILURE TO STATE THE REASONS ON WHICH THE AWARD IS BASED**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nArgentina alleges (i) that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons with respect to its findings as to the existence of an investment,257 (ii) that the Tribunal's reasoning is contradictory with respect to the question of the validity of the powers of attorney,258 as well as (iii) with respect to the SEPI funds,259 and that (iv) it failed to express reasons regarding the international law principles on good faith.260 Argentina also relies on Article 52(1)(e) concerning the alleged failure to provide reasons on the use of the USD 205 million received from SEPI.261 Argentina then submits that the Tribunal failed to express reasons or expressed contradictory reasons with regard to the July 2008 Agreement,262 as well as to its assessment of damages.263\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 241, 242.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 255.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 262, 264.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 268.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 271.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 279.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 295-296; 308.\n\n**(1) Legal Standard**\n----------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n205.\n\nArgentina avers that the requirement that tribunals state the reasons for their decisions is an essential aspect of the ICSID arbitration.264 In this regard, Argentina cites the *Tidewater* annulment committee, according to which \"\u2026 [t]*he legitimacy of an arbitral decision to invalidate a sovereign act would be severely undermined if the tribunal did not have to explain why the act contradicts the law*.\"265\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 52.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 53, citing *Tidewater,* Decision on Annulment, \u00b6 165 (**AL RA 419**).\n\n206.\n\nArgentina submits that annulment committees have considered as a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e), amongst others: a total absence of reasons, incoherent reasons or reasons that do not allow to understand the solution, frivolous, contradictory, insufficient or inadequate reasons, the failure to deal with a question that may affect the final decision of that tribunal and even the failure to address certain relevant evidence.\n\n207.\n\nFinally, Argentina contends that in the presence of a failure to state reasons, an annulment committee cannot imagine or make up what could have been the tribunal's reasons, and should therefore annul the award.266\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, as held by many annulment committees and emphasized by commentators, the requirement to state reasons is intended to enable readers to understand and follow the reasoning of the tribunal.267 Failure to state reasons therefore requires \"*a finding that the tribunal failed to provide any reasons at all or, at a minimum, provided reasons so extremely flawed that a good-faith reader cannot follow the reasoning in the award through its conclusion*.\"268 Finally, tribunals have no duty to discuss each and every question raised by the parties and must be allowed a degree of discretion regarding how they express their reasoning.269\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 122-123.\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 125.\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 129-130.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nThe Committee considers, consistently with many committees having addressed arguments based on Article 52(1)(e),270 that Article 52(1)(e) expresses the minimum requirement that a good faith reader of the award can understand the motives that led the Tribunal to adopt its decisions. In assessing whether that is the case, the award must be considered in its entirety. The mere fact that reasons are unclear or imperfectly expressed is therefore insufficient to annul an award. Likewise, contradictory reasons may only entail annulment if the contradiction is such that it becomes impossible to understand the motives that led such tribunal to adopt its solution.\n\n*See, e.g.,* *MINE,* \u00b6 5.08-5.09, (**AL RA 418**); *Vivendi I,* \u00b6 64, **(C-403)** ; *Wena*, Decision on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 79-81, **(C-621)** ; *CDC* \u00b6\u00b6 70-75, (**AL RA 420** ***bis***); *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v.

Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/7, Decision on Annulment, December 10, 2010 \u00b6 355 (**AL RA 446**).\n\n210.\n\nThe Committee also agrees with the Claimants that a tribunal has no duty to follow the parties in the detail of their arguments, and that the sole fact of failing to address one or more of the same does not in itself entail annulment, unless the argument in question was so important that it would clearly have been determinative of the outcome. Likewise, a tribunal has no duty to address in its award all the evidence that is in the record, and failure to do so does not entail annulment unless the evidence that such tribunal failed to address was manifestly so important as to change the outcome of the arbitration. Apart from that situation, it is not the role of a Committee to step into the shoes of an arbitrator and engage into speculation as to the relevance that a piece of evidence that a tribunal did not address would have had on the award.\n\n211.\n\nFinally, the control of the existence of reasons is exclusive of any review of the award on the merits, and a committee may not annul an award for failure to provide reasons on the basis that the reasoning is incorrect in fact or in law.\n\n**(2) Jurisdictional finding concerning the existence of an investment**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n212.\n\nArgentina submits that the Tribunal failed to explain how the Claimants' shareholdings in the Spanish company Air Comet could be considered to be assets in Argentina, and how Air Comet's shareholdings in Interinvest could be considered to be assets acquired by the Claimants, in accordance with the definition of investment under the Argentina-Spain BIT and the ICSID Convention.271\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 249; Reply, \u00b6 194.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Award did not fail to state the reasons on which the Tribunal supported its finding that the Claimants had standing to bring the Arbitration. The Tribunal explained its reasons on this issue clearly and coherently across more than 30 paragraphs, some of which are cited in paragraph 182 of the Claimants' Counter-Memorial.272\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 178-184.\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that the Tribunal dedicated several pages in the Decision on Jurisdiction and in the Award explaining and describing the Claimants' various \"investments\" in Argentina, and they provide a summary of the Tribunal's reasoning and findings on this issue.273\n\nAnnulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 185.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nContrary to Argentina's averment, the Tribunal's decision as to the existence of an investment and of an investor under the BIT is reasoned. The Tribunal explained why the Claimants qualified as investors under the BIT.274 The Tribunal also explained, at paragraphs 208 to 232 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, why in its view Article I(2) of the BIT protected not only investments directly made in Argentina, but also indirect investments. The Tribunal also discussed in the Award whether the objective requirements of contribution and risk were met.275 The reasoning followed by the Tribunal is exempt of contradictions. Argentina says that the Tribunal failed to apply the Vienna Convention in its interpretation of Article I(2) of the BIT.276 But what matters in the context of Article 52(1)(e) is that there is an understandable explanation of how the Tribunal reached its conclusion. There is no failure to provide reasons unless such failure makes the decision impossible to understand, which is not the case here.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 207, 214, 221-32.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 250-57, 267, 315, 373, 381.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 239; 246.\n\n216.\n\nArgentina also complains that the Tribunal relied on a decision made on the basis of another bilateral treaty.277 However, such a circumstance does not constitute a failure to state reasons.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 244.\n\n217.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not fail to provide reasons in its jurisdictional findings.\n\n**(3) Lack of Capacity of the Claimants' Counsel**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n218.\n\nArgentina submits that the Tribunal contradicted itself in first accepting that Spanish law was applicable to King & Spalding's powers of attorney, to then ignore that same law that it had identified as applicable.278\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6 254-261. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 207-217.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimants' position on this issue is reflected under paragraphs 101-108 *supra.*\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nThe Committee has already addressed Argentina's argument in the context of the discussion on manifest excess of powers.\n\n221.\n\nAt paragraph 118 of this Decision, the Committee found that the Tribunal's reasoning on the validity of the powers of attorney was \"*based on an analysis of the various legal provisions at stake, in view of the legal opinion of a Spanish law professor upon which the Claimants relied*\", and that the Tribunal's findings rested \"*on (i) the Tribunal's analysis of Article 61(2) of the Spanish Bankruptcy law, according to which the Retainer Agreement between the Claimants and King & Spalding was still in force in absence of termination, (ii) the Tribunal's analysis of Article 48(3) of that same law, according to which the powers of attorney had been \"affected or limited\" but not terminated as a consequence of the suspension, and (iii) its finding that said powers had in any event been ratified by way of the undated letters signed by the insolvency administrators and that said ratification was not subject in Spanish law to a specific form*\". The Committee also noted that *\"[t]he Tribunal also found that the October 2015 public deeds were relevant to the question of the validity of the King & Spalding's powers of attorney and their authority to represent the Claimants in the arbitration.*\"279 In the eyes of the Committee, these conclusions are reasoned and are not contradictory.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures, \u00b6 172.\n\n**(4) Misappropriation of Funds Received from SEPI**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n222.\n\nArgentina first submits that the Tribunal contradicted itself by, on the one side, stating that the Claimants acknowledged that Air Comet did not pay the entirety of the USD 50 million capital contribution and, on the other side, finding that Argentina had failed to prove that Air Comet breached the SPA.280 Argentina also avers,281 with respect to the USD 300 million funds, that the Tribunal also contradicted itself by, on the one hand, acknowledging that the acquisition and subrogation of the debt had not been made in accordance with the SPA and, on the other, holding that \"*there is no basis to conclude that the alleged noncompliance with the terms of the SPA has been made out nor that any deviation from the original terms of the SPA would provide a basis for finding that the transaction was illegal or would justify denying jurisdiction on the basis that the investment was not made in accordance with Argentina's legislation*\".282 Finally, Argentina complains that the Tribunal failed to address its argument relating to the USD 205 million funds.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 263.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 264.\n\nAward, \u00b6 289.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nThe Claimants essentially submit that SEPI never complained about the use of the funds under the SPA, and that there was no evidence that this matter was relevant to the jurisdiction or to the merits. The Tribunal's decision had clear record support, even if it was not stated so expressly.283\n\nTr. Day 1, 202:22-203:7.\n\n224.\n\nRegarding Argentina's complaint that the Tribunal \"*did not analyse or settle the issue concerning the use of the USD 205 million contributed to SEPI*\",284 the Claimants note that such funds were principally used for leasing and operational expenses,285 and submit that the use of those funds were also subject to auditing by PriceWaterHouseCoopers under the terms of the SPA.\n\nClaimants' Opening, slide 128, citing Annulment Reply, \u00b6 96.\n\nClaimants' Opening, slide 129, citing Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 202, 212.\n\n225.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Argentina had the remedy for this issue: it could have sought a supplementary decision under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 49, but it chose not to avail itself of that remedy, and it cannot now seek annulment under those same grounds here.286\n\nClaimants' Opening, slide 131. Tr. Day 1, 203:8-203: 13.\n\n***c. The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Committee notes that the Tribunal devoted no less than fifteen pages of its Award287 to discuss in detail Argentina's averments concerning the use of the SEPI funds. In view of the Committee, in so doing, the Tribunal has provided a comprehensive and detailed answer to Argentina's arguments, which generally satisfies the requirement under Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention that the Award be reasoned. The Tribunal had no duty to follow the Parties in the detail of their case and a failure to address each and every single argument put before it does not in itself amount to a failure to provide reasons. The Committee will now address the two specific complaints articulated by Argentina under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\nAward, pp. 69-84.\n\n227.\n\nConcerning first of all the argument relating to the use of the USD 50 million contribution, there is no contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning. The Tribunal's conclusion that \"*the Respondent has failed to demonstrate the alleged breach of the SPA*\"288 was based on its earlier finding that \"*neither Party indicates that Air Comet was ever found to be in default of its obligation to make the USD 50 million investment, nor that SEPI took any steps under the SPA or otherwise in this regard*\", and that \"*the Spanish Audit Court concluded that Air Comet had complied with its obligation to increase the capital of ARSA by USD 50 million (albeit somewhat late). The Tribunal de Cuentas determined that Air Comet paid in cash approximatively 25% of the amount on February 9, 2003 and the balance by February 11, 2005*\".289 The Tribunal therefore explained that its finding that no breach occurred with regard to the USD 50 million payment was based on the fact that SEPI never complained about any breach, and that the Spanish Audit Court had found that the obligations provided by the SPA had been complied with.\n\nAward, \u00b6 305.\n\nAward, \u00b6 304.\n\n228.\n\nAs concerns the USD 300 million funds, contrary to Argentina's averment,290 the Tribunal did not acknowledge that the acquisition and subrogation had not taken place in accordance with the SPA. The exact words of the Tribunal are that \"*while the acquisition and subrogation may not have been in accordance with the SPA as originally contemplated, the parties subsequently agreed to a different handling of the USD 300 million contributed by SEPI*\".291 Here again, the basis for the Tribunal's finding are clear: the Tribunal found that SEPI had acknowledged before the *Tribunal de Cuentas* that the way the funds had been used was permitted by the SPA.292 As a consequence, there was no basis to find that the SPA had been breached. There was therefore no contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 264.\n\nAward, \u00b6 289.\n\n*Ibid.,* \"*SEPI's position before the Tribunal de Cuentas was that this was permitted by the SPA*\".\n\n229.\n\nFinally, for what concerns the USD 205 million funds, Argentina's argument is that this amount should have been used to extinguish debts and liabilities of ARSA and AUSA, and that they were instead used to pay off operating costs, fees and gasoline costs.293 It is true that the argument is only cursively addressed in the Award. The Tribunal noted that \"*SEPI later agreed to contribute an additional USD 205 million to cover the operational losses suffered by the Airlines between July and October 2001*\",294 but says nothing concerning the way these funds were effectively used.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 271.\n\nAward, \u00b6 377.\n\n230.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, appears to have implicitly concluded that SEPI had no complaint as to the way these funds had been used. The Tribunal, as a matter of fact, held that \"*Claimants' investment was also the subject of further review by the Tribunal de Cuentas. In Report N\u00b0765 dated July 19, 2007, the court again addressed the transfer of the USD 300 million and the various other post-closing obligations contained in the SPA. In its conclusion, the court noted that SEPI had submitted a number of other documents, which did not demonstrate that the debts had been finally contributed to ARSA. This appears to have led the court to again address this subject in its next report (N\u00b0811), discussed below. The Court did note that SEPI submitted documentation demonstrating that other requirements under the SPA, such as Air Comet's capital contribution of USD 50 million to ARSA, had been performed*\".295 The Committee understands the references to the \"*the various other post-closing obligations contained in the SPA*\" and to \"*other requirements under the SPA*\" to cover not only the USD 300 million and USD 50 million funds, but also the USD 205 million quantified based on Article 11 of the SPA. This means that the *Tribunal de Cuentas* had no objection as to the way these funds had been used. The Tribunal held that any breach of the SPA with respect to these payments could not affect jurisdiction,296 and it also found that \"*there is no basis to conclude that* [\u2026] *any deviation from the original terms of the SPA would provide a basis for finding that the transaction was illegal or would justify declining jurisdiction on the basis that the investment was not made in accordance with Argentina's legislation*\".297 These findings apply to the various funds paid by SEPI to Air Comet pursuant to Articles 9 and 11 of the SPA, including the USD 205 million. Because the Award allows understanding the Tribunal's findings on all aspects of the use of the SEPI funds, there is no failure to provide reasons, including with respect to the USD 205 million fund.\n\nAward, \u00b6 285.\n\nAward, \u00b6 267.\n\nAward, \u00b6 289.\n\n231.\n\nFinally, Argentina did not explain in the annulment proceedings why a departure from the SPA concerning these payments (i.e. the use of the USD 205 million to cover operational costs instead of debts and liabilities) would have been a breach of the principle of good faith in international law susceptible to entail the inadmissibility of the claims. As a consequence, any omission to deal with that argument would have been immaterial and would not have been such as to entail the annulment of the Award for failure to provide reasons.\n\n232.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not fail to provide reasons concerning the use of the SEPI funds, and that any failure to provide reasons in respect of the USD 205 million argument would not be such as to entail the annulment of the Award.\n\n**(5) The July 2008 Agreement**\n-------------------------------\n\n***a. Argentina's Position***\n-----------------------------\n\n233.\n\nArgentina submits that \"*in establishing the international responsibility of Argentina for the breach of the BIT based on the non-compliance with the July 2008 Agreement and determining the damages flowing from such breach, the majority of the Tribunal failed to state reasons on crucial issues and incurred irreconcilable contradictions. This warrants annulment of the Award within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention*.\"298\n\nAnnulment Reply, \u00b6 231. Annulment Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 278-315.

The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons in finding that Argentina breached the BIT.303 The Tribunal explained in detail the various elements of Argentina's conduct that gave rise to the breach of the July 2008 Agreement, why that breach also violated the FET standard, and the Tribunal further addressed Argentina's submission that contract breaches cannot be equated to the FET standard,304 as well as its findings on quantum.305\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 232-244.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 232.

The Committee's Analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nConcerning first of all Argentina's averment that the Award does not allow understanding how a breach of contract could be held to be a treaty breach, the Tribunal expressed clear and coherent reasons.\n\n237.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered Argentina's argument that not every breach of contract by a State constitutes a violation of the duty of fair and equitable treatment. It accepted that proposition,306 but nonetheless held that \"*the July 2008 Agreement was not a simple commercial agreement*\",307 and therefore that \"*Interinvest and the Claimants legitimately expected Respondent to comply with its commitment to purchase all the shares in the Airlines at the price determined by the agreed mechanism in Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement*\".308 The Tribunal then found that Argentina's refusal to comply with the procedure established by Article 6 was a breach of these legitimate expectations and further found that its conduct \"*in relation to the introductory message and bill seeking approval of the July 2008 Agreement, the adoption of Law N\u00b0 26,412, the objections as to the form of the Credit Suisse valuation, the injunction appointing a controller over the Airlines, the maintenance of Mr. Alak as General Manager of the Airlines and the decision to proceed by expropriation lacked transparency and was arbitrary*\".309 The Tribunal therefore concluded that Argentina \"*breached the FET standard in the Treaty*\".310\n\nAward, \u00b6 854.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 855.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 856.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 857.\n\n238.\n\nIt is not for the Committee to opine as to whether these findings are correct. These findings are however reasoned, clear, and understandable.\n\n239.\n\nArgentina also contends that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons for its decision to reject its umbrella clause argument. However, the Tribunal explained why it rejected the argument made by the Claimants, based on the BIT's MFN clause, to the effect that they would be entitled to rely on an umbrella clause.311\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 884-892.\n\n240.\n\nFor what regards the assessment of damages, Argentina's first argument is that the Tribunal's reasoning is contradictory because the Tribunal could not on the one hand accept that the function of damages is to replace the aggrieved party in the situation that would have prevailed in the absence of breach (i.e. an assessment of the price of the shares made by an independent valuator) and on the other hand fix damages on the basis of the valuation proposed by Interinvest in the price fixing procedure provided by Article 6 of the SPA.312\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 295 seq.\n\n241.\n\nThe Committee finds no contradiction in the Tribunal's reasoning on point. The Tribunal concluded that \"*the Credit Suisse valuation* [is] *the most reliable expression of the value of the Airlines as agreed by the Parties under the July 2008 Agreement and the best evidence of the fair market value of the Airlines in late 2008*\".313 That conclusion was based not only on an analysis of the Credit Suisse valuation, but also of third-party valuations made in the context of the May 2008 Agreement by Deloitte, Morgan Stanley and PriceWaterHouseCoopers.314 The Tribunal also analysed the valuations proposed by Compass Lexecon for the Claimants,315 and by KPMG for Argentina, which it found unreliable.316 The Tribunal explained why in its view the Deloitte, Morgan Stanley, PriceWaterHouseCoopers and Credit Suisse third-party valuations were a reliable indicator of the value of the Airlines317 and having compared them it found that the one proposed by Credit Suisse was the best evidence of the Airlines' fair market value in late 2008.\n\nAward, \u00b6 1112.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 1102.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 1105.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 592.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 1106.\n\n242.\n\nArgentina's argument rests on a conceptual error: in adopting the Credit Suisse valuation, the Tribunal did in fact not purport to enforce the July 2008 Agreement. Argentina avers that Credit Suisse was not independent, and criticizes the Tribunal for holding that circumstance to be irrelevant.318 Argentina further contends that this lack of independence did not allow the Tribunal to adopt its conclusions as being \"*final and binding*\", as provided by Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement.319 However, the Tribunal did not adopt the Credit Suisse valuation as the final and binding valuation provided by Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement. Nor did it, as suggested by Argentina, adopt the Credit Suisse valuation as a substitute to the valuation provided for by Article 6 of the July 2008 Agreement.320 It rather found, based on the other available valuations in the record, that the Credit Suisse valuation was the best available evidence of the fair market value of the Airlines at the time of the taking, which is different.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 312.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 314.\n\n243.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the FET standard had been breached. It did not decide to order specific performance. As a consequence, in accordance with the full reparation standard in international law, the Claimants were entitled to damages equal to the fair market value of the Airlines at the time of the taking. The Tribunal found that fair market value was reflected by the Credit Suisse valuation. There is no contradiction in that reasoning. Nor is the Tribunal's reasoning unclear and even less incomprehensible.\n\n244.\n\nWhether, in assessing damages, the Tribunal over-compensated the Claimants is not a question that an *ad hoc* Committee has the power to assess under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n245.\n\nArgentina also points out that the Tribunal had acknowledged the difficult financial situation of the Airlines, which would be inconsistent with a valuation exceeding USD 300 million.321 The Tribunal has indeed found that the Airlines were \"*in a very difficult financial condition by the end of 2007 and early 2008*\".322 According to Argentina, this finding is contradictory with the assessment of a positive fair market value.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 307.\n\nAward, \u00b6 750.\n\n246.\n\nThe Committee disagrees. As an initial matter, the Tribunal found that ARSA had no value and that only AUSA had value. Second, there is no conceptual inconsistency in finding that a company in a difficult situation may generate value in the future. Such a finding may well be based on the financial assumptions concerning the future business perspectives of the Airlines at the time of the taking, which an *ad hoc* committee may of course not assess or second guess.\n\n247.\n\nThe Committee will finally address Argentina's argument that the Tribunal failed to deal with the comments and criticisms contained in the KPMG report and in the TTN valuation report on the Credit Suisse valuation.323 Argentina, in this respect, asserts that both reports made a number of specific criticisms to the Credit Suisse report, which the Tribunal should have considered and addressed.324\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 308 seq.\n\nAnnulment Memorial, \u00b6 310 for the KPMG report and \u00b6 309 for the TTN report.\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimants respond that the Tribunal did discuss the KPMG and TTN reports in different parts of the Award.325 These sections of the Award, however, do not discuss the criticism made by KPMG and TTN to the Credit Suisse report. These sections rather address the valuations proposed by KPMG and TTN, and explain why the Tribunal did not find them to be reliable.326\n\nFor the KPMG report, Award, \u00b6\u00b6 510-511, 592-593, 823, 825, 1112-1113 (see transcript, Tr. Day 2 \u2013 356:11 to 364:3); for the TTN report, Annulment Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 278 (referring to \u00b6\u00b6 830-834 and 1112 of the Award.\n\nFor KPMG report, Award, \u00b6\u00b6 592-593, dealing however with the different question whether airfare increases matched increases on the Airlines costs. For TTN, Award, \u00b6 1112.\n\n249.\n\nThe Committee, however, does not believe that this situation can entail the annulment of the Award. As a matter of fact, as long as the award allows understanding the basis for the tribunal's findings (which it does), a tribunal has no duty to comment on the details of all the evidence produced by the parties. A failure by the Tribunal to comment on certain portions of an expert report produced by a party, which the Tribunal may have found to be irrelevant, is therefore not such as to entail the annulment of the Award. This is all the more so that Argentina does not allege to have relied, in its submissions before the Tribunal, on the parts of the KPMG and TTN reports upon which it now relies to sustain that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons.\n\n250.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not fail to provide reasons with respect to its assessment of the damages.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**A. ARGENTINA'S COST SUBMISSIONS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nIn its submission on costs, Argentina argues that the Claimants should bear the total arbitration costs incurred by Argentina, including legal fees and expenses, totalling USD 884,319.88, broken down as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CONCEPT | ARS | USD |\n| Translations | 93,467.95 | 2,296.51 |\n| Airfare, accommodation, travel | 1,069,319.45 | 27,992.66 |\n| Courier | 68,014.88 | 1,671.13 |\n| Office supplies | 7,500.00 | 184.28 |\n| Communication costs | 1,500.00 | 36.86 |\n| ICSID costs | - | 725,000.00 |\n| PTN personnel expenses | 2,981,134.97 | 127,138.46 |\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total | **4,220,937.25** | **884,319.88** |\n\n**B.

Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n254.\n\nThe costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD): 359,060.45327\n\nCommittee Members' fees and expenses\n\nMr. Alexis Mourre, USD 100,999.96\n\nProf. Fernando Cantuarias Salaverrry, USD 67,903.54\n\nMr. Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez USD 53,796.93\n\nICSID's administrative fees USD 84,000.00\n\nDirect expenses (estimated)328 USD 52,360.02\n\n**Total USD 359,060.45**\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account once all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\nThis amount includes estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Decision (courier, printing and copying).\n\n255.\n\nThe above costs have been entirely paid out of the advances made by Argentina.329\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to Argentina.\n\n256.\n\nThe Committee considers that, Argentina having failed in all the arguments that it has advanced in order to seek the annulment of the Award, it should bear the entirety of the costs of the proceedings. Argentina having advanced said costs in their entirety, the Claimants are not entitled to any payment in this respect.\n\n257.\n\nAs to the Parties' legal costs and expenses, the Committee considers, for the same reasons, that the Claimants having prevailed in the annulment proceedings, they are entitled to be compensated for their costs. However, the Committee notes a significant disproportion between the representation costs of each party. While the Claimants have spent USD 1,514,322 in fees, Argentina has only spent 2,981,134.97 ARS (i.e slightly more than USD127,138.46). It is widely accepted that *ad hoc* committees enjoy a wide discretion in assessing the reasonableness of the parties' representation costs.330 In view of the complexity of the case and the interests at stake, the Committee decides that the Claimants are entitled to be reimbursed of their representation costs in an amount of USD 1,000,000, in addition to their expenses, i.e. a total amount of USD 1,017,512.\n\nICSID Convention Articles 52(4) & 61(2); Arbitration Rules 47(1)(j) & 53; Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e).

DECISION**\n----------------\n\n258.\n\nFor the reasons stated *supra*, the Committee decides as follows:\n\n(1) Argentina's request for annulment is denied;\n\n(2) Argentina shall bear the entirety of the costs of the proceedings and shall pay to the Claimants an amount of USD 1,017,512 on account of their representation costs;\n\n(3) All other claims are dismissed."}]}
