Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 29 November 2007, Respondent filed with the ICSID Secretariat a challenge to Professor Gabrielle Kaufman-Kohler, citing both Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Argentine Republic also made reference to Rules 10, 11 and 12, which address other procedural matters arising during and after a tribunal vacancy.\n\n2.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention provides that a party may propose disqualification of a tribunal member on account of \"any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14\".\n\n3.\n\nArticle 14 requires *inter alia* that persons designated to serve may be relied upon to \"exercise independent judgment.\"\n\n4.\n\nRule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides in pertinent part that the arbitrator to whom a disqualification proposal relates may \"furnish explanations\" and that the other members of the tribunal shall promptly consider and vote on the proposal in the absence of the arbitrator concerned.\n\n5.\n\nOn 4 December 2007, the President of the Tribunal invited Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler and counsel for the Claimants to submit any observations on the matter by 21 December 2007, and granted both sides an opportunity to comment on Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler's observations by 16 January 2008.\n\n6.\n\nProfessor Kaufmann-Kohler presented her comments in a letter dated 21 December 2007 addressed to Mr. Gonzalo Flores. Arnold & Porter, counsel for Claimants, set forth its position in a letter of even date addressed to Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson. On 16 January 2008 Claimants and Respondent filed with ICSID their respective observations on the comments made by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. On 11 February 2008 Claimants filed observations on Respondent's comments dated 16 January 2008. On 29 February 2008 Respondent replied to Claimants' letter, attaching an expert report of Professor Charles W. Wolfram of Cornell Law School.\n\n7.\n\nPursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(4), the remaining members of the Tribunal, Professor Park and Professor Rem\u00f3n, have carefully considered Respondent's contentions, as well as the comments by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the position of Claimants.\n\n8.\n\nFor the reasons set forth below, the challenge must be rejected.\n\n**II. The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n**1. Challenge of 29 November 2007**\n------------------------------------\n\n**a) Overview**\n---------------\n\n9.\n\nIn its Challenge, the Argentine Republic addressed not only the present arbitration (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23), but also Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's service in the following other cases:\n\ni. ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17 with Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Interagua Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A.;\n\nii. ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 with Suez, Vivendi Universal S.A. and Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A.;\n\niii. ICSID Case No. ARB/03/22 with Electricidad Argentina S.A. and EDFI S.A.; and\n\niv. UNCITRAL Arbitration with Anglian Water Ltd.\n\n10.\n\nThis Challenge Decision takes no position on any of the other proceedings, which must each be addressed on its own merits.\n\n11.\n\nFor the sake of good order, we note that the same President chairs both the present arbitration and ICSID Case No. ARB/03/22. Nevertheless, the challenge in the other proceeding will be addressed only after (i) termination of the stay in that case and (ii) appointment of a successor arbitrator to Professor de Trazegnies Granda.\n\n**b) Specific Assertions**\n--------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn 19 April 2006, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was appointed to the Board of Directors at the Swiss banking establishment, UBS A.G. In this connection, Respondent put forth the following contentions:\n\ni. UBS recommends that its customers invest in El\u00e9ctricit\u00e9 de France (\"EDF\"), the parent corporation of EDF International, one of the Claimants in this arbitration.\n\nii. UBS and EDF have a common interest in the company AEM Milan (\"AEM\"), in that UBS held 5.32% of the shares of that company, and that EDF effectively controlled AEM through the intermediary company Transalpina de Energ\u00eda.\n\niii. UBS and EDF have a common interest in the Swiss entity Motor Columbus. EDF acquired share capital in that company from UBS in a proportion of 17.3% in October 2005 and another 17.32% in March 2006.\n\niv. In October 2005 EDF placed a share offer in the French financial market with the assistance of UBS Limited.\n\nv. UBS Investment Foundation lists EDF securities (asserted to amount to 3% of the EDF shares) within its foreign obligations denominated in Swiss francs.\n\n**c) Applicable Standard**\n--------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Argentine Republic stresses that Article 14 of the ICSID Convention requires that an arbitrator must be someone who \"may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment\". By its express terms, Article 14 applies to \"persons designated to serve on the Panels\" of ICSID. However, Article 57 makes reference to Article 14 in connection with disqualification of any member of an arbitral tribunal (whether on the Panel or not) who evidences a \"manifest lack of the qualities\" required by Article 14.\n\n14.\n\nRespondent mentions Articles 9 and 10 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, which speak of \"justifiable doubts\" with respect to impartiality or independence. We understand that reference to apply to the Anglian Water case conducted under the UNCITRAL Rules (not subject to this Challenge Decision) but with suggested persuasive value for this present arbitration.\n\n15.\n\nProfessor Schreuer is cited for the proposition that the \"manifest\" nature of any lack in the qualifies required under Article 14 should be defined as \"easily understood or recognized by the mind.\"1\n\n*See* Christoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (Cambridge, 2001), at 932.\n\n16.\n\nUnder the standards of Article 14, Respondent argues that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler failed to report the existence of facts that raise questions about her impartiality and independence.\n\n17.\n\nIn support of its contentions, Respondent also provides an extensive discussion of the *Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration* approved by the International Bar Association in 2004.\n\n18.\n\nThe Argentine Republic supplements its arguments with reference cases decided by national courts. These include *inter alia* the United States Supreme Court decision in *Commonwealth Coatings v. Continental Casualty*, 393 U.S. 145 (1968). From the United Kingdom, Respondent cites House of Lords decisions in *The Pinochet Case* (17 December 1998 and 15 January 1999) and the other in *Magill v. Porter* (2001 UKHL 67).\n\n19.\n\nThe 2003 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is cited for the proposition that a financial interest may be indirect, but nevertheless damaging to the integrity of the arbitral process.2\n\nUNCTAD, Dispute Settlement, International Commercial Arbitration, Section 5.3 (2003).\n\n20.\n\nFinally, Respondent also draws our attention to the writings of other eminent authorities on arbitration, including Professor Carlo Santulli and Professor Albert Jan van den Berg.\n\n**2. Observations of 16 January 2008**\n--------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nRespondent on 16 January 2008 presented Observations on Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's comments dated 21 December 2007. The Argentine Republic compares the alleged conflict of interest to the offense of a motorist who ignores a red light, or a judge to decide a case in which his daughter acts as counsel. The behavior is wrong *per se* in all instances.\n\n22.\n\nThe Argentine Republic also cites at length several authorities on conflicts of interest, including the work of Professor Carrie Menkel-Meadow, *Ethical Issues in Arbitration and Related Dispute Resolution Processes*.3\n\nProfessor Carrie Menkel-Meadow, Ethical Issues in Arbitration and Related Dispute Resolution Processes: What's Happening and What's Not, 56 U. Miami L. Rev. 949 (2002).\n\n23.\n\nRespondent's Observations reject the view put forward by Claimants' lawyers to the effect that the attempt to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler represents disruptive and dilatory behaviour.\n\n**a) Dealings Between UBS with EDF**\n------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nRespondent presents additional arguments with respect to the various alleged disqualifying relationships involving UBS and EDF, including *inter alia* the AEM ownership and the recommendation of EDF shares.\n\n**b) Duty to Disclosure Appointment to UBS Board**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nRespondent argues that both Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and Claimants were required to disclose to the Argentine Republic any relationship between the Professor and Claimants. Respondent also contends that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was subject to a duty to investigate any potential conflict of interest, which according to Respondent included membership in the UBS Board. Respondent states that this asserted duty has been memorialized in General Principles 3 and 7 of the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest.\n\n**c) UBS Board Responsibilities**\n---------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Argentine Republic emphasizes the duties of a UBS board member, even one who is non-executive. Citations are presented from the UBS Handbook, the UBS Charter for Directors, the Organization Regulations of UBS and the UBS Articles of Association, showing that the Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility of management of the corporation.\n\n**d) Access to Information**\n----------------------------\n\n27.\n\nRespondent further cites portions of the UBS sources listed above in order to show the extent of information made available to members of the Board of Directors. In Respondent's view, it is difficult to defend an argument that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler lacked knowledge of the controverted transactions.\n\n**e) Remuneration**\n-------------------\n\n28.\n\nAs pointed out by Respondent, the UBS Handbook states that a Board member receives a base fee of FS 300 thousand, paid 50% in cash and 50% in restricted UBS shares.4 Non-executive Board members may elect to receive their remuneration entirely in restricted UBS shares.\n\nRespondent's Objections to the Comments by Mrs. Kauffman-Kohler and Comments by Claimants of 16 January 2008, para. 66, citing the 2006/2007 UBS Handbook, at 136, filed as Respondent's Annex XXVI.\n\n**f) Appearance of Impropriety**\n--------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nRespondent emphasizes several recent disqualification cases in which arbitrators have been held to a high standard of avoiding any appearance of impropriety. In particular, the Argentine Republic discusses *SGS v. Pakistan*,5 and the decision on disqualification in *Vivendi v. Argentine Republic*.6\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13), Decision on Claimant's Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator of 19 December 2002, 8 *ICSID Rep.* 398 (2005).\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on the Challenge to the President of the Committee of 3 October 2001, [English original] 17 *ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ* 168 (2002); 6 *ICSID Rep.* 330 (2004); 125 *I.L.R.* 46 (2004); [Spanish original] 17 *ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ* 182 (2002), also available at www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n30.\n\nRespondent also invokes standards set forth in the UCITRAL Rules, which address \"justifiable doubts\" with respect to an arbitrator's impartiality and independence.\n\n**3. Reply to Claimants' February Letter and Wolfram Report**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nOn 14 February 2008, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimants' letter of 11 February 2008.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent filed its observations on 29 February 2008, attaching an expert report of Charles W. Wolfram, Emeritus Professor at Cornell Law School, but now living in retirement in Berkeley, California.\n\n33.\n\nWe note in passing that Professor Wolfram makes no claim to have any experience with arbitration, whether international or domestic. Instead, his work has addressed professional ethics in the context of American practice, which is to say, the principles applicable to the bar and the bench within the United States. Thus we understand his opinion to be offered for its analogies between judges and arbitrators, but not any specialization in arbitration.\n\n34.\n\nApart from the ICSID Convention and Rules themselves, the legal authority cited in support of his conclusions appears limited to two sources: (a) the U.S. Supreme Court decision in *Commonwealth Coatings v. Continental Casualty*7; and (b) the IBA Guidelines on Conflict of Interests (2004).8\n\n*Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v. Continental Casualty Co. et al.*, 393 U.S. 145 (1968).\n\n*See* Expert Report of Charles W. Wolfram, 29 February 2008, footnote 12.\n\n35.\n\nProfessor Wolfram concludes that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler demonstrated a manifest lack of the qualities required of arbitrators under the ICSID Convention in joining the UBS Board in failing to disclose that association. Because UBS holds stock in EDF, and recommends EDF to clients, Professor Wolfram considers that there exists an economic incentive for UBS to favor Claimants, and consequently that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's \"loyalty interests\" will lead her to follow suit in this proceeding.\n\n36.\n\nProfessor Wolfram's report suggests that the relative size of the UBS holdings in EDF is not material for purposes of challenge to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. In paragraph 9 (quoted by Respondent on page 2 of its submission of 29 February 2008), Professor Wolfram proposed a \"thought experiment\" in which a small bank holds 10% of its assets in EDF and other Claimants. In this scenario, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler would be disqualified.\n\n37.\n\nProfessor Wolfram then takes the next step of asking rhetorically whether the size of UBS holdings becomes immaterial \"...merely because UBS is not a small bank, but instead is... the 9th largest publicly traded enterprise in the world?\" Rather than answering the question directly, the legal opinion asserts that \"...somewhere and at some level of responsibility within the UBS bureaucracy were managers who...well might have been motivated to attempt [to] influence [Professor Kaufmann-Kohler].\".9\n\n*Id.,* para. 9.\n\n38.\n\nThe legal opinion goes on to contend that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler would be motivated to advance the interests of UBS in a way that should cause her disqualification as an arbitrator in this case. Such motivation allegedly arises from her institutional loyalty, as a part of the UBS team, and her economic self-interest, from her compensation as a UBS director.\n\n39.\n\nProfessor Wolfram also makes comments on the alleged \"campaign\" of Argentina to disrupt the proceedings. Given that we find no evidence of any such intent to interrupt or frustrate this process (see discussion *supra*), that consideration need not be addressed.\n\n40.\n\nArgentina's submission builds upon many of the themes raised in the opinion of Professor Wolfram. Respondent argues that the ties between UBS and EDF give rise to an objective conflict for Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, regardless of the size of the EDF holdings.\n\n41.\n\nIn addition, Argentina argues that the ownership of EDF is significant even for a financial institution of the size of UBS. Respondent contends that UBS would benefit economically by favorable client referrals and industry rankings, which would cause Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to favor Claimants both from institutional loyalty and the hope of greater economic remuneration.\n\n42.\n\nRespondent considers that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's relationship with UBS does not inspire confidence in her independence. In this connection, they stress \"appearance of bias\" regardless of whether actual bias exists.\n\n43.\n\nArgentina lays great stress on the general proposition that arbitrators must disclose circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts about impartiality or independence.10 We agree with this statement, but must note the entirety of the principle. The question is not whether doubts exist, but whether they are \"*justifiable*\" doubts. On the facts of this case, we cannot find any such doubts to be justified.\n\n*See* the penultimate sentence of point 5 of Argentina's submission of 29 February 2008.\n\n**4. Submission with respect to** *New Regency v. Nippon Herald*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nOn 25 April 2008 Respondent submitted a copy of the decision of the United States Court of Appeals decision in *New Regency Productions Ind., v. Nippon Herald Films, Inc.*, 501 F. 3d 111 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\n45.\n\nArgentina drew the Tribunal's attention to what it considered to be a similarity of facts in *New Regency v. Nippon Herald* and the scenario which gives rise to Respondent's request for disqualification of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. In Part IV of this Decision, we analyze *New Regency v. Nippon Herald* and its applicability to this challenge.\n\n**5. Argentina's Letter of 14 May 2008**\n----------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nOn 14 May 2008, Argentina sent a final letter attaching a press article suggesting a decisive influence (\"una influencia a\u00fan m\u00e1s decisiva\") exercised by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler on the UBS Board of Directors. *See* Respondent's letter of 14 May 2008, and its Annex 1, \"Une Genevoise commence \u00e1 faire le m\u00e9nage \u00e1 la tete d'UBS\" in *24 Heures* (9 May 2008), which outlines the work of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler in eliminating certain individuals from the UBS Board following certain problems at that bank.\n\n**B. Claimants**\n----------------\n\n**1. Submission of 21 December 2007**\n-------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn its submission of 21 December 2007, Claimants argue that any link between EDF and UBS is so tenuous as to be immaterial.\n\n48.\n\nIn support of their argument, Claimants suggest that the ICSID disqualification standards focus on factors such as financial dependency, employment relationships, subordination relationships between a party and an arbitrator.\n\n49.\n\nIn Claimants' view, it is vital to remember that UBS has no equity interest in EDF. Under the circumstances, no threat can exist with respect to the independence and impartiality of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler.\n\n50.\n\nClaimants assert that the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest do not apply in this ICSID arbitration. Even if they did apply, Claimants argue that the Guidelines provide no basis for disqualification.\n\n51.\n\nLikewise, Claimants contest application of the new ICSID Rules (entered into force in April 2006) which contain provisions for arbitrator disclosure of relationships that might cause a party to question an arbitrator's reliability for independent judgment.\n\n52.\n\nFinally, the legal framework for ICSID arbitration imposes no duty of disclosure on parties to an ICSID. According to Claimants, the imposition of any such obligation would be unworkable and unrealistic.\n\n**2. Observations of 16 January 2008**\n--------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nIn response to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's comments of 21 December 2007, Respondent sent a brief letter noting the following:\n\n\u2022 Professor Kaufmann-Kohler confirmed that she was not aware of the alleged business relationship between UBS and EDF;\n\n\u2022 Professor Kaufmann-Kohler confirmed that her position at UBS was without any involvement in individual business decision; and\n\n\u2022 Professor Kaufmann-Kohler clarified that UBS business relationships did not affect her independence and impartiality as an arbitrator.\n\n54.\n\nIn consequence, Claimants concluded that the comments by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler were entirely consistent with the analysis in their letter of 21 December 2007, and underscored their views that no basis exists to support a finding of manifest lack of the qualities required under Article 14 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**3. Letter of 11 February 2008**\n---------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nIn an unsolicited letter of 11 February 2008, Claimants filed comments in response to the observations filed by Respondent on 16 January 2008.\n\n56.\n\nClaimants note that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler only became aware of the UBS Foundation's interest in EDF subsequence to the filing of the Argentine challenge. Moreover, Claimants emphasize the size of UBS, with approximately US$ 3 trillion of assets under management.\n\n57.\n\nClaimants emphasize again the lack of actual knowledge by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, and in this connection discuss internal UBS guidelines. They stress that Board members may not assume day-to-day management responsibility.\n\n58.\n\nFinally, Claimants note that the remuneration of non-executive directors, even if paid in restricted stock, is not dependent on the UBS Group's financial performance and that restricted stock may not be sold for four (4) years. In Claimants' view, this state of facts prevents the success or failure of EDF in the present arbitration from having any material effect on Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's ability to exercise independent judgment.\n\n**III. Comments by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nOn 21 December 2007, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler wrote to Mr. Gonzalo Flores at ICSID. While not wishing to comment on the merits of the challenge, she provided five (5) clarifications with respect to her relationship with UBS. These were set forth as follows:\n\n(i) Except with respect to Motor Columbus, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had no knowledge of the business relationship between UBS and EDF prior to the challenge. With respect to Motor Columbus, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had knowledge of the holdings. By the time she was appointed to the Board, she also knew that UBS had divested itself of the investment.\n\n(ii) After seeing the challenge, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler asked UBS to verify the accuracy of allegations with respect to shareholdings relevant to Respondent's allegations. The replies were attached to her letter. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler added that she did not regard these facts as relevant to her independence and impartiality.\n\n(iii) As an independent non-executive Board member, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had no involvement in individual business decision of UBS, and did not receive information related thereto. Consequently, she did not consider those business relationships to affect her independence and impartiality.\n\n(iv) At the time of her appointment to the UBS Board, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler from an abundance of caution submitted a confidential list of pending arbitrations, including the two proceedings implicating the EDF group. She was told by UBS that no conflicts existed, with the exception of her position on the America's Cup Jury, from which she resigned.\n\n(v) Non-executive directors do not deal with specific business or client matters. By letter dated 21 December 2007, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler confirmed that no information involving the parties implicated by the challenge of 29 November 2007 would be distributed to her or discussed in her presence.\n\n60.\n\nProfessor Kauffman-Kohler also attached a letter of 20 December 2007 from individuals in the UBS legal department providing additional information with respect, *inter alia*, to EDF, Motor Columbus, and AEM. Later in this Challenge Decision we shall make further reference to information contained in the letter.\n\n**IV. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. Applicable Standard**\n--------------------------\n\n61.\n\nProfessor Kaufmann-Kohler must be disqualified if facts exist to indicate a manifest lack of reliability with respect to the exercise of independent judgment in this case.\n\n62.\n\nThe starting point for our analysis can be found in the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention, to which reference has been made in Convention Article 57.\n\n63.\n\nNo suggestion has been made that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler is deficient in either of the first two categories required by that in Article 14(1): high moral character or recognized competence in the field of law.11\n\nThis second category includes competence in the fields of \"law, commerce, industry or finance.\" The disjunctive \"or\" indicates that competence in only one of these fields is required.\n\n64.\n\nThe relevant quality that has been put into question relates to independence. We must consider whether Professor Kaufmann-Kohler \"may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\" If reasonable doubts exist on this matter, she should cease to serve in these proceedings.\n\n65.\n\nPursuant to Convention Article 57, a lack of reliability to exercise independent judgment must be \"manifest\". We understand Respondent to propose that a lack of reliability to exercise independent judgment becomes \"manifest\" when it can be \"easily understood or recognized by the mind.\" In this connection, Respondent cites Schreuer.12\n\nSchreuer, *supra* note 1, at 932.\n\n66.\n\nWe note that Professor Schreuer makes this suggestion in connection with award annulment for *exces de pouvoir* as provided in Convention Article 52(b) (\"the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its power\"), rather than a lack of independence by an individual arbitrator.\n\n67.\n\nFor the purposes of this challenge, however, no reason exists that Respondent's proposed test should not apply to disqualification. Nothing in Professor Schreuer's commentary, or any other authority, suggests that the same notions of \"manifest\" cannot be relevant both to excess of powers and to lack of independence.\n\n68.\n\nProfessor Schreuer indicates that the proposed test for what is \"manifest\" relates not to the seriousness of the allegation, but to the ease with which it may be perceived. Something is \"manifest\" if it can be \"discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis.\"13\n\n*Id.*, at 933.\n\n69.\n\nWe have taken note of the other sources discussed by the parties, including *inter alia* the relevant portions of the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts, the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and the relevant case law. In all instances, these authorities have been given the weight that they deserve.\n\n**B. Grounds for Challenge**\n----------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Considerations**\n--------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nAs an initial matter, we stress for the sake of good order that the remaining two members of the Tribunal find no improper motive on the part of the Argentine Republic in connection with this challenge. We accept that all allegations have been made in good faith.\n\n71.\n\nThe facts asserted by Respondent give no reason to suspect that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler would be biased in favor of Claimants. Her position as a nonexecutive director at UBS gives her no financial interest in any of the Claimant companies. Nor would she benefit in any way from an award in favor of Claimants.\n\n72.\n\nWe have asked ourselves whether Professor Kaufmann-Kohler might favor Claimants because a victory for their side in this dispute would result in some benefit to UBS, an entity with which Professor Kaufmann-Kohler feels a sense of emotional solidarity and psychological identification by virtue of her position.\n\n73.\n\nWhile the prospect of such subconscious influence can never be completely excluded, the possibility remains remote, tenuous and speculative. The outcome of this arbitration cannot be expected to have any material impact on the fortunes of UBS. Just as *de minimis* would be the effect on Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's psychological, social or economic well-being.\n\n74.\n\nA reasonable observer cannot find that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's independence would, by virtue of her position at UBS, fluctuate in function of her contemplation of a victory for one side or the other. No reasonable observer would find such a scenario credible.\n\n**2. Specific Assertions**\n--------------------------\n\n**a) UBS Recommendation**\n-------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe UBS recommendation of EDF as a good investment opportunity cannot establish a manifest lack of reliability with respect to independence on the part of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler.\n\n76.\n\nThese recommendations were made in the ordinary course of UBS business. While UBS obviously wants its recommendations to prove sound, this fact gave Professor Kaufmann-Kohler no direct incentive to favor Claimants. The connection remains speculative and indirect, and thus not determinative for purposes of this challenge.\n\n77.\n\nThe Argentine Republic cites a UBS press release in which EDF is mentioned as one of a half dozen companies whose stock might benefit from climate change.14 Absent something more, such a recommendation gives no reason to suspect that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\n\n*See* UBS Media Release of 25 June 2007: UBS launches major climate change research initiative: 'Forget the science concentrate on financial markets', cited as Respondent's Annex XX to its Challenge of 29 November 2007.\n\n78.\n\nUnder different circumstances, our conclusion might be different. For example, a different conclusion might be indicated if an arbitrator held a substantial equity stake in a bank which owned and actively promoted a company that was party to the relevant proceedings. Such facts, however, have not been presented to us.\n\n**b) Common Interest in AEM**\n-----------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe fact that UBS and Transalpina de Energ\u00eda (controlled by EDF) share a joint shareholding in AEM does not create circumstances in which Professor Kaufmann-Kohler would be deemed to lack independence.\n\n80.\n\nUBS holds its interest in AEM in the normal course of its business activity as one of the largest banks and private equity firms in the world. Under the circumstances, no reason exists to believe that such ownership would cause Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to lack independence of judgment.\n\n81.\n\nThis conclusion imposes itself even more in light of the low level of the UBS stake in AEM, which we understand to fall below 1.5%.15\n\n*See* Annex 2 of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's letter of 21 December 2007.\n\n**c) Ownership of Motor Columbus**\n----------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nWith respect to the Motor Columbus shares, a line of analysis similar to the one applied to AEM must dictate our conclusion. Nothing in the facts surrounding the Motor Columbus investment give reason to suspect that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's independence would be thereby impaired.\n\n83.\n\nWe note in passing that UBS disposed of its shares in Motor Columbus approximately two years ago. See letter of 20 December 2007 from Dr. Karin Eugster and Dr. Bernhard Schmid, respectively Legal Adviser and General Counsel of UBS, attached to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's letter of 21 December 2007. See section 3 of that letter indicates that on 23 March 2006 UBS sold its 55.6% stake in Motor Columbus.\n\n84.\n\nNo mechanism or nexus has been suggested to explain why someone in Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's position, as a non-executive director at UBS, would wish Respondent to lose this arbitration because of this one-time share ownership.\n\n**d) Share Placement in the French Market**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nRespondent also urges disqualification of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler by reason of the UBS participation in a financial consortium that assisted EDF in placing its shares in the French market.\n\n86.\n\nNo allegation is made that UBS itself purchased shares in EDF during this placement.\n\n87.\n\nUnder the circumstances, we are unable to perceive any link between that consortium's activity and the way Professor Kaufmann-Kohler will evaluate the issues of this case.\n\n88.\n\nThe role of UBS in this financial placement does not give Professor Kaufmann-Kohler any reason to expect a benefit, whether direct or indirect, from an outcome in this arbitration favoring Claimants.\n\n**e) UBS Investment Foundation**\n--------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe matter of the \"UBS Investment Foundation 2\" (the \"Foundation\") stands on a somewhat different footing from Respondent's other arguments. If EDF loses this arbitration (so it might be argued) the Foundation investments in EDF will be worth less.\n\n90.\n\nThe argument continues that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler will be inclined to seek the welfare of the Foundation and might be tempted to decide in favor of Claimants.\n\n91.\n\nAs an initial matter, we note the reference in footnote 32 of Respondent's Challenge, directing our attention to page 136 of its Annex XXIV, which provides the Foundation's \"*Compositions du portfeuille*\" as of 30 September 2006. No indication of EDF securities seems to be present on that page.\n\n92.\n\nFor the sake of this Challenge Decision we accept that the Foundation's ownership has been recorded in that report. We assume that by inadvertence the proper reference has been misplaced, and should point to another section of the report.\n\n93.\n\nNevertheless, it still remains unclear why the composition of the Foundation's assets would cause Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to deviate from her duty to exercise independent judgment. The Foundation is an institution for the collective investment of assets by Swiss pension funds. Ultimately, the assets of the Foundation will benefit the various Swiss pension funds that have joined in the institutions which participate in the Foundation.\n\n94.\n\nWe note that the UBS Legal Department contends that the references in Annex XXIV refer to debt (bonds) rather than equity (share). See section 4 of the letter of 20 December 2007 from Dr. Karin Eugster and Dr. Bernhard Schmid, respectively Legal Adviser and General Counsel of UBS, attached to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's letter of 21 December 2007.\n\n95.\n\nThat same section of the letter from the UBS Legal Department indicates that the \"total of UBS's shareholdings\" in EDF falls below 1.5%. From the context, we understand this mention of \"UBS's shareholdings\" as a reference to the Foundation discussed in the prior paragraph.\n\n96.\n\nEven if UBS A.G. (the bank) held EDF bonds, a stake of less than 1.5% would not be significant enough to have an impact on the independence of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler.\n\n**3. Duty of Disclosure and Investigation**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nRespondent argues that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had a duty to disclose her membership on the UBS Board and to investigate possible conflicts of interest.16 The rubric for Section II-B of the Respondent's Observations emphasizes the duty to disclose (*deber de informar*) the Board membership. However, the text of that Section also devotes considerable discussion to the duty to investigate (*deber de investigar*) various possible conflicts of interest. We have examined both the duty to disclose (Board membership) and the duty to investigate (possible conflicts of interest).\n\n*See* Respondent's Observations of 16 January 2008, Section II-B (paras. 23 through 40).\n\n98.\n\nWith respect to the alleged failure to disclose, we cannot accept that non-disclosure of the Board membership indicates a manifest lack of reliability in the exercise of independent judgment, the standard to be applied in this challenge. Whatever level of disclosure might be required under the ICSID Convention, a failure to inform the parties about this Board membership does not rise to that plane.\n\n99.\n\nNothing inherently suspect can be found in Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's participation in the board of directors of that particular financial institution, such as to cause her to question the propriety of her service as arbitrator in this case. While some legal systems and arbitral rules might require such disclosure, no such duty indication can be found in the ICSID standards discussed above.\n\n100.\n\nRespondent's argument with respect to the duty to investigate is equally misplaced. The provisions of IBA General Standard 7(c) (were they applicable) speak to \"reasonable\" enquiries of \"potential\" conflicts and \"facts... that may cause... independence to be questioned.\" No evidence has been presented that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had reason to suspect any potential conflict or fact that would call into question her independence.\n\n101.\n\nThis conclusion remains consistent with the line of analysis in the recent decision of the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals in *AIMCOR v. Ovalar*, a dispute between an American and a Turkish company.17\n\n*Applied Industrial Materials Corp. v. Ovalar,* 492 F.3d 132 (2nd Cir. 2007).\n\n102.\n\nIn *AIMCOR*, the challenged arbitrator had already learned about, and disclosed, a potential transaction between his company and the purchaser of the American entity in the arbitration.18 No challenge was made at that time. Later, however, other facts came to light about dealings between the arbitrator's company and the American side to the dispute. In light of having been put on notice by that earlier transaction, the arbitrator was expected to follow up with continued vigilance.\n\n*AIMCOR* had been acquired by Oxbow Industries, which had potential dealings with a company called Seacor Holdings, of which Mr. Charles Fabrikant (the challenged arbitrator) was Chairman, President and CEO. The first incident (which did not give rise to challenge) involved a contract for the carriage of petroleum coke by the barge operation conducted by his company's St. Louis office.\n\n103.\n\nWe take no position on whether such a standard applies under the ICSID Convention, but note simply that no similar fact pattern faced Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. In *AIMCOR v. Ovalar* the challenged arbitrator was not a nonexecutive director, but was the Chairman, President and CEO of a company that engaged in direct business dealings with one of the parties to the arbitration.\n\n104.\n\nWe note Rule 6(2) of the new ICSID Arbitration Rules, which require an arbitrator to notify the ICSID Secretary General of any professional or business relationship that might cause a party to question the arbitrator's reliability for independent judgment. These new rules, which entered into force on 10 April 2006, do not apply to proceedings in this arbitration, which pursuant to ICSID Convention Article 44 were expressly subject to the Rules in force as of January 2003.19\n\n*See* Minutes of the First Session of the Tribunal of 1 September 2004, Washington, D.C.\n\n105.\n\nEven if the new Rules applied in this matter, it is doubtful that they would apply to facts which Professor Kaufmann-Kohler neither knew nor had reason to know.\n\n106.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimants themselves had a duty to make a disclosure with respect to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's Board membership. Without taking a position on whether a jurisprudential basis exists for this asserted standard, we note that no evidence demonstrates that anyone at EDF was aware of either Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's position at UBS or the alleged links between UBS and EDF.\n\n**4. Wolfram Report**\n---------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Report of Professor Wolfram, submitted by Argentina on 29 February 2008, does not change our conclusion. For the sake of good order, we set forth below several of our more salient concerns with respect to the analysis of this report.\n\n108.\n\nWe note again that the relevant test looks to whether an arbitrator \"may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.\" In this connection, a related question is whether the individual is likely to be influenced by a particular fact. As discussed below, Professor Wolfram's report does not appear to be focused on this test.\n\n109.\n\nProfessor Wolfram argues that \"long-established custom and practice in arbitral bodies\" required Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to \"make careful inquiry\" of whether UBS had connections to either party. Curiously, the authority cited falls short of supporting the proposition.20\n\n*See* Wolfram, *supra*, at para. 16.\n\n110.\n\nProfessor Wolfram cites *Commonwealth Coatings*, a case in which a central point (for the opinions of both Justice Black and Justice White) was that the offending engineer/arbitrator had worked directly for one of the parties, and did not need to make any inquiries. A prime contractor was being sued by a subcontract. The Court noted that the prime contractor's patronage (of the disqualified arbitrator) was \"repeated and significant... over a period of four of five years\" and added that the relationship even went so far as to include \"services on the very projects involved in this lawsuit.\" Such a fact pattern is far from the one at issue in this present case.\n\n111.\n\nThe other authority cited by Professor Wolfram was Standard 7(c) of IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interests in International Arbitration. Like the *Commonwealth Coatings* case, however, the IBA Guidelines actually support a very different principle.\n\n112.\n\nFirst, Standard 7 speaks of \"reasonable\" inquiries. The Standard and the accompanying comment also clear that the type of information that must be ascertained and disclosed is information that might affect the arbitrator's impartiality and independence. As discussed below, a *de minimis* interest would not be of such a nature as to call into question that impartiality or independence.\n\n113.\n\nThe *de minimis* principle can be found in Standard 2 of the IBA Principles, which oblige an arbitrator to resign if he or she knows of facts or circumstances which \u2014 \"from a *reasonable* third person's point of view\" (emphasis added) give rise to \"justifiable doubts\" about his or her impartiality or independence.21\n\nStandard 2(a) speaks of subjective \"doubts\" by the arbitrator, while standard 2(b) makes reference to an objective standard based on a \"reasonable third person's point of view\".\n\n114.\n\nIn defining justifiable doubts, Standard 2(d) of the IBA Principles speaks of a *\"significant\"* interest \u2014 *not \"* any\" economic or personal interest.\n\n115.\n\nA comment to General Standard 6 (discussing problematic relationships) throws further light on Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's situation. The Explanation 6(a) addresses the overlap of the arbitrator's interests with those of his or her law firm. In this context the explanation states that \"the activities of the arbitrator's firm should not automatically constitute a conflict of interest.\" Rather, each firm activity must be considered in the individual case. If the IBA Principles reject an absolutist rule with respect to a law firm, *a fortiori* approach does not commend itself with respect to a bank the size of UBS.\n\n116.\n\nThe relevant principles in Professor Wolfram's own jurisdiction (the United States) clearly apply a \"de minimis\" standard. Canon 2 of the American Bar Association (ABA) 2007 Model Code of Judicial Conduct states, \"A judge shall perform the duties of judicial office impartially, competently and diligently.\"\n\n117.\n\nThe specific rules following this general Canon provide *inter alia*, in Rule 2.11, as follows:\n\nA judge shall disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to the following circumstances: \\*\\*\\*\n\n(2) The judge knows that the judge \\*\\*\\*has more than a *de minimis* interest that could be substantially affected by the proceeding.\n\n118.\n\nThe ABA Rules define \"de minimis,\" to mean \"an insignificant interest that could not raise a reasonable question regarding the judge's impartiality.\" They also define \"economic interest\" to mean ownership \"of more than a de minimis legal or equitable interest.\" Finally, the Rules state that an economic interest does not include an interest in \"a mutual or common investment fund,\" which seems to be the case for UBS Foundation.\n\n119.\n\nOther jurisdictions with developed arbitration laws take a similar perspective. In *ATT v. Saudi Cable Co*., the English Court of Appeal had to consider the effect of an arbitrator's ownership of shares of a telecommunications company that might arguably have influenced his views. A *de minimis* approach was taken by the court which stated:\n\nAny benefit which could indirectly accrue to Nortel [the company whose shares were owned by the arbitrator] as a result of the outcome of the arbitration would be of such minimal benefit to [the arbitrator] that it would be unreasonable to conclude that it would influence him.22\n\n*ATT v. Saudi Cable Co.,* 200 WL 571190 (2000) (English Court of Appeal). Opinion paragraph 43 (c).\n\n120.\n\nWhile the facts of that case are different from those of the present arbitration, the principle established is that of proportionality, whereby an insignificant interest will not be cause for disqualification.\n\n121.\n\nWere the ethical standards otherwise for international arbitration, it would be unduly easy for a party wishing to derail an arbitration to do so by asserting some tenuous connection between the arbitrator and a fact that might arguably have an impact. In an increasingly interdependent and complex world, it will not be difficult to construct some theory for most scenarios that suggests influence might be possible. If Professor Wolfram's \"no-link-too-small\" theory were correct, EDF might conceivably challenge an arbitrator simply because he or she has good Argentine friends. To permit removal of arbitrators on such grounds would damage the stability and efficiency of the arbitral process. The costs of such an absolutist perspective clearly outweigh the advantages.\n\n122.\n\nIn summary, if the interest of UBS are *de minimis* in any dealing with EDF then *a fortiori* one must conclude that the possibility of influence upon Professor Kaufmann-Kohler remains equally minimal.\n\n123.\n\nConsequently, speculative or tenuous interests do not normally come into consideration. Non-disclosure in itself cannot be a ground for disqualification, but must relate to facts that would be material to a reasonable likelihood of impartiality or lack of independence, which is not the case here. Without some link of materiality, an arbitrator would be called upon to reveal all (or almost all) elements of his or her life, a situation that would paralyze any arbitral process.\n\n124.\n\nHaving considered seriously on the Wolfram Report, we conclude that its arguments do not give any reason to conclude that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler would be influenced in this case by her position at UBS. No indication has been given that she cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment and the challenge must fail.\n\n**5. The New Regency Case**\n---------------------------\n\n125.\n\nIn its forwarding letter of 25 April 2008, submitting the U.S. Court of Appeals decision in *New Regency Productions Ind., v. Nippon Herald Films, Inc.*, 501 F. 3d 111 (9th Cir. 2007), Argentina drew the Tribunal's attention to what it considered to be \"the startling similarity\" (*la enorme similitud*) between the facts of that case and those which engendered this present request for disqualification of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. For reasons discussed below, we consider the two sets of facts to be clearly distinguishable in their relevant aspects.\n\n126.\n\n*New Regency v. Nippon Herald* arose from a dispute over film production in Japan. Nippon Herald had agreed to distribute in Japan five films produced by New Regency. It was undisputed that New Regency delivered only four of these films.\n\n127.\n\nThe sole arbitrator heard the case during 2004, issuing several orders during the latter half of that year. He found in favor of Nippon Herald for an undisputed amount of US$440 thousand, representing return of its fee for the film that had never been delivered. In addition, the arbitrator found for New Regency on a claim of more than five times that much (US$2.3 million) allegedly owed to Nippon Herald under a cross-collateralization provision.\n\n128.\n\nAlso in 2004, the sole arbitrator was employed by another film company (\"Yari Group\") as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer. In that capacity he had oversight of the company's business and legal affairs, as well as its general administration.\n\n129.\n\nAt that time in 2004, the company of which the arbitrator was Senior Executive Vice President was actively negotiating for the right to finance a film developed by New Regency and produced by the daughter of its principal owner. Thus during the course of the arbitration, the arbitrator was also overseeing a substantial business deal whereby his company sought rights from one side to the dispute he was hearing.\n\n130.\n\nThe court in *New Regency v. Nippon Herald* had no difficulty in finding a conflict of interest. The arbitrator was simultaneously sitting in judgment over the New Regency dispute and serving as chief administrative officer for a company negotiating a substantial contract with New Regency.\n\n131.\n\nNothing like the scenario in *New Regency v. Nippon Herald* has been alleged in the facts that give rise to the challenge of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. No allegation has been made of a substantial business deal being negotiated between UBS and EDF, let alone a transaction being supervised by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler.\n\n132.\n\nThe Court in *New Regency v. Nippon Herald* emphasized repeatedly that conflicts of interest must be \"non-trivial\" in order to give rise to challenge. For example, see page 1107 (\"more than trivial business\"), page 1108 (\"where an arbitrator has reason to believe that a nontrivial conflict of interest might exist\") and page 1110 (\"conflict alleged by Nippon Herald is...nontrivial\"). This language in *New Regency v. Nippon Herald* reinforces our finding that a challenge, in order to succeed, must rest on a relationship that is other than *de minimis*. See our analysis of the Wolfram report, *supra*.\n\n133.\n\nIn consequence, since any link between UBS and EDF was trivial and *de minimis*, nothing in the *New Regency case* suggests that there should be justifiable doubts about Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's reliability to exercise independent judgment.\n\n**6. Letter of 14 May 2008 (\"Decisive Influence\" on Board)**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nWe have considered Argentina's letter of 14 May 2008, suggesting that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler should be disqualified because she exercises a decisive influence (\"una influencia a\u00fan m\u00e1s decisiva\") on the UBS Board of Directors. Respondent points to an article titled \"Une Genevoise commence \u00e1 faire le m\u00e9nage \u00e1 la tete d'UBS\" (*24 Heures*, 9 May 2008), which sets forth the work done by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler in eliminating Board members at UBS following certain well-publicized problems at that bank. In itself, such a role does not change the result in this Challenge. There is no implication that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler assumes responsibility over UBS's investments or profit and loss account. Rather, her responsibilities are limited to promoting good corporate governance. Whatever interaction might possibly exist between UBS and EDF remains trivial. No connection has been alleged between the UBS difficulties and the present arbitration. Consequently, it follows the services performed by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler at UBS (Chair of the Nominating Committee) create no risk that she will be unreliable to exercise independent judgment in this case.\n\n**V.

(\"EDFI\"), a company incorporated and headquartered in France that holds overseas-investment assets of its wholly-owning parent, \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France (\"EDF\"), a power company likewise incorporated and headquartered in France; (ii) SAUR International S.A. (\"SAURI\"), also a company incorporated and headquartered in France that specializes in providing water and energy services around the world; and (iii) Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. (\"Le\u00f3n\"), a company incorporated and headquartered in Luxembourg that was originally created as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, a company incorporated and headquartered in France, but that was later acquired by Claimant EDFI on 12 March 2004.\n\n4.\n\nRespondent is the Argentine Republic (\"Argentina\") to which is attributed the sovereign acts of its provincial territory, the Province of Mendoza as well as those of the provincial regulatory agencies acting on behalf of the Government of Mendoza.\n\n5.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal (\"Tribunal\") has been duly constituted by Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler by appointment of Claimants, and Professor Jes\u00fas Rem\u00f3n by appointment of Respondent, as Arbitrators, and Professor William W. Park by appointment of the Chairman of the Administrative Council pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, as President of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nJurisdiction was addressed on a preliminarily bifurcated basis. A hearing was held on 8 March 2006 and a Decision was rendered on 5 August 2008 confirming the Tribunal\u2018s jurisdiction. For purposes of pleadings and oral arguments, this proceeding was further bifurcated into merits and quantum phases. A hearing on the merits was held between 1 and 3 October 2009, which continued from 2 thru 7 November 2009, and on quantum on 14 February 2011. All hearings were held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal renders this Award to dispose of all issues related to the merits and quantum of this arbitration, registered at the Centre as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23.\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n**A. CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL AND PROCEDURES**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 16 June 2003, the Centre received a request for arbitration (\"Request of 16 June\") against Respondent filed by Claimants EDFI and SAURI. In accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre (\"Acting Secretary-General\") on even date registered the Request of 16 June as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23.1 The next day, pursuant to Institution Rule 5 the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Request of 16 June and transmitted copies thereof to Respondent and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\nOne month prior to the filing of the Request of 16 June, Claimant EDFI and its subsidiary, Electricidad Argentina S.A. (\"EASA\"), a company incorporated under the laws of Argentina, had filed a request for arbitration with the Centre also naming the Argentine Republic as Respondent (\"Request of 16 May\"). Per ICSID Convention Article 36(3), the case was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/22 on the same day together with the Request of 16 June. The claims underlying both Requests largely mirror each other in all material respects, and on this basis, by letter dated 12 August 2003 the Centre recommended\"and all constituents approved\"that a common tribunal should address both proceedings. Thereafter the Argentine Republic, EDFI and EASA agreed to suspend ICSID Case No. ARB/03/22 for purposes of negotiating a settlement. That proceeding has remained suspended ever since.\n\n9.\n\nOn 4 August 2003, the Centre received an amended request for arbitration (\"Amended Request\") joining Le\u00f3n as an additional claimant to the Request of 16 June. Claimant Le\u00f3n is said to be an assignee of the investment made in Argentina by its French parent company, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, and hence, has standing to file arbitrations under the Argentina-France BIT. See Amended Request footnote 1. Nevertheless, to the extent its Luxembourgian corporate nationality is found to preclude standing, Le\u00f3n invokes provisions of the Agreement between the Government of Argentina and the Belgian/Luxembourg Economic Union for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, signed on 28 June 1990 and which entered into force on 20 May 1995 (\"Argentina-Luxembourg BIT\").\n\n10.\n\nOn 7 August 2003, pursuant to Rule 5 of the Institution Rules, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Amended Request and transmitted copies thereof to Respondent and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n11.\n\nOn 12 August 2003, the Acting Secretary-General registered the Amended Request pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23 under the formal heading, *EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic*. In accordance with Institution Rule 7, on even date the Parties were notified of the registration and were invited to proceed, as soon as possible, with the constitution of the tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nOn 31 October 2003, Claimants filed a letter requesting that the tribunal be constituted pursuant to ICSID Convention Article 37(2)(b), which prescribes one arbitrator to be appointed by each side and the third arbitrator by agreement of the Parties. By the same letter, Claimants appointed as Arbitrator, Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland. Per ICSID Arbitration Rule 2(3), the Acting Secretary-General confirmed by letter dated 3 November 2003 the application of ICSID Convention Article 37(2)(b).\n\n13.\n\nOn 26 January 2004, Claimants filed a letter on account of the fact that ninety days had elapsed since the case was registered on 12 August 2003 without any tribunal being constituted, and therein invoked ICSID Convention Article 38 as well as ICSID Arbitration Rule 4(4) to request the Chairman of the Administrative Council to appoint and fill the respective vacancies.\n\n14.\n\nOn 24 March 2004, Respondent appointed as Arbitrator, Dr. Fernando de Trazegnies, a national of Peru.\n\n15.\n\nOn 18 May 2004 the Chairman of the Administrative Council appointed Professor William W. Park, a national of the United States of America (\"U.S.\"), to serve as President of the Tribunal.\n\n16.\n\nOn 2 June 2004, the Acting Secretary-General notified the Parties pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1) that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments, thereby formally commencing the proceeding, and that ICSID Senior Counsel Mr. Gonzalo Flores would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal (\"Secretary\"). Since 9 December 2009, ICSID Consultant Ms. Anneliese Fleckenstein has continued to serve as Secretary.2\n\nMr. Flores was subsequently replaced by ICSID Counsel, Dr. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, whose extended leave of absence prompted the interim return of Mr. Flores. Mr. Flores was later substituted by Ms. Anneliese Fleckenstein.\n\n17.\n\nOn 1 September 2004, a first session was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. (\"First Session\").\n\n18.\n\nPresent on behalf of Claimants included (i) Mr. Didier Lam\u00e8the from EDF; and (ii) Mr. Ronald E. M. Goodman, Mr. Paolo Di Rosa and Ms. Gaela Gehring Flores from the law firm, WHITE & CASE.3 On behalf of Respondent attended (i) Drs. Cintia Yaryura and Juan Jos\u00e9 Galeano from the PROCURACI\u00d3N DEL TESORO DE LA NACI\u00d3N; and (ii) Drs. Marcelo A. Massoni and Roberto Hermida from the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\nMr. Goodman, Mr. Di Rosa and Ms. Gehring-Flores later moved to the Washington D.C. offices of the law firm, WINSTON & STRAWN, but continued to represent Claimants. Thereafter, Mr. Goodman moved to the law firm, FOLEY HOAG, with representation of Claimants being assumed solely by Mr. Di Rosa and his team at Washington D.C. offices of the law firm, ARNOLD & PORTER, which currently represents Claimants in this proceeding.\n\n19.\n\nDuring the First Session the Parties agreed on a number of procedural matters reflected in the meeting minutes signed by the President of the Tribunal and the Secretary. A timetable was adopted for the submission of pleadings and the presentation of oral arguments (\"First Session Timetable\"), pursuant to which Claimants would file a memorial on the merits no later than 30 April 2005. With respect to the latter stages, the First Session Timetable was designed to be contingent upon whether Respondent challenged arbitral authority, which if so it would be required to submit a memorial on objections to jurisdiction by 15 July 2005.\n\n20.\n\nOn 2 May 2005, Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits.\n\n**B. JURISDICTIONAL PHASE**\n---------------------------\n\n21.\n\nPer the First Session Timetable, Respondent filed its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction on 15 July 2005. Consequently, the merits phase of the proceeding was suspended on 15 July 2005as prescribed by ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3).\n\n22.\n\nOn 12 August 2005, Claimants informed the Centre that Drs. Michael R. Rattagan and Ricardo Barreiro Deymonnaz from the Argentine law firm, RATTAGEN, MACCHIAVELLO, AROCENA & PE\u00d1A ROBIROSA, ABOGADOS, would act as co-counsel for Claimants.\n\n23.\n\nIn accordance with the First Session Timetable, Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on 3 October 2005. Subsequently, Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction on 17 November 2005, and Claimants their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on 13 January 2006.\n\n24.\n\nOn 8 March 2006, a hearing on jurisdiction was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C.\n\n25.\n\nPresent on behalf of Claimants were (i) Mr. Didier Lam\u00e8the from EDFI, and (ii) Messrs. Ronald E. M. Goodman, Paolo Di Rosa, Tom\u00e1s Leonard, A. Manuel Garc\u00eda, and Kelby Ballena from the law firm, WINSTON & STRAWN. On behalf of Respondent attended Drs. Adolfo Gustavo Scrinzi, Gabriel Bottini, Florencio Travieso, and Mar\u00eda Luz Moglia from the PROCURACI\u00d3N DEL TESORO DE LA NACI\u00d3N.\n\n26.\n\nOn 20 March 2006, Claimants submitted their post hearing brief on jurisdiction. Respondent filed its observations thereto on 6 April 2006.\n\n27.\n\nOn 22 June 2006, Respondent proposed the disqualification of its own party-appointed arbitrator, Dr. de Trazegnies, which prompted his resignation through a letter dated 7 July 2006. On 20 July 2006, the Centre notified the Parties that the President of the Tribunal and Arbitrator Kaufmann-Kohler had considered and consented to the resignation of Dr. de Trazegnies, and invited Respondent to appoint a replacing arbitrator.\n\n28.\n\nOn 26 September 2006, Respondent appointed Professor Jes\u00fas Rem\u00f3n, a national of Spain. By letter dated 17 October 2006, Professor Rem\u00f3n accepted his appointment, thereby resuming the proceeding, and conveyed it was unnecessary to recommence oral procedures as permitted but not required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 12.\n\n29.\n\nA second challenge by Respondent was raised on 29 November 2007, this time proposing the disqualification of Claimants\u2018 party-appointed arbitrator, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3), on 21 December 2007 Professor Kaufmann-Kohler furnished explanations addressing Respondent\u2018s disqualification proposal. Thereafter, the Parties exchanged observations on the matter. On 25 June 2008, the President of the Tribunal and Arbitrator Rem\u00f3n concluded Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was capable of exercising independent judgment as required under ICSID Convention Article 14(1), and thus, rejected Respondent\u2018s challenge and effectively lifted the suspension on the proceeding.\n\n30.\n\nOn 5 August 2008, the Tribunal, duly comprised of Professors Kaufmann-Kohler and Rem\u00f3n as Arbitrators and Professor Park as President of the Tribunal, issued its Decision on Jurisdiction holding that (i) the Tribunal possesses authority to hear the claims set forth in Claimants\u2018 Memorial; (ii) any allocation of costs related to the jurisdiction phase would be addressed as part of an Award on the merits and quantum; and (iii) procedural aspects of further proceedings would be addressed in a subsequent procedural order.\n\n**C. MERITS PHASE**\n-------------------\n\n31.\n\nOn 13 August 2008, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 and established therein a timetable for submitting pleadings concerning the merits phase of this proceeding. On 22 October 2008, the Tribunal, in consultation with the Parties, fixed the venue and dates for the hearing on the merits.\n\n32.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits on 26 January 2009, an English translation of which is dated 9 February 2009.4 Subsequently, Claimants filed their Reply on the Merits on 30 April 2009, and Respondent its Rejoinder on the Merits on 27 July 2009.\n\nFor good order, the Tribunal notes that all other English translations of Respondent\u2018s pleadings, which were submitted in Spanish, are dated the same as the originals thereof.\n\n33.\n\nA hearing on the merits was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C., between 1 and 3 October and continued on 2 thru 7 November 2009.\n\n34.\n\nPresent on behalf of Claimants were (i) Mr. Charles-Henri Prou, Mr. Jean-Paul Palma and Ms. Laure Perrin from EDFI; (ii) Mr. Paolo Di Rosa, Ms. Jean Kalicki, Ms. Mara Senn, Mr. A. Manuel Garcia, Mr. Pablo Valverde, Mr. Patricio Grane, Ms. Cristina Sorgi, Mr. Wells Bennett, Ms. Suzana Medeiros Blades, Mr. Rodrigo Gil, Ms. Paloma Gomez, Mr. Rodolfo Fuenzalida, Mr. Kelby Ballena, Ms. Vanessa Mueller and Ms. Rosario Cornejo from ARNOLD & PORTER; and (iii) Drs. Ricardo Barreiro Deymonnaz Rattagan, and Juan Pablo De Luca from RATTAGAN, MACCHIAVELLO, AROCENA & PE\u00d1A ROBIROSA, ABOGADOS.\n\n35.\n\nOn behalf of Respondent attended (i) Dr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino, Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n; (ii) Dr. Gabriel Bottini, Dr. Ignacio P\u00e9rez Cort\u00e9s, Dr. Javier Pargament Mariasch, Dr. Alejandra Mackluf Faelli, Dr. Facundo P\u00e9rez Aznar, Dr. Mar\u00eda Soledad Romero Caporale, Dr. Cintia Yaryura, Dr. Nicol\u00e1s Grosse, and Dr. Nicol\u00e1s Duhalde from the PROCURACI\u00d3N DEL TESORO DE LA NACI\u00d3N; and (iii) Dr. Ignacio Torterola from the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n36.\n\nOn 14 December 2009, Claimants and Respondent filed post-hearing briefs on the merits. Subsequently on 8 January 2010, the Parties, also simultaneously, submitted replies to each other\u2018s Post Hearing Brief on the Merits.\n\n**D. FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF QUANTUM**\n---------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nOn 9 July 2010, the Tribunal invited each side to submit supplementary expert reports on the quantum of damages and comments of counsel on the other side\u2018s as well as each side\u2018s own supplementary expert reports.\n\n38.\n\nAccordingly on 24 September 2010, each side submitted a supplementary expert report on quantum. On 15 November 2010, the Parties filed comments on the supplementary reports prepared by their own as well as by the other side\u2018s experts (\"Comments on Quantum\").\n\n39.\n\nRespondent also submitted a supplementary statement by Mr. Reos dated 10 November 2010 and a new expert report by Messrs. Garc\u00eda and Guidi dated 11 November 2010, both sent on 15 November 2010. On 19 November 2010 Claimants applied to declare the statement and report inadmissible. Respondent on 13 December 2010 moved to exclude certain sections of the LECG reports of 24 September and 15 November 2010.\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal declined to grant Claimants\u2018 application and declared Respondent\u2018s motion moot, confirming that the Tribunal would give all statements and reports the weight deserved, being attentive to identify any portions which attempted to introduce new evidence or argument on which responsive comment has not been possible. Each side was given a right to cross-examine experts on 14 February 2011.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal later ruled that Messrs. Reos, Garc\u00eda and Guidi would appear only if Claimants elected to cross-examine them. In the event, Claimants declined the opportunity to cross examine these individuals.\n\n42.\n\nOn 14 February 2011, a hearing on quantum was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C.\n\n43.\n\nPresent on behalf of Claimants were (i) Mr. Jean-Paul Palma from EDFI; (ii) Mr. Paolo Di Rosa, Ms. Mara Senn, Ms. Mallory Silberman, Mr. Kelby Ballena and Ms. Rosario Cornejo from ARNOLD & PORTER;5 and (iii) Messrs. A. Manuel Garcia and Pablo Valverde, consultants for Claimants\u2018 counsel.\n\nSee *supra* note 3.\n\n44.\n\nOn behalf of Respondent attended (i) Dr. Gabriel Bottini, Dr. Ignacio P\u00e9rez Cort\u00e9s, Ms. Ver\u00f3nica Lavista, Ms. Mariana Lozza, Mr. Patricio Arnedo Barreiro and Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Grosse from the PROCURACI\u00d3N DEL TESORO DE LA NACI\u00d3N; (ii) Dr. Ignacio Torterola from the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C.; and (iii) Mr. Hugo Reos, a Representative of the Province of Mendoza.\n\n45.\n\nOn 11 March 2011, Claimants and Respondent filed post-hearing briefs on quantum.\n\n46.\n\nPursuant to certain objections raised during the February hearings, on 25 February 2011 the Parties each submitted a Motion to Strike. Claimants submitted a Motion to Strike in connection with the testimonies of Respondent\u2018s quantum expert as well as of certain references made by Respondent during closing arguments. Respondent\u2018s Motion to Strike concerned Claimants\u2018 Exhibits C262 and C263, which Respondent notes were filed with Claimants\u2018 pleadings on damages submitted prior to the hearings on quantum. Respondent also challenged the evidentiary weight of these exhibits. On 11 March 2011, the Parties submitted their responses with respect to the other side\u2018s Motion to Strike.\n\n47.\n\nHaving fully considered the motions to strike made by Claimants and by Respondent on 25 February, as well as the responses of each side filed on 11 March, the Tribunal declined to grant either application, concluding that it was able to distinguish between what is, and what is not, relevant, material and admissible.\n\n48.\n\nThe proceeding was declared closed on 13 March 2012.\n\n**E. COST SUBMISSIONS**\n-----------------------\n\n49.\n\nOn 16 February 2012, in accordance with the Tribunal\u2018s request of 30 January 2012, and the extension of time it granted on 8 February 2012, each Party submitted its Statement of Costs (\"Planilla de Costos\").\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. THE CONCESSION AND ITS LEGAL FRAMEWORK**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Overview**\n---------------\n\n50.\n\nThe dispute arises out of a Concession Agreement between the Government of Mendoza and EDEMSA, signed on 15 July 1998 (\"Concession Agreement\") relating to the transmission and distribution of electricity. On 28 May 1997, the Government of Mendoza had reformed the regulatory framework governing distribution of electricity within the Province of Mendoza through the enactment of Provincial Law No. 6,497 (\"Provincial Electricity Law\")6 and Provincial Law No. 6,498 (\"Transformation Law\"),7 collectively referred to herein as the Regulatory Framework.\n\nOfficial title, \"Framework for Regulating Electricity.\"\n\nOfficial title, \"Transformation of the Provincial Electricity Sector Law.\"\n\n51.\n\nThe Regulatory Framework adopts at the provincial level Argentina\u2018s then-standing national policy on electricity transmission and distribution, which was passed at the federal level on 19 December 1991 as Federal Law No. 24,065. The purpose of the Regulatory Framework is to declare electricity transmission and distribution a public service and to implement a regulatory framework that ensures stability in the electricity sector. See Provincial Electricity Law, Articles 3 and 4. Among the more specific provisions, of particular importance are those contained in Chapter XI: Tariffs\"Article 43 thru 52\"of the Provincial Electricity Law.\n\n52.\n\nArticle 43 of the Provincial Electricity Law endorses a policy of fair and reasonable rates to consumers for services supplied by electricity transmission companies and distributors. On the other hand, transmission companies and distributors are allowed to capitalize on an opportunity to derive sufficient income to cover relevant costs and to obtain a reasonable rate of return. In this regard, Article 43 in pertinent part provides:\n\nLos servicios suministrados por los transportistas y distribuidores ser\u00e1n ofrecidos a tarifas justas y razonables, las que se ajustar\u00e1n a los siguientes principios: (a) proveer a los transportistas y distribuidores que administren los servicios de acuerdo a pautas y par\u00e1metros de gesti\u00f3n internacionalmente aceptados, la posibilidad de obtener ingresos suficientes para satisfacer los costos operativos, de mantenimiento y de expansi\u00f3n de los servicios, los impuestos y una tasa de rentabilidad razonable determinada conforme lo dispuesto en el art. 46 de esta ley; [y]... (c) en el caso de tarifas de distribuidores, el precio de venta de la energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica deber\u00e1 incluir los costos propios de distribuci\u00f3n reconocidos al concesionario y un t\u00e9rmino representativo de los costos de adquisici\u00f3n de la energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica en el mercado el\u00e9ctrico mayorista, de manera que las variaciones de este \u00faltimo se reflejen en las tarifas a los respectivos usuarios; (d) Asegurar el m\u00ednimo costo razonable para los usuarios, compatible con la seguridad del abastecimiento, la calidad del servicio y el uso racional de la energ\u00eda[\u2026]\n\nIn English, the provision reads,\n\nThe rates charged by electricity transmission companies and distributors shall be fair and reasonable and shall be subject to the following principles: (a) Rates shall afford transmission companies and distributors operating the services in accordance with internationally-accepted management guidelines and parameters, the opportunity to derive sufficient income to cover any operating, maintenance and expansion costs and taxes applicable to the services, and to obtain a reasonable rate of return defined pursuant to the provisions of Article 46 of this law; [and]... (c) For distribution rates, the electricity sale price shall include the specific distribution costs inherent in the distribution business recognized to the concessionaire, and a term representative of the cost of electricity purchased in the wholesale electricity market, in a manner such that any variations in this market may be reflected in the rates applied to the respective users; (d) Ensure the minimum reasonable cost to users, compatible with the security of supply, service quality and rational use of energy[\u2026]\n\n53.\n\nSpecific to electricity distributors, subsection (c) *supra* envisages what is known to be the \"pass through\" mechanism. As drafted, the end result is a tariff rate that reflects relevant distribution costs as well as variations in the costs of purchasing and distributing electricity, which \"pass through\" to consumers.\n\n54.\n\nArticle 44 of the Provincial Electricity Law restricts the recoupment of costs attributable to services provided to one class of consumers with tariffs collected from another class or classes of consumers. Pursuant to Article 45 of the Provincial Electricity Law, tariff rates are capped at levels allowing for a rate of return that is compatible with the risk level characterizing the electricity transmission and distribution businesses as well as similar to other industries of comparable risk.\n\n55.\n\nIn line with its underlying objective of stability, Article 46 of the Provincial Electricity Law contemplates for an initial tariff schedule not exceeding a fixed-term of five years as well as designed and calculated pursuant to principles set forth in Articles 43 thru 45 introduced *supra*.\n\n56.\n\nPursuant to Article 47 of the Provincial Electricity Law, prior to the lapse of the initial tariff schedule, a successive tariff schedule also not exceeding a fixed-term of five years must be established (\"Ordinary Review\"), which mandates compliance with criteria similar to those employed in the design of the initial schedule while taking into consideration changes in the value of goods and services directly associated with the distribution of electricity.\n\n57.\n\nArticle 48 of the Provincial Electricity Law requires strict adherence to approved tariff schedules. Pursuant to the same provision, however, schedules are subject to interim modification provided an application to that effect is based on objective and justified circumstances (\"Extraordinary Review\").\n\n58.\n\nArticles 74 and 75 of the Provincial Electricity Law create the Provincial Tariff Compensation Fund (\"PTC Fund\") in order to offset the differences in ordinary distribution costs recognized among the different concessionaires and to allow consumers with similar consumption characteristics to pay homogeneous tariffs for the electricity supplied.\n\n59.\n\nTo oversee the implementation and execution of the regulatory framework, Article 14 of the Provincial Electricity Law created an independent regulatory agency known as Ente Provincial Regulador de la Electricidad (\"EPRE\"). EPRE is charged with duties to *inter alia* regulate the quality of electrical service, conduct tariff revisions, and apply penalties for any failures by concessionaires to meet standards set forth in the law, regulations and relevant concession agreements. See Provincial Electricity Law, Articles 53 thru 73.\n\n60.\n\nOn the other hand, the specific purpose of the Transformation Law is to reorganize and privatize the formerly state-owned electricity distributor, Energ\u00eda Mendoza Sociedad de Estado (\"EMSE\"). See Transformation Law, Articles 2 and 4. Article 2 of the Transformation Law separates EMSE\u2018s activities into those related to the generation of electricity and those to electricity distribution. Article 4 commissions the incorporation of three companies to become successors in interests of EMSE\u2018s divided operations.\n\n61.\n\nAccordingly, Empresa Distribuidora de Energ\u00eda de Mendoza S.A. (\"EDEMSA\"), along with Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad de Este S.A. (\"EDESTESA\"), were created to succeed EMSE as the Province of Mendoza\u2018s electricity distributors. The third company, Generaci\u00f3n El\u00e9ctrica de Mendoza (\"GEMSA\"), assumed control over EMSE\u2018s electricity generating operations.\n\n62.\n\nAs concerns EDEMSA, Article 4 of the Transformation Law specifies that the transfer of EMSE\u2018s electricity distribution concession is effectuated upon the sale of EDEMSA\u2018s Class \"A\" shares. Article 6 of the Transformation Law provides that:\n\nLa valuaci\u00f3n de las unidades empresarias, ser\u00e1 realizada en base al c\u00e1lculo del valor actual del flujo neto de fondos descontado, generado por la actividad o activos que se privaticen, en concordancia con el art. 96 de la ley 24065, art. 19 de la ley nacional 23696 y de la ley provincial 6072. No ser\u00e1n admisibles ofertas econ\u00f3micas inferiores al setenta por ciento (70%) de la valuaci\u00f3n oficial.\n\nIn English the relevant portion reads:\n\neconomic offers lower than seventy percent (70%) of the official valuation shall not be admissible.\n\n**2. Promotional and Bidding Schemes**\n--------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nStarting from the second half of 1997, the Province of Mendoza sought the sale of 51% of EDEMSA Class \"A\" shares, and to further this end, retained Chase Manhattan Bank and Salomon Smith Barney as technical, financial and international marketing advisors to *inter alia* conduct an initial valuation of the offered EDEMSA shares and undertake in road shows to promote the sale thereof.\n\n64.\n\nThe promotional scheme started with the Global Power Conference held in New York during the month of September 1997, and also included an exclusive meeting in Paris with executives of EDF, parent company to Claimant EDFI.\n\n65.\n\nIn February 1998, Chase Manhattan Bank and Salomon Smith Barney distributed an Information Memorandum (\"Info Memo\") to potential investors, including Claimants, with the aim of aiding them with the decision of whether or not to participate in the purchase of EDEMSA shares. The Info Memo discusses *inter alia* the regulatory framework governing the concession, including its underlying policies on rates and returns, cost allocation, and revision of tariffs. With respect to costs, the Info Memo indicates tariff rates are to be subject to periodic tariff adjustments to account for the inflation of electricity distribution costs as assessed pursuant to an index combining variations in the U.S. producer and consumer price indices published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n66.\n\nFurthermore, the Info Memo notes that costs reflected in the tariff schedule are to be first calculated in U.S. dollar terms and then converted to Argentine pesos for purposes of billing consumers.\n\n67.\n\nThe official bidding process was launched on 23 February 1998 with the publication of the bidding terms (\"Bidding Terms\"). Among them was the prerequisite obliging bidders to accept and initial a copy of the concession agreement that was to be entered between the Government of Mendoza and EDEMSA. Paragraph 2.1.6 of the Bidding Terms provides that:\n\nLa aplicabilidad excluyente del derecho argentino y de la sumisi\u00f3n a la jurisdicci\u00f3n de los tribunales competentes en lo contencioso administrativo de la Provincia de Mendoza, renunciando expresamente a la aplicaci\u00f3n de cualquier fuero extranjero regulado por nomas o tratados de cualquier tipo.\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\n[The acquisition of the Bidding Terms and the presentation of offers imply:] the exclusive application of Argentine law and the submission to the jurisdiction of competent courts for administrative contentions of the Province of Mendoza, expressly renouncing the application of any foreign jurisdiction regulated by norms or treaties of any kind.\n\n68.\n\nA consortium company, SODEMSA, was formed between local co-investors and the French companies, EDFI, SAURI, and Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais (former parent to Claimant Le\u00f3n) to consolidate their respective interests in bidding for the purchase of 51% of EDEMSA\u2018s Class \"A\" shares.\n\n69.\n\nOn 10 April 1998, Claimants EDFI and SAURI respectively acquired 45% and 15% interests in SODEMSA. On 20 April 1998, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais acquired a 70% interest in an Argentine company, MEDINVERT, which in turn purchased 40% of SODEMSA shares.\n\n70.\n\nThe economic offers of the qualified bidders were opened in a formal ceremony held on 23 June 1998, at which time SODEMSA\u2018s bid of US$ 237.8 million was declared the winner. The second highest bid was for US$ 207.71 million, the third for US$ 200.63 million and the fourth was a bid for US$ 193.13.\n\n71.\n\nThe Government of Mendoza and EDEMSA signed a formal agreement on 15 July 1998. On 27 July 1998, the Mendoza Congress subsequently approved the transaction and Claimants\u2018 consortium was officially awarded ownership over 51% of EDEMSA\u2018s Class \"A\" shares. SODEMSA assumed control of EDEMSA and commenced operations on 1 August 1998.\n\n72.\n\nSubsequently Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais incorporated Claimant Le\u00f3n under the laws of Luxembourg as a wholly-owned subsidiary to hold the former\u2018s interest in MENDINVERT, and accordingly transferred to Le\u00f3n the relevant shares.\n\n**3. Contractual Framework**\n----------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Concession Agreement has a prescribed term of thirty years, divided into three periods of ten years each. See Concession Agreement, Articles 3 and 4.\n\n74.\n\nThe underlying policies of the regulatory framework formed under the Provincial Electricity and Transformation Laws, in particular those found in Chapter XI of the former, are expressly memorialized, as well as incorporated by reference, in the various provisions of the Concession Agreement. See e.g., Concession Agreement, Preamble (\"Concession Agreement between the Province of Mendoza... and [EDEMSA]... with attention to the provisions of [Provincial] Laws Nos. 6,497, 6,498;... and all the legislation applicable in the Province of Mendoza...\").\n\n75.\n\nIn conformity with Article 3 of the Provincial Electricity Law, the objective of the Concession Agreement is to grant EDEMSA a concession for the exclusive provision of \"the Public Service.\" See Concession Agreement, Article 1. The Concession Agreement in turn defines \"Public Service\" to be \"the provision of electricity distribution services to Users who are connected to [EDEMSA\u2018s] electricity distribution grid, paying a tariff for the services received.\" See Concession Agreement at 2.\n\n76.\n\nArticle 25 of the Concession Agreement, running parallel with Article 46 of the Provincial Electricity Law, obligates EDEMSA to apply an initial fixed-term tariff schedule during the first five years of the Concession Agreement\u2018s entry into force (\"Initial Tariff Schedule\"). The Initial Tariff Schedule is annexed to the Concession Agreement as Sub-Annex 3. See Concession Agreement, Article 27.\n\n77.\n\nArticle 28 of the Concession Agreement memorializes the Ordinary Tariff Review contemplated for in Article 47 of the Provincial Electricity Law. In pertinent part, Concession Agreement Article 28 provides:\n\nPrevio al vencimiento el per\u00edodo inicial del Articulo 25, el EPRE elevar\u00e1 al Poder Ejecutivo la propuesta de las tarifas por per\u00edodos de CINCO (5) A\u00d1OS. En los nuevos cuadros tarifarios se tendr\u00e1 en cuenta lo dispuesto por los art\u00edculos 43 a 45 de la Ley N\u00b0 6,497 y su Decreto Reglamentario, y se establecer\u00e1n los descuentos anuales previstos en el art\u00edculo 46 de la Ley N\u00b0 6,498. A ese fin, con UN (1) A\u00d1O de antelaci\u00f3n a la finalizaci\u00f3n de cada per\u00edodo de CINCO (5) A\u00d1OS, la CONCESIONARIA presentar\u00e1 al EPRE la propuesta de un nuevo Cuadro Tarifario.\n\nIn English the provision reads:\n\nPrior to the end of the initial period provided for in Article 25, EPRE shall submit to the Executive Branch the proposed rates for FIVE (5) YEAR periods. The provisions of Law 6,497, Articles 43-45, and its Regulations shall be taken into account in preparing the new rate structures and the annual discounts provided for Law 6,498, Article 46 shall be established. To that end, ONE (1) year before the end of each period of FIVE (5) YEARS the CONCESSIONAIRE shall present to EPRE the proposal for a new Rate Structure.\n\n78.\n\nThe Extraordinary Tariff Review contemplated for in Article 48 of the Provincial Electricity Law is also memorialized in the Concession Agreement, which in Article 29 provides:\n\nFor the purpose of rate revision, EPRE:\n\na) May contract the services of a consulting group with recognized experience in the electrical sector, which must prepare an alternative rates proposal following guidelines identical to those defined for the CONCESSIONAIRE.\n\nb) Shall analyze both proposals and establish the Rate Structure that shall be ineffect during the following FIVE (5) YEAR period.\n\nThe CONCESSIONAIRE must strictly apply the rates approved. Nevertheless, it may request from EPRE the changes it considers necessary, for which purpose the procedure established in Law 6,497, Articles 48 and following, and its regulations shall apply.\n\nIn Spanish the Provision reads:\n\nEI EPRE, a los efectos de proceder a la revisi\u00f3n tarifaria:\n\na) podr\u00e1 contratar los servicios de un grupo consultor de reconocida experiencia en el Sector El\u00e9ctrico, que deber\u00e1 efectuar una propuesta tarifaria alternativa siguiendo id\u00e9nticos lineamientos que los definidos para Ia CONCESIONARIA.\n\nb) analizar\u00e1 ambas propuestas y establecer\u00e1 el Cuadro Tarifario que estar\u00e1 vigente en el siguiente per\u00edodo de CINCO (5) A\u00d1OS.\n\nLa CONCESIONARIA deber\u00e1 aplicar estrictamente las tarifas aprobadas. Sin embargo, podr\u00e1 solicitar al EPRE las modificaciones que considere necesarias, a cuyo fin se aplicar\u00e1 el procedimiento previsto por los art\u00edculos 48 y ss. de la Ley No 6,497 y su reglamentaci\u00f3n.\n\n79.\n\nAs introduced *supra*, Article 48 of the Provincial Electricity Law in pertinent part provides that \"[t]ransmission companies and distributors... may, however, solicit to the EPRE modifications considered to be necessary, if their application is based on objective and justified circumstances.\"\n\n80.\n\nThe Concession Agreement also memorializes as contractual terms those matters highlighted in the Info Memo, including *inter alia* the accounting of costs reflected in the tariff schedule in U.S. dollar terms as well as the periodic adjustment of rates in consideration of inflation in electricity distribution costs. See Concession Agreement, Sub-Annex 2 (\"Calculation of Tariff Schedule Parameters\").\n\n81.\n\nThe Currency Clause in Sub-Annex 2 of the Concession Agreement is of particular importance to the claims raised in the present dispute, and Section I of Sub-Annex 2 in pertinent part provides as follows:\n\nTodos los costos mencionados se calcular\u00e1n y recalcular\u00e1n en d\u00f3lares estadounidenses. El Cuadro Tarifario recalculado o resultante, se expresar\u00e1 en el momento de su aplicaci\u00f3n para la facturaci\u00f3n a los usuarios en pesos ($), teniendo en cuenta para ello la relaci\u00f3n para la convertibilidad al peso, establecida en el Articulo 3\u00b0 del Decreto Nacional N\u00b0 2128/91 y en las condiciones establecidas en la ley 23,298.\n\nIn English translation, the provision reads:\n\nAll the aforementioned costs shall be calculated and recalculated in U.S. dollars. The recalculated or resulting Rate Structure shall be expressed in Argentine pesos ($) at the time it is applied to the user invoices, at the peso conversion rate established in National Decree 2128/91, Article 3, and under the conditions established in [Federal] Law [No.] 23,298 [text corrected by hand to read: \"23,928\"].\n\n82.\n\nFirst, the Currency Clause\u2018s cross-references to Federal Law No. 23,928 and its implementing National Decree No. 2,128 (collectively \"Convertibility Law\") point to a federal legislation and its implementing executive order, respectively passed and issued in March and October of 1991, seven years prior to the signing of the Concession Agreement, as part of a national policy on economic reform instituted in the late-1980\u2018s and early-1990\u2018s by Argentina\u2018s former president, Carlos Menem. Upon its implementation, the Convertibility Law pegged the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar at a foreign exchange rate of one to one, which as further discussed *infra* lasted until 6 January 2002.\n\n83.\n\nIn other words, the operation of the Currency Clause may be summarized as follows. Pursuant to the \"pass through\" mechanism elaborated in Article 43(c) of the Provincial Electricity Law introduced *supra*, tariff rates invoiced to consumers must reflect for EDEMSA\u2018s costs of purchasing and distributing electricity, specifically those mentioned in the first paragraph of Section I of Sub-Annex 2, namely, costs representing the purchase of electricity from the Electricity Wholesale Market (\"MEM\") as well as the transportation, distribution and commercialization of electricity.\n\n84.\n\nThese costs are then coupled with the concessionaire\u2018s return on capital to make up what is referred to as the distribution-added value (\"DAV\"). The DAV passes the costs of purchasing and distributing electricity through to the final consumer and constitutes the only remuneration the distributor obtains for services provided.\n\n85.\n\nThe Currency Clause prescribes the calculation of these costs in terms of U.S. dollar currency for purposes of assessing the ultimate tariff rate to be invoiced to consumers. Subsequently, user invoices would be expressed in Argentine pesos in accordance with the monetary policy and exchange rate contemplated for in the Convertibility Law, which until 6 January 2002 pegged parity between the U.S. dollar and the Argentine peso at a ratio of one to one.\n\n86.\n\nSecond, the Currency Clause\u2018s reference to \"recalculation\" of costs concerns the periodic adjustment of tariff rates to account for the inflation of electricity distribution costs, which was highlighted in the Info Memo. In this connection, Section IV of Sub-Annex 2 (\"Cost Adjustment Clause\") in pertinent part provides:\n\nLos Costos Propios de Distribuci\u00f3n y los Gastos de Comercializaci\u00f3n se recalcular\u00e1n anualmente en coincidencia con la actualizaci\u00f3n de los Precios Mayoristas de Energ\u00eda y Potencia para el per\u00edodo estacional que da inicio en el mes de Noviembre de cada a\u00f1o, y tendr\u00e1n vigencia para los doce (12) meses siguientes al rec\u00e1lculo. Para el rec\u00e1lculo anual se utilizar\u00e1 la siguiente expresi\u00f3n:...\n\nIn English the provision reads:\n\nThe Actual Distribution Costs and the Marketing Costs shall be recalculated each year to coincide with the updating of the Wholesale Energy and Power Prices for the seasonal period beginning in November each year and shall be in effect for the twelve (12) months following the recalculation. The following expression shall be used for the annual recalculation:....\n\n87.\n\nAccordingly, the Cost-Adjustment Clause directs adjusting tariff rates every twelve months in the month of November. At that time, pursuant to the Currency Clause, relevant costs would undergo a recalculation in U.S. dollars. The purpose of the recalculation is to account for the inflation of electricity distribution costs, which must be assessed in accordance with an index combining variations in the U.S. producer and consumer price indices published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Producer Price Index (\"U.S. PPI\") is an indicator of the wholesale price of industrial commodities in the United States, while the Consumer Price Index (\"U.S. CPI\") is an indicator of U.S. retail prices.\n\n88.\n\nArticle 40 of the Concession Agreement contains an \"Applicable Law and Jurisdiction\" clause which in its entirety provides:\n\nSin perjuicio del marco legal sustancial dado por las Leyes N\u00b0 6,497, 6,498 y sus reglamentaciones, el CONTRATO ser\u00e1 regido e interpretado de acuerdo con las leyes de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina, y en particular, por las normas y principios del Derecho Administrativo, sin que ella obste a que las relaciones que la CONCESIONARIA mantenga con terceros se rijan sustancialmente por el Derecho Privado.\n\nPara todos los efectos derivados del CONTRATO, las partes aceptan la jurisdicci\u00f3n de los Tribunales en lo Contencioso Administrativo competentes de la ciudad de Mendoza.\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\nWithout prejudice to the substantive legal framework pursuant to the [Provincial Electricity Law], the [Transformation Law], and their regulations, the [Concession] Contract shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Argentine Republic, and in particular, by the norms and principles of Administrative Law, without precluding the substantive governance of Private Law with respect to relationships the Concessionaire maintains with third parties. To all effects derived from the [Concession] Contract, the parties accept the jurisdiction of competent Courts for Administrative Contentions of the city of Mendoza.\n\n89.\n\nClaimants\u2018 consortium company, SODEMSA, which owned 51% of EDEMSA Class \"A\" Shares, thus is what is referred to when the Concession Agreement speaks of \"the Investment Company owning the Majority Stake.\" For example, pursuant to Article 12 of the Concession Agreement \"the Investment Company owning the Majority Stake\" may not \"modify its holdings nor sell its shares during the first five (5) years of Entry into Force, without previous authorization of the Executive Power. \\*\\*\\* For their part, the shareholders of the referred to Investment Company shall not be able to modify their holdings or sell their shares in said Investment Company during the term of five (5) years since Entry into Force without prior approval of the [Province of Mendoza].\"8\n\nIn its original Spanish, Concession Agreement, Article 12 provides:  \n La CONCESIONARIA deber\u00e1 tener como objeto principal la prestaci\u00f3n del SERVICIO PUBLICO en los t\u00e9rminos del presente CONTRATO.  \n La SOCIEDAD INVERSORA titular del PAQUETE MAYORITARIO, no podr\u00e1 modificar su participaci\u00f3n ni vender sus acciones durante los primeros CINCO (5) ANOS de la ENTRADA EN VIGENCIA, sin previa autorizaci\u00f3n del Poder Ejecutivo. Con posterioridad al plazo indicado, solo podr\u00e1 hacerlo previa autorizaci\u00f3n del EPRE. Cualquier cambio de domicilio, deber\u00e1 ser aprobado por el EPRE.  \n Por su parte, los accionistas de la referida SOCIEDAD INVERSORA no podr\u00e1n durante el termino de CINCO (5) ANOS desde Ia ENTRADA EN VIGENCIA modificar sus participaciones o vender acciones de dicha SOCIEDAJD INVERSORA sin autorizaci\u00f3n previa de la CONCEDENTE. EI OPERADOR, por el mismo t\u00e9rmino, deber\u00e1 mantener una participaci\u00f3n no menor del VEINTE POR CIENTO (20%) del capital social de la SOCIEDAD INVERSORA. Finalizado dicho termino, de CINCO (5) ANOS, las modificaciones de las participaciones o la venta de acciones solo podr\u00e1n realizarse previa comunicaci\u00f3n al EPRE, cumpliendo las limitaciones societarias establecidas en la Ley N\u00b0 6,497 Y su Reglamentaci\u00f3n.  \n En el caso de las sociedades titulares de las acciones de la SOCIEDAD INVERSORA estas deber\u00e1n informar al EPRE todas las modificaciones sociales o de tenencias accionarias que signifiquen una modificaci\u00f3n en el control de las mencionadas sociedades respecto del existente en el momento de celebrarse el contrato de transferencia del PAQUETE MAYORITARIO a dicha SOCIEDAD INVERSORA.  \n La CONCESIONARIA tiene la obligaci\u00f3n de informar al EPRE, en forma inmediata y fehaciente la configuraci\u00f3n de cualquiera de las situaciones descriptas precedentemente de las cuales tuvieran conocimiento, y es responsable del cumplimiento de las resoluciones que al efecto determine el EPRE.  \n En todo supuesto de transferencia O suscripci\u00f3n de ACCIONES CLASE \"A\", el adquirente o nuevo titular de las mismas deber\u00e1 otorgar todos los mandatos que en el presente se prev\u00e9 que otorguen los COMPRADORES, en los t\u00e9rminos y condiciones establecidos.\"\n\n90.\n\nArticle 13 of the Concession Agreement makes it EDEMSA\u2018s exclusive responsibility to \"realize the necessary investments to assure the provision of the Public Service in conformity with the level of quality required....\"9 See also, Concession Agreement, Article 22 (listing as sub-articles thereof the various obligations of the concessionaire). On the other hand, Article 23 of the Concession Agreement obliges the Province to \"guarantee... the exclusivity of the Public Service, for the duration and subject to the conditions determined in the present Contract.\" In accordance with these provisions, which collectively form the structure of what is referred to as the \"price cap system,\" EDEMSA can only enhance profitability by lowering costs and increasing efficiency rather than through an escalation of tariff rates.\n\nIn its original Spanish, Concession Agreement, Article 13 provides:  \n Es exclusiva responsabilidad de la CONCESIONARIA realizar las inversiones necesarias para asegurar la prestaci\u00f3n del SERVICIO PUBLICO conforme al nivel de calidad exigido en el \"Subanexo 5\", as\u00ed como la de celebrar los contratos de compraventa de energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica en bloque que considere necesarios para cubrir el incremento de demanda dentro de su AREA. Asimismo, la CONCESIONARIA deber\u00e1 implementar pol\u00edticas de desarrollo de proveedores y pol\u00edticas de compras y suministros que habiliten mecanismos de competencia.  \n El r\u00e9gimen de contrataciones previsto deber\u00e1 contemplar dispuesto por el art. 13 inc. d) y f) de la Ley N\u00b0 6,498.  \nEI EPRE reglamentar\u00e1 lo referido a los contratos de transferencia de tecnolog\u00eda y subcontrataci\u00f3n de obras significativas, como asimismo limitaciones a su respectiva contraprestaci\u00f3n. Dicha reglamentaci\u00f3n determinar\u00e1 cuales obras se consideran significativas. En los casos de violaci\u00f3n de la reglamentaci\u00f3n o aquellos en que la contraprestaci\u00f3n no sea razonable para la obra contratada, el EPRE aplicar\u00e1 las sanciones correspondientes.  \n En ning\u00fan caso se podr\u00e1 celebrar contratos de subconcesi\u00f3n o contratos que, bajo cualquier denominaci\u00f3n, impliquen la asunci\u00f3n por parte de terceros subcontratantes, de las obligaciones impuestas a la CONCESIONARIA en este CONTRATO *.*  \n En todos los casos, deber\u00e1 informarse al EPRE los actos jur\u00eddicos que tengan como objeto principal o accesorio la transferencia, cesi\u00f3n o licencia de tecnolog\u00eda o marcas o cualquier acto que se inscriba de conformidad con el r\u00e9gimen de la Ley de Transferencia de Tecnolog\u00eda del Exterior No 22,426. Igual procedimiento se aplicara a cualquier contrato con personas INTEGRANTES o vinculadas a la SOCIEDAD INVERSORA titular del PAQUETE MAYORITARIO.  \n Los contratos deber\u00e1n incluir una clausula estipulando expresamente la posibilidad de continuar su ejecuci\u00f3n por parte de Ia CONCEDENTE u otros concesionarios, en caso de extinci\u00f3n de la CONCESION.\n\n91.\n\nArticle 32 of the Concession Agreement authorizes EPRE to sanction EDEMSA for nonperformance of the latter\u2018s contractual obligations. See also, Concession Agreement, Sub-Annex 5, which contains the prescribed sanctions EPRE is authorized to apply.\n\n**B. PRE-EMERGENCY MEASURES AFFECTING THE CONCESSION**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal notes a certain fluidity in the claims relating to regulatory measures adopted prior to the national and provincial emergency laws discussed below (\"Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession\"). Claimants initially listed seven (7) such preemergency measures which allegedly breached the Concession Agreement. See Memorial of 2 May 2005, page 69-88. However the damages calculation in the same Memorial (pages 223-224) includes only five enumerated measures (having split the initial category 4 into categories 3 and 5), plus another item at paragraph 480 concerning \"additional obligations\" seeming to omit the quasi-currency payment matter and the more stringent conditions of service. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraphs 478-79; see also LECG Report of April 2005, at paragraphs 168-84.\n\n93.\n\nMoreover, Claimants\u2018 Post-hearing Brief on Quantum, as well as their expert reports, seems to omit discussion not only of quasi-currency payments and the more stringent conditions of service, but also Claimants\u2018 prior calculation of damages for what was referred to as \"unilateral expansion of the scope of concession by including the Polvaredas area\" See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 480.\n\n94.\n\nRespondent\u2018s enumeration of the various items takes a different approach, including ten (10) items in their Counter-memorial and nine (9) in their Rejoinder.\n\n95.\n\nClaimants\u2018 initial seven (7) categories are as follows:\n\n- First Modification of Tariff Schedule: the \"Use of Network\" Fees\n\n- Unilateral Expansion of the Scope of Concession\n\n- Second Modification of Tariff Schedule: The Optional T-2 Tariff Category\n\n- Refusal to Pay Amounts Owed to EDEMSA and Denial of Access to Court\n\n- Modification of the Subsidies Regime\n\n- Imposition of More Stringent Conditions Regarding Quality of Service\n\n- Imposition of the Obligation to Accept Quasi-currency as payment from users.\n\n96.\n\nRespondent\u2018s ten (10) item categorization are provided as follows:\n\n- Modification of \"Use of Network\" Fees\n\n- Second Modification to Tariff Schedule: The Optional T-2 Tariff Category\n\n- Incorporation of the Town of Polvaredas Into the Concession Area\n\n- Incorporation of the \"scattered electricity market\" Users\n\n- Failure to Pay Amounts Owed in Regards to Nihuil IV (First Nihuil Claim)\n\n- Failure to Pay Amounts Owed in Regards to Nihuil IV (Second Nihuil Claim)\n\n- Failure to Pay Subsidies and Provision of Public Lighting Services\n\n- Modification of the \"Agricultural Irrigation\" Subsidies Regime\n\n- Imposition of More Stringent Conditions Regarding Quality of Service\n\n- Imposition of the Obligation to Accept Quasi-Currency from Users.\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the substantial overlap among the various categories of PreEmergency Measures affecting the Concession commends analysis according to the following six (6) rubrics.\n\n**1. Tariff Schedule under the Concession Agreement**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Payment Structure Applicable to Large Users**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nAnexo II, Subanexo 1 of the Concession Agreement set forth a tariff schedule (\"Tariff Schedule\") which *inter alia* established different tariff categories depending on the type of user. Anexo II, Subanexo 1, Chapter 2, subsection 3 of the Tariff Schedule in the Concession Agreement provides that one of the components of the tariffs applicable to large users is a fee for \"Use of the Network\" (\"Network-Use Fee\"). Under Anexo II, Subanexo 1, \"Tarifa Nro. 2 (Grandes Demandas)\" of Chapter 2, Subsection 1, users were to fall under the Tariff No. 2 (\"T-2\") category when their maximum power demand exceeded 10kW.\n\n99.\n\nThe Network-Use Fee is calculated based on the power capacity that is installed and made available to each particular user. Every twelve months, each user is to notify EDEMSA of the power capacity that it will require in the next twelve-month period. The power capacity requested by, and made available to, each user determines the amount of the fee each user will pay for use of the network during the relevant twelve-month period.\n\n100.\n\nIssued on 28 August 1998, Resolution No. 8/98 established a different fee schedule based on the last non-null power recorded by each user immediately prior to the beginning of the concession. Resolution 8/98 retroactively applied to the date of 1 August 1998, which was the first day of the Concession Agreement.\n\n101.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether the tariff schedule set forth by Resolution No. 8/98 was intended to apply to all large users, including those pre-existing the Concession Agreement, or solely to future large users.\n\n102.\n\nOn 16 September 1998, EDEMSA filed an administrative claim before EPRE challenging Resolution 8/98. On 12 May 1999, EPRE issued Resolution EPRE No. 73/99, in which it rejected EDEMSA\u2018s claim.\n\n103.\n\nResolution No. 73/99 allowed large users to contract with EDEMSA for the level of power required on a quarterly or bi-annual basis.\n\n104.\n\nEDEMSA filed an administrative appeal before the provincial executive power on 28 May 2000, challenging both Resolution 8/98 and Resolution 73/99.\n\n105.\n\nOn 22 November 2000, the Government of Mendoza issued Decree No. 2468, rejecting EDEMSA\u2018s claims and confirming the modifications to the Concession Agreement.\n\n**b) Optional Tariff T-2 Category**\n-----------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Tariff Schedule under the Concession Agreement provided for a \"transitory tariff\", applicable to all users who at the beginning of EDEMSA\u2018s concession either (i) did not have power measuring equipment appropriate for their classification level within the Tariff Schedule established by the Concession Agreement, or (ii) had yet to be classified under one of the categories provided in the Tariff Schedule. See \" Tariff Regime - Tariff Schedule\"; Concession Agreement, Annex II, Sub-Annex 1, Chapter 5 [\"Miscellaneous Orders\"], Paragraph 2. In such cases, the transitory tariff was to apply until the user was classified under a tariff category.\n\n107.\n\nThe Concession Agreement required EDEMSA to install the requisite measuring equipment and to classify each user based on its respective power consumption. The Concession Agreement required EDEMSA to complete the meter installation and user classification by specific deadlines, which, depending on the user\u2018s level of service demand, was either 6 or 12 months.\n\n108.\n\nDuring August and September 1999, EPRE issued Resolution No. 125/99, which was later supplemented by Resolution No. 131/99. The evidence shows that Resolution No. 125/99 permitted users whose successive readings falls below 10 kW to continue with their original tariff category, known as the Tariff No. 1 (\"T-1\") category, applicable to small demands. Resolution No. 131/99 suspended payment obligations of those users which had already been reclassified or were about to be reclassified as T-2 large users, and mandated refund of any and all monies that may have been billed in excess due to their reclassification. Resolution No. 131/99 required EDEMSA to resend invoices to every user which had been reclassified as \"T-2 Large Demands.\" The revised invoices were to be based on the tariff class which was in force prior to their reclassification. Such recalculation was required from the time the reclassification was implemented.\n\n109.\n\nOn 9 December 1999, the transitory tariff was extended for a period of one year until 31 July 2000.\n\n110.\n\nOn 11 August 2000, following expiration of the one-year extension, the Governor of Mendoza issued Executive Order No. 1632/00, which incorporated into Chapter 2 of the Concession Agreement a new tariff category as \"Subparagraph 7: Large Demands (Optional).\" This order was to be in force from 1 August 2000 to 31 July 2003.\n\n111.\n\nDecree No. 1632/00 provided all users who had benefited from the transitory tariff the option to remain within such class, identified as the \"Optional T-2\" category, or to be reclassified into a new category based on their actual power consumption. The Parties are in dispute as to whether the \"Optional T-2\" Tariff was to include a Network-Use Fee.\n\n112.\n\nOn 13 September 2000, EDEMSA filed an administrative action before the Supreme Court of Mendoza challenging the constitutionality of Decree No. 1632/00.\n\n**2. Polvaredas Area and the Scattered Electricity Market**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nUnder Resolution EPRE No.183/99, EPRE expressly incorporated a local town, known as \"Polvaredas\", into EDEMSA\u2018s area of concession, and obligated EDEMSA to serve such town.\n\n114.\n\nPolvaredas is geographically located within the area covered by EDEMSA\u2018s Concession Agreement, but the Parties dispute whether such town had been expressly excluded from the area of concession specifically defined in the Concession Agreement. Polvaredas was not connected to the distribution network transferred to EDEMSA, and, therefore, required its own generation equipment, which had not been transferred to EDEMSA with the concession.\n\n115.\n\nOn 23 May 2002, EDEMSA challenged Resolution EPRE No. 183/99 before the Supreme Court of Mendoza. The Parties disagree as to whether the Supreme Court of Mendoza had rendered a decision with respect to EDEMSA\u2018s challenge of 23 May 2002.\n\n116.\n\nOn 3 December 1999, the Government of Mendoza issued Provincial Decree No. 2379/99, expressly incorporating into EDEMSA\u2018s area of concession another category for users that fall within the \"scattered electricity market\" (\"Scattered Market\"). This category comprises of users that are located in distant regions, and that are not linked to the interconnected distribution network.\n\n117.\n\nOn 8 March 2000 EDEMSA challenged the constitutionality of Provincial Decree No. 2379/99 before the Supreme Court of Mendoza. The Parties disagree whether a decision has been rendered by the Supreme Court of Mendoza with respect to EDEMSA\u2018s challenge of 8 March 2000.\n\n**3. Alleged Failure to Pay Amount Owed**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**a) Nihuil IV Claims**\n-----------------------\n\n118.\n\nArticle 37 of the Transformation Law mandated the assignment of EMSE\u2018s rights and obligations arising out of a contract entered into with a power generation company, Hidronihuil S.A. The contract was for the construction, operation and maintenance of a hydroelectric power plant known as NIHUIL IV (\"Nihuil IV Contract\").\n\n119.\n\nThe Nihuil IV Contract provided, *inter alia*, for a commitment by EMSE to purchase all of the Nihuil IV power plant\u2018s output at a price higher than that available in the Electricity Wholesale Market. Article 37 of the Transformation Law established that \"[t]he difference between the price that EDEMSA must pay pursuant to this contract and the purchase value of energy in the electricity wholesale market, shall be compensated to EDEMSA by the Province with funds allocated pursuant to Article 47.\"\n\n120.\n\nIn conformity with Article 37 of the Transformation law, Article 22.36 of the Concession Agreement memorialized the same compensation scheme. In return for servicing a loan obtained by EMSE for purposes related to the construction of the NIHUIL IV, EDEMSA would receive monthly payments of the difference between the NIHUIL IV price and the going market price.\n\n121.\n\nThe evidence shows that, in February 2000, the Government of Mendoza stopped making payments to EDEMSA for the compensation provided for under Article 37 of the Transformation Law and Article 22.36 of the Concession Agreement.\n\n122.\n\nOn 20 November 2000, EDEMSA filed a claim before the Supreme Court of Mendoza seeking payment of amounts accrued during the period of February to July 2000. On 31 May 2002, Supreme Court of Mendoza declined to hear EDEMSA\u2018s claim, instructing EDEMSA to exhaust all recourses available at the administrative level before resorting to the judiciary.\n\n123.\n\nEDEMSA appealed the decision of 31 May 2002 before the Federal Supreme Court of Argentina. In August 2003, the Federal Supreme Court declined to hear EDEMSA\u2018s case, finding that it lacked jurisdiction to review an interim procedural decision. On 14 March 2002, EDEMSA filed a similar claim of reimbursement before the Supreme Court of Mendoza, this time seeking payment of amounts accrued during the period August 2000 to June 2001.\n\n124.\n\nFollowing the Mendoza Supreme Court\u2018s dismissal of its first claim with respect to NIHUIL IV, EDEMSA withdrew its second claim, and filed a demand for payment with the provincial government authorities. Thereafter, EDEMSA filed an administrative request for \"pronto despacho\", which is a request under administrative law for an expedited decision. EDEMSA received no response from the government authorities.\n\n125.\n\nSubsequently, EDEMSA filed an amended complaint with the Mendoza Supreme Court. In August 2003, the Supreme Court refused to hear EDEMSA\u2018s claim for lack of jurisdiction to review an interim procedural decision.\n\n126.\n\nUnder a contractual renegotiation agreement executed by EDEMSA and the Government of Mendoza, the parties agreed on a procedure to honor the outstanding payments due to the Concessionaire as at 31 February 2005, including the NIHUIL IV non-payments.\n\n**b) Subsidies and Public Lighting Services**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe Tariff Schedule in the Concession Agreement provided for the application of subsidized tariffs for certain users, such as the elderly and those engaged in agricultural irrigation, as well as certain sectors, such as rural areas. The Tariff Schedule establishes that the difference arising out of the application of such tariff in lieu of that set forth in the Concession Agreement shall be covered by the PTC Fund.\n\n128.\n\nTo collect from the PTC Fund, EDEMSA was required to submit a monthly statement before EPRE, itemizing the amounts due by the Government. EPRE was required to review the calculations submitted by EDEMSA and upon approval, to pay the appropriate amounts due within ten business days from the date of EPRE\u2018s notice of approval.\n\n129.\n\nSince August 1999, the provincial government has failed to make payments owed, including compensation for the above-mentioned subsidy as well as for the provision of the public lighting services, despite EDEMSA continuing to submit monthly statements and obtain EPRE approvals.\n\n130.\n\nIn August 2001, EDEMSA filed an administrative claim with the Ministry of the Environment and Public Works (the authority in charge of managing the Provincial Fund). Receiving no response, in September 2001, EDEMSA filed a similar request with the Governor\u2018s office. On 14 March 2002, EDEMSA filed a claim before the Supreme Court of Mendoza seeking payment of AR$ 5,498,653.19. On 31 October 2002, the Supreme Court of Mendoza refused to hear EDEMSA\u2018s claim.\n\n**4. Agricultural Irrigation Subsidies**\n----------------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nThe Transformation Law set forth a mechanism for subsidizing the electricity consumption by certain agricultural users for irrigation purposes.\n\n132.\n\nUnder this system, EDEMSA was to be compensated for the difference between the subsidized tariff, referred to as the \"Reference Tariff\", and a benchmark tariff, known as the \"Tariff Payable to Distributor.\" Under Article 36 of the Transformation Law, all amounts due to EDEMSA were to be paid out from the Provincial Fund for the Compensation of Tariffs.\n\n133.\n\nThis subsidy mechanism implemented by the Transformation Law was incorporated into EDEMSA\u2018s Concession Agreement. Accordingly, Chapter 2 of the Tariff Schedule in the Concession Agreement required EDEMSA to apply the \"Reference Tariff\" to agricultural producers. Chapter 2 set forth the government\u2018s obligation to compensate EDEMSA for the difference that may exist between the amounts billed to the beneficiaries of the subsidy and those that would result from the application of the \"Tariff Payable to Distributor.\"\n\n**5. Imposition of Service Quality Conditions**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nOn 5 January 2001, the Government of Mendoza enacted Provincial Law No. 6,856. Sections 2 through 6 of Law No. 6,856 set forth procedures for the filing of claims against EDEMSA by users who allege damages due to failures in the electricity distribution system.\n\n135.\n\nSection 2 eliminated the requirement to file an administrative claim in the first instance, thereby enabling users to resort directly to local courts. Section 5 directed courts to increase by fifty percent any damages award against EDEMSA in the event that EDEMSA challenges the merits of the claim or the existence of the alleged failure in the system. Section 6 established that the failure to comply with a damages award is tantamount to a \"severe breach.\"\n\n136.\n\nEDEMSA filed a claim challenging Law No. 6856 on the ground that many provisions thereof were contrary to the Provincial Constitution. The Provincial Supreme Court dismissed the action brought by EDEMSA on 10 August 2005.\n\n**6. Quasi-Currency**\n---------------------\n\n137.\n\nProvincial Laws No. 6955 (4 December 2001) and No. 6982 (20 February 2002) required EDEMSA to accept payment from its clients with notes, in lieu of monetary currency, issued by the Mendoza government\u2018s treasury for users\u2018 electricity bills.\n\n138.\n\nThese notes were known as \"LECOPS\" (Letras de Cancelaci\u00f3n de Obligaciones Provinciales or \"Notes for the Cancellation of Provincial Obligations\" ) and \"PETROMS.\"\n\n139.\n\nUnder Section 2 of Provincial Law No. 6955, a penalty against EDEMSA would apply in the event it refused to accept payments in LECOPs.\n\n140.\n\nSection 6 of Law No. 6982 established that the notes would mature on 30 September 2003, on which 110.4904% of their nominal value would be paid.\n\n**C. EMERGENCY LAWS AND RENEGOTIATION PROCESS**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**1. National and Provincial Emergency Laws**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe confusion and disorder characterizing the economic turmoil experienced by Argentina during late-2001 and early-2002 (\"Argentine Economic Turmoil\") is well documented by tribunals which have addressed investment treaty-based claims arising from the measures undertaken by Argentina in response to then-existing circumstances.10\n\nSee, e.g., *Sempra Energy (U.S.) v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16 (Award of 28 September 2007); *Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. et al. (U.S.) v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/03 (Award of 22 May 2007); *CMS Gas Transmission Co. (U.S.) v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/08 (Award of 12 May 2005).\n\n142.\n\nIn late 2001, Argentine banks experienced massive bank runs, protests and demonstrations were wide-spread, and upon the resignation of elected President Fernando de la R\u00faa in late December 2001, the national government subsequently witnessed the appointment and resignation of four presidents within the span of three weeks. The Argentine Congress ultimately appointed Eduardo Duhalde as interim president for a term to last until December 2003.\n\n143.\n\nOn 19 December 2001, Federal Decree No. 1678/2001 was issued pursuant to Article 23 of the Argentine Constitution, which grants constitutional authority to the Executive and Legislative branches to declare a State of Siege (\" *Estado de Sitio* \") in instances considered to threaten the exercise of the Argentine Constitution. Federal Decree No. 1678/2001 originally contemplated a State of Siege to last for thirty days but was terminated three days later on 21 December 2001 through the issuance of Federal Decree No. 1679/2001.\n\n144.\n\nPresident Duhalde\u2018s first measure to stabilize his nation\u2018s economy was the enactment of Federal Law No. 25,561 on 6 January 2002 (\"National Emergency Law\").11 Of particular importance is Articles 3 thru 5 and 8 thru 10 of the National Emergency Law.\n\nOfficial title, \"Law of Public Emergency and Reform of the Monetary Exchange Regime.\"\n\n145.\n\nFirst, Articles 3 thru 5 of the National Emergency Law (the \"2002 Monetary Measures\") amended the Convertibility Law in ways that abrogated the fixed foreign exchange rate of one Argentine peso to one U.S. dollar that was adopted in the early 1990\u2018s, and in its stead, implemented a floating monetary regime whereby the value of the local currency would be determined by market forces. Once the fixed-parity regime was set aside, the Argentine peso devalued on average three-fold so that one Argentine peso could no longer be converted into one U.S. dollar but rather approximately three Argentine pesos would be needed to acquire the same U.S. dollar.\n\n146.\n\nSecond, Articles 8 thru 10 of the National Emergency Law (hereinafter \"Emergency Tariff Measures\") *inter alia* abrogated tariff terms involving foreign currencies contained in public utilities contracts, including the Concession Agreement\u2018s Currency and Cost-Adjustment Clauses. In conformity with principles of federalism, the Government of Argentina invited its provinces to adopt the Emergency Tariff Measures.12 See National Emergency Law, Article 14.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal notes that no such invitation was necessary for the adherence of the 2002 Monetary Measures since monetary policy falls within the prerogative of the Argentine federal government.\n\n147.\n\nFor its account, through the enactment of Provincial Law No. 6,976 on 15 January 2002 (hereinafter \"Provincial Emergency Law\"), the Government of Mendoza adopted the Emergency Tariff Measures, fully adhering to Articles 8 and 10 of the National Emergency Law and, as discussed *infra*, adopting a slightly revised version of Article 9. The texts of Articles 8 and 10 of the National Emergency Law are not separately spelled out in the Provincial Emergency Law but rather incorporated therein by reference. See Provincial Emergency Law, Article 1.\n\n148.\n\nAccordingly, Article 8 of the National Emergency Law provides as follows:\n\nARTICULO 8\u00b0 \" Disp\u00f3nese que a partir de la sanci\u00f3n de la presente ley, en los contratos celebrados por la Administraci\u00f3n P\u00fablica bajo normas de derecho p\u00fablico, comprendidos entre ellos los de obras y servicios p\u00fablicos, quedan sin efecto las cl\u00e1usulas de ajuste en d\u00f3lar o en otras divisas extranjeras y las cl\u00e1usulas indexatorias basadas en \u00edndices de precios de otros pa\u00edses y cualquier otro mecanismo indexatorio. Los precios y tarifas resultantes de dichas cl\u00e1usulas, quedan establecidos en pesos a la relaci\u00f3n de cambio UN PESO ($ 1) = UN DOLAR ESTADOUNIDENSE (U$S 1).\n\n149.\n\nThe relevant English translation, taken from Mr. Eduardo Ratti\u2018s statement of 15 November 2008, would read: \"All clauses adjusting prices in dollars or any other foreign currency and any price indexation clauses in any government contracts under public law, including public works and services, shall be null and void. Prices and rates arising from any such provisions are hereby established in pesos at a rate of ARS 1 = US$ 1.\"\n\n150.\n\nThe Concession Agreement, being a public service contract, falls under the ambit of the Emergency Tariff Measures, which declares the Cost-Adjustment Clause no longer applicable since the provision is one regarding adjustment in U.S. dollars as well as adjustment based on foreign price indices. By precluding periodic tariff adjustments as provided for in the Cost-Adjustment Clause, the Emergency Tariff Measures in effect placed a freeze on tariff rates.\n\n151.\n\nFurthermore, despite the 2002 Monetary Measures, which de-pegged the Argentine peso so as to float at one-third of its value vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar prior to the abrogation of the Convertibility Law, the Emergency Tariff Measures imposed a fixed parity rate between the U.S. dollar and Argentine peso of one to one for purposes of assessing \"[p]rices and rates arising from\" the Cost-Adjustment Clause. See National Emergency Law, Article 8. This latter aspect of the Emergency Tariff Measures is commonly referred to (and therefore herein as well) as \"pesification\" and it effectively overrides the Currency Clause, the primary provision in the Concession Agreement addressing the calculation and recalculation of costs and tariffs as well as the terms of conversion thereof between the U.S. dollar and the local currency.\n\n152.\n\nThe second component of the Emergency Tariff Measures is contained in Article 9 of the National Emergency Law, which authorizes the national executive power to renegotiate all contracts included under Article 8 pursuant to five prescribed criteria, including *inter alia* the profitability of the company.\n\n153.\n\nAs mentioned *supra*, the Government of Mendoza adopted a slightly revised version of Article 9 as Provincial Emergency Law, Article 2, which adds a sixth criterion, taking into account when renegotiating Public Services Contracts the following factors: (1) the impact of rates on economic competitiveness and income distribution; (2) service quality and investment plans, where these are contemplated in the relevant contracts; (3) user interest and service accessibility; (4) the security of the systems covered; (5) corporate profitability; and (6) the tariff revision methodology established in the relevant Concession Agreements.\n\n154.\n\nThe third and last prong of the Emergency Tariff Measures, Article 10 of the National Emergency Law, which as mentioned *supra* was fully adhered to by the Province, prohibits public utility concessionaires, including EDEMSA, from derogating contractual obligations during the Renegotiation Process. This provision of the Emergency Tariff Measures proclaims that under no circumstances are contracting companies or providers of public services authorized to suspend or alter the performance of their obligations.\n\n155.\n\nIn Spanish, National Emergency law Article 10 provides:\n\nLas disposiciones previstas en los art\u00edculos 8\u00b0 y 9\u00b0 de la presente ley, en ning\u00fan caso autorizar\u00e1n a las empresas contratistas o prestadoras de servicios p\u00fablicos, a suspender o alterar el cumplimiento de sus obligaciones.\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\nUnder no circumstances will the provisions of articles 8 and 9 herein authorize utility companies to suspend or change the performance of their obligations.\n\n156.\n\nFor ease of reference, the Tribunal will on occasion make reference to \"Emergency Measures\" to include analogous legislative dispositions of both the federal and the provincial governments.\n\n**2. Renegotiation Process and Ordinary as well as Extraordinary Reviews**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nIn conformity with Article 2 of the Provincial Electricity Law, on 26 April 2002 the Government of Mendoza created the Renegotiation Commission of the Public Utilities Agreements (\"Renegotiation Commission\"), which, acting under the aegis of EPRE and the Ministry of the Environment and Public Works (\"ME&PW\"), was commissioned to handle the renegotiation of the EDEMSA Concession Agreement (\"Renegotiation Process\"). See Provincial Decree No. 487/2002 of 26 April 2002.\n\n158.\n\nIn July 2002, EDEMSA defaulted on its financial debt.\n\n159.\n\nOn 24 July 2002, Claimants EDFI and SAURI, along with Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, parent company to Claimant Le\u00f3n, filed an initial notice of amicable consultations under the Article 8(1) of the Argentina-France BIT, which provides:\n\nTout diff\u00e9rend relatif aux investissements, au sens du pr\u00e9sent Accord, entre l\u2018une des Parties contractantes et un investisseur de l\u2018autre Partie contractante est, autant que possible, r\u00e9gl\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2018amiable entre les deux Parties concern\u00e9es.\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\nAny dispute concerning investments in the terms of this Agreement between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party shall whenever possible be settled by amicable consultations between the two parties to the dispute.\n\n160.\n\nOn 1 August 2002, EDEMSA filed an application for Extraordinary Review pursuant to Article 48 of the Provincial Electricity Law, which was followed by similar applications by other companies involved in the electricity sector. Through Resolution No. 400 of 20 September 2002, EPRE rejected all of these applications on grounds of failure to present a \"specific petition in clear and accurate terms\" in accordance with Section 129(c) of Law No. 3909 of the Mendoza Administrative Procedure.\n\n161.\n\nPursuant to Article 5 of Provincial Decree No. 487/2002, which marked the beginning of the Renegotiation Process, the Renegotiation Commission was initially required by law to produce new concession terms within a time frame of 180 days that ran from July 2002 until December 2002. The renegotiation, however, was unsuccessful. Consequently, on 17 January 2003, the Government of Mendoza extended the deadline for an additional 180 days up to July 2003 through Provincial Decree No. 89/2003.\n\n162.\n\nPrior to the passage of Provincial Decree No. 89/2003, however, on 13 December 2002 EPRE held a public hearing wherein twenty-six entities, including EDEMSA, non-profit organizations, unions, service companies, and users participated (\"2002 Public Hearing\"). Thereafter, EPRE, on the advice of Consultancy Jorge Lape\u00f1a y Asociados S.A., prepared a report proposing an acknowledgement of US$ 39.6 million to EDEMSA (\"JL&A Report\").\n\n163.\n\nAccording to the JL&A Report, EPRE concluded that as of 13 December 2002 EDEMSA covered its operating costs with the average tariff. However, that tariff did not cover payment of principal or interest on most of its debt.\n\n164.\n\nDespite the extension, the renegotiation process proved unsuccessful once again, and thus prompted the Mendoza Executive\u2018s issuance of Provincial Decree No. 1539/2003 which made effective a second extension that was to expire on 10 December 2003.\n\n165.\n\nUpon failure to reach an agreement on renegotiation terms by December 2003, Provincial Law No. 7,187 was passed on 24 February 2004 to extend the deadline yet again to lapse at the end of 2004.\n\n166.\n\nFinally, upon the failure yet again to agree on renegotiation terms by the end of the third extension, the Government of Mendoza enacted Provincial Law No. 7,324 which extended the deadline to 30 June 2005. This was the fourth and last extension to the renegotiation deadline before Claimants notified EPRE in July 2004 of their intention to divest from EDEMSA.\n\n167.\n\nOn 17 January 2003, approximately one year after the enactment of the Emergency Laws, the Government of Mendoza passed Provincial Law No. 7,091, pursuant to which government funds were allocated to the PTC Fund for distribution among the various electricity distributors operating within the Province of Mendoza. Article 59 of Provincial Law No. 7,091 expressly establishes that \"Cooperatives\" (smaller electricity distributors all of which were owned by local investors at the times relevant to the present dispute) are to be given preference over EDEMSA with respect to the allocation of payouts.\n\n168.\n\nOn 13 March 2003, the governor of Mendoza issued Provincial Decree No. 323/2003, which sought to institute a 3.4% increase to the DAV reflected in EDEMSA\u2018s tariff schedule to apply until the completion of the Renegotiation Process. Without acknowledging any specific right of EDEMSA, EPRE explicitly approved the governor\u2018s proposal by issuing Resolution No. 467/2002. The increase in DAV, however, was ultimately rejected by the Mendoza Senate and thus, never entered into force.\n\n169.\n\nOn 20 March 2003, EDEMSA and EPRE entered into a Memorandum of Agreement No. 1 (\"Memorandum No. 1\"), which formally postponed the requirement level as prescribed in the Concession Agreement\u2018s Sub-Phase 2 of Control Phase I, which EDEMSA took on to achieve by December 2001. Memorandum No. 1 also left it up to the concessionaire\u2018s discretion to notify the moment when its operational and management systems would be ready to begin supplying services in accordance with the stricter quality standards imposed in Control Phase II.\n\n**3. Commencement of ICSID Arbitration**\n----------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nAs detailed *supra* in the Procedural History part of this Award, on 16 June 2003 Claimants EDFI and SAURI filed a request for arbitration against Respondent. The Request of 16 June was subsequently amended on 4 August 2003 to join Le\u00f3n as an additional claimant, and on 12 August 2003 the Acting Secretary-General registered the Amended Request as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23 under the formal heading, *EDF* *International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic*.\n\n**4. Claimants' Divestment and Increases in Tariff Rates**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nOn 12 March 2004, Claimants EDFI agreed to purchase from Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais the interest in EDEMSA held by Le\u00f3n, thereby transferring Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais\u2018s indirect ownership in EDEMSA to EDFI. In the following month on 7 April 2004, EDFI purchased all of SAURI\u2018s interest in SODEMSA. These two transactions conferred upon EDFI complete ownership of SODEMSA, which held 51% of EDEMSA Class \"A\" shares, by adding a 55% interest in SODEMSA to EDFI\u2018s pre-existing 45% ownership.\n\n172.\n\nIn July 2004, Claimant EDFI informed EPRE of an agreement reached between EDFI and a local Mendoza-based investment firm, IADESA, to sell EDFI\u2018s shares in SODEMSA to the latter. On 10 February 2005, the Argentine press reported on the Province of Mendoza\u2018s intention to institute a 12% increase in EDEMSA\u2018s tariffs.\n\n173.\n\nOn 10 March 2005, EPRE submitted to the Renegotiation Commission its proposal to grant a tariff increase based on a study on the Concession Agreement conducted by EPRE\u2018s independent expert, Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Nacional - Regional Tucum\u00e1n (\"UTN Report\").\n\n174.\n\nLater that month, on 30 March 2005, EDFI effectuated the sale of its SODEMSA shares to IADESA for US$ 2 million, including all direct and indirect interests in EDEMSA which EDFI had acquired from SAURI and Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais. This marked the end of the Renegotiation Process.\n\n175.\n\nOn the basis of the March 2005 sale, Claimants affirm they no longer have any direct or indirect ownership in EDEMSA or related companies but nevertheless have retained all rights to claims related to their prior ownership in EDEMSA, thus making them entitled to any damages this Tribunal concludes to have been suffered by EDEMSA during the time when Claimants\u2018 were owners thereof. Respondent does not controvert this proposition.\n\n176.\n\nOn 7 April 2005, a week after Claimants\u2018 sale of their investment to IADESA, the Province of Mendoza executed a Letter of Understanding (the \"Letter of Understanding\") with the now locally-owned EDEMSA providing for a DAV increase of 38.05%, thus acknowledging the need to increase the electricity tariffs. Respondent\u2018s Exhibit 169. Claimants\u2018 Exhibit 37.\n\n**III. PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. APPLICABLE LAW**\n---------------------\n\n177.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[t]he Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.\" In this connection, Article 8(4) of the Argentina-France BIT prescribes:\n\nEl \u00f3rgano arbitral decidir\u00e1 en base a las disposiciones del presente Acuerdo, al derecho de la Parte Contratante que sea parte en la controversia \"incluidas las normas relativas a conflictos de leyes\" y a los t\u00e9rminos de eventuales acuerdos particulares concluidos con relaci\u00f3n a la inversi\u00f3n como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n a los principios del Derecho Internacional en la materia.\n\nIn the French version, Article 8(4) provides:\n\nL\u2018organe d\u2018arbitrage statuera, sur la base des dispositions du pr\u00e9sent Accord, du droit de la Partie contractante partie au diff\u00e9rend\"y compris les r\u00e8gles relatives aux conflits de loi\", des termes des accords particuliers \u00e9ventuels qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 conclus au sujet de l\u2018investissement ainsi que des principes de droit international en la mati\u00e8re.\n\nIn the English version, Article 8(4) provides:\n\nThe arbitration organization shall rule based on the provisions of this Agreement, on the laws of the Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute\"including rules relating to conflicts of laws\"and on the terms of any special agreements made in connection with the investment, and on the principles of International Law on the subject.\n\n178.\n\nSimilarly, Article 12(7) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT provides:\n\nEl \u00f3rgano arbitral decidir\u00e1 en base al derecho de la Parte Contratante que sea parte en la controversia\"incluidas las normas relativas a conflictos de leyes\", en base a las disposiciones del presente Convenio y a los t\u00e9rminos de eventuales acuerdos especiales concluidos con relaci\u00f3n a la inversi\u00f3n, como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n seg\u00fan los principios del derecho internacional en la materia.\n\nIn French, the provision reads:\n\nL\u2018organe d\u2018arbitrage statuera sur la base du droit de la Partie contractante partie au diff\u00e9rend, y compris les r\u00e8gles relatives aux conflits de lois, des dispositions du pr\u00e9sent Accord, des termes des accords particuliers \u00e9ventuels qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 conclus au sujet de l\u2018investissement ainsi que des principes de droit international en la mati\u00e8re.\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\nThe arbitration tribunal shall make a determination based on the laws of the Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute\"including its conflict of law provisions\"based on the provisions of this Agreement and the terms of any special agreements regarding the relevant investment, as well as in accordance with the applicable international law principles.\n\n179.\n\nThe Parties are for the most part in accord that this case can and should be decided solely on the basis of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n180.\n\nOne exception to this acceptance of the Argentina-France BIT lies in connection with Respondent\u2018s affirmative defense asserted exclusively against Claimant Le\u00f3n, namely that Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT applies to expressly exempt Argentina from any liability which might result from \"... measures necessary to maintain public order[\u2026]\" See Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Brief on Merits of 14 December 2009 at paragraphs 112-19; Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Brief on Merits at paragraphs 280-83.\n\n181.\n\nBoth Article 8(4) of the Argentina-France BIT as well as Article 12(7) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT constitute choice-of-law clauses pursuant to which the substantive legal tenets to be applied to disputes arising under the respective treaties are sourced in the investment instruments themselves, the national law of the Argentine Republic, any special investment agreement, and principles of international law on the matter. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 314-5; Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 233-6; Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder of 27 July 2009 at paragraphs 190-3.\n\n182.\n\nClaimants contend that it is common ground that any lacunae in the Treaty must be resolved by resorting to international law in a manner which does not preclude Argentina\u2018s observance of international *jus cogens* norms. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 247; Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 242-7. And that for Claimants to prevail in this arbitration, nothing short of a breach of those rights granted under the Treaty must be established. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 237-9. The Parties furthermore agree that other international arbitral awards are not binding on this Tribunal in the sense of *stare decisis*, but that such decisions are illustrative and relevant to the Tribunal\u2018s analysis. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 133; Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 270.\n\n183.\n\nThat being said, the Parties sharply diverge on (i) the relevance of Argentine law and judgments in defining the nature and scope of Claimants\u2018 treaty-based rights as well as in ascertaining the standards against which to measure the legal effects of Respondent\u2018s purported violation of said rights; (ii) the preemptive nature of international human rights laws which might have prohibited the observance of the Treaty; (iii) the existence of a special investment agreement; and (iv) the need to prove discrimination as a general prerequisite in establishing breaches of the Treaty.\n\n**1. Relevance of Argentine Law and Judgments**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nClaimants press for a hierarchical approach, contending it is the Argentina-France BIT and customary international law which principally define the nature and scope of their treaty-based rights as well as set forth the standards against which any conduct in violation of those rights will be assessed. Consistent with this reckoning, Argentine law is relevant only as factual matters in the context of purely domestic aspects of the dispute. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 247-48, 253.\n\n185.\n\nClaimants\u2018 legal expert on Argentine administrative and constitutional laws, Dr. Alberto Bianchi, supports the soundness of Claimants\u2018 position, opining that the Argentine Constitution ranks treaties as superior to and overriding inconsistent local laws. See Bianchi Expert Report at paragraph 70; see also Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 249. Moreover, Claimants maintain that, in the context of investment protections, the Treaty must be deemed to be *lex specialis* that trumps the *lex generalis* embodied in domestic law. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 316.\n\n186.\n\nOn the other hand, Respondent asserts that Claimants\u2018 approach incorrectly marginalizes the relevance of Argentine law because the Treaty, national law and international law should not be applied in a mutually exclusive manner. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 198. In Respondent\u2018s view, foreign investors are entitled to exercise rights in accordance with circumstances existing in the host state, and in that respect, Argentine law is essential in determining the nature and scope of Claimants\u2018 treaty-based rights as well as in deciding whether a breach of such rights has occurred. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraph 240. Respondent argues it is futile to discuss hierarchy under the Argentine Constitution, affirming that as concerns this proceeding not only is there an absence of any national law provision which might conflict with international obligations, but also there is no contradiction among the four categories of applicable tenets. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 197, 202.\n\n187.\n\nRespondent insists the purpose of the Treaty is to provide international protection of certain property and shareholder rights Claimants acquired under the Concession Agreement, which in turn is urged to be governed by national law provisions that cannot be analyzed in isolation from the rest of Argentina\u2018s legal regime, in particular those domestic principles and rules germane to economic crises. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 240-1; Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 195-6, 200-1.\n\n188.\n\nRespondent stresses that the Supreme Court of Argentina has ratified the validity of national emergency regulations almost one hundred years ago, as well as through subsequent recurrent pronouncements, thereby suggesting Claimants were well aware of (and therefore cannot be exempted from) the contours of Argentina\u2018s sovereign capacity during times of economic crises. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 202.\n\n189.\n\nIn response, Claimants state that, for purposes of this proceeding, it is ultimately irrelevant whether the Argentine Supreme Court vests Respondent with robust authority during national economic crises or whether measures adopted under crises situations are consistent with such authority because all of Argentina\u2018s actions must be measured against a single international standard, that of the Treaty. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 253. Notwithstanding, Claimants\u2018 legal expert, Dr. Bianchi, opines that the Emergency Tariff Measures are, in any event, unconstitutional. See Bianchi Expert Report at paragraph 217.\n\n190.\n\nRelying *inter alia* on Article 3 of the 2001 International Law Commission\u2018s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"ILC Articles\") as well as Article 27 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"Vienna Convention\"), Claimants posit it is well-settled that a state cannot immunize itself from international responsibility by arguing that its actions complied with national law, and thus, the legality of acts of states under national law is not in any way determinative of lawfulness under international law. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 316; Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 250-2.\n\n**2. Preemption by International Human Rights Laws**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nAlthough Claimants do not contest that Argentina\u2018s observance of the Treaty should not preclude observance of international *jus cogens* norms, Claimants argue Respondent is unable to demonstrate that any such norm is at issue in this case or, even if present, that it compelled the pesification and freeze of tariffs; the facts of this case neither show that compliance with the Treaty was rendered impossible, nor that the Treaty was rendered void, by virtue of a *jus cogens* norm. In Claimants\u2018 view, it is preposterous to suggest that any *jus cogens* norm required Argentina to repudiate Claimants\u2018 rights under the Concession Agreement or to rework the Regulatory Framework, or that Argentine citizens hold a supervening right to consume electricity at certain reduced prices. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 266-67.\n\n192.\n\nRespondent disagrees, asserting it was necessary to enact the Emergency Tariff Measures in order to guarantee the free enjoyment of certain basic human rights \"such as, *inter alia*, the right to life, health, personal integrity, education, the rights of children and political rights\" which were \"directly threatened by the socio-economic institutional collapse suffered by the Argentine Republic, where tens of people lost their lives, the right to health, to personal integrity, to work and safety.\" Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 206, 208. Respondent\u2018s position is that obligations under investment treaties do not undermine obligations under human rights treaties, and thus, the Treaty should be construed and interpreted consistently with international canons aimed at fostering respect for human rights.\n\n193.\n\nRespondent argues Claimants\u2018 rights under investment treaties should not be deemed absolute to the detriment of the Argentine population\u2018s entitlement to universal human rights enshrined in international instruments such as the 1948 U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 1966 U.N. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 1989 U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the 1969 American Convention on Human Rights. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 205, 209. Respondent posits these latter multilateral pacts proscribe the abrogation or suspension in any situation of those rights contained thereunder; hence, the non-derogable nature of such rights is said to be conclusive evidence that they are tantamount to *jus cogens*. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraph 246; Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 209-10.\n\n194.\n\nRespondent\u2018s legal expert on international law, Dr. Monica Pinto, agrees, opining that \"[t]he Government\"whichever it were pursuant to the [American Convention]\"was not supposed to suspend the exercise of human rights but to ensure of their satisfaction at reasonable levels.\" Pinto Expert Report at paragraph 69. As such, Respondent maintains that measures enacted to safeguard the free enjoyment of human rights should never result in international responsibility. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 212.\n\n195.\n\nAccording to Claimants, an international *jus cogens* norm is one that is \"accepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.\" See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 263-4, quoting Vienna Convention, Article 53. Claimants contend that very few norms are recognized internationally as *jus cogens* \"two illustrations being treaties on genocide or the legalization of slave trading\"and that obligations do not elevate to *jus cogens* status just because the instruments Respondent cites, such as the American Convention on Human Rights, considers such duties to be non-derogable; for example, Claimants call into question the peremptory nature of Articles 17(5) and 18 of the American Convention, which respectively require children born in and out of wedlock to be treated equally and individuals to be allowed to adopt the surnames of one\u2018s parents. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 264-5.\n\n**3. Existence of Special Investment Agreements**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nRespondent advances that no special investment agreements exist. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraph 236; Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 193. As developed in the context of their claims discussed *infra*, however, Claimants argue otherwise. For example, in the context of indirect expropriation, Claimants contend that \"for purposes of the BIT, the Concession Agreement is a concrete and legally binding specific commitment to the Claimants with respect to their investment.\" Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 369.\n\n**4. Discriminatory Intent as a General Prerequisite**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nAccording to Respondent, a showing that the measures were discriminatory is a requirement for Claimants to establish treaty breaches. See Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial, at paragraph 553-54. In support of its view, Respondent cites to paragraph 146 of the Tribunal\u2018s Decision on Jurisdiction dated 5 August 2008. In this regard, Respondent asserts that for the Tribunal to now establish a different approach would be a serious departure from a rule of procedure and thus would take the Parties by surprise. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Reply on the Merits, at paragraph 2.\n\n198.\n\nIn response, Claimants assert that such proposition has no basis in either the relevant treaty or the Tribunal\u2018s Decision on Jurisdiction as Respondent has taken the Tribunal\u2018s *dicta* out of content and has drawn spurious conclusions from it. Claimants Post-Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraphs 69-71. Alternatively, Claimants argue that they have in fact demonstrated the discriminatory nature of the measures adopted by the Argentine authorities.\n\n**B. CLAIMS AND DEFENSES**\n--------------------------\n\n199.\n\nClaimants\u2018 position is that from the very outset of their investment in EDEMSA in 1998, the Province, by way of the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession, wrongfully chipped away at the Concession Agreement\u2018s legal framework until completely unraveling it with the enactment of the Emergency Tariff Measures in early 2002, at that time radically transforming the \"rules of the game\" for Claimants and consequently crippling EDEMSA\u2018s financial stability. See, e.g., Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 410. All the while the pesification and freeze of tariffs together with the repeal of the convertibility system destroyed EDEMSA\u2018s enterprise value the Emergency Tariff Measures explicitly obligated full compliance of the Concession Agreement throughout the duration of the Renegotiation Process, which Claimants argue was engaged in good faith on their part but turned out to be nothing more than a mere formality. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 271, 410. As a result, the agreed upon economic and financial equilibrium contemplated under the Concession Agreement was never restored. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 271.\n\n200.\n\nAlthough conceding to the severity of the Argentine Economic Turmoil, Claimants posit that the Renegotiation Process was highly politicized and unwarrantedly so, marked by a lack of any real intent by the Province to reach a solution and resulting in no genuine progress during the three and a half so years that lapsed between its inception and the point Claimants finally decided to mitigate ongoing losses by selling their EDEMSA Class \"A\" shares. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 206-11, 433. Claimants note that Article 2 of the Provincial Law mandated new concession terms to be drawn up within a six-month deadline, but that this time limit was subsequently extended on four occasions without affording any palliative recourse during the meantime for a period of thirty eight months. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 270-1.\n\n201.\n\nIn Claimants\u2018 view, the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession, the Emergency Tariff Measures, and the Renegotiation Process caused a level of injury to Claimants\u2018 investment in EDEMSA sufficient to support findings of breaches of Articles 3 (\"Fair and Equitable Treatment\"), 4 (\"national treatment\"), 5(1) (\"full protection and security\") and 5(2) (\"indirect expropriation\") of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n202.\n\nMoreover, Claimants plead that Respondent\u2018s actions constitute violations of any standards of substantive protections afforded in investment treaties Argentina has entered into with third-party states that might be considered to be more favorable than those found in the Argentina-France BIT but subject nonetheless to incorporation therein by virtue of the most-favored-nation clause found in Treaty Article 4 (\"MFN Clause\"). See, e.g., Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 386. As such, Claimants contend Respondent also bears international responsibility for failing to respect specific commitments undertaken in connection with Claimants\u2018 investment as well as to abstain from resorting to discriminatory, arbitrary, unreasonable or unjustified measures. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 441-8, 452.\n\n203.\n\nClaimants assess their damages to be US$ 7.2 million excluding interest on account of the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession, and at least US$ 123.9 million excluding interest on account of the Emergency Tariff Measures and the ensuing failure of the Renegotiation Process. See Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Brief on Quantum of 11 March 2011 at paragraph 53; Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Brief on Quantum at paragraphs 45-7.\n\n204.\n\nOn the other hand, Respondent\u2018s position is that Claimants incorrectly construe the applicable legal standards; in particular, Respondent asserts the principle of *ejusdem generis* proscribes the MFN Clause from incorporating substantive protections of a kind not explicitly contained in the Treaty itself, such as the treaty-obligation to respect specific commitments undertaken in connection with investments of protected foreign investors. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 612-3.\n\n205.\n\nThere is no dispute that the Emergency Tariff Measures abrogated certain material aspects of the Concession Agreement, including those provisions that incorporate by reference substantive terms set forth in the Regulatory Framework. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 214, 269; Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 66-7. Notwithstanding, Respondent posits that, even if Claimants\u2018 construction of the law were to be correct, the facts do not support finding in favor of their claims because Claimants misunderstand the terms of the Concession Agreement and it is Claimants\u2018 own negligence and ill-performance that negatively affected the value of their investment in EDEMSA. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 206-208, 221. Rather, the Emergency Tariff Measures were legitimate means to conform to the Regulatory Framework\u2018s controlling principle of fair and reasonable tariffs as well as to safeguard the indigent class and to prevent hyperinflation. What is more, they actually helped EDEMSA weather the Argentine Economic Turmoil. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 402-8.\n\n206.\n\nAs regards the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession, Respondent maintains these were justified exercises of EPRE\u2018s authority in its capacity as regulatory agency. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraph 727. Concerning the fallout of the Renegotiation Process, Respondent argues that Claimants encountered nothing but good faith on the part of the Province and EPRE as opposed to Claimants themselves who demanded irreconcilable terms, and that Claimants knew as early as 2005 that a DAV increase would be implemented. As such, Claimants\u2018 decision to divest from EDEMSA was not prompted by any purported failure of the Renegotiation Process but instead for reasons wholly unrelated to issues of liability under the Treaty. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 213-28. In Respondent\u2018s view, the Renegotiation Process terminated successfully, and thus, all claims presented in this proceeding should be dismissed in their entirety. See Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Brief on Merits at paragraph 170.\n\n**1. Respect for Specific Commitments**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**a) Treaty Framework**\n-----------------------\n\n207.\n\nArticle 4 of the Argentina-France BIT, namely the so-called MFN Clause, provides in pertinent part:\n\nCada Parte Contratante aplicar\u00e1, en su territorio y en su zona mar\u00edtima, a los inversores de la otra Parte, en aquello que concierne a sus inversiones y actividades ligadas a estas inversiones, un tratamiento no menos favorable que el acordado a sus propios inversores, o el tratamiento acordado a los inversores de la Naci\u00f3n m\u00e1s favorecida si este \u00faltimo fuese m\u00e1s ventajoso. Por la misma raz\u00f3n, los nacionales de una de las Partes Contratantes autorizados a trabajar en el territorio y en la zona mar\u00edtima de la otra Parte Contratante deber\u00e1n poder gozar de las facilidades apropiadas para el ejercicio de sus actividades profesionales.\n\nEse tratamiento no se extender\u00e1 a los privilegios que una Parte Contratante acuerde a los inversores de un tercer Estado, en virtud de su participaci\u00f3n o de su asociaci\u00f3n a una zona de libre comercio, una uni\u00f3n aduanera, un mercado com\u00fan o cualquier otra forma de organizaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica regional.\n\nAsimismo, este tratamiento no se extender\u00e1 a los privilegios que una Parte Contratante acuerde a los inversores de un tercer Estado, en virtud de un convenio para evitar la doble imposici\u00f3n o cualquier otro convenio en materia fiscal.\n\nIn the French version, the MFN Clause provides:\n\nChaque Partie contractante applique, sur son territoire et dans sa zone maritime, aux investisseurs de l\u2018autre Partie, en ce qui concerne leurs investissements et activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 ces investissements, un traitement non moins favorable que celui accord\u00e9 \u00e0 ses investisseurs, ou le traitement accord\u00e9 aux investisseurs de la nation la plus favoris\u00e9e, si celui-ci est plus avantageux. A ce titre, les ressortissants de l\u2018une des Parties contractantes autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler sur le territoire et dans la zone maritime de l\u2018autre Partie contractante doivent pouvoir b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des facilit\u00e9s appropri\u00e9es pour l\u2018exercice de leurs activit\u00e9s professionnelles.\n\nCe traitement ne s\u2018\u00e9tend pas aux privil\u00e8ges qu\u2018une Partie contractante accorde aux investisseurs d\u2018un Etat tiers, en vertu de sa participation ou de son association \u00e0 une zone de libre \u00e9change, une union douani\u00e8re, un march\u00e9 commun ou toute autre forme d\u2018organisation \u00e9conomique r\u00e9gionale.\n\nDe m\u00eame, ce traitement ne s\u2018\u00e9tend pas aux privil\u00e8ges qu\u2018une Partie contractante accorde aux investisseurs d\u2018un Etat tiers, en vertu d\u2018une convention tendant \u00e0 \u00e9viter la double imposition fiscale ou de toute autre convention en mati\u00e8re fiscale.\n\nIn English, the MFN clause reads:\n\nWithin its territory and in its maritime zone, each Contracting Party shall provide to the investors of the other Party, with respect to their investments and activities associated with such investments, a treatment no less favorable than that accorded to its own investors or the treatment accorded to investors of the most favored Nation if the latter is more advantageous. For the same reason, the nationals of either of the Contracting Parties authorized to work in the territory and in the maritime zone of the other Contracting Party shall be able to enjoy suitable terms for the conduct of their professional activities.\n\nSuch treatment shall not extend to the privileges that a Contracting Party grants to investors of a third State by virtue of its participation or its association with a free trade zone, a customs union, a common market, or any other form of regional economic organization.\n\nFurthermore, such treatment shall not extend to the privileges that a Contracting Party grants to investors of a third State by virtue of an agreement to prevent double taxation or any other agreement covering fiscal matters.\"\n\n208.\n\nClaimants\u2018 position is that by virtue of the MFN Clause they are entitled to any substantive protections which might be considered to be more favorable than those contained in the Argentina-France BIT but are found in third-party investment treaties; one such protection being what shall be referred to herein as the \"umbrella clause(s),\" that is, the express treaty obligation of a host state to respect specific commitments undertaken in connection with investors of the counter-party contracting state. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 452.\n\n209.\n\nArticle 10(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, which Claimant Le\u00f3n is noted to be able to invoke directly without having to rely on the MFN Clause, furnishes an \"umbrella clause\":\n\nCada una de las Partes Contratantes respetar\u00e1 en todo momento los compromisos contra\u00eddos con los inversores de la otra Parte Contratante.\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\n\"Each of the Contracting Parties shall respect at all times the commitments it has undertaken with respect to investors of the other Party.\"\n\n210.\n\nLikewise, the investment treaty concluded on 9 April 1991 between Argentina and Germany in Article 7(2) provides:\n\nCada Parte Contratante cumplir\u00e1 cualquier otro compromiso que haya contra\u00eddo con relaci\u00f3n a las inversiones de nacionales o sociedades de la otra Parte Contratante en su territorio.13\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall comply with any other commitment undertaken in connection with the investments made by nationals or companies from the other Contracting Party in the former\u2018s territory.\"\n\nSee Claimants\u2018 Memorial of 2 May 2005, at paragraph 452. In this connection, Respondent argues that the Argentina-Greece BIT was, as of the date Respondent filed its Rejoinder on 27 July 2009, not yet effective. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraph 540.\n\n211.\n\nClaimants moreover invoke Article 2(3) of the Agreement between the Government of the Hellenic Republic and the Government of the Republic of Argentina on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments concluded on 26 October 1999, which provides that \"Each Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n212.\n\nAccording to Claimants\u2018 legal expert on international law, Dr. Rudolf Dolzer, as concerns to this case specific commitments undertaken in connection with Claimants\u2018 investment in EDEMSA are \"contained in the national and provincial regulatory framework, and in the Concession Agreement.\" Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 189. In paragraph 467 of their Reply, Claimants posit that, among those specific commitments the Province bargained to undertake as well as those implemented by law, particular emphasis should be given to Respondent\u2018s purported failure to respect: (i) the principles of the Regulatory Framework, including those governing the right to calculate and recalculate tariffs as well as those proscribing the unwarranted and unilateral modification of the Concession\u2018s legal framework; (ii) Claimants\u2018 right to fair and reasonable tariffs which produce reasonable rates of return for EDEMSA; (iii) Claimants\u2018 right to calculate tariffs in U.S. dollar terms as prescribed in the Currency Clause; (iv) Claimants\u2018 right to adjust tariffs for inflation based on U.S. producer and consumer price indexes as prescribed in the Cost-Adjustment Clause; and (v) Claimants\u2018 right to Ordinary Reviews every five years and Extraordinary Reviews in objective and justified circumstances.\n\n213.\n\nOn the issue of applicability, Respondent sets forth a three-tier defense, asserting that (i) the principle of *ejusdem generis* effectively bars Claimants from invoking any \"umbrella clauses,\" (ii) even if the scope of the MFN Clause is found to be able to incorporate \"umbrella clauses,\" there are no specific commitments Claimants can base their claim on because the Concession Agreement was signed with EDEMSA, and thus, Claimants lack contractual privity, and (iii) even in the event the Tribunal were to find in favor of Claimants on counts (i) and (ii), applying \"umbrella clauses\" to enforce provisions set forth in the Concession Agreement would mean having to enforce the forum selection clause contained therein, which grants exclusive jurisdiction to the administrative courts of the City of Mendoza. See Respondent Rejoinder at paragraphs 541-2, 558-64; Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraph 109.\n\n214.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the MFN Clause is of a generic type subject to the principle of *ejusdem generis*, which in effect prohibits the incorporation of a new standard of protection into the Argentina-France BIT. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraph 613. Quoting Article 9(1) of the U.N. Draft Articles on the Most Favored Nation Clause, titled \"Scope of Rights under a Most-Favored-Nation Clause,\" Respondent presses that under the MFN Clause, Claimants acquire \"only those rights that fall within the scope of the purpose of the clause.\" Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 541.\n\n215.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent suggests that the language of Treaty Article 8(1), namely the jurisdiction clause and which is formulated in terms of \"[t]out diff\u00e9rend relatif aux investissements, au sens du pr\u00e9sent Accord,... [,]\"14 should be construed to place claims based on treatment standards not expressly contemplated under the Argentina-France BIT as falling outside the authority of the Tribunal. In this respect, Respondent highlights that consent is a cornerstone of the arbitral process. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 545-46.\n\nRespondent\u2018s English translation: \"Any dispute relating to investments, in the sense of the present Agreement,....\"\n\n216.\n\nAs such, Respondent asserts that the MFN Clause is unable to incorporate \"umbrella clauses\" because the question of whether there has been a breach of such standards does not arise \"in the sense of [the Argentina-France BIT].\" See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 544. In Respondent\u2018s view, \"umbrella clauses\" constitute exceptions to the fundamental principle of customary international law that a breach of a domestic law does not give rise to international responsibility, and exceptions by their very nature must be considered to be specifically negotiated. Respondent posits that the majority of investment treaties entered into by either France or Argentina does not provide \"umbrella clauses.\" See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 550-55. What is more, any other interpretation would contradict the principle of *effet utile* \"in other words, there would be no purpose of signing treaties not containing an \"umbrella clause\" if treaties concluded either prior or subsequent thereto in fact do. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 556.\n\n217.\n\nIn response, Claimants contend that foreign investors have relied on most-favored-nation clauses to obtain more favorable substantive protections contained in investment treaties between the host state and third-party states since otherwise investors protected under third-party investment treaties would in fact receive more favorable treatment from the host state, which in Claimants\u2018 view is exactly what the MFN Clause proscribes. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 459. Claimants\u2018 legal expert, Dr. Dolzer, agrees, opining that \"umbrella clauses\" should be found to fall within the scope of the MFN Clause because or else, \"certain foreign investors would receive treaty protection with respect to specific commitments made to them in circumstances in which French investors would not, which would contradict the MFN guarantee provided by the France BIT.\" Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 183.\n\n218.\n\nAs concerns Respondent\u2018s second line of defense, Claimants\u2018 position is that contractual privity is not a prerequisite for invoking \"umbrella clauses\" because for starters, a literal interpretation of the standard supports the inference that obligations under the Concession Agreement and the Regulatory Framework constitute specific commitments undertaken in connection with Claimants\u2018 investments, and hence, are provisions that shareholders such as Claimants are entitled to enforce under the Treaty even if contractual privity is lacking and as a consequence thereof redress under Argentine law would have been precluded. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 461.\n\n219.\n\nDr. Dolzer for his part opines that the \"umbrella clauses\" in question are broadly worded and do not refer to contractual privity, requiring only \"that the subject matter of the commitment concern the investment of a foreign investor.\" Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 187. Claimants add that (i) provisions under concession agreements and local regulations become obligations subject to \"umbrella clause\" protection by virtue of being targeted at foreign investors and applying specifically to their investments, (ii) payment obligations are contemplated as well, and (iii) the inquiry is whether a contractual breach affects a right protected under the Treaty. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 463-5.\n\n220.\n\nIn Claimants\u2018 view, the relationship between contracts and international investment law is well established: absent an \"umbrella clause,\" if a host state acts as an ordinary commercial or contractual counterparty in breach of contractual obligations, then the state is answerable for its conduct only to its contractual counter-party according to the dispute resolution mechanism provided in the contract and consequently, generally not internationally liable. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 317.\n\n221.\n\nAccording to Claimants, it is clear that a repudiation of contractual rights by a state through a governmental act, as opposed to a commercial breach, gives rise to breaches of investment treaty-based rights. Claimants posit that the sovereign acts at issue in this case are not mere ordinary contractual breaches of a commercial nature, but rather the outcome of major legal and regulatory changes induced by the state\"it is incontrovertible that only the Governments of Argentina and the Province of Mendoza possess the power to freeze tariff rates, reform monetary policy, and to regulate the distribution of electricity. As such, the key issue is whether the relevant acts were taken in a sovereign or regulatory capacity, or merely as a commercial counterpart. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 318, 319-21.\n\n222.\n\nOn the other hand, Respondent asserts that specific commitments contemplated by \"umbrella clauses\" (i) are consensual obligations arising independently of investment treaties, (ii) are specific obligations concerning the investment, (iii) do not cover general requirements imposed by the law of the host State, (iv) are not entered into *erga omnes* but with regard to particular persons and whose performance occurs with regard to, and as between, obligor and obligee, (v) are obligations that do not transform into something else, as their content \u2018is unaffected, as is its proper law and the parties are bound thereto, and (vi) are bilateral or intrinsically linked to obligations of the investment company, but nevertheless are not confused with such obligations, as a shareholder will not be bound by them. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 561. In sum, based on the foregoing factors, Claimants may not allege that the Province undertook specific commitments with respect to them as they are not parties to the instruments invoked. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 564.\n\n223.\n\nNotwithstanding, even if an \"umbrella clause\" were to apply to the present dispute, Respondent argues that the rights provided under the Concession Agreement or their legal consequences would remain unaffected, in particular the forum selection clause contained in Article 40 therein. As such, when the essence of a claim falls under the scope of a contractually-agreed forum selection clause, such stipulation should be respected. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 565-68, 569.\n\n224.\n\nIn Respondent\u2018s view, the maxim *generalia specialibus non derogant* dictates that a document containing a dispute settlement clause which is more specific in relation to the parties and to the dispute should be given precedence over a document of more general application, namely investment treaties, which are not concluded with any specific investment or contract in view but rather as a framework treaty intended to support and supplement, not to override and replace, the actually negotiated investment arrangements made between the foreign investor and the host state. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 570. Respondent notes that neither the Argentina-France BIT nor the ICSID Convention sets forth any provision which could prevail over forum selection clauses, and thus, if the Tribunal were to find \"umbrella clauses\" as applicable to the claims presented herein, the forum selection clause found in Article 40 of the Concession Agreement must be respected. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 570-4.\n\n225.\n\nClaimants contend that it is widely accepted that even where the facts of a dispute arise in connection with a contract, a foreign investor is still entitled to pursue treaty-based claims notwithstanding any contractual forum selection clause that might govern mere breach of contract claim. Claimants insist that local law might be relevant at most in assessing whether there has been a breach of the treaty since the breach of a commitment under national norms is an appropriate factor for consideration in determining whether the same act of state amounts to a treaty violation. Consequently, any overlap which might exist as regards the facts supporting a breach of contract claim and a corollary breach of treaty claim does not prevent a tribunal from considering the prevalence of the latter. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 393-94.\n\n226.\n\nClaimants reiterate that where an act of state reflects the exercise of quintessentially public or sovereign powers, then a treaty claim can be pursued completely independent of issues concerning contract breach. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 398. In this respect, Claimants note that Respondent admits the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession were exercises of the Province\u2018s sovereign capacity and that there can be no doubt the Emergency Measures and the overseeing of the Renegotiation Process were so as well. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 402-3; Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraph 702. Accordingly, it is not a matter of being disappointed in the performance of the host state in the execution of a contract, but rather whether an investor, whose contract rights are destroyed through the exercise of governmental prerogatives, is entitled to circumvent the operation of contractual forum selection clauses and head straight to claiming violations of investment treaties before an international arbitral tribunal. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 399-401.\n\n**b) Pre-Emergency Measures Affecting the Concession**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Claimants have initially listed seven (7) Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession whereas Respondent\u2018s defenses break them down into ten (10) categories. As discussed hereinafter the Tribunal finds substantial overlap which permits such measures to be considered most accurately under six (6) rubrics.\n\n228.\n\nClaimants assert that, from the very beginning of EDEMSA\u2018s concession, the Respondent altered the Regulatory Framework and Concession Agreement, negatively impacting EDEMSA\u2018s operations and finances. Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 189. According to Claimants, Respondent\u2018s conducts caused a change to the financial equilibrium of the Concession Agreement in a way detrimental to EDEMSA. Moreover, all these measures discussed *infra* adversely affected the company\u2018s technical performance and made it increasingly difficult to meet the quality standards.\n\n229.\n\nIn Respondent\u2018s view, Claimants\u2018 Pre-Emergency claims affecting the Concession pertain to measures under the regulatory authority of EPRE or the Government of Mendoza. Respondent asserts that the nature of the claims based on Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession is strictly contractual and that Claimants have already brought said claims before local courts. Respondent\u2018s position is that the claims are subject to *res judicata* and pertain to matters foreign to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 777.\n\n230.\n\nRespondent argues that contractual renegotiation agreement was executed by EDEMSA and the Government of Mendoza, in which the parties agreed on a procedure to honor the outstanding payments due to EDEMSA as at 31 February 2005, including the NIHUIL IV non-payments. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 778. According to Respondent, such agreement had been memorialized in the Letter of Understanding dated 7 April 2005. In this connection, Respondent argues that the Tribunal\u2018s finding in favor of Claimants with respect to these claims based on Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession would result in double recovery.The Parties\u2018 dispute with respect to the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession can be categorized as follows.\n\n**(1) Modification of the Tariff Regime under the Concession Agreement**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n231.\n\nClaimants assert that EPRE unilaterally altered the tariff regime under the Concession Agreement by modifying its fee structure and the contracting period applicable to large users as well as by wholly creating a new tariff category. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 190.\n\n232.\n\nAccording to Claimants, it is uncontested that the Tariff Schedule under the Concession Agreement permitted EDEMSA to recuperate the additional costs incurred as a result from having to supply greater levels of power for large electricity users. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 149; see Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 729-37. As such, the scheme was set forth in Anexo 1, Subanexo 1, Chapter 2, Subsection 3 of the Tariff Schedule in the Concession Agreement, establishing a fee for \"Use of the Network\" (\"Network-Use Fee\") as part of the tariffs applicable to large users. The Network-Use Fee was to be calculated based on the power capacity that had been installed and made available to each large user. Every twelve months, each large user would notify EDEMSA of the power capacity that it will require in the next twelvemonth period. The power capacity requested by and made available to each user determined the amount of the fee each user will pay for use of the network during the relevant twelve-month period. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 729, 37.\n\n233.\n\nClaimants assert that it is uncontested that Resolution No. 8/98 established a fee structure different from that mentioned above in that the new fee calculation would be based on the last non-null power recorded by each user immediately prior to the beginning of the concession on 1 August 1998. Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 151-52; Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 736-37.\n\n234.\n\nThe Parties, however, disagree whether EPRE\u2018s resolutions in relation to this tariff regime constitute unilateral modifications or instead legitimate exercise of authority by EPRE. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraphs 190-94; see Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial of 9 February 2009, at paragraph 727.\n\n235.\n\nMoreover, Claimants assert that Resolution No. 8/98 in effect allowed users to only pay for the yearly minimum of their electricity use rather than the maximum as originally contemplated in the Concession Agreement. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 151. According to Claimants, the last non-null power usage immediately prior to the beginning of the concession would have been recorded in July, which was during the winter season in the southern hemisphere. Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 191. Claimants\u2018 witness, Mr. Gonella, attests that electricity consumption falls to its lowest level during the winter, and that EPRE regulations permitted large users to contract for their minimum use, regardless of the power capacity actually installed and made available to such users. See Supplementary Witness Statement of H\u00e9ctor Gonella, at paragraph 13.\n\n236.\n\nIn Respondent\u2018s view, such modification was consistent with the requirements of the Concession Agreement in order to ensure that the tariffs were just, proportional, and equitable. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 782. Respondent\u2018s witness, Mr. Sergio Rodr\u00edguez, opines that such modifications were sought in response to consumer complaints and applied in general to all power distributors in the province and not just to EDEMSA. See Witness Statement of Sergio Rodr\u00edguez, at paragraphs 33-42. Respondent further argues that this new tariff system was only applicable to new large users, as opposed to those pre-existing at the date of the Concession Agreement\u2018s execution. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 732. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez further opines that, given the existence of over 4,000 large users, the parties could not have expected the individual agreements with users to be completed by the time of service take over.15\n\nRebuttal Witness Statement of Sergio Rodr\u00edguez, at paragraph 11\n\n237.\n\nClaimants\u2018 witness, Mr. Gonella, seeks to undermine Respondent\u2018s argument by stating that EMSE in fact had at its disposition the exact figures of maximum energy consumption of each large user from the twelve months prior to the beginning of the concession.16 See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 193. Mr. Gonella further opines that, in light of these figures, EDEMSA could have easily projected each consumer\u2018s energy use for the following year.\n\nSupplementary Witness Statement of H\u00e9ctor Gonella, at paragraph 12.\n\n238.\n\nThe second alleged modification imposed by EPRE concerns the reduction of the twelvemonth contracting period with large users. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 153. According to Claimants, Resolution EPRE No. 73/99 further modified the tariff regime by reducing the twelve-month contracting period to three months. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 195. Claimants assert that at no time during the negotiating process prior to signing the Concession Agreement were periods of less than twelve months ever contemplated for calculating the Network-Use Fee. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 197.\n\n239.\n\nClaimants argue that it is uncontested that in practice, Resolution 73/99 would allow large users with seasonable production cycles to pay EDEMSA for power capacity only during the months when each user actually makes use of the maximum power capacity, while paying lesser amounts during the remainder of the year when, due to lower levels of activity, separate contracts are entered for a lesser power capacity. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 154; see Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 744. Moreover, Claimants contend that it is undisputed that EPRE did in fact modify the duration of the contracts to be entered into with large users. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 195; see Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 744\n\n240.\n\nThe third modification asserted by Claimants regards the events leading to EPRE\u2018s imposition of a new category, referred to as the \"Optional T-2\" Tariff. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 168.\n\n241.\n\nAs detailed above, the Tariff Schedule under the Concession Agreement provided for a temporary tariff, applicable to all users who at the beginning of EDEMSA\u2018s concession either (i) did not have the power measuring equipment appropriate for their classification level within the Tariff Schedule established by the Concession Agreement, or (ii) had yet to be classified under one of the categories provided in the Tariff Schedule. In such cases, the transitory tariff was to apply until the user was classified under a tariff category. The Concession Agreement required EDEMSA to complete the meter installation and user classification by specific deadlines, which, depending on the user\u2018s level of service demand, was either 6 or 12 months. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 168.\n\n242.\n\nAccording to Claimants\u2018 witness, Mr. Gonella, the Concession Agreement originally required that if the first reading with new digital readers exceeded 10kW, the user would be automatically categorized under the T-2 large user category, thereby being subject to the Network-Use Fee. See Supplementary Witness Statement of Hector Gonella, at paragraph 23.\n\n243.\n\nIn August 1999, EPRE issued Resolution No. 125/99, which was later supplemented by Resolution No. 131/99. In Claimants\u2018 view, these resolutions effectively prevented EDEMSA from properly classifying the temporary tariff users. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 167.\n\n244.\n\nRespondent admits that Resolution No. 125/99 permitted users whose consumption fell between 10 and 50 kW to continue with the original T-1 tariff category. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraph 799. Claimants thus assert that EPRE wrongfully permitted modification of the tariff regime by permitting consumers to opt for the T-1 tariff category (applicable to small consumers) if successive readings showed power uses of less than 10kW; in effect, some large users could avoid the T-2 tariff classification so long as later monthly readings fell below the threshold level. Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 199.\n\n245.\n\nClaimants argue that it is uncontested that Resolution No. 131/99 suspended payment obligations of those users which had already been reclassified or were about to be reclassified as T-2 large users, and mandated refund of any and all monies that may have been billed in excess due to their reclassification. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 199; see Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraph 801. In addition, Resolution No. 131/99 required EDEMSA to resend invoices to every user which had been reclassified under the T-2 tariff category. The revised invoices were to be based on the tariff class which was in force prior to their reclassification. Such recalculation was required from the date on which the reclassified tariffs were implemented. Claimants contend that it is undisputed that the transitory tariff was later extended for one year until 31 July 2000.\n\n246.\n\nIn defense, Respondent argues that Resolutions No. 125/99 and 131/99 were issued in the interest of the electricity consumers. According to Respondent, the former was enacted provided that the application of the Measurement Normalization Plan under Chapter 5, subsection 2 of the Tariff System was inadequate, resulting in only a series of measures aiming at safeguarding the information rights of users. Respondent further asserts that the latter resolution was established as a precautionary measure. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 800-1.\n\n247.\n\nIn addition, Claimants argue that despite expiration of the one-year extension, the Governor of Mendoza issued Executive Order No. 1632/00, which unilaterally incorporated the transitory tariff into the Concession Agreement as a new tariff category. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 168. This order was to be in force from 1 August 2000 to 31 July 2003.\n\n248.\n\nOn 13 September 2000, EDEMSA filed an administrative action before the Supreme Court of Mendoza challenging the constitutionality of Decree No. 1632/00. Parties disagree whether a decision has been rendered by the Supreme Court of Mendoza with respect to EDEMSA\u2018s challenge of 13 September 2000.\n\n249.\n\nClaimants contend that it is undisputed that Executive Order No. 1632/00 provided all users who had benefited from the transitory tariff the option to remain within such class, identified as the \"Optional T-2\" category, or to be reclassified into a new category based on their actual power consumption. Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 200; see Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraphs 802-6.\n\n250.\n\nThe Parties, however, disagree whether the \"Optional T-2\" Tariff was to include a fee for the use of the network. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraphs 168-69; see Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraphs 808-10.\n\n251.\n\nClaimants assert that this new tariff category in effect allowed certain commercial users the option to avoid paying the Network-Use Fee, which had been originally agreed to apply when a users maximum power demand exceed an average of 10kW per periods of fifteen consecutive minutes. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 165.\n\n252.\n\nMoreover, Claimants argue that Respondent\u2018s arguments as to equity and the need to protect certain groups of consumers are wholly irrelevant in the present case. Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 202. Rather, EPRE was simply not authorized by the Concession Agreement to implement such unilateral modifications. This resulted in substantial harm to EDEMSA, for which it was not compensated.\n\n253.\n\nIn response, Respondent argues that users classified under the Optional T-2 Tariff were not exempt from paying the Network-Use Fee and that this tariff category was not lower than the electricity actually being consumed. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 808. Respondent\u2018s witness, Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, opines that although the Optional T-2 and the regular T-2 tariffs were calculated by way of different methods, both compensated for all costs related to the provision of the service, that is, the DAV and the procurement cost. See Rebuttal Witness Statement of Sergio Rodr\u00edguez, at paragraphs 60-61. According to Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, the optional tariff set forth a variable charge, which resulted in increases in the amount billed as power usage increased.\n\n**(2) Expansion of the Scope of the Concession Area**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nClaimants assert that EPRE unilaterally expanded the scope of the Concession Agreement by incorporating therein the town of Polvaredas as well as the Scattered Market without adequate remuneration in exchange. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 158-63.\n\n255.\n\nClaimants suggest that it is common ground that these categories comprise of users located in remote regions that are not linked to the interconnected distribution network. Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraphs 160, 162; see Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 752-53, 757.\n\n256.\n\nClaimants contend that it is undisputed that the area of Polvaderas was not transferred to EDEMSA upon commencement of the concession as this region was self-serviced by a generation equipment. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 160; see Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 753. According to Claimants, it is uncontested that, after an incident resulting in damages to the generation equipment and thus halt of power services to the Polvaderas inhabitants, Resolution EPRE No.183/99 was issued, expressly incorporating the town of Polvaredas into EDEMSA\u2018s area of concession. In addition, Claimants argue that it is undisputed that, on 3 December, 1999, the Government of Mendoza issued Provincial Decree No. 2379/99, expressly incorporating into EDEMSA\u2018s area of concession the Scattered Market. Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 211; see Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 757.\n\n257.\n\nIn defense, Respondent argues that such isolated areas are deemed public service and thus serve as an integral part of EDEMSA\u2018s distribution services. See Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial at paragraphs 754, 759-60. In support, Respondent cites to Article 2 of the Concession Agreement, which obliged the concessionaire \"to satisfy in whole the demand for electricity service within the Area....\" Respondents Counter-Memorial at paragraph 759. In turn, the Definitions section of the Concession Agreement defined \"Area\" in a way so as to establish \"the scope within which CONCESSIONAIRE is obliged to render the PUBLIC SERVICE and cover the increase in the demand as provided for in this Agreement, including the areas defined in the regulation of [the Transformation Law] and Annex I of the Bidding Conditions.\" In this connection, Respondent cites to the definition of \"area of exclusivity\" under the Concession Agreement. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 760. Respondent\u2018s position is that both Polvaderas and the Scattered Market fall under the scope of \"public service\", as the terms of the Concession Agreement require EDEMSA to cover the increase in demand within the area of concession. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 759.\n\n258.\n\nMoreover, Respondent notes that the Mendoza Supreme Court recognized the need to compensate EDEMSA as the Polvaredas area was delivered to Claimants after their taking of possession. In this connection, Respondent concedes that EDEMSA was to be compensated through the PTC Fund, in order to balance the difference in distribution costs. Respondent further posits that Mendoza undertook the responsibility of providing Polvaredas with the fixed material needed for power supply, without EDEMSA having to invest money for such purpose. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 791-92.\n\n259.\n\nClaimants respond by asserting that the documents presented during the due diligence process, though making reference to the distribution system, fails to mention inclusion of isolated populations located in areas such as Polvaredas or the Scattered Market. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 206, 213.\n\n260.\n\nCiting to paragraph 755 of Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, Claimants assert that Respondent\u2018s own admission of the need to compensate EDEMSA for additional costs incurred in relation to services in the Polvaredas area further supports Claimants\u2018 view that the isolated regions were never considered as part of the Concession Agreement. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 207. Had such area been included prior to the concession, extra compensation would not have been required. Furthermore, Claimants assert that, had Polvaredas been included in the area of concession, there would have been no need for EPRE to issue Resolution No.183/99. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 208. Claimants further argue that despite recognizing the need for compensation, Respondent has never provided compensation or reimbursement in this connection. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 209.\n\n261.\n\nWith respect to the Scattered Market, Claimants further assert that EDEMSA was denied the right to charge certain local users located in small rural communities with their own electricity generation equipment and local low voltage distribution network (referred to as \"collective users\") as well as those connected to a secondary network consisting of a single wire used for transmission purposes (referred to as \"monofilar\"). Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 163. According to Claimants, Provincial Decree No. 2379/99 further burdened EDEMSA by requiring it to apply to the Scattered Market the same stringent quality of service that applied to users within the interconnected distribution network. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 163. Claimants\u2018 witness, Mr. Gonella, posits that this new contractual obligation resulted in an increase in cost to EDEMSA. See Supplementary Witness Statement of Hector Gonella, at paragraph 46.\n\n262.\n\nIn response, Respondent cites to Mr. Rodr\u00edguez, who opines that \"tariffs were expressly regulated in Schedule 1.2 of [Decree No. 2379/99], which established a regime of subsidies and compensations payable to the Concessionaire.\"17 See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 797.\n\nRebuttal Witness Statement of Sergio Rodr\u00edguez, at paragraph 44.\n\n**(3) Modification of Agricultural Subsidy Regime**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nClaimants assert that EPRE changed the original subsidies regime that had been established for the benefit of agricultural irrigation users. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 192-95.\n\n264.\n\nClaimants contend that it is undisputed that the Transformation Law set forth a mechanism for subsidizing the electricity consumption by certain agricultural users for irrigation purposes. Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 214; see Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at 822. The Transformation Law mandated the application of a special tariff schedule to all agricultural irrigation users existing at the time the Regulatory Framework was passed. Under this system, EDEMSA was to be compensated for the difference between the subsidized tariff, referred as the \"Reference Tariff\", and a benchmark tariff, known as the \"Tariff Payable to Distributor.\" Under Article 36 of the Transformation Law, all amounts due to EDEMSA were to be paid out from the PTC Fund.\n\n265.\n\nThis subsidy mechanism implemented by the Transformation Law was incorporated into EDEMSA\u2018s Concession Agreement. Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 214; see Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at 822. Accordingly, Chapter 2 of the Tariff Schedule in the Concession Agreement set forth the government\u2018s obligation to compensate EDEMSA for the difference that may exist between the amounts billed to the beneficiaries of the subsidy and those that would result from the application of the \"Tariff Payable to Distributor.\" See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 822.\n\n266.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether, under this subsidy framework, EDEMSA was required to deposit back into the PTC Fund any excess amount in instances where the \"Reference Tariff\" resulted in a higher amount than that from the \"Tariff Payable to Distributor.\" See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 216; see Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 828.\n\n267.\n\nAccording to Claimants, such regime was altered by EPRE preventing EDEMSA from collecting on excess amounts in instances where the \"Reference Tariff\" resulted in a higher amount than that from the \"Tariff Payable to Distributor.\" See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 194-95. In this connection, Claimants argue that nowhere in the Concession Agreement was there a requirement that EDEMSA reimburse the PTC Fund under the concerned scenario.\n\n268.\n\nClaimants assert that said subsidy only applied to those agricultural users whose consumption was during hours of lowest demand. Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 215. Consequently, Claimants were justified in charging the T-2 Tariff category for those users that failed to meet the aforementioned criterion for agricultural subsidy benefits. In this connection, Claimants argue that EDEMSA in fact did not charge a \"Reference Tariff\" higher than the \"Tariff Payable to Distributor,\" but rather simply applied the T-2 Tariff in those situations. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 217.\n\n269.\n\nIn defense, Respondent asserts that EDEMSA was not entitled to charge agricultural users a fee higher than the one under the Concession Agreement. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 821. Rather EDEMSA had agreed to collect the \"Tariff Payable to Distributor\" in relation to agricultural irrigation users, and thus that any excess resulting from the difference with the Reference Tariff should have been deposited back into the PTC Fund. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 823, 828. In support of such view, Respondent cites to Mr. Rodr\u00edguez\u2018s statement, opining that such procedure was implied in the subsidy framework. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 82627.18 Respondent\u2018s witness, Mr. Faura, posits that the subsidy was not restricted to those agricultural users that consume during low-demand hours. Rebuttal Witness Statement of Raul Faura, at paragraph 48. Rather, the agricultural subsidy framework contemplated both low and high hours of demand while merely encouraging consumption during the former by establishing different pricing structures.\n\nRebuttal Witness Statement of Raul Faura, at paragraph 44.\n\n270.\n\nIn support, Respondent cites to Article 36 of the Transformation Law, which, in pertinent part, state that \"[t]he collection of this compensation shall only be applied to electrical power users for agricultural irrigation to the date of enactment of this law, in accordance with the regulations, and such compensation shall be gradually allocated in relation to the higher efficiency in the use of surface and ground water for agricultural irrigation....\" See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at footnote 946. Respondent\u2018s witness, Mr. Faura posits that the agricultural subsidy framework simply encouraged consumption during low-demand hours by providing different prices for low- and high-demand hours. See Rebuttal Witness Statement of Raul Faura, at paragraph 48.\n\n**(4) Failure to Pay Amount Owed**\n----------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nClaimants contend that the Government of Mendoza refused to make payment owed to EDEMSA under two situations, both of which were explicitly contemplated in the Concession Agreement. Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 221.\n\n272.\n\nFirst, Claimants assert that EDEMSA was owed reimbursement for extra costs incurred in purchasing power from the Nihuil IV power plant. Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 222.\n\n273.\n\nAccording to Claimants, it is common ground that Article 37 of the Transformation Law mandated the assignment of EMSE\u2018s rights and obligations arising out of a contract entered into with a power generation company, Hidronihuil S.A. Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 172; see Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 777-83. The Nihuil IV Contract was for the construction, operation and maintenance of a hydroelectric power plant known as NIHUIL IV. The Nihuil IV Contract provided, *inter alia*, for a commitment by EMSE to purchase all of the Nihuil IV power plant\u2018s output at a price higher than that available in the Electricity Wholesale Market. Article 37 of the Transformation Law established that \"[t]he difference between the price that EDEMSA must pay pursuant to this contract and the purchase value of energy in the electricity wholesale market, shall be compensated to EDEMSA by the Province with funds allocated pursuant to Article 47.\"\n\n274.\n\nIn conformity with Article 37 of the Transformation law, Article 22.36 of the Concession Agreement memorialized said compensation scheme. In return for servicing a loan obtained by EMSE for purposes related to the construction of the NIHUIL IV, EDEMSA would receive monthly payments of the difference between the NIHUIL IV price and the going market price.\n\n275.\n\nClaimants assert that it is undisputed that, in February 2000, the Government of Mendoza stopped making payments to EDEMSA for the compensation provided under Article 37 of the Transformation Law and Article 22.36 of the Concession Agreement. Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 222; see Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 777-83.\n\n276.\n\nAccording to Claimants, EDEMSA made numerous requests for payment over the course of almost a year, but faced substantial delays and unusual administrative proceedings. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 176; see Claimants Reply at paragraph 223. Moreover, Claimants assert that they were unable to seek recourse in the Supreme Court of Mendoza, which found that it lacked jurisdiction by reason that all administrative proceedings had not been terminated. See Claimants Reply at paragraph 223.\n\n277.\n\nSecond, Claimants argue that EDEMSA was owed reimbursement and compensation for certain subsidized tariffs as well as for public lighting services. Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 224.\n\n278.\n\nClaimants contend that it is uncontested that the Tariff Schedule contained in the Concession Agreement provided for the application of subsidized tariffs for specific users (e.g., the elderly, those engaged in agricultural irrigation) and certain sectors (e.g., rural areas). See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 184; see Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraphs 818-19. The Tariff Schedule established that the difference in amount resulting from the subsidy was to be reimbursed to EDEMSA through the PTC Fund. In accordance with the Concession Agreement, Claimants submitted monthly statements before EPRE, itemizing the amounts due by the Government.\n\n279.\n\nClaimants contend that it is undisputed that since August 1999, the provincial government has failed to make payments owed, including compensation for the above-mentioned subsidy as well as for the provision of the public lighting services. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 186; see Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraphs 81819.\n\n**(5) Quasi-Currency**\n----------------------\n\n280.\n\nClaimants assert that EDEMSA was forced to accept payments from its customers with notes issued by the Province\u2018s treasury. Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 218. According to Claimants, these notes were issued in lieu of monetary currency, which further hindered EDEMSA\u2018s ability to satisfy its own monetary obligations.\n\n281.\n\nIn response, Respondent states that these notes could in fact be used to satisfy taxes and other obligations owed to the provincial government. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 835. Respondent contends that during times of economic crisis, the Governor of California also had issued similar bonds called IOUs. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 834. Respondent argues that the bonds were ultimately redeemed by the Province at 110.4904% of their nominal value. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 837.\n\n282.\n\nNotwithstanding, Claimants contend that such unilateral conduct by Respondent was unfair, as it was not only unforeseeable within the Concession Agreement but also contrary to the tariff principles set forth in the Regulatory Framework. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 219.\n\n283.\n\nAccording to Claimants, such unilateral conduct by Respondent caused EDEMSA to face cash flow problems. Claimants contend that EDEMSA was forced to purchase cash in exchange for these notes, for which EDEMSA was able to receive only 80% of the notes\u2018 face value, thereby resulting in a 20% loss. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 220.\n\n**(6) Imposition of Service Quality Conditions**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nClaimants assert that Provincial Law No. 6856 imposed obligations and conditions more onerous than those originally provided for in the Regulatory Framework. In particular, Claimants advance Sections 2 through 6 of Law No. 6856, which set forth procedures for the filing of claims against EDEMSA by users who allege damages due to failures in the electricity distribution system.\n\n285.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Section 2 eliminated the requirement to file an administrative claim in the first instance, thereby enabling users to resort directly to local courts. Section 5 directed courts to increase by fifty percent any damages award against EDEMSA in the event that EDEMSA challenges the merits of the claim or the existence of the alleged failure in the system. Section 6 established that the failure to comply with a damages award is tantamount to a \"severe breach.\"\n\n286.\n\nIn response, Respondent clarifies that Provincial Law No. 6856 in fact was applicable to every concessionaire and any type of public services\u2018 providers, whether on the national or provincial level. Respondent further argues that it was Claimants failure to mention that these allegations were submitted to the decision of the Supreme Court of Mendoza, which, on 10 August 2005, dismissed such action. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 801-802. Following the Mendoza Supreme Court\u2018s decision, Claimants have no grounds to affirm the unconstitutionality of the regulations, given the court found them consistent with the principles set forth in Articles 41, 42 and 43 of the Argentine Constitution. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 803.\n\n**c) Emergency Laws and Renegotiation Process**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nClaimants assert that Respondent has violated the specific commitments undertaken in connection with Claimants\u2018 investment by breaching the terms of the Concession Agreement. In support, Claimants cite to several ICSID decisions that have ruled in the investor\u2018s favor in this regard, including the *Sempra, Enron* and *CMS Gas* cases.\n\n288.\n\nAs discussed *supra*, Claimants contend that it is undisputed that the Emergency Measures abrogated the fixed-exchange regime provided under the Convertibility Law as well as invalidated key provisions in the Concession Agreement, in particular the Currency Clause and Cost-Adjustment Clauses. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 206-11; Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 63, 66-7. In this connection, Cliamants state that it is also common ground that EDEMSA, while under the control of Claimants in their capacity as shareholders, and pursuant to the price cap system, had the duty to make necessary investments for the maintenance and expansion of the service, and as such, EDEMSA could only enhance its profitability by lowering costs and increasing efficiency rather than through the increase of tariffs. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 117, 358; Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 167, 357.\n\n289.\n\nThe Parties disagree, however, as to who bears the currency risk, the applicability of tariff principles embodied in the Concession Agreement during the Argentine Economic Turmoil, the justifiability of the Emergency Tariff Measures, the real causation behind the destruction of EDEMSA\u2018s value as of December 2001, and who lacked good faith during the Renegotiation Process as well as the outcome thereof.\n\n290.\n\nClaimants contend that the Concession Agreement, which incorporates by reference the provisions of the Provincial Electricity Law, sets forth the terms and conditions of the concession granted to EDEMSA, including mechanisms to protect the concessionaire against currency risk, inflation, and political and regulatory risks. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 97.\n\n291.\n\nFirst, Claimants\u2018 position is that the Currency Clause, by establishing the calculation and recalculation of tariffs in U.S. dollar terms, allocates to the Province any risk associated with currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Argentine peso. According to Claimants, despite the seven-year reign of the fixed-exchange system under the Convertibility Law by the time the EDEMSA shares were being promoted, concern over the sustainability of that system as well as over the stability of the Argentine currency lurked among foreign investors, and thus, the assumption of currency risk by part of the Province was essential in comforting any such apprehensions. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 103-4.\n\n292.\n\nClaimants posit that other reasons underlie their position, including the fact that many investment costs were to require payments in U.S. dollars, such as the purchase of equipment only available outside of Argentina, and because assuming debt in U.S. dollars would allow long-term debt financing from the international capital markets at lower interest rates. As such, the Province would benefit from operational efficiencies resulting eventually in lower tariffs and improved service at every tariff review. To protect the investor from inflation risks, Claimants argue that the Cost-Adjustment Clause provided for a mechanism to maintain the real value of tariffs constant. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 105-108.\n\n293.\n\nSecond, Claimants posit that the Province was aware of the harmful effects that politically-motivated tariff policies have, and accordingly, made it explicit under the Provincial Electricity Law that guarantees of long-term political and regulatory stability was being implemented for the Concession Agreement. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 100, 109. Claimants emphasize that tariffs were to be determined on the basis of economic criteria and were to afford the concessionaire sufficient income to cover all costs associated with the distribution of electricity as well as to obtain a reasonable return on the any investments made in that connection. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 109-12. Claimants argue that the Concession Agreement contemplates tariff schedules of five-year terms subject to interim modification only on grounds of significant variations in the cost structure of the distributor caused by unforeseen events beyond the control of the Parties, and at the expiration of such term, subject to revision only in conformity with pre-determined procedures in order to augment the stability of the Regulatory Framework. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 114-20.\n\n294.\n\nAccording to Claimants\u2018 expert on quantum, LECG, \"[t]he use of individualized contracts, as opposed to simply using regulatory frameworks based on general legislation, grants investors an additional protection against governmental opportunistic behavior, as general regulatory frameworks can be changed by new legislation, while changing contracts require, in principle, the agreement of both parties to the contract.\" See LECG Expert Report at paragraph 46.\n\n295.\n\nIn Claimants\u2018 view, the foregoing panoply of protections made EDEMSA an attractive investment prospect, which as a matter of fact, was relied on heavily when Claimants decided to invest in the Province. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 121. Claimants argue that the Emergency Tariff Measures imposed drastic changes in the tariff regime so as to fundamentally alter the economic equation of the Concession Agreement, thereby severely affecting Claimants\u2018 investment. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 115, 214.\n\n296.\n\nClaimants argue that the Emergency Tariff Measures (i) caused a *de facto* freeze on the tariffs, thus depriving Claimants from their contract protection under the Cost-Adjustment Clause against inflation risks and the consequent loss of value of revenues over time, and (ii) pesified tariffs so as to require by law the conversion of dollar-denominated tariffs into peso-denominated tariffs at a ratio of 1 to 1 despite the exchange parity of the market of US$ 1 to ARS 3 following the abrogation of the Convertibility Law. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 214-5.\n\n297.\n\nClaimants illustrate that, whereas prior to the Emergency Laws, when consumer bills were calculated in U.S. dollars and then converted to pesos for purposes of billing, the calculated bill in U.S. dollar terms would equal the billing invoice denominated in peso terms because the Convertibility Law fixed an exchange rate of 1:1, the enactment of the Emergency Tariff Measures skewed this formula so as to force the same billing invoice amount in peso terms even though the fixed convertibility system had been scrapped and the peso had consequently floated and devalued three-fold. Consequently, Claimants state that the value to the concessionaire of the billing invoice charged to the consumer would be worth only a third of what it had been prior to 2002, thereby depriving Claimants of the fundamental protections provided under the Concession Agreement against currency risk. What is more, the Emergency Tariff Measures also required EDEMSA to abide by its contractual obligations, thus creating an asymmetry that further exacerbated injury to Claimants\u2018 investment during the thirty-eight months in which the Renegotiation Process took place. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 216-20.\n\n298.\n\nClaimants\u2018 position is that their investment incurred devastating damages by reason of the Emergency Tariff Measures that can be inferred from the sharp drop of 32% in the revenues of private entities, which in turn resulted in the reduction of cash flows to a level insufficient to cover operational costs, taxes and interest payments, in the depreciation of equity value, in the default of commercial debt, and in the reduction of investments for improving infrastructure. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 246. Claimants contend that the pesification and freeze of tariffs combined with the rapid devaluation of the peso caused EDEMSA\u2018s revenues to drop drastically, in U.S. dollar terms, to practically one-third of its value prior to 2002 all the while EDEMSA\u2018s costs experienced sharp increases due to inflation, thereby creating a severe imbalance between revenues and operational expenses. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 252. According to Claimants, the Emergency Tariff Measures are directly responsible for reducing EDEMSA\u2018s operating profits by 75% in 2002, instigating EDEMSA\u2018s default of debts financed in U.S. dollar terms, and diluting the value of equity. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 253-9.\n\n299.\n\nRespondent\u2018s position is that the mechanisms provided under the Concession Agreement operate according to the economic, monetary and social conditions existing at the time of contract, and that neither the Concession Agreement nor the Regulatory Framework supplied appropriate means to restore the balance between the rights of the concessionaire and those of the users during the Argentine Economic Turmoil. As such, Respondent asserts the tariff system contemplated under the Concession Agreement was inapplicable both from economic as well as legal angles, for enforcing them would have destroyed the principle of fair and reasonable tariffs and caused serious damages to the Province, EDEMSA, and the users. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraph 401-403. Respondent\u2018s regulatory expert, Mr. Alejandro Sruoga, agrees, opining that the Argentine Economic Turmoil altered the expectations incorporated in the Concession Agreement, thus suggesting a justification for abandoning the protection mechanisms thereunder. See Sruoga Expert Report at paragraphs 128-31.\n\n300.\n\nIn Respondent\u2018s view, the Currency Clause established a direct and indissoluble link between the Convertibility Law and the Concession Agreement, whereby only a change in the exchange rate parity under the Convertibility Law would be taken into account and not the total repeal of the Convertibility Law so as to implement a completely different monetary system. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 435-41. Respondent argues that Claimants are wrong in construing the Currency Clause so as to have the Province bear the currency risk since EDF acknowledges in a *Plan Directeur* dated 31 March 1998 that, upon the abandonment of convertability, the Currency Clause does not anticipate what would happen in a crisis scenario. See Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial, at paragraph 442. That document states in pertinent part:\n\nTant que la convertibilit\u00e9 US$/Peso est garantie par la loi, la formule d\u2018 indexation couvre correctement le risque de change. En revanche dans un sc\u00e9nario de crise du Peso, le d\u00e9cret 2118/1991 pourrait alors \u00eatre amend\u00e9. Dans ce cas, la formule ne pr\u00e9voit pas le risque du taux de change r\u00e9el du peso, ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se produit normalement apr\u00e8s un subite d\u00e9valuation.\n\n301.\n\nThe Parties, however, disagree on the correct English translation. Claimants\u2018 translation reads as follows:\n\nAs long as US$/Peso convertibility is guaranteed by law, the indexation formula adequately covers the exchange risk. However, in a scenario of crisis of the Peso, decree 2128/1991 could then be amended. In that case, the formula does not contemplate the risk of appreciation of the real exchange rate of the peso, a phenomenon that normally occurs after a sudden devaluation (\"tequila effect\").\n\n302.\n\nIn contrast, Respondent\u2018s version states as follows:\n\nAs long as the dollar/peso convertibility is guaranteed by law, the indexation formula adequately covers the exchange risk. Quite the opposite, in a scenario of the crisis of the peso, Decree No. 2128/1991 could thus be modified. Consequently, the formula does not foresee the risk of modification of the real exchange rate of the peso, which normally occurs after a sudden devaluation (*tequila* effect).\n\n303.\n\nMoreover, Respondent posits that the maintenance of the Currency Clause, the Cost-Adjustment Clause, and other tariff terms tailored into the Concession Agreement would have extinguished the principle of fair and reasonable tariffs, which Respondent insists is the single means for safeguarding the interests of supplier companies and service users. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 443. Respondent states that Claimants\u2018 regulatory expert, former Secretary of Energy for the Argentine Republic, Mr. Carlos Bastos, agrees with Respondent\u2018s position and recognizes that calculating tariffs at the average floating-exchange rate of 1 US$ for 1 ARS would have led to increases in billing invoices by three-fold, in turn resulting in service theft and payment delinquencies. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 444-6, citing Bastos Expert Report at paragraphs 196-7; see also Sruoga Expert Report at paragraphs 122-4. In the words of Respondent\u2018s legal expert, Professor Ismael Mata, in a scenario where the Convertibility Law was repealed, the tariff system under the Concession Agreement \"had become impractical and impossible for service users.\" Mata Expert Report at paragraph 220.\n\n304.\n\nRespondent asserts that, under Argentine law, every concession involving a public utility must search for and materialize, to the extent possible, an equilibrium between the advantages agreed upon the burdens imposed on the concessionaire, thereby guaranteeing by way of the principle of fair and reasonable tariffs, the guarantee of the original contractual equivalence and the defense of the economic interests of users. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 377-85. According to Respondent\u2018s understanding of Argentine law, although the Argentine Constitution recognizes that tariffs must allow account for costs of the service provided as well as the provider\u2018s profitability, the Constitution also *inter alia* withholds from concessionaires the right to obtain profits with no objective limit whatsoever and prohibits the modification of tariff guidelines for mere allegations of a certain deterioration of business profitability. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 386-7.\n\n305.\n\nAs such, the Emergency Laws were legitimate and reasonable means to maintain tariffs at fair and reasonable rates that allowed, in time, for the gradual economic and social recovery which would benefit all constituents. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 448. In this respect, Respondent notes that the Convertibility Law was not abandoned to increase sovereign wealth or to restructure productivity forces, and that the Argentine Supreme Court has declared the Emergency Laws as constitutional. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 410, 420.\n\n306.\n\nRespondent asserts that the value of EDEMSA was already worthless by the time the Emergency Tariff Measures were adopted due to Claimants\u2018 overbidding of the purchase price caused by defective due diligence and faulty macro-economic forecasts, to Claimants\u2018 poor performance of EDEMSA\u2018s operations and to their dangerous policies on debt financing and capital reduction. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 150-204. According to Respondent, the Emergency Tariff Measures actually helped EDEMSA\u2018s economic and financial position amidst the Argentine Economic Turmoil, and allowed for Argentina\u2018s economic indicators to change towards a positive trend by as early as the second quarter of 2002. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 127-30. Respondent notes, however, that many issues remaining pending, such as the reduction of poverty, improvement of production, and the reduction of social conflicts.\n\n307.\n\nIn response, Claimants contend that it is absurd to propose that the Emergency Tariff Measures benefitted EDEMSA. In Claimants\u2018 view, the Emergency Tariff Measures were over-inclusive and disproportional to their stated purposes of *inter alia* alleviating the financial burden of the indigent class. Equally invalid is Respondent\u2018s assertion that the Currency and Cost-Adjustment Clauses were never intended to apply in the event the Convertibility Law was abandoned. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraphs 105-8. Claimants\u2018 witness, Mr. Didier Lam\u00e8the, at the time the legal adviser of the EDEMSA Project Team, attests that, had the Province not borne the currency risk, not a single foreign investor \"would have dared to invest in Argentina, given the country\u2018s history of economic and monetary volatility.\" Lam\u00e8the Supplemental Witness Statement at paragraph 15. In Claimants\u2018 view, the Tribunal should resort to the Info Memo as well as the privatization efforts undertaken by the national government of Argentina in the early 1990\u2018s in order to confirm the proper interpretation of the Concession Agreement. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraphs 107-10, 305.\n\n308.\n\nClaimants state that, had the Currency Clause been conditioned on the prevalence of the Convertibility Law, the Concession Clause could have clearly said so, and that it would have been futile to resort to calculation and recalculation in U.S. dollar terms since, under the fixed parity of the Convertibility Law, a peso-denominated tariff would have accomplished exactly the same result. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 134-5. Claimants posit that the primary purpose and effect of the Currency and Cost-Adjustment Clauses are to protect the actual value of the tariffs from the likelihood of devaluation or depreciation of the local currency, and that any other interpretation would be contrary to common sense and deprive such clauses of all meaning. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 137.\n\n309.\n\nAccording to Claimants\u2018 expert on Argentine law, Dr. Alberto B. Bianchi, Claimants\u2018 interpretation of the Concession Agreement is correct because:\n\nThere is no reason preventing the continued validity of the right granted to the concessionaire once the Convertibility Law was extinguished[,]... this right would acquire economic meaning if the peso was rated below the dollar, for example, 2 AR$ = 1 US$. Similarly, and from the hermeneutics point of view, it is more reasonable to maintain that the contract has no lacunae, and therefore the repeal of the Convertibility Law shall not produce the loss of the clause, but its substitution with another, in this case the substitution of the parity fixed by the Convertibility Law with another parity or different exchange rate. See Bianchi Supplemental Expert Report at paragraph 30.\n\n310.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants argue that Respondent distorts Mr. Bastos\u2018s statement for what Mr. Bastos meant to convey in paragraphs 196-7 of his expert report was that the Regulatory Framework was designed to withstand situations precisely like that of the Argentine Economic Turmoil, thereby dispensing with any need to freeze and pesify tariffs. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 111-2. Rather, in Claimants\u2018 view the Currency Clause naturally refers to the Convertibility Law because the exchange rate at the time of contract was established by that Law, and pursuant to the principle of pl\u00e9nitude du droit,19 the only rational interpretation of the Currency Clause would mean that, in the event the Convertibility Law is repealed, the conversion from dollars to pesos to be done for purposes of billing would have to resort to a new official exchange rate if existent or at the then-current market rate. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraphs 114-5.\n\nOr plenitud herm\u00e9tica del ordenamiento jur\u00eddico in Spanish or \"completeness of the law\" in English.\n\n311.\n\nClaimants add that, had the Province\u2018s understanding of the Currency Clause been that such would inherently lose effectiveness upon the repeal of the Convertibility Law, it would have been unnecessary for the Emergency Tariff Measures to separately repeal the Currency and Cost-Adjustment Clauses. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 116. What is more, Respondent overlooks the phrase of the Currency Clause that reads, \"at the time of its application to the billing of users,\" a phrase Claimants consider to be critical given that it demonstrates the Currency Clause contemplated U.S. dollar calculation of tariffs under a floating exchange regime as well. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 121.\n\n312.\n\nAs concerns the *Plan Directeur*, Claimants request that the Tribunal apply Claimants\u2018 translation for reason that Respondent\u2018s version contains critical mistakes that radically alter the sense of the relevant paragraph. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at footnote 63. According to Claimants, Respondent\u2018s use of the word \"modification\" in lieu of \"appreciation\" is incorrect and deceptive because it can be interpreted as a downward shift in the real exchange rate when the key point here is that EDF was concerned only about an upward shift. With respect to the other two alleged errors, Claimants assert that they predispose the reader as to the content of the phrase following them, thereby coloring the reader\u2018s perception of such content.\n\n313.\n\nMoreover, Claimants press that the paragraph in question refers to \"real exchange rates,\" and that this concept is distinct from nominal exchange rates which form the basis of the Currency Clause\u2018s protection against currency risk. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraphs 122-5. Claimants explain that a sharp devaluation followed by sharp inflation (i.e., \"tequila effect\") exposes the concessionaire to risks resulting from real exchange rates because although the purchasing power of foreign currencies would initially be enhanced due to the devaluation of the local currency, it would eventually diminish on account of inflation of costs. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 126. As such, Claimants argue that the *Plan Directeur* expressed concern for losses resulting from real exchange rates, conversely identifying no risk at all resulting from a change in the nominal exchange rates alone. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 127.\n\n314.\n\nClaimants maintain that, as a matter of law, their conduct does not immunize Respondent from international responsibility under the Argentina-France BIT. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraphs 329-34. And that, in any event, Claimants\u2018 due diligence was sound, performance of EDEMSA matched expectations, and policies on debt financing and capital reductions were all justified and conformed to industry standards. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraphs 85-91, 139-88. Rather, EDEMSA\u2018s higher-than-anticipated levels of debt are a principal result of Respondent\u2018s actions in violation of the Concession Agreement. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraphs 145-7. Moreover, Claimants\u2018 position is that they did not overbid the purchase price, as can be evinced by the second-place bid which was merely 14.5% less than Claimants\u2018. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 104. According to Claimants, the official initial valuation performed by Chase Manhattan Bank and Salomon Smith Barney only serves to express a minimum value, and hence, the fair market value is the price agreed on by a willing seller and a willing buyer, namely Claimants\u2018 winning bid for US$ 237.7 million. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraphs 94100.\n\n315.\n\nAlso noteworthy is Claimants\u2018 contention that, under the Regulatory Framework, the tariff rates necessarily had to enable the concessionaire to cover the cost of capital, or debt. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraphs 154-6. Claimants\u2018 regulatory expert, Mr. Bastos, fully supports this proposition, opining that the use of the term \"specific distribution costs\" in Article 43(c) of the Provincial Electricity Law is a term of art \"widely acknowledged in the electricity sector and in a number of nations around the world\" as clearly including as one of its components the cost of capital. Bastos Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 23.\n\n316.\n\nWith respect to the Renegotiation Process, Claimants contend that despite their own good faith participation, the Province for its part violated the spirit and letter of its own law when it failed to renegotiate the Concession Agreement and also failed to provide interim tariff adjustments to help EDEMSA survive. Claimants note that the Province proceeded to extend the deadline for completing the Process seemingly *ad infinitum*, such that even as of 30 April 2009 the relevant Concession Agreements have yet to be renegotiated. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 227-28.\n\n317.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the reasons underlying their divestment from EDEMSA are irrelevant to the determination of whether Respondent has violated the Argentina-France BIT, but that to clarify, Claimants proceeded to divest mainly to mitigate losses and to become unburdened of toxic investments such as EDEMSA, which had attained such status due to the Emergency Tariff Measures. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraphs 23242. In light of such objective, Claimants decided to consolidate under EDFI\u2018s ownership a controlling interest in SODEMSA, which would make it easier to sell the SODEMSA shares as well as to obtain an added premium to the sales price. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 243.\n\n318.\n\nOn the other hand, Respondent asserts that Claimants\u2018 reliance on the Info Memo and the regulatory framework applying at the national level have no bearing in this arbitration because the former contains a disclaimer that strips the document of any legal effect and the latter can be distinguished from its provincial corollary. See Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial, at paragraphs 366-76.\n\n319.\n\nIn Respondent\u2018s view, it was the Province that participated during the Renegotiation Process in good faith and Claimants who lacked it, as corroborated by their proposal for an 87.1% DAV increase amidst the worst economic crisis experienced by Argentina. See Respondent\u2018 s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 457, 468. The Province relaxed stringent quality requirements through Memorandum No. 1 and even agreed to a 3.4% DAV increase that was shot down by the Mendoza Congress. See Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial, at paragraphs 461-7.\n\n320.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants were well aware that a DAV increase would be forthcoming at the conclusion of the UTN Report, which had been completed shortly prior to Claimants\u2018 sale of their EDEMSA shares to the Mendoza-based company, IADESA. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 472-6. Consequently, the Letter of Understanding signed on 7 April 2005 between the Province and IADESA stipulated a DAV increase, and Respondent suggests that the precise timing of when Claimants became aware of this directive is unimportant since Claimants could have withdrawn their decision to leave EDEMSA when such information had become available. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 476. Respondent argues Claimants divested from EDEMSA not because of the Emergency Laws, but because of reasons wholly unrelated to this proceeding. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 478.\n\n**2. Discrimination, National Treatment and Arbitrary Measures**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Treaty Framework**\n-----------------------\n\n321.\n\nArticle 4 of the Argentina-France BIT, the so-called National Treatment Clause, provides in pertinent part:\n\nCada Parte Contratante aplicar\u00e1, en su territorio y en su zona mar\u00edtima, a los inversores de la otra Parte, en aquello que concierne a sus inversiones y actividades ligadas a estas inversiones, un tratamiento no menos favorable que el acordado a sus propios inversores....\n\nIn its French version, the National Treatment Clause provides:\n\nChaque Partie contractante applique, sur son territoire et dans sa zone maritime, aux investisseurs de l\u2018autre Partie, en ce qui concerne leurs investissements et activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 ces investissements, un traitement non moins favorable que celui accord\u00e9 \u00e0 ses investisseurs....\n\nIn English the provision reads:\n\nWithin its territory and in its maritime zone, each Contracting Party shall provide to the investors of the other Party, with respect to their investments and activities associated with such investments, a treatment no less favorable than that accorded to its own investors....\"\n\n322.\n\nIn addition, Claimants invoke the MFN clause to direct the Tribunal to Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT which states:\n\nWithout prejudice to measures necessary to maintain public order, investments shall enjoy permanent protection and security, to the exclusion of any unjustified or discriminatory measure that could impede in fact or in law its management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or liquidation.\n\n323.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the MFN clause Claimants invoke the bilateral investment treaties Argentina has entered into respectively with Israel, Mexico, and The Netherlands. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 445-7.\n\n324.\n\nArticle 2(2) of the Argentina-Israel BIT provides:\n\nNo Contracting Party may hinder, in any manner, through unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the right of the investors from the other Contracting Party to manage, maintain, use, profit from or dispose of their investments in its territory.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the Argentina-Mexico BIT states:\n\nEach Contracting Party... shall not impair [the investors\u2018] management, operation, use, enjoyment or disposal through arbitrary or discriminatory measures.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the Argentina-Netherlands BIT reads:\n\nEach Contracting Party.. shall not hinder [the investors\u2018] operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal by means of unjustified or discriminatory actions.\n\n**b) Parties' Contentions**\n---------------------------\n\n325.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent is prohibited from enacting measures which are unreasonable, unjustified, arbitrary, and or are discriminatory so as to impede in fact or in law the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or liquidation of their protected foreign investment. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 444.\n\n326.\n\nRespondent avers that they have engaged in no discriminatory treatment against Claimants, and that Claimants\u2018 arguments do not fit within the international law concept of discrimination or arbitrariness, and do not constitute measures contrary to the national treatment guarantee. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 559-60.\n\n327.\n\nIn addition, Respondent argues the Argentina-France BIT does not contain a provision on discrimination. A previous case, *ELSI*, set out criterion for a finding of discriminatory treatment, which include intentional treatment, action in favor of a national against a foreign investor, and action that is not taken in similar circumstances against a national.20 See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder on the Merits at paragraph 462.If Claimants wish to allege a more comprehensive rule on discrimination than the concept than in the *ELSI* case they have to prove that such a rule has evolved in international law, which they have not done. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder on the Merits at paragraph 474.\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States) v. Italy*, 1989 I.C.J. 15, \u00b6 122 (20 July) (LA AR 22).\n\n328.\n\nClaimants\u2018 contest that due to the MFN clause in Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT, French investors subject to the treaty protection are entitled to receive treatment from Argentina that is at least equal to that which it confers on its own nationals or is no worse than that accorded to third-party nationals, such as Luxembourg, Israel, Mexico, or the Netherlands. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 443-8.\n\n329.\n\nIn this connection, Claimants seek to incorporate those protections accorded in *inter alia* the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, which states that, \"[I]nvestments shall enjoy permanent protection and security, to the exclusion of any unjustified or discriminatory measure that could impede in fact or in law its management maintenance, use, enjoyment or liquidation.\"\n\n330.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants\u2018 situation is unique and not comparable to the businesses of other sectors with which they are comparing themselves because of Claimants\u2018 position in the market and the nature of the services they supply. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 584-6. Respondent specifically contends that discrimination can only be alleged in cases of different treatment of two people in equal circumstances, in this case the same business and economic sector. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 566-7.\n\n331.\n\nClaimants assert that, in the present case, Respondent adopted measures that altered the tariff scheme, suspended the legal framework within which EDEMSA was operating and abrogated EDEMSA\u2018s contractual rights under the Concession Agreement. Claimants also argue that such measures in effect were discriminatory in that they created a *de facto* cross subsidy by EDEMSA for all of its consumers, especially those in the industrial and exporting sectors, which, while not particularly affected by the Argentine crisis, financially benefited from the devaluation; what is more, such consumers were allowed to increase the price of their own products or services to keep pace with the ensuing inflation. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 449.\n\n332.\n\nIn defense, Respondent asserts that the measures they adopted are not discriminatory because the National Emergency Law was effective for inhabitants and investors of the Argentine Republic while the renegotiation of all public utilities agreements was determined. In fact, the impact upon Claimants\u2018 investments was no greater than the impact on the rest of the distribution companies and the rest of the economy, and EDEMSA\u2018s value actually increased after the measures were adopted. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 579, 597. In addition, Respondent argues that Claimants fail to identify how this alleged cross subsidy was granted, to whom, for how much, and when, and fail to show how such an assertion would breach the BIT. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 588.\n\n333.\n\nClaimants contend that no defensible or legitimate justification can be adduced by Respondent for the Emergency Measures that targeted the public utilities. Instead such measures were adopted for no apparent purpose other than to discriminate by shifting the political blame and economic burden of the crisis onto a discrete and individualized sector that is almost entirely owned or controlled by foreign investors. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 449.\n\n334.\n\nRespondent argues that there cannot be discrimination because foreign investors were not injured by measures, which were designed to combat the worst crisis suffered in Respondent\u2018s history, to the benefit of local investors. In addition, Respondent claims that all distribution companies, both national and foreign, were affected by the crisis and renegotiation process with no distinction made an account of nationality, and that public utility tariffs have always been afforded legal treatment different from other nonregulated prices of the economy. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 577, 581-2, 587, 593.\n\n335.\n\nClaimants aver that in light of the fact that the Emergency Measures were unnecessary to begin with and also that such measures had no objectives other than being discriminatory, Claimants have suffered from arbitrary, unjustified, unreasonable and discriminatory treatment, thereby warranting compensation under the BIT. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 451.\n\n336.\n\nRespondent contends that the measures were adopted in good faith, were nondiscriminatory, and were effective for the country in general and the Claimants\u2018 investments in particular. Furthermore, the measures were not arbitrary since they were both reasonable and proportionate, and therefore do not fit the legal definition of arbitrariness as being contrary to reason, rules, or law. See Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial at paragraphs 593, 600-9.\n\n337.\n\nClaimants also assert that the discriminatory intent of Respondent is further evidenced by the statements of legislators during the national congressional debates on the draft emergency legislation as well as those of executive branch officials, along with the fact that the provincial government failed to make any meaningful progress in over three years in providing relief to EDEMSA through tariff increases or through a *bona fide* renegotiation of the Concession Agreement. But as soon as Claimants sold their interests to a local Mendoza company in March 2005, the Province began to move in earnest toward the approval of 38.05% increase in tariffs. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 450. According to Arriazu\u2018s expert report, \"Since foreign investments in public utilities were much higher than those found in other sectors of the economy, the devaluation of the peso and the freeze and pesification of public utility tariffs affected foreign investors asymmetrically in relation to national investors.\" See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 245.\n\n338.\n\nRespondent\u2018s argue that the statements by the legislators were not sufficient to conclude that there is a discriminatory intent or effect towards foreign investors, and that a thorough analysis indicates a clear intention by the Argentine National Congress to take measures to overcome the worst crisis in the history of the country; in addition the renegotiation process took place simultaneously between the eleven provincial distribution companies, all with the same procedure at the same time. In addition, Respondent asserts that Claimant\u2018s argument that the tariff increase was subject to EDEMSA\u2018s withdrawal is baseless since they knew there would be an increase and still decided to leave. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder on the Merits at paragraphs 468-70, 472.\n\n**3. Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**a) Treaty Framework**\n-----------------------\n\n339.\n\nArticle 3 of the Argentina-France BIT provides:\n\nCada una de las Partes Contratantes se compromete a otorgar, en su territorio y en su zona mar\u00edtima, un tratamiento justo y equitativo conforme a los principios de Derecho Internacional, a las inversiones efectuadas por los inversores de la otra Parte y a hacerlo de manera tal que el ejercicio del derecho as\u00ed reconocido no sea de hecho ni de derecho obstaculizado.\n\nIn the French version, Article 3 states:\n\nChacune des Parties contractantes s\u2018engage \u00e0 assurer, sur son territoire et dans sa zone maritime, un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable, conform\u00e9ment aux principes du droit international, aux investissements effectu\u00e9s par des investisseurs de l\u2018autre Partie et \u00e0 faire en sorte que l\u2018exercice du droit ainsi reconnu ne soit entrav\u00e9 ni en droit, ni en fait.\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\nEach of the Contracting Parties undertakes within its territory and its maritime zone to grant Fair and Equitable Treatment according to the principles of International Law to the investments made by the investors of the other Party, and to do so in such a way that the exercise of the right thus granted is not impaired *de facto* or *de jure*.\n\n**b) Interpretation of Article 3 of the Argentina-France BIT Based on Principles of International Law**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the contours of the treaty\u2018s standard of protection and the applicable principles of international law.\n\n341.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Fair and Equitable Treatment clause under Article 3 not only obligated Respondent to accord Claimants\u2018 investment \"Fair and Equitable Treatment in accordance with the principles of international law,\" but also required observance of this commitment in principle as well as in a practical sense. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 388.\n\n342.\n\nFirst, Claimants state that it is unclear whether qualifying the obligation of Fair and Equitable Treatment to conform to \"principles of international law\" results in any changes to the standard. They conclude, however, that even if so, ultimately the outcome remains unaffected because any variation in the standard is compensated for by virtue of Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT, that is, the MFN Clause. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at footnote 194. In particular, Claimants cite to several third-nation BITs that contain an unqualified fair and equitable treatment clause, including Article 3 of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Mexico BIT, Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Netherlands BIT and Article 3(2) of the Argentina-New Zealand BIT.\n\n343.\n\nIn Respondent\u2018s view, reference to principles of international law pursuant to Article 3 of the Argentina-France BIT entails a minimum standard of objective treatment. According to Respondent, such reference to customary international law implicates that the concept of Fair and Equitable Treatment does not establish an autonomous and independent standard but rather coincides with the minimum standard. Respondent asserts that such standard of minimum treatment has been endorsed by several nations, including the United States of America, Canada, Switzerland, Mexico and Ecuador, as well by several international tribunals.21\n\nRespondent cites to *Alex Genin et al. v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case ARB/99/2, Award of 25 June 2001, at paragraph 367; *Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL Arbitration, Arbitration Permanent Tribunal, Partial Award, decision dated 17 March 2006, at paragraph 292; and *M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Award of 31 July 2007, at paragraph 369.\n\n344.\n\nRespondent advances the standard set forth in the 1927 case of *Neer v. Mexico*22. Respondent argues that this approach, also known as the \" *Neer* standard\", does not impose obligations to keep the investment unharmed.\n\nSee *Neer v. Mexico*, published at 21 AM. J. INT\u2018L L. 555 (1927).\n\n345.\n\nIn this connection, Respondent argues that this minimum standard approach sets a high benchmark to prove a violation of the Fair and Equitable Treatment. In support of this view, Respondent cites to several ICSID and NAFTA awards as well as an ICSID annulment decision23, in which the committee required a \"clear showing\" of treaty violation.\n\nSee *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. the Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/97, Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, at paragraph 113.\n\n346.\n\nAs to incorporation through the MFN Clause, Respondent asserts that Claimants cannot invoke their indirect shareholdings in EDEMSA in order to claim substantive protection under the treaties with respect to a contractual relationship to which they are not privy. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 330.\n\n347.\n\nIn response, Claimants contend that the treaty\u2018s text under Article 3 (\"Fair and Equitable Treatment according to principles of international law\") is not synonymous with the minimum standard of treatment recognized in customary international law. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 399. Claimants argue that the Argentina-France BIT does not contain any reference to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, and thus that comporting to Respondent\u2018s interpretation would contravene principles of treaty interpretation under Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention as well as the contracting parties\u2018 intent. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 275.\n\n348.\n\nClaimants argue that the *Neer* standard has been traditionally interpreted to afford foreign investors a level of protection that is relatively lower than that offered by the standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment, but that in any event, the *Neer* standard itself has evolved since its inception in the 1920s. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 399-400.\n\n349.\n\nClaimants\u2018 expert opines that whereas \"[b]efore 1927 the emphasis on the economic dimension of sovereignty of each state was accompanied by an indifference toward the role of foreign investment in the international economic arena, [ ] a current perspective will focus much more on global economic interdependence, on the necessity of economic growth and its significance for the reduction of poverty, on the role of foreign investment, and on the accompanying competition among states in attracting foreign investors.\" See Dolzer Expert Report at paragraph 110.\n\n350.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent\u2018s reliance on NAFTA jurisprudence and analysis is without merit in that the treaty language used for NAFTA is different from that of the Argentina-France BIT. Claimants argue that the very title of the Fair and Equitable Treatment provision under NAFTA Article 1105(1) is \"Minimum Standard of Treatment\" whereas neither the France nor Luxembourg BITs contain language akin to that of NAFTA. Claimants cite to the NAFTA Free Trade Commission\u2018s binding Note of Interpretation of 31 July 2001, which according to Claimants essentially instructed the tribunals to take such a restrictive approach. Claimants thus conclude that Respondent cannot apply the NAFTA strictures to the broader Fair and Equitable Treatment provisions of modern BITs. Claimants Reply, at paragraph 281-82.\n\n351.\n\nClaimants state that the evolution of the *Neer* standard has prompted debate with respect to the standard\u2018s relationship with the obligation of Fair and Equitable Treatment, but contend that the two standards remain separate. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 401. In support, Claimants cite to an ICSID award in which an arbitral tribunal also dealt with *inter alia* Article 3 of the Argentina-France BIT.24 See Claimants Post-Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraph 76. Claimants stress the fact that the tribunal rejected Respondent\u2018s minimalist approach, finding that the provision\u2018s reference to principles of international law invites consideration of a wider range of international law principles rather than the minimum standard alone. According to Claimants several other international tribunals have held similarly.25 Alternatively, Claimants argue that Respondent\u2018s acts were arbitrary and unjust to such a degree that they amount to breaches of the *Neer* standard anyhow. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 439-40.\n\nReferred to as the \"Vivendi II\" decision, Claimants cite to *Compa\u00f1ia del Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. and Vivendi Universal, S.A. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award (20 August 2007).\n\nClaimants cite to *Saluka Investments v. Czech Republic*, (Partial Award, 17 March 2006), at paragraph 294; and *MTD Equity Sdn. Hbd. et al. v. the Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, at paragraphs 111-12 (25 May 2004); *PSEG Global, Inc. et al. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5; and *National Grid v. Argentina*, at paragraph 167.\n\n352.\n\nSecond, Claimants contend that the scope of the FET Clause, as drafted, is broader and goes beyond that provided for in most other bilateral investment treaties. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 398. According to Claimants, the language of the FET Clause stating that \"the exercise of the right thus granted is not impaired either de facto or de jure,\" brings within the scope of the provision any act that has the *de facto* effect of impairing the right to Fair and Equitable Treatment even if an intent to achieve such an effect is not manifested by the host state. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 418.\n\n**c) Contours of the Legal Standard**\n-------------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nClaimants contend that modern jurists accord the standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment a *sui generis* significance. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 391. Claimants cite to a number of arbitration awards that have dealt with the subject and conclude that Fair and Equitable Treatment (i) requires the host state to refrain from affecting the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor in making the investment,26 that is, evisceration of the arrangements in reliance upon which the foreign investor was induced to invest;27 (ii) depends on the factual context of the host state\u2018s actions, including factors such as the undertakings made to the investor and the actions the investor took in reliance on those undertakings,28 and thus prohibits conduct that might be permissible in some circumstances but appears unfair and inequitable in the context of a particular dispute; and (iii) precludes consideration of whether the host state has proceeded in good faith.29 See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 391.\n\nSee *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TecMed, S.A. v. Mexico*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/02 (Award of 29 May 2003), at paragraph 152.\n\nSee *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL (Partial Award of 13 September 2001), at paragraph 611.\n\nSee *CME,* Partial Award of 13 September 2001), at paragraph 157.\n\nSee *Occidental Exploration & Prod. Co. v. Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3467 (Award of 1 July 2004), at paragraphs 185 and 187.\n\n354.\n\nClaimants add that a trend in international arbitration may be gleaned from recent arbitration awards, which is that the legitimate expectations of the foreign investor is understood to be a key element in assessing whether there has been a breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment obligation.30 See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 397.\n\nClaimants cite to *TecMed v. Mexico*, Award of 29 May 2003), at paragraph 152; *ADF Group Inc. v. United* *States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/01 (Award of 9 January 2003), at paragraph 189; *Waste Mgmt. Inc. v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/03 (Award of 30 April 2004), at paragraph 98; and *CME v. Czech Republic* (Partial Award of 13 September 2001), at paragraph 157.\n\n355.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the expectations upon which investors can reasonably rely in making their investment include assurances and representations with respect to the Concession Agreement and relevant regulatory laws, as well as to the stability and predictability of the Regulatory Framework. In support, Claimants\u2018 expert, Professor Dolzer, opines that respecting the assurances and representations made as inducement to investors is central to the concept of legitimate expectations. See Claimants Post-Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraph 84 (citing to Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, at 2680:9 to 2682:9). In Claimants\u2018 view, prior UNCITRAL awards also support such position.31\n\nClaimants cite to *National Grid PLC v. The Argentine Republic*, UNCITRAL, (Award, 3 November 2008), at paragraphs 178-79; and *BG Group Plc. v. The Argentine Republic*, UNCITRAL, (Definite Award of 24 December 2007), at paragraph 310.\n\n356.\n\nIn addition, Claimants argue that the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard is commonly understood to entail protection as to the stability and predictability of the legal framework32, as well as the obligation not to adopt arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory measures.33 See Claimants Post-Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraphs 87, 89.\n\nClaimants cite to *Sempra v. Argentina*, Award of 28 September 2007); *Enron v. Argentina*, Award of 22 May 2007); and *CMS Gas,* Award of 12 May 2005) *.*\n\nClaimants cite to *Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL Arbitration, Arbitration Permanent Tribunal, Partial Award, decision dated 17 March 2006, at paragraph 309.\n\n357.\n\nProfessor Dolzer opines that the standard seeks to ensure the continuity and stability of the legal framework embodied in an investment contract, especially contracts for longterm projects wherein the foreign investor will sink high volumes of resources into the project at an early stage and the calculated economic return will materialize only in the subsequent years and decades, thereby depending on the host country\u2018s will to honor its contractual commitment and treat the investor in a fair manner. See Dolzer Expert Report at paragraph 91.\n\n358.\n\nRespondent agrees that assessment of Fair and Equitable Treatment requires consideration of the factual context, especially the extraordinary economic and social crisis existing at the time of occurrence conduct. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 331. Respondent cites to *inter alia* the *Saluka* award wherein the tribunal stressed that the investors expectations \"must rise to the level of legitimacy and reasonableness in the light of the circumstances.\"34\n\n*Saluka Investment v. Czech Republic*, Partial Award, at paragraph 232.\n\n359.\n\nRespondent, however, argues that customary international law recognizes neither legitimate expectations nor legal stability as essential elements to the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraphs 249-50, 255. Respondent asserts that such broad interpretation extending to the protection of legitimate expectation constitutes a legislative expansion inconsistent with the contracting parties\u2018 intentions as well as the principles of treaty interpretation under Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention. In support of their restrictive approach, Respondent cites to, *inter* *alia*, the *Continental Casualty Co. v. Argentina* award35 as well as ICSID annulment decisions.36 Moreover, Respondent argues against Claimants\u2018 interpretation of *CMS Gas, Enron* and *Sempra* by suggesting that those awards are distinguishable in that those tribunals included an obligation to maintain a stable and predictable framework because the preamble of the Argentina-U.S. BIT made express reference to the concept of stability.\n\n*Continental Casualty Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9 (Award of 5 September 2008), at paragraph 250.\n\n*MTD Equity v. the Republic of Chile*, (Decision on Annulment of 21 March 2007), at paragraph 67 *;* and *CMS* *Gasv. the Argentine Republic*, (Decision on Annulment, 25 September 2007), at paragraph 89.\n\n360.\n\nIn Respondent\u2018s view, legitimate expectations do not demand that the host state refrain from modifying its legislation unless there has been an assumption of specific commitment to the investor. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial of 9 February 2009, at paragraph 320. Respondent emphasizes that modifications implemented to the Regulatory Framework in situations otherwise do not violate the standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment.\n\n361.\n\nIn this connection, Respondent reiterates its position that the Government of Argentina undertook no specific commitments. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial of 9 February 2009, at paragraph 321. Respondent thus argues that there can be no legitimate expectation that Respondent will refrain from implementing changes to the legal framework set forth at the time of the Concession Agreement\u2018s execution.\n\n362.\n\nRespondent further argues that the standard for Fair and Equitable Treatment additionally requires a showing of denial of justice or discrimination. In support of this view, Respondent cites to several ICSID and NAFTA awards.37 See Respondent\u2018s CounterMem, at paragraphs 310-11; Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraphs 244. Respondent also seeks support of such view from the Tribunal\u2018s Decision on Jurisdiction, citing specifically to paragraph 146 therein.\n\nRespondent cites to, *inter alia*, *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID No. ARB(AF)/00/03, Award of 30 April 2004, at paragraph 98; *Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Award of 8 June 2009, at paragraph 620; and *Int'l Thunderbird Gaming Corp. v. United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Award of 26 January 2006, at paragraph 194.\n\n363.\n\nAlternatively, Respondent asserts that, even if a different standard than that of *Neer* were to apply, there was no violation of Claimants\u2018 right to Fair and Equitable Treatment. In this connection, Respondent cites to an ICSID award, seeking support of its view that legitimate expectations must be reasonable in light of the circumstances.38\n\nIn support of its view, Respondent cites to *Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award of 11 September 2007, at paragraph 332.\n\n**d) Application to the Facts**\n-------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nClaimants contend that Respondent has violated its treaty obligation to accord \"Fair and Equitable Treatment according to principles of international law\" by thwarting Claimants\u2018 fundamental investment expectations. Specifically, they claim that (i) the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession systematically contravened contractual rights that Claimants relied upon when investing; (ii) the Emergency Laws (which, according to Claimants, were unrelated or disproportionate to state objectives, discriminatory, and unconstitutional under Argentine law) destroyed the legal regime created to attract Claimants\u2018 investment; and (iii) the Renegotiation Process was discriminatory and conducted in bad faith.\n\n365.\n\nClaimants argue that from the very outset of their investment in August 1998, EPRE through arbitrary regulatory measures chipped away at the legal framework guaranteed to EDEMSA\u2018s investors, until 2002, when the Government of Mendoza is alleged to have completely unraveled that framework through the enactment of the Provincial Emergency Law, thereby radically transforming the \"rules of the game\" and crippling EDEMSA financially. Claimants add that Respondent\u2018s acts are rendered all the more unjust by the fact that the Provincial Emergency Law explicitly obligated EDEMSA to continue complying fully with the Concession Agreement, thus further exacerbating EDEMSA\u2018s financial plight and creating a markedly unfair asymmetry in the contractual relationship. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 410.\n\n366.\n\nFurthermore, Claimants stress the importance of the additional requirement under Article 3, which imposes the obligation not to impair Claimants\u2018 right to Fair and Equitable Treatment either *de facto* or *de jure*. As such, Claimants contend that, whatever the intent of the Government of Mendoza may have been with respect to the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession and the enactment of the Emergency Measures, as a practical matter a marked injustice was perpetrated insofar as Claimants\u2018 use of and benefit from their investment was radically impeded. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 418.\n\n**(1) Expectation Based on Respondent's Conducts**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n367.\n\nClaimants contend that the Province of Mendoza embarked on a campaign to specifically attract foreign investors in purchasing 51% of EDEMSA Class \"A\" shares. According to Claimants, Respondent\u2018s road shows and Info Memo promoted *inter alia* a foreign investor-friendly legal regime that provided investors with reasonable returns as well as a series of protections tailored to make the investment more appealing to foreign capital markets. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 403-406.\n\n368.\n\nKey features of the Respondent\u2018s sales pitch are said to have been (i) the creation of a regulatory agency with independent oversight to insulate investors from politically motivated measures and actions; (ii) the Currency Clause; (iii) the Cost Adjustment Clause; (iv) the Extraordinary Tariff Adjustment Clause; (v) an initial tariff schedule with a fixed-term of five years; and (vi) a concession with a duration of thirty years. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 406-407.\n\n369.\n\nAccording to Claimants, foreign investors were lured with specific guarantees and commitments that created strong expectations of a long-term investment subject to only *de minimis* political or regulatory risk. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 408. Claimants contend they in fact did rely on such guarantees and commitments to effectuate their purchase of EDEMSA shares. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 409. Claimants emphasize the fact that Respondent\u2018s representations and assurances were directly related to the rights and protections under the Concession Agreement and the Regulatory Framework.\n\n370.\n\nIn defense, Respondent asserts that in all circumstances the national and provincial authorities acted in a reasonable, responsible, non-discriminatory and proportionate manner in light of their public responsibility under extraordinary economic conditions. Moreover, Respondent contends that even if it had failed to comply with its contractual obligations, such breaches do not amount to violations of Fair and Equitable Treatment. In support of such view, Respondent cites to *Waste Mgmt. Inc. v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/03 (Award of 30 April 2004).\n\n371.\n\nIn Respondent\u2018s view, a scenario in which the Concession Agreement would go unmodified despite economic and social crisis was beyond Claimants\u2018 reasonable expectation. Moreover, it was beyond expectation that no renegotiation would take place to account for the new macroeconomic and social situation of the country. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraph 68. According to Respondent, such expectation of Claimants runs afoul of what should be fair and equitable in the context of a general and dramatic crisis in which everyone loses. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 290.\n\n372.\n\nMoreover, Respondent argues that assurances made by the Argentine officials prior to Claimants\u2018 investment could not give rise to legitimate expectations because the privatization materials provided therewith were not contractually binding. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits, at paragraphs 70-73. Said materials did not establish Claimants\u2018 legitimate expectation given the bidders\u2018 responsibility to conduct due diligence and base their bids on their own assessment and investigation.\n\n373.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Regulatory Framework and Concession Agreement were expressly subject to the existing circumstances at the time of investment and Claimants\u2018 efficient operation of the concession. As such, the Regulatory Framework and Concession Agreement were not intended to compensate Claimants for consequences pertaining to their business risk. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 291.\n\n374.\n\nRespondent further argues that Claimants were at their own fault in their investment failing to meet their expectations. Respondent asserts that such failure was caused by Claimants\u2018 inadequate due diligence despite Respondent supplying sufficient information per the Data Room, as well as by Claimants\u2018 own breaches, technical inefficiencies and bad management. According to Respondent, Claimants had voluntarily invested in Mendoza after making their own assessment and becoming fully aware that they would assume the risks inherent in a regulated sector. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 292.\n\n375.\n\nClaimants respond by asserting that Respondent\u2018s due diligence arguments cannot alter its liability under the BIT, which should necessarily be based on the state\u2018s postinvestment conduct, not Claimants\u2018 pre-investment conduct. Alternatively, Claimants argue that such arguments by Respondent are baseless because Claimants did carry out adequate due diligence and inspections as well as properly manage the company.\n\n376.\n\nIn Claimants\u2018 view, the fact that bidders were supposed to conduct due diligence does not render their reliance on the State\u2018s assurances and representatives irrational or illegitimate, or provide *carte blanche* to Argentina to renege on those assurances. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Reply on the Merits, at paragraph 16.\n\n**(2) Pre-Emergency Measures Affecting the Concession**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n377.\n\nAs an initial matter, Respondent asserts, without admitting wrongdoing, a claim based on denial of justice should be dismissed *in limine* insofar as it is based on the PreEmergency Measures affecting the Concession because it was not pled in Claimants\u2018 Memorial, and thus, must be deemed untimely. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 768.\n\n378.\n\nClaimants contend that the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the concession unilaterally and systematically contravened aspects of the Concession Agreement alleged to have been fundamental in the Claimants\u2018 evaluation of investing in the Province of Mendoza. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 423.\n\n379.\n\nClaimants argue that the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession blatantly disregarded material financial and contractual commitments, such as to compensate EDEMSA for losses incurred as a result of provincial subsidies and for financial obligations assigned to EDEMSA as part of the contractual arrangement, as well as to abide by the tariff schedules and tariff revision mechanisms established in the Concession Agreement. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 423. In Claimants\u2018 view, EPRE summarily ignored such commitments by *inter alia* establishing new categories of tariffs and users and arbitrarily expanding the geographical scope of the concession area.\n\n380.\n\nClaimants contend that these measures went beyond mere contractual breaches in that they were adopted by the Province of Mendoza in exercise of its regulatory powers. According to Claimants, such acts configure a pattern of conduct that is clearly not fair or equitable, as it substantially altered *the economic* equilibrium of the Concession Agreement that the Claimants had relied upon, thereby significantly reducing the value of their investment. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 424.\n\n381.\n\nClaimants argue that EDEMSA faced difficulties in the administrative and judicial proceedings, which were sought to vindicate rights under the Concession Agreement. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at 148-89. Claimants thus assert that Respondent frustrated Claimants\u2018 access to fair legal proceedings, thereby breaching one of the core principles inherent in the standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment.\n\n382.\n\nClaimants\u2018 witness, Mr. Gonella, provides further detail regarding the barriers that EDEMSA confronted in the administrative proceedings. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraphs 335-37. According to Mr. Gonella, EDEMSA was required to submit any administrative claim in the first instance to EPRE, which in fact was the same independent government entity that had issued the administrative resolutions detrimental to EDEMSA by way of unilaterally changing the terms of the Concession Agreement. See Supplementary Witness Statement of Hector Gonella, at paragraph 79. Mr. Gonella further provides that EPRE\u2018s dual role as judge and party prevented any justice before the administrative tribunal. Mr. Gonella opines that the general trend in the way in which EDEMSA\u2018s claims were being dealt with followed a pattern involving lengthy proceedings with long periods of time spent waiting for decisions to be adopted and notified; followed by, \"incorrectly based decisions without a direct reply to EDEMSA\u2018s arguments in defense of EDEMSA\u2018s rights, and the repeated denial of each claims being submitted.\"\n\n383.\n\nMr. Gonella further comments on the administrative appeal process before the ME&PW that followed after the initial proceedings mentioned above. See *id.* at paragraphs 80. According to Mr. Gonella, the officials in charge of resolving EDEMSA\u2018s appeal had a contractual relationship with the predecessor company, EMSE, and displayed hostility against EDEMSA. Each and every claim submitted before the ME&PW was rejected.\n\n384.\n\nAs to the final stage of appeal, which was made before the judicial courts, Claimants assert that EDEMSA suffered significant denials of due process, including an inability to have its claims heard on the merits as well as an inability to obtain relief. Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 337. Claimants cite to Mr. Gonella\u2018s statement, in which he provides that the Supreme Court of Mendoza, having original and exclusive jurisdiction over EDEMSA\u2018s claims, rejected all claims made by EDEMSA based on merely formal considerations. Mr. Gonella opines that several delays in the judicial process were made intentionally and that EDEMSA\u2018s arguments were rejected for political reasons. Moreover, Mr. Gonella states that during the appeal process, the court refused to accept expert reports on damages. *Id.* at paragraphs 89, 90-91.\n\n385.\n\nWith respect to Claimants\u2018 witnesses, including Mr. Gonella, Respondent seeks to undermine their credibility. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits, at paragraphs 25-32. In this regard, Respondent asserts that Mr. Gonella has a conflict of interest because he has served as counsel to EDF. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits, at paragraphs 25-32. In response, Claimants argue that such argument cuts both ways in that all of Respondent\u2018s fact witnesses are themselves employees of the Province of Mendoza. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Reply on the Merits, at paragraph 5.\n\n386.\n\nRespondent further argues that Claimants alleged difficulties were caused by their own inaccurate business projections, which resulted from Claimants\u2018 negligent failure to properly conduct its due diligence obligations, including adequate analysis of the network\u2018s conditions as well as geographic and climatic characteristics of the concession area. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Reply on the Merits, at paragraphs 26-31.\n\n387.\n\nIn this connection, Respondent contends that the acts of the Province prior to the Argentine crisis demonstrate its good faith. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Reply on the Merits, at paragraphs 34-35. Despite EDEMSA\u2018s management deficiencies and inability to meet objectives and deadlines with respect to service quality, EPRE and provincial government displayed good faith as well as a strong will to collaborate. Respondent underscores that Claimants have not contested these particular facts.\n\n**(3) Emergency Measures and Renegotiation Process**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n388.\n\nClaimants contend that the enactment of the Emergency Laws completely destroyed the value of their investment in EDEMSA by eliminating a legal regime purposefully created and promoted to induce foreign investors. According to Claimants, the Emergency Laws first delinked the Argentine peso from the U.S. dollar, thus ending the Convertibility System. Claimants note that this measure by itself would not have affected the legal regime since tariffs were guaranteed to be calculated in dollars regardless of the exchange rate. However, the Emergency Laws\u2018 further pesification and freeze of tariff rates are alleged to have overturned the legal framework that Argentina had guaranteed to Claimants in order to secure their investment. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 425-426.\n\n389.\n\nClaimants contend that, consequently, they suddenly found EDEMSA\u2018s cash flow generation capabilities eroded, thereby resulting in a significant reduction of operating profits which by 2003 became negative, with no tariff adjustment remedy to enable a reasonable return on their long-term investment while at the same time EDEMSA was obligated by law to keep up with the quality standards to which it was bound under the original terms of the Concession Contract. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 426.\n\n390.\n\nClaimants posit that such an arrangement is totally at odds with the contractual regime upon which Claimants relied on when making their investment and constitutes a repudiation of applicable contractual rights, and thus amounts to a violation of the FET Clause. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 426.\n\n391.\n\nClaimants add that the Emergency Laws were unrelated or disproportionate to Respondent\u2018s asserted objective, that is, to protect the lower socio-economic classes. Claimants argue that the Emergency Laws did not include similar freezing measures with respect to other components of the basket of expenses of lower income groups, even though monthly public utility expenses is alleged to make up less than 8% of the national average low-income family budget and electricity consumption is alleged to account for less than 2% of total consumer expenditures. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 42728.\n\n392.\n\nClaimants highlight that no effort was made to tailor the measures to those sectors that the Emergency Laws supposedly sought to help. Claimants allege that low income households account for less than 9% of total electricity consumption nationally, and no more than 5% in the Province of Mendoza, but yet the tariff freeze was imposed across the board, thereby conferring a windfall on sectors of society that did not need help. In Claimants\u2018 view, the over-inclusiveness of the Emergency Laws constitutes an unfair and forced subsidy by EDEMSA in favor of sectors of Argentine society that had the full or substantial capacity to bear increases in energy costs prompted by the economic situation of early 2002. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 429.\n\n393.\n\nIt is also claimed that the Emergency Laws were discriminatory as well. Claimants argue that the various remarks made by both the legislative and executive branches of the Government of Mendoza alleged to xenophobic in nature. Claimants also state that the Emergency Law\u2018s price freeze was imposed exclusively on the public utilities sector, the majority of which is owned by foreign investors, and, in the case of EDEMSA, the freeze was kept firmly in place until Claimants sold their shares and a local Mendoza-based company became EDEMSA\u2018s new majority owner. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 430-31.\n\n394.\n\nWith respect to any difficulties encountered by Claimants in connection with the Emergency Measures, Respondent argues that their cause was due to Claimants\u2018 poor management decision to incur high levels of debt in foreign currency. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 293.\n\n395.\n\nRespondent further argues that even after enactment of the Emergency Measures in 2002, the government authorities made a good-faith effort to consider EDEMSA\u2018s request for tariff adjustment. Respondent\u2018 Counter-Memorial at paragraph 314. In Respondent\u2018s view, the Emergency Laws were legitimate and reasonable means to maintain tariffs at fair and reasonable rates that allowed, in time, for the gradual economic and social recovery which would benefit all constituents. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraph 448. In this connection, Respondent notes that the Convertibility Law was not abandoned to increase sovereign wealth or to restructure productivity forces, and that the Argentine Supreme Court has declared the Emergency Laws as constitutional. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 410, 420.\n\n396.\n\nMoreover, Respondent asserts that it had displayed good faith during the Renegotiation Process as well, essentially suspending EDEMSA\u2018s service quality obligations in light of the latter\u2018s failure.\n\n397.\n\nClaimants contend that despite their good-faith cooperation with the Renegotiation Process, the process was highly politicized, characterized by repeated extensions of the legal deadlines for its completion, and lacking of any real intent on Respondent\u2018s part to reach a solution. Claimants argue that no genuine progress was made in the nearly three and a half years that passed from the inception of the Renegotiation Process to the point where Claimants decided to sell their EDEMSA shares. According to Claimants, the focus of the Renegotiation Process from 2002 through March 2005 was on short-term palliatives rather than on the renegotiation of the concession contracts themselves as required by the Provincial Emergency Law. Claimants argue that, even so, no solutions were forthcoming until EDEMSA\u2018s ownership was transferred to Argentine hands. In Claimants\u2018 view, the fact that the Renegotiation Process was inordinately delayed even though by Decree it was to be concluded originally in 180 days, reflects the Government of Mendoza\u2018s lack of political will to take the necessary steps to lift the tariff freeze, which Claimants allege is precisely the type of political risk the Argentina-France BIT is designed to protect against. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 433-34.\n\n398.\n\nClaimants argue that while their persistent requests for a tariff increase ever since the 2002 tariff freeze was imposed were consistently rejected, the stage was suddenly transformed shortly after Claimants publicly announced their divestiture from EDEMSA and a local Argentine company took over ownership of EDEMSA, at which time the Government of Mendoza announced a tariff increase of 38.05% which became effective only after Claimants\u2018 sale of their EDEMSA shares. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 430.\n\n**4. Full Protection and Security**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**a) Treaty Framework**\n-----------------------\n\n399.\n\nArticle 5(1) of the Argentina-France BIT provides:\n\nLas inversiones efectuadas por inversores de una u otra de las Partes Contratantes gozar\u00e1n, en el territorio y en la zona mar\u00edtima de la otra Parte Contratante de protecci\u00f3n y plena seguridad en aplicaci\u00f3n del principio del tratamiento justo y equitativo mencionado en el art\u00edculo 3 del presente Acuerdo.\n\nIn the French version, Article 5(1) reads:\n\nLes investissements effectu\u00e9s par des investisseurs de l\u2018une ou l\u2018autre des Parties contractantes b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient, sur le territoire et dans la zone maritime de l\u2018autre Partie contractante, d\u2018une protection et d\u2018une s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pleines et enti\u00e8res, en application du principe de traitement juste et \u00e9quitable mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2018article 3 du pr\u00e9sent Accord.\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\nThe investments made by investors of either of the Contracting Parties shall enjoy protection and full security in the territory and in the maritime zone of the other Contracting Party in application of the principle of Fair and Equitable Treatment discussed in Article 3 of this Agreement.\n\n**b) Admissibility of Claim**\n-----------------------------\n\n400.\n\nAs an initial matter Respondent requests dismissal of this claim by reason that it was not included in Claimants\u2018 Memorial of 2 May 2005 and thus that it violates Article 31(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraphs 575-76.\n\n401.\n\nRespondent further argues, without admitting wrongdoing, that a claim based on denial of justice should be dismissed *in limine* insofar as it is based on the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession because it was not pled in Claimants\u2018 Memorial, and thus, must be deemed untimely. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 768.\n\n402.\n\nIn response, Claimants argue that their full protection and security claim was first asserted in the Request for Arbitration dated 4 August 2003, and was fully briefed in their Reply of 30 April 2009. As such, the mere fact that this claim was not briefed in\n\nClaimants\u2018 Memorial of 2 May 2005 caused no prejudice to Respondent because it had notice of that claim by virtue of Claimants\u2018 assertions made in the Request for Arbitration and thus was given opportunity to respond not only in its Rejoinder but also at the hearing. Alternatively, Claimants assert that this claim qualifies as an incidental or ancillary claim under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules because it arises directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute. Those norms require that such incidental or additional claims be presented no later than the reply, which Claimants have done. Claimants Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits, at paragraph 119.\n\n**c) Parties' Contentions**\n---------------------------\n\n403.\n\nClaimants assert that Respondent has violated Article 5(1) of the Argentina-France BIT by breaching its obligation to afford full protection and security to Claimants\u2018 investments. Specifically, Claimants argue that Respondent compromised the legal security of Claimants\u2018 investments by overriding and repudiating the rights granted under the Concession Agreement and that it failed to provide EDEMSA with a meaningful opportunity to resolve its contractual claims before fair administrative and judicial bodies in Mendoza. According to Claimants, modern jurisprudence confirms that the obligation to provide full protection and security of an investment goes beyond physical protection, thus affording legal security and a stable investment environment. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 340-41.\n\n404.\n\nHad Argentina and France wished to devise the meaning of \"security\" narrowly so as to preclude obligations to legal security, they could have expressly indicated so in the treaty. Rather, the countries agreed to provide \"full\" security, which, according to Claimants, should be broadly defined so as to include legal protection. Claimants\u2018 expert, Dr. Dolzer opines that \"full security\", when given its ordinary meaning, runs afoul with a narrow interpretation limiting the scope of application to strictly physical aspects. See Expert Report of Dolzer, at paragraph 178. In further support, Claimants cite to an ICSID award,39 in which the tribunal rejected Argentina\u2018s narrow reading of Article 5(1) of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n*Compa\u00f1ia del Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. and Vivendi Universal, S.A. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award (20 August 2007).\n\n405.\n\nIn Claimants\u2018 view, the concept of full protection and security is closely linked to that of Fair and Equitable Treatment. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 343. What is more, Article 5(1) expressly links full protection and security to the \"application of the principle of Fair and Equitable Treatment.\" Given that the latter concept guards investors from all unfair acts or omissions by the host country, reference thereto under Article 5(1) makes clear that full protection is not limited to physical aspects but rather includes legal security, which in turn relates to the stability and predictability of the legal framework. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits, at paragraph 114.\n\n406.\n\nAccording to Claimants, such linkage between the two treaty protections has been recognized in several arbitral awards, including *Vivendi II, Occidental* and *National Grid*. Claimants provide their reading of the *Occidental* decision, which is that violation of the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard necessarily entails a violation of the full protection and security standard. See Claimants\u2018 Reply of 30 April 2009, at paragraph 343-44 (citing to *Occidental* (Final Award, 1 July 2004), at paragraph 187).\n\n407.\n\nAlternatively, Claimants argue that, regardless whether Article 5(1) directly assures legal security, Claimants are still entitled to such protection through the MFN clause under Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT. Pursuant to those clauses, Respondent is required to extend the more favorable treatment accorded to other investors under, for instance, the Argentina-Germany BIT, which expressly guarantees the \"legal security\" of all foreign investments. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 344.\n\n408.\n\nClaimants further contend that, in the present case, the evidence shows that the measures trampled on EDEMSA\u2018s rights under the Concession Agreement and the Regulatory Framework. According to Claimants, Respondent repudiated contractual terms while unilaterally substituting others, and radically altered the operation of the Regulatory Framework. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 345.\n\n409.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent failed to afford Claimants with fair and meaningful legal process to vindicate their contractual rights against Mendoza. In support, Claimants cite to *Parkerings-Compagneit S.A. v. Lithuania* and *Tecmed*. According to Claimants, these awards establish that full protection and security obligations include a fair and accessible legal system. Claimants argue that, in the present case, Mendoza\u2018s administrative and judicial authorities have created needless delays and engaged in gross procedural improprieties, including biases displayed by Mendoza\u2018s administrative agencies against EDEMSA as well as the Mendoza Supreme Court\u2018s refusal to consider EDEMSA\u2018s claims on the merits. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 351-52.\n\n410.\n\nAs a result, the above mentioned conducts by Respondent amounted to violations of its obligation to provide full protection and security to Claimants\u2018 investments. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 345-6.\n\n411.\n\nIn support of its conclusion, Claimants further cite to, *inter alia*, the *National Grid* award, which dealt with similar facts as those in the present case. According to Claimants, the *National Grid* tribunal found a violation of the full protection and security clause on the basis of Argentina imposing pesification of public contracts and a tariff freeze, as well as impeding the company\u2018s ability to renegotiate its Concession Agreement. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits of at paragraph 118 (citing to *National Grid*, at paragraphs 59-60,189-90.\n\n412.\n\nIn defense, Respondent contends that Claimants\u2018 accusations fall outside the scope of protection provided under either Article 5(1) of the Argentina-France BIT or Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT. Alternatively, Respondent asserts that this accusation lacks factual grounds. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 586.\n\n413.\n\nIn Respondent\u2018s view, it is impossible to put the two standards on the same footing in the sense that violation of Fair and Equitable Treatment equals breach of full protection and security. Respondent argues against Claimants\u2018 view by asserting that, if such were the case, the existence of one of the two standards would become unnecessary. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 592.\n\n414.\n\nMoreover, Respondent disagrees with Claimant that legal security was intended by Argentina and France, saying that Claimants\u2018 reasoning is flawed in that the same construction can be used to support the contrary, meaning that the countries had intended to extend the protection to include legal security, they could have expressed so in the text of the Argentina-France BIT. In this connection, Respondent states that other investment treaties entered into by Argentina do in fact contain the expression, \"legal security\", such as those entered into with Germany, Chile, Guatemala, Panama and Peru, as well as the fact that the Argentina-Germany BIT had entered in force prior to the Argentina-France BIT, but inclusion of the term \"legal security\" was not agreed to in the latter. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 596.\n\n415.\n\nRespondent attempts to undermine Claimants\u2018 reading of *Vivendi II* and *National Grid* by arguing that neither tribunal expressly stated that treaty reference to \"full protection and security\" includes legal security or stable investment environment, and with respect to the *CME v. Czech Republic* award, Respondent seeks to distinguish its facts from that of the present case as well as the text of relevant treaty provisions. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraphs 601-2.\n\n416.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the *CME* tribunal conclusion was based on its finding that the measures adopted were \"targeted\" to remove the security and legal protection. Respondent asserts that Claimants have presented no evidence of such \"targeted\" conduct in the present case, and rather, objectives behind the measures adopted by Respondent in the present case were of general nature, such as to avoid hyperinflation, improve fiscal situations and halt deterioration of life conditions. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraph 603.\n\n417.\n\nMoreover, Respondent argues against incorporation of other treaty standards by way of the MFN clause, which would run afoul of the intentions of the contracting states. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 611. For the reasons mentioned above, Respondent concludes that it has not violated the treaty standard because neither Claimants nor EDEMSA were deprived of physical protection and security. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder of 27 July 2009, at paragraph 608. Alternatively, Respondent asserts that legal security was in fact afforded to Claimants\u2018 investments. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder of 27 July 2009, at paragraph 624.\n\n418.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the guarantee of protection and security is not absolute and does not impose strict liability on the host state. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 618. Rather, the obligation implicates a requirement to exercise due diligence as reasonable under the circumstances. In support of such view, Respondent cites to *Lauder v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL case (Award of 3 September 2001).\n\n419.\n\nCiting to the *Lauder* and *Parkerings-Compagneit* awards, Respondent advances the position that the only duty under the full protection and security standard was to keep the judicial system available and permit such claims to be properly examined and decided. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 620-21.\n\n420.\n\nRespondent argues that, in the present case, Mendoza\u2018s administrative and judicial system has been fully available to Claimants and EDEMSA, which is evidenced by the fact that EDEMSA had in fact brought several actions before the administrative and judicial tribunals; Respondent further asserts that it has provided Claimants due process of law at all times. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 622.\n\n**5. Indirect Expropriation**\n-----------------------------\n\n**a) Treaty Framework**\n-----------------------\n\n421.\n\nArticle 5(2) of the Argentina-France BIT provides:\n\nLas Partes Contratantes se abstendr\u00e1n de adoptar, de manera directa o indirecta, medidas de expropiaci\u00f3n o de nacionalizaci\u00f3n o cualquier otra medida equivalente que tenga un efecto similar de desposesi\u00f3n, salvo por causa de utilidad p\u00fablica y con la condici\u00f3n que estas medidas no sean discriminatorias ni contrarias a un compromiso particular.\n\nLas medidas mencionadas que podr\u00edan ser adoptadas deber\u00e1n dar lugar al pago de una compensaci\u00f3n pronta y adecuada, cuyo monto calculado sobre el valor real de las inversiones afectadas deber\u00e1 ser evaluado con relaci\u00f3n a una situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mico normal y anterior a cualquier amenaza de desposesi\u00f3n.\n\nEsta compensaci\u00f3n, su monto y sus modalidades de pago ser\u00e1n fijados a m\u00e1s tardar a la fecha de la desposesi\u00f3n. Esta compensaci\u00f3n ser\u00e1 efectivamente realizable, pagada sin demora y libremente transferible. Y producir\u00e1 intereses calculados a una tasa apropiada hasta la fecha de su pago.\n\nIn the French version, Article 5(2) prescribes:\n\nLes Parties contractantes ne prennent pas, directement ou indirectement, de mesures d\u2018expropriation ou de nationalisation, ni tout autre mesure \u00e9quivalente ayant un effet similaire de d\u00e9possession, si ce n\u2018est pour cause d\u2018utilit\u00e9 publique et \u00e0 condition que ces mesures ne soient ni discriminatoires, ni contraires \u00e0 un engagement particulier.\n\nLes mesures vis\u00e9es ci-dessus qui pourraient \u00eatre prises doivent donner lieu au paiement d\u2018une indemnit\u00e9 prompte et ad\u00e9quate dont le montant, calcul\u00e9 sur valeur r\u00e9elle des investissements concern\u00e9s, doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 par rapport \u00e0 une situation \u00e9conomique normale et ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 toute menace de d\u00e9possession.\n\nCette indemnit\u00e9, son montant et ses modalit\u00e9s de versement sont fix\u00e9s au plus tard \u00e0 la date de la d\u00e9possession. Cette indemnit\u00e9 est effectivement r\u00e9alisable, vers\u00e9e sans retard et librement transf\u00e9rable. Elle produit, jusqu\u2018\u00e0 la date de versement, des int\u00e9r\u00eats calcul\u00e9s au taux d\u2018int\u00e9r\u00eat appropri\u00e9.\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\nThe Contracting Parties shall abstain from directly or indirectly adopting measures of expropriation or nationalization or any other equivalent measure having a similar effect of dispossession, except for causes of public utility and provided such measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a specific commitment.\n\nSuch measures as may be adopted shall result in the payment of prompt and adequate compensation, the amount of which, calculated on the genuine value of the relevant investments, shall be valuated in terms of a normal economic situation prior to any threat of dispossession.\n\nThe amount and terms of payment of such compensation shall be established by the time of dispossession at the latest. Such compensation shall be effectively realizable, paid without delay, and freely transferable. It shall accrue interest calculated at an appropriate rate up to the date of payment.\n\n422.\n\nTreaty Article 1(1) defines the term \"inversiones\" as:\n\nactivos tales como los bienes, derechos e intereses de cualquier naturaleza y, en particular, aunque no exclusivamente:... b) las acciones, primas de emisi\u00f3n y otras formas de participaci\u00f3n, a\u00fan minoritarias o indirectas, en las sociedades constituidas en el territorio de una de las Partes Contratantes;... e) las concesiones acordadas por la ley o en virtud de un contrato....\n\nIn the French version, \"investment\" is defined as:\n\navoirs tels que les biens, droits et int\u00e9r\u00eats de toute nature, et plus particuli\u00e8rement mais non exclusivement:... b) Les actions, primes d\u2018\u00e9mission et autres formes de participation, m\u00eame minoritaires ou indirectes, aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s constitu\u00e9es sur le territoire de l\u2018une des Parties contractantes;... e) Les concessions accord\u00e9es par la loi ou en vertu d\u2018un contrat....\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\nassets such as goods, rights, and interests of any nature, including but not limited to:... b) shares, issue premiums, and other forms of participation, even minority or indirect participation, in companies established in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties;... e) concessions granted by law or under contract....\n\n423.\n\nFurthermore, Treaty Article 1(3) provides:\n\nLas ganancias de las inversiones y, en caso de reinversi\u00f3n, las ganancias de su reinversi\u00f3n gozan de la misma protecci\u00f3n que la inversi\u00f3n.\n\nIn the French version, Article 1(3) states:\n\nLes revenus de l\u2018investissement et, en cas de r\u00e9investissement, les revenus de leur r\u00e9investissement jouissent de la m\u00eame protection que l\u2018investissement.\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\nReturns on investments and, in the event of reinvestment, returns on reinvestment shall enjoy the same protection as the investment.\n\n424.\n\nThe same provision defines \" *ganancias* \" as:\n\n[T]odas las sumas producidas por una inversi\u00f3n, tales como los beneficios, retribuciones o intereses, durante un per\u00edodo determinado.\n\nIn the French version, \" *revenus* \" is defined as\n\n[T]outes les sommes produites par un investissement, telles que b\u00e9n\u00e9fices, redevances ou int\u00e9r\u00eats, durant une p\u00e9riode donn\u00e9e.\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\n[A]ll the amounts yielded by an investment, such as profit, income or interest, in a given period.\n\n**b) Parties' Contentions**\n---------------------------\n\n425.\n\nClaimants observe that Treaty Article 5(2) generally reflects customary international law precepts proscribing host state measures which prevent, unreasonably interferes with, or unduly delays the effective enjoyment or disposal of the property, whether such acts were lawful or not. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial on the Merits at paragraphs 317, 320-3, 329.\n\n426.\n\nIn response, Respondent contends that its regulatory actions were valid, which does not necessitate compensation; such regulation power is part of the general customs of international law, and is therefore relevant in the application of the Treaty. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial, at paragraphs 539-44.40\n\nRespondent cites to leading commentator F.A. Mann, who purports that \"[T]hose measures which matter in the present context, namely, general legislation or executive provisions put into force for the benefit of the community at large, do not involve the taking of property even if they affect the rights of the owner or the value of his property.\" See F.A. Mann, \"State Contracts and State Responsibility,\" in International Law in the Twentieth Century (Leo Gross ed., 1996), 577.\n\n427.\n\nClaimants take the position that the Argentina-France BIT obliges Respondent to promptly and adequately compensate for adopting measures of direct or indirect expropriation, or for measures having a similar effect. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 317. According to Claimants, the Pre-Emergency Alterations, Emergency Tariff Measures and ensuing failure of the Renegotiation Process had the effect of indirectly expropriating Claimants\u2018 investments, but the Respondent has failed to compensate for this taking. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraphs 323, 335, 350-3, 371.\n\n428.\n\nRespondent asserts that when taken in context of the emergency situation such actions were lawful and fall under Respondent\u2018s police power, which due to the Harvard Draft Convention include a \"general change in the value of currency\" and \"the action of the competent authorities of the State in the maintenance of public order\" and do not constitute an expropriation. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 533, 536-7.\n\n429.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the concept of indirect expropriation is more expansive than direct expropriation, extending even to repudiation of contractual or concession rights,41 and including at least three key factors, namely the nature of the measure or act at issue, whether the impact on the investor was disproportionately severe, and whether the duration of the interference was not merely ephemeral. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 325-8, 342-3.\n\nClaimants\u2018 legal expert, opines that \"[a] substantial deprivation... also [occurs] when the earnings derived from the investment are no longer reasonably related to those which would have accrued if the host state had not altered the conditions laid down in the concession contract[;]... [a]ny alteration of these rights which goes beyond the framework of the investment back expectations as recognized in the contract... simultaneously alters the property rights of the investor in a manner which has the same effect as a dispossession of property within the meaning of Article 5 section 2 of the Argentine-French BIT.\" Dolzer Expert Report, at paragraphs 43-4.\n\n430.\n\nRespondent, however, takes the position that under Article 5(2) of the Argentina-France BIT indirect expropriation only occurs when an act or series of acts constitute a material deprivation of property rights. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial on the Merits at paragraphs 493-4. Respondent emphasizes the fact that indirect expropriation necessitates the deprivation be material, including whether the investor maintains ownership and control of the investment or if the Government administers the daily operations of the company, that the measures are severe in nature, and the threshold for indirect expropriation should not be lower than that for direct expropriation. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial on the Merits at paragraph 495, 501-505, 507. Also, the fact that Claimants retained control and increased their shareholding in SODEMSA indicates that there was no deprivation of ownership. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 412.\n\n431.\n\nIn addition, in Claimants\u2018 view the definition of the term \"investment\" is also broad as it not only comprises assets of any nature, but also any income or returns derived from the corpus; thus shares in EDEMSA and the value of and returns on those shares are all \"investments\" for purposes of the Treaty.42 See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 3189. Claimants emphasize that the focus of the inquiry must constitute a finding on the expropriatory effect of Respondent\u2018s actions upon the investment, as opposed to the governmental purpose or objective underlying the measures in question, thus meaning whether or not Respondent intended to expropriate is irrelevant.43 See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 336-8.\n\nClaimants\u2018 legal expert, Professor Dolzer, opines that \"it is expressly recognized in the BIT that shares held by nationals of one state in companies established in the other state are covered by the rules of the BIT. Argentina was aware of its obligations under various BITs, including the one with France, when it carried out its program of privatization, and allowed and encouraged the acquisition of shares by foreign investors such as EDFI. Therefore, the economic value of the shares in the national companies are protected in the same way as is the economic value embodied in other property rights protected under the BIT, as defined in Article 1 of the BIT. As shareholders in the interests in EDEMSA, EDFI, SAURI, and Le\u00f3n have the right to assert claims for State measures that affect their property rights which consist of their shares in EDEMSA and the value which is embodied in these shares. \" Dolzer Expert Report, at paragraph 12.\n\nClaimants\u2018 legal expert, Professor Dolzer, supplements by opining that \"[t]he absence of good faith will mean only that the act is unlawful, with the consequences provided by the general rules of international law on state responsibility. In other words, good faith is a prerequisite for a lawful measure of expropriation and the fact that the government does act in good faith does not exempt it from the obligation to compensate, because a lawful expropriation still triggers a duty to pay compensation.\" Dolzer Expert Report, at paragraph 37.\n\n432.\n\nRespondent argues that a diminution in the value of the shares does not equate to an expropriation, and that Claimants actually sold their interests in EDEMSA for a positive value. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 405, 408, and Respondent\u2018s CounterClaim on the Merits at paragraph 501. Furthermore, Claimants\u2018 investment had no value when the measures took effect, and therefore the Respondent\u2018s measures are not at fault for any loss in value experienced by Claimants. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial on the Merits at 503. Finally, Respondent takes the view that the Tribunal must also take into account whether Respondent intended to perpetrate an expropriation. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 458.\n\n433.\n\nClaimants assert the effect of the Pre-Emergency Alterations, the Emergency Tariff Measures, and ensuing failure of the Renegotiation Process significantly deprived Claimants of their control or use of the investment as well as their reasonably expected economic benefits, ultimately forcing divestiture in order to mitigate losses. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 329.\n\n434.\n\nRespondent\u2018s view is that a decrease in the expected return does not amount to expropriation, and the BIT\u2018s protection against expropriation \"investment\" does not extend to a guarantee of profits. See Claimants Counter Memorial on the Merits at paragraph 525. In connection to this, Respondent did not procure rights from the Claimants, meaning no expropriation occurred. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 459-60.\n\n435.\n\nIn particular, Claimants contend that the Emergency Tariff Measures destroyed the economic terms of the investment by unilaterally altering the Concession\u2018s Legal Framework, eliminating any return on the investment despite legal guarantees of reasonable returns, causing an inability to sustain infrastructural investment levels for adequate network maintenance, threatening the medium- to long-term sustainability of the investment, eroding EDEMSA\u2018s cash flow generation capabilities so as to result in negative operating margins and defaults on debts, and completely diluting the value of Claimants\u2018 equity holdings due to the phenomenal increase in the relative value of EDEMSA\u2018s financial debt occasioned by the pesification and freeze of tariffs. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 330.\n\n436.\n\nRespondent replies that the crisis and various management mistakes on the part of the Claimants, including constant breaches and a high level of indebtedness, caused the loss of value in EDEMSA. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 511.\n\n437.\n\nClaimants emphasize that actions on the part of the Respondent effectuated an expropriation, especially as BIT\u2018s do not require an investment\u2018s obliteration as a precondition to indirect expropriation; instead an investor need only show that the state substantially deprived the investment of value. See Claimants\u2018 Reply on the Merits at paragraph 354. Claimants add that loss of legal title is not necessary to establish indirect expropriation. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 339-41.\n\n438.\n\nAccording to Respondents, a substantial deprivation is not enough to constitute expropriation, and according to international law indirect expropriation claims necessitate dispossession or material deprivation, as under Article 5(2) of the Argentina-France BIT. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 493. Furthermore, Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to show that the impairment caused by Respondent\u2018s measure was total, which they contend is necessary to establish expropriation. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 400.\n\n439.\n\nClaimants further maintain their concession rights constitute an integral part of the their investment, and the Pre-Emergency Alterations and Emergency Tariff Measures must be deemed to have repudiated the Concession\u2018s Legal Framework so as to have, in the case of the latter, rendered the Concession Contract largely meaningless and deprived Claimants of their reasonable expectations of economic benefit.44 See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 344-9. In addition, neither the Argentina-France BIT nor international law requires a showing of denial of justice. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Reply on the Merits, at paragraph 26.\n\nClaimants\u2018 legal expert, Professor Dolzer, opines that \"the Argentine State\u2018s radical alteration of the preexisting legal framework upon which Claimants based their investment decisions demonstrates that the Argentine State disregarded its contractual commitments. The Argentine State thereby repudiated its contract with EDEMSA in a manner that effected an indirect expropriation of the relevant contractual rights and of Claimants \u2018 return on their investment, since they had an effect \u2018similar to dispossession with regard to Claimants\u2018 investment.\" Dolzer Expert Report, at paragraph 48.\n\n440.\n\nRespondent instead argues that breaches of the Concession Agreement do not equate to expropriation, and the Claimants cannot cite specific behavior that amounts to expropriation under international law, such as a denial of justice. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 512-14.\n\n441.\n\nClaimants also note the Emergency Tariff Measures not only ensued between 15 January 2002 (date of enactment) thru 30 March 2005 (date of Claimants divestiture), sharply cutting income and an ability to make infrastructural investment, but at the same time these measures also forced EDEMSA to abide fully by its obligations under the Concession Contract, resulting in fines for deficiencies in quality output. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 333.\n\n442.\n\nRespondent\u2018s claim that the Claimants\u2018 decision to make capital reduction, an indebtedness policy, and a decision to withdraw from the concession prove that the Claimants are to be held liable for their damages. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 434.\n\n443.\n\nClaimants take the position that there was no reasonable justification underlying the Emergency Tariff Measures to begin with, much less to maintain such an asymmetrical regime for over three years. The nature, severity, and duration of the Respondent\u2018s measures indicate that an expropriation has taken place. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 334-35.\n\n444.\n\nRespondent replies that they were entirely within their rights to effectuate a devaluation of their currency. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 437-41. The economic situation necessitated the exercise of Respondent\u2018s police power, whereby regulatory measures introduced for public necessity do not constitute expropriation. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 544.\n\n445.\n\nClaimants\u2018 case is that the expropriation was unlawful. It is alleged the Emergency Tariff Measures, being completely disproportionate in relation to its ostensible goals, did not serve a legitimate public purpose, were discriminatory against foreign investors, and were contrary to the Concession Contract, which Claimants press to be a concrete and legally binding specific commitment with respect to their investment. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraphs 355-72. Claimants contend Respondent imposed the pesification and freeze measures for purely political reasons and discriminatory motives, which serves to magnify the sever nature of the measures Claimants were subject to. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial at paragraph 334.\n\n446.\n\nRespondent contends that a finding of bad faith requires a high degree of certainty, and it is necessary to presume that a Government acts regularly and validly, seen in the context of the extraordinary economic circumstances that the authorities of Mendoza and Argentina had to face. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 456. Respondent asserts that the actions taken by Mendoza were lawful and consistent with the circumstances, and there is no evidence of bad faith or discrimination by the Province. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 491, 538.\n\n**C. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES**\n---------------------------\n\n447.\n\nRespondent asserts six affirmative defenses which it claims absolve it from liability. The Tribunal groups these defenses as (i) contractual issues, (ii) double recovery, (iii) Claimants\u2018 consent to the Emergency Tariff Measures, (iv) Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, (v) Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT, and (vi) Necessity under customary international law.\n\n**1. Contractual Issues** ***(*** ***Res Judicata*** **and** ***Litis Pendens*** ***)***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n448.\n\nWith respect to Claimants\u2018 claims based on Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession, Respondent contends that Claimants are attempting to present contractual issues that are foreign to this Tribunal which in most cases are *res judicata* or subject to local remedies. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 205-10.\n\n449.\n\nRespondent argues that half of the pre-emergency measures are barred as *res judicata*, three are subject to *litis pendens* as not having been exhausted at the administrative level, one has been extinguished due to lack of prosecution, and one is simply groundless. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, paragraph 210, footnotes n. 229-231.\n\n450.\n\nWith respect to all pre-emergency claims, Claimants argue that they are not required to exhaust their claims at the local level before seeking adjudication before this Tribunal and that decisions rendered by Argentine courts have no *res judicata* effect on this Tribunal. To this effect, Claimants contend that Respondent\u2018s assertions would result in a \"fundamental Catch-22\" in which Claimants\u2018 treaty rights would be unenforceable at the international level due to the existence of possible local litigation. Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 254.\n\n451.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Parties\u2018 numbering with respect to Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession is not always consistent. Respondent speaks of ten (10) categories in paragraph 210 of its Counter-Memorial, but includes only nine (9) in the relevant footnote references (seeming to omit use of network fees), as opposed to the Claimants\u2018 original organization of seven (7) categories of what they refer to as regulatory abuse in their First Memorial at paragraphs 147 et seq.\n\n452.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, at this point the arguments will be summarized below according to Respondent\u2018s ten categories, although as indicated earlier the Tribunal considers overlap to exist among various iterations resulting in essentially six (6) core groups of claims.\n\n453.\n\n*Item 1. Use of Network Fees*. Respondent asserts that Claimants\u2018 claim relating to the modification of \"Network Use\" fees by way of Resolution 8/98 is \"exclusively contractual\" and that EDEMSA has recognized that the courts of the Province of Mendoza have jurisdiction over such issue. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 730. Respondent contends that EDEMSA filed an administrative claim against Resolution No. 8/98 in 1998, and that EPRE dismissed the claim in May 1999 by way of Resolution No. 73/99. According to Respondent, EPRE concluded that Resolution No. 8/98 was passed due to the \"unavoidable need of regulating the transition between two tariff systems....\"45 Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 740.\n\nRespondent offers no citation for its direct quote of Resolution 73/99.\n\n454.\n\nRespondent further contends that EDEMSA filed an administrative appeal against Resolution 73/99 before the Provincial Executive on 28 May 2000, and that the executive body dismissed the claim by way of Decree 2468 on 22 November 2000. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 747. According to Respondent, who offers no citation to either the claim or dismissal decree, the executive body based its determination on the fact that \"EPRE had legitimately exercised the regulatory powers granted to it and had protected users\u2018 rights through its actions.\" Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 747.\n\n455.\n\nRespondent alleges that EDEMSA later challenged Resolution 8/98 and Resolution 73/99 through an administrative procedural action before the Supreme Court of Mendoza and that judgment was entered on this matter prior to the filing of Claimants\u2018 Memorial.46 Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 748. According to Respondent, this judgment consisted of the issuance by the Court of a \"lapse of action\", which closed the proceedings because, according to Respondent\u2018s witness, Mr. Rodriguez, EDEMSA \"for no reason whatsoever failed to further the proceedings for a term beyond a year....\" Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at n. 803; Witness Statement by Rodriguez at paragraph 16. Mr. Rodriguez notes that the \"Court did not actually determine the merits of the case.\" Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at n. 803; Witness Statement by Rodriguez at paragraph 16. Indeed, Respondent asserts that the closing of the proceedings took place with the admittance of EPRE\u2018s and the State Attorney\u2018s Office\u2018s motion for constructive abandonment. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 749.\n\nEmpresa Distribuidora De Electicidad Medoza S A Edemsa v. Ente Provincial Regulador Electrico Administrative Procedural Action, Supreme Court of Medoza, Dock No. 70715 (2005).\n\n456.\n\nRespondent thus argues that the issue relating to the modification of \"Network Use\" fees is alien to this Tribunal\u2018s jurisdiction because such issue was determined by domestic courts on grounds of EDEMSA\u2018s own negligence. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 751.\n\n457.\n\n*Item 2. Town of Polvaredas*. Respondent further alleges that EDEMSA filed an Appeal for Revocation against EPRE\u2018s decision to incorporate the town of Polvaredas into the concession area, and that such claim was denied by way of EPRE Resolution No. 183/99. According to Respondent, the denial was based on the fact that power generation distribution in areas isolated from the Province of Mendoza is a public service and therefore part of EDEMSA\u2018s concession area.47 Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 754.\n\nRespondent cites to Regulatory Framework, Art. 3 (A RA 14) and Regulatory Decree No. 196/98, Art. 2 (A RA 24).\n\n458.\n\nThe Parties agree that EDEMSA challenged Resolution No. 183/99 before the Supreme Court of Mendoza on 23 May 2002. See Claimant\u2018s Memorial at paragraph 161; Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 756. Respondent argues that the court denied EDEMSA\u2018s claim on 25 November 2008.48 Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 756.\n\n\"EDEMSA C/ EPRE S./APA\", SCJM [Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza], Docket Number No. 74,105 (2008) (AL RA 146).\n\n459.\n\n*Item 3. Scattered Market*. Respondent further contends that decisions by the Supreme Court of Mendoza with respect to the creation of the Scattered Market render the analogous claims in this proceeding alien to this Tribunal. Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial at paragraph 767.\n\n460.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants challenged Decree No. 2379/99, which created the Scattered Market, before the Supreme Court of Mendoza and that the Court denied this challenge on 19 October 2004.49 According to Respondent, the Court held that users comprised in the Scattered Market were already included in the area of exclusivity defined in the concession. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 762.\n\n\"Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad de Mendoza -EDEMSA- c/ Gob. de la Provincia s/ acc. de inc.\", SCJM, Docket File No. 68,711 (2004) (AL RA 147).\n\n461.\n\nRespondent also alleges that EDEMSA challenged EPRE Resolution No. 192/03, which \"established the procedures for quality control in the Collective Scattered Electrical Market Stage I.\"50 Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 764. According to Respondent, in a decision dated 6 April 2005, the Supreme Court of Mendoza upheld its 19 October 2004 decision while holding that the Executive Power\u2018s ability to reformulate service quality requirements through renegotiation does not preclude its regulation of technical aspects of the provision of the public service. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at 765.\n\n\"Empresa Distribuidora de Electricidad de Mendoza -EDEMSA- c/ EPRE s/ acc. de inc.\", SCJM, Docket No. 77,145 (2005) (AL RA 148).\n\n462.\n\n*Item 4. Optional T-2 Tariff*. Respondent claims that Claimants\u2018 allegations regarding the optional T-2 are *res judicata* because such allegations are contractual matters that have already been reviewed at a local venue. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 775. In support of this contention, Respondent refers to a judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Justice of the Province of Mendoza on 6 August 2008.51 Respondent details the enactment of the T-2 tariff and asserts that analysis of the regulation demonstrate that the values at stake and the need to protect users justify the Governor\u2018s exercise of its regulatory capacity. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 774.\n\n\"Emprea Distribuidora de Electricidad de Mza. S.A. -EDEMSA- c/Gobierno de la Provincia de Mendoza y Ot. S/ APA\", Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza, Docket No. 69,943 (2008), (AL AR 149).\n\n463.\n\n*Item 5. Nihuil IV Claim I.* Claimants assert that on 20 November 2002, they filed a claim with the Supreme Court of Justice of Mendoza regarding Respondent\u2018s alleged failure to reimburse Claimants for the purchase of more expensive power from the hydroelectric plant Nihuil IV between February and June 2000. Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial at paragraph 777. Claimants further argue that after the provincial government opposed Claimants\u2018 claim, the court reversed its decision to hear the claim on the grounds that EDEMSA had not exhausted the administrative procedure, and that this constituted a denial of justice. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 779, 782.\n\n464.\n\nIn response, Respondent argues that this decision shows that the court \"tackled the matter\" and that in order to file a claim in accordance with the Code of Administrative Procedure for the Province of Mendoza, Claimants must show that there has been a final administrative decision that is *res judicata*, or \"tacit denial.\" According to Respondent, Claimants failed to demonstrate both the existence of a decision that was *res judicata* and \"tacit denial.\" Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 781-82.\n\n465.\n\nRespondent thus claims that Claimants cannot make an assertion in the present proceedings that there was a denial of justice because it was only through Claimants\u2018 own negligence that the judicial proceeding in Mendoza was unavailable. Respondent argues that Claimants\u2018 decision to pursue its claim in the Supreme Court of Justice of the Province of Mendoza was misguided, as it is the highest court within the judicial system and only hears matters that have a final judgment passed by the highest relevant tribunal. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 783-84.\n\n466.\n\n*Item 6 - Nihuil IV Claim II.* With respect to Claimants\u2018 Nihuil IV claim for the period from August through June 2001, Respondent again argues that Claimants cannot assert that they were denied justice because the court rightly ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to review an interim review. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 786-88.\n\n467.\n\n*Item 7. Lack of payment of subsidies and street lighting services.* Respondent further argues that Claimant\u2018s claim concerning the Government of Mendoza\u2018s failure to pay the amounts due to EDEMSA for subsidies and street lighting services is unsubstantiated. Respondent\u2018 s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 789-90. Moreover, Respondent contends, Claimants failed to file the Supreme Court\u2018s judgment that Claimants argue limited their rights.\n\n468.\n\n*Item 8. Modification of the Subsidy System*. Respondent asserts that Claimants filed an action before the Provincial Supreme Court, for which Claimants failed to account in their Memorial, challenging a series of resolutions in opposition to the provisions in the agreement to subsidize electrical consumption to agriculture users for irrigation purposes. According to Respondent, such action opposed the resolutions that \"subtract from the declared amounts any monies obtained in excess of the \u2018Distributor Payment Tariff\u2018 amount.\" Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 791, 796.\n\n469.\n\nRespondent contends that the Supreme Court of Mendoza dismissed Claimants\u2018 action, ordering EPRE to implement any measure necessary to reimburse users for amounts collected by EDEMSA in excess of the \"Distributor Payment Tariff.\" Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 797. As such, Respondent argues that the subsidies issue is foreign to this Tribunal \"given that its nature is essentially contractual and it has already been determined by the domestic courts.\" Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at 798.\n\n470.\n\n*Item 9. Stricter Conditions Regarding Quality of Service.* Respondent also assert that Claimants filed, but failed to reference in their Memorial, a claim before the Provincial Supreme Court challenging Provincial Law No. 6856, which Claimants argue established new procedures to users to bring claims against EDEMSA for failures in the electricity distribution system. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 800-801.\n\n471.\n\nRespondent contends that the Provincial Supreme Court dismissed this claim on 10 August 2005 on grounds that the law was constitutional and did not damage or create a conflict with respect to EDEMSA\u2018s interest.52 Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 802. Thus, Respondent argues that Claimants have no basis in the present proceeding to claim that Provincial Law No. 6856 is unconstitutional or arbitrary. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 803.\n\n\"E.D.E.M.S.A. v. Province of Mendoza on Unconstitutionality Action,\" Supreme Court of Mendoza, Docket No. 70905 (2005).\n\n472.\n\n*Item 10. Quasi-Currency*. With respect to Claimants\u2018 claim regarding the Government of Mendoza\u2018s payment to EDEMSA using bonds (\"quasi-currency\"), Respondent alleges that such claim is groundless because the bonds could be used as payment of Provincial obligations and would mature in 2003 when their nominal value would be paid. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 804-07. Earlier, at paragraph 210, Respondent mentions lack of \"currentness\" for this item, but without further explanation.\n\n**2. Double Recovery**\n----------------------\n\n473.\n\nAs an additional defense, Respondent argues that adjudication of Claimants\u2018 claims by this Tribunal would result in a double recovery. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 211. Respondent notes that the Tribunal addressed this issue in its Decision on Jurisdiction by stating that \"To the extent that the judicial process in Mendoza (pursuant to the forum selection clause) results in Claimants receiving compensation for their loss, recovery under the French and Luxemburg investment treaties would likely be barred.\" Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 211; Decision on Jurisdiction at paragraphs 219-20. (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23).\n\n474.\n\nRespondent contends that Annex II to the Letter of Understanding, as of 31 February 2005, demonstrates that EDEMSA and the Government of Mendoza agreed on a procedure to honor the outstanding payments due to EDEMSA with respect to the purchase of energy from Nihuil IV. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 785, 788.\n\n475.\n\nRespondent further argues that EDEMSA and the Government of Mendoza included the issue of the Agriculture Irrigation subsidies into their contractual renegotiation agreement.53 Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 799.\n\nIn support, Respondent cites to Annex II to the Supplementary Memorandum to the Letter of Understanding: Reciprocal Debits and Credits, Art. 2 (Annex AR No. 170)\n\n476.\n\nClaimants do not address the issue of double recovery in their pleadings.\n\n**3. Consent to Emergency Tariff Measures**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n477.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants consented to the National and Provincial Emergency Laws, including the declaration of public emergency, the provisions that invalidated the mechanisms of adjustment or indexation of prices in foreign currency, and the Executive Power authorization to renegotiate the public service contracts. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 426-34; Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 160-68; Respondent\u2018 s Post Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraphs 154-59.\n\n478.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants\u2018 experts acknowledge that Claimants consented to the Emergency Measures. See Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraphs 154-56. For example, Respondent contends that Mr. Nitrosso acknowledged that both parties recognized that the readjustment of the electrical framework was necessary in light of the emergency and wished to mitigate the effects on users. *Id*. at paragraph 154; Hearing on the Merits, Day 5, Tuesday 3 November 2009, p. 1332 (lines 9 to 17), statement by Bruno Nitrosso, English transcript.\n\n479.\n\nIn response, Claimants assert that they did not consent to the Emergency Measures. See Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraphs 64-66. Rather, Claimants contend that they entered into amicable negotiations with Argentina precisely because they objected to the Emergency Measures. *Id.* at paragraph 64. Claimants further demonstrate that Memorandum No. 1 states that \"[T]he adoption of transitional measures in no way indicates assignment or waiver of rights or actions which may correspond to the Distributor in accordance with law, or recognition by the Provincial State of any right by virtue of their implementation.\" *Id.* at paragraph 65; Exhibit A RA 155, Art. 5. Lastly, Claimants content that their experts in no way accepted that the Emergency Measures were necessary. See Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at 66.\n\n**4. Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Treaty Framework**\n-----------------------\n\n480.\n\nRespondent invokes Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT as an affirmative defense, asserting that this provision expressly authorizes measures necessary for the maintenance of public order and thus precludes international responsibility. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 616-9.\n\n481.\n\nArticle 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT provides:\n\nSin perjuicio de las medidas necesarias para el mantenimiento del orden p\u00fablico, las inversiones gozar\u00e1n de una seguridad y protecci\u00f3n permanentes, con exclusi\u00f3n de toda medida injustificada o discriminatoria que pudiera obstaculizar de hecho o de derecho, su gesti\u00f3n, mantenimiento, uso, goce o liquidaci\u00f3n.\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\nWithout prejudice to measures necessary to maintain public order, investments shall enjoy permanent security and protection, to the exclusion of any unjustified or discriminatory measure which could impede in fact or in law its management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or liquidation.\n\n**b) Parties' Contentions**\n---------------------------\n\n482.\n\nRespondent argues that Article 3(2) excuses Respondent\u2018s conduct because the emergency measures enacted by the Argentine Republic were necessary to maintain public order. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 618; Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 663-69; Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraphs 281-83; Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraphs 142-45. According to Respondent, the \"measures necessary principally for the maintenance of public order include those aimed at ensuring internal safety, in the face of situations such as violent internal insurrections, riots, lootings and crimes, extended social tension, or the possibility that the fundamental order be disintegrated and the government lose effective control over the State\u2018s territory.\" See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 617.\n\n483.\n\nIn response, Claimants principally argue that Article 3(2) is inapplicable to these proceedings. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 631; Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraph 141; Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraph 49.\n\n**5. Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Treaty Framework**\n-----------------------\n\n484.\n\nRespondent further argues the emergency defense under Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT, which provides:\n\nLos inversores de una Parte Contratante cuyas inversiones hubiesen sufrido p\u00e9rdidas a causa de una guerra o de cualquier otro conflicto armado, revoluci\u00f3n, estado de emergencia nacional o rebeli\u00f3n ocurrido en el territorio o en la zona mar\u00edtima de la otra Parte Contratante, recibir\u00e1n de esta \u00faltima un tratamiento no menos favorable que el acordado a sus propios inversores o a los de la Naci\u00f3n m\u00e1s favorecida.\n\nIn the French version, Article 5(3) states:\n\nLes investisseurs de l\u2018une des Parties contractantes dont les investissements auront subi des pertes dues \u00e0 la guerre ou \u00e0 tout autre conflit arm\u00e9, r\u00e9volution, \u00e9tat d\u2018 urgence national ou r\u00e9volte survenu sur le territoire ou dans la zone maritime de l\u2018 autre Partie contractante, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieront, de la part de cette derni\u00e8re, d\u2018un traitement non moins favorable que celui accord\u00e9 \u00e0 ses propres investisseurs ou \u00e0 ceux de la nation la plus favoris\u00e9e.\n\nIn English, the provision reads:\n\nInvestors of one Contracting Party whose investments have suffered losses owing to war or any other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, or rebellion occurring in the territory or in the maritime zone of the other Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party treatment no less favorable than that granted to its own investors or to those of the most favored Nation.\n\n**b) Parties' Contentions**\n---------------------------\n\n485.\n\nRespondent argues that Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT legitimizes the actions of the government of Argentina because Claimants\u2018 injuries were the result of a state of national emergency and Claimants were treated no less favorably than were other investors, both foreign and domestic. See Respondent Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 248-50. According to Respondent, the purpose of Article 5(3) \"is to establish a minimum standard of protection in the face of a special situation, such as cases of national emergency.\" *Id.* at paragraph 252. \"In such cases,\" Respondent explains, \"the State is only compelled to afford no less favourable treatment than that accorded to other investors in relation to the measures it adopts... without entailing a particular obligation to compensate foreign investors for the events occurred.\"54*Id.*\n\nIn support of its defense, Respondent cites to *L.E.S.I S.p.A. and Astaldi S.p.A. v. Algeria*, in which the tribunal upheld the emergency defense pursuant to an emergency situations provision that was identical to Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT. See Respondent\u2018 Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 254; *L.E.S.I. S.p.A. and ASTALDI S.p.A. v. Republic of Algeria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/03, Award of 12 November 2008, at paragraph 18 (LA AR 190).\n\n486.\n\nRespondent contends that Article 5(3) is *lex specialis*, intended to override the remainder of the Treaty in times of national emergency. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 256. According to Respondent, \"the main purpose of BITs is to rule in normal situations and do not particularly address exceptional situations.\" *Id.* at paragraph 258.\n\n487.\n\nWhile the Argentina-France BIT does not define emergency,55 Respondent asserts that Article 5(3) contemplates \"a dangerous or disastrous situation (regardless of the cause) which calls for immediate action at a national level.\" See Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial at paragraphs 260-61. Respondent argues that a literal interpretation of Article 5(3) necessarily involves national emergencies caused by \"[e]conomic, financial social or institutional situations....\" *Id.* at paragraph 261. Respondent claims that Article 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties further supports this interpretation, by stipulating that supplementary means of interpretation, such as that put forth by Claimants, may only be sought in order to determine the meaning when a literal interpretation yields an ambiguous or absurd result. *Id.* at paragraph 263. According to Respondent, a literal interpretation of 5(3) includes national emergencies caused by economic crises.\n\nArticle 5(3) considers the \"losses as a result of war or any other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency or uprising.\" See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 259.\n\n488.\n\nIn contrast, Respondent contends that the President of France\u2018s message supports an interpretation that includes national emergencies caused by economic turmoil. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 263-66. In Respondent\u2018s view, as the President of France stated that Article 5(3) is applicable in emergencies caused by \"political events,\" such as strikes, the provision must also apply to the Argentine situation, which included political and financial disorder. *Id.*\n\n489.\n\nRespondent further argues that Article 5(3) affords Argentina \"a wide \u2018margin of appreciation\u2018 for the adoption of measures in times of national emergency or like situations.\"56 See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 270-74.\n\nRespondent cites to *Continental Casualty v. Argentina*, in which the tribunal observed that \"a significant margin of appreciation [must be afforded] for the State applying the particular measure: a time of grave crisis is not the time for nice judgments, particularly when examined by others with disadvantage of hindsight.\" See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 270; *Continental Casualty*, at paragraph 181 (footnote omitted). In further support, Respondent also refers to Articles 8 to 11 and 15 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which permits States to adopt emergency measures \"to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation\" and \"necessary in a democratic society.\" *Id.* at paragraph 272. Respondent further highlights the tribunal \u2018s language in *Metalpar v. Argentina*, which reads, in part:  \n The authorities of the different countries must take very different measures on a daily basis. Except in obvious situations, at the time or even some time later, it is extremely difficult to determine whether the measures adopted were the best. In the instant case, trying to determine in the abstract whether the actions adopted by Argentina during the crisis were optimal is a difficult or impossible task, especially if intending to derive economic consequences from the conclusion reached.  \n*Metalpar S.A. and Buen Aire S.A. v. Argentine Republic*. ICSID Case No. ARB/03/05, Award of 6 June 2008, at paragraph 198 (LA AR 45).\n\n490.\n\nRespondent further argues that Article 5(3) is analogous to Article XI of the U.S.-Argentina BIT, which according to Respondent the *LG&E57* and *Continental Casualty58* tribunals interpreted as relieving Argentina of liability for particular measures enacted during the economic turmoil. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 131-37.\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp. et al. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1 (Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006), at paragraph 259.\n\n*Continental Casualty Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9 (Award of 5 September 2008), at paragraph 250\n\n491.\n\nIn response, Claimants seek support from the *Enron, Sempra,* and *CMS Gas,* which rejected the argument proposed by Respondent. See Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraph 136. Moreover, Claimants assert that Article 5(3) \"bears no resemblance whatsoever to Article XI, either textually or functionally.\" Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraph 137.\n\n492.\n\nLastly, Respondent concludes that the emergency measures were adopted in order to abate a national emergency, and that Claimants were not afforded less favorable treatment than that shown to other domestic or foreign investors. See Respondent Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 276-78, 282. Thus, according to Respondent, Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT precludes Respondent\u2018s liability with respect to Claimants\u2018 injury.\n\n**6. State of Necessity under Customary International Law**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Overview**\n---------------\n\n493.\n\nRespondent argues the circumstances surrounding the late 2001 economic turmoil in Argentina satisfy the elements of the \"State of Necessity Defense\" requiring claims based on the Emergency Measures to be dismissed. According to Respondent, where a host state has no other means of preserving an essential interest threatened by a grave and imminent peril, it may adopt conduct which would otherwise violate duties under international conventions. If sustained, the defense would thus excuse violation of such treaty obligations. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 620 et seq.\n\n494.\n\nAlthough suggesting that the State of Necessity Defense is historically controversial (Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 541), in particular with respect to cases involving investment treaties (Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraphs 69-75), Claimants main argument is that Respondent has not demonstrated that the defense applies under the facts of this arbitration.\n\n495.\n\nAs discussed below, the Parties\u2018 arguments about the matter take as their focal point the articulation of the defense found in Article 25 of the 2001 International Law Commission\u2018s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, drafted by the United Nations body established to \"promote the progressive development of international law and its codification.\" United Nations General Assembly Resolution, A-RES-174(II) (21 November 1947). Both sides appear to accept that ILC Article 25 reflects the relevant standards with respect to this defense.\n\n496.\n\nILC Article 25 provides as follows:\n\nNecessity\n\n1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:\n\n(a) is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and\n\n(b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.\n\n2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:\n\n(a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or\n\n(b) the State has contributed to the situation of necessity.\n\n497.\n\nThe Parties have also addressed ILC Article 27 which provides as follows:\n\nThe invocation of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness in accordance with this Chapter [Chapter V: Circumstances Precluding Wrongfulness] is without prejudice to:\n\n(a) compliance with the obligation in question, if and to the extent that the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer exists;\n\n(b) the question of compensation for any material loss caused by the act in question.\n\n498.\n\nWhile contending that the ILC Articles are \"not a binding document for any State\" Respondent nevertheless seems to accept that \"it reflects customary rules in most of its articles.\" (Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, paragraph 635). Moreover, Respondent asserts that the defense applies within the context of investment treaty disputes. See Respondent\u2018 s Rejoinder at paragraph 670.\n\n499.\n\nThe Parties\u2018 main disagreement relates to the way ILC Article 25 applies in the present case. Claimants contend that the Respondent has the burden of establishing that all of the elements of ILC Article 25 have been met. In this respect, Claimants cite the principle of *ei incumbit probatio qui dicit non qui negat* : the burden of proof lies with the asserting party, not the denying one. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 483-84.\n\n500.\n\nRespondent asserts that it has established the elements of the State of Necessity Defense, and consequently, the burden has shifted to Claimants to refute the defense. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 631.\n\n501.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute the exceptionality of the State of Necessity defense as set forth in ILC Article 25. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 672; and Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 542. Respondent\u2018s position is that the circumstances surrounding the enactment of the Emergency Measures amounted to an unprecedented situation that satisfies the elements of the State of Necessity defense. See Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial at paragraphs 634-35; Rejoinder at paragraph 672. Claimants\u2018 position is that Respondent has not satisfied the elements of the State of Necessity defense. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 548.\n\n502.\n\nRespondent asserts that the *LG&E* tribunal found that (i) Argentina did not contribute to the situation of necessity, (ii) the Emergency Measures were the only way to protect an essential interest, (iii) there was no serious impact on the essential interests of the community as a whole, the state or states to whom obligations exist, nor on the fulfillment of any *jus cogens* obligation, and (iv) there was neither discriminatory nor inequitable treatment of foreign investors. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 634. Respondent also cites to the *Continental Casualty* in support of its contentions with respect to the State of Necessity defense.\n\n503.\n\nClaimants\u2018 expert Professor Dolzer opines that the *LG&E* and *Continental Casualty* cases are wholly inapplicable here because the controlling provision in those cases was Article XI of the BIT executed between the U.S. and Argentina, signed on 14 November 1991 and effective since 20 October 1994. See Dolzer Supplementary Expert Report at paragraph 95. According to Professor Dolzer, neither the Treaty nor the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT contains a clause that would be analogous to Article XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT. See Dolzer Supplementary Expert Report at paragraph 95.\n\n504.\n\nArticle XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT provides that that treaty \"shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the Protection of its own essential security interests.\" Claimants argue that this standard is different from that one set forth in ILC Article 25, and that the *LG&E* and *Continental Casualty* tribunals found Argentina to have satisfied necessity pursuant to Article XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT and not necessity under customary international law. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 545. According to Claimants, five out of seven tribunals that have reviewed Argentina\u2018s State of Necessity defense against facts similar to those in this proceeding ruled that Respondent failed to meet the elements of ILC Article 25. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 544 (citing to *CMS Gas*, *Enron*, *Sempra*, *BG Group*, and *National Grid*).\n\n505.\n\nIn Respondent\u2018s view, Article XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT evidences centuries-old practice with respect to necessity, suggesting that the provision is an embodiment of international law. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 671. Although it concedes that the *LG&E* and *Continental Casualty* tribunals applied the necessity doctrine as defined in the applicable treaty rather than customary international law, Respondent asserts that those tribunals analyzed ILC Article 25 in applying Article XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 676.\n\n506.\n\nRespondent asserts that the arbitral awards that Claimants cite do not represent a uniform position on the matter, and that \"international case law, as auxiliary means, may not be invoked to set aside principles ruling on treaty law and international liability.\" See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 625. Respondent adds that, whereas the *BG Group* and *National Grid* awards only discuss the State of Necessity defense in a few paragraphs, the *Continental Casualty* award provides a much more thorough and extensive review of the matter. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 675.\n\n507.\n\nAccording to Respondent, international case law and legal commentaries consider economic crises to fall within the scope of the State of Necessity defense. It follows that, for purposes of legitimate self-defense or self-conservation, states are excused from treaty obligations if observing such would prove to be self-destructive. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 622-631 (citing to inter alia the 17th-century case of Affaire du Neptune, as well as the early 20th-century cases of *French Company of* *Venezuelan Railroads*, the *Russian Indemnity Case*, *Dickson Car Wheel Co*., *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9* *Commerciale de Belgique,* and finally the more recent case of *Gabc\u00edkovo - Nagymaros* *(Hungary/Slovakia)*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports, 1997).\n\n508.\n\nIn response, Claimants contend that most of the cases cited by Respondent involve noninvestment contexts and do not find economic conditions as grounds for sustaining the defense. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 547.\n\n509.\n\nIn Claimants\u2018 view, ILC Article 25 presupposes five basic conditions that must be cumulatively satisfied: (i) that an \"essential interest\" of the state which is the author of the act conflicting with one of its obligations was at stake; (ii) that this interest must have been threatened by a \"grave and imminent peril\"; (iii) that the act must have been the only means of safeguarding that interest; (iv) that the act must not have seriously impaired an essential interest of the state towards which the obligation existed; and (v) that the state which is the author of the act must not have contributed to the occurrence of the state of necessity. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 543, citing to *Gabc\u00edkovo - Nagymaros*.\n\n510.\n\nClaimants\u2018 expert, Professor Dolzer, argues that these rules must be construed in a strict and narrow manner for they operate as a limitation to the fundamental international legal principle of *pacta sunt servanda*. See Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 71. Claimants further cite to comment 2 of ILC Article 25, which provides that \"necessity will only rarely be available to excuse non-performance of an obligation and... it is subject to strict limitation to safeguard against possible abuse.\" See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 550.\n\n511.\n\nProfessor Dolzer adds that the fact that ILC Article 25 is formulated in the negative reflects the drafters\u2018 intent to substantially limit the application of the State of Necessity defense. See Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 72; see also, Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 551-53 (citing *to Gabc\u00edkovo - Nagymaros, National Grid, Enron, Sempra*, *CMS Gas*, and *BG Group*). Professor Dolzer concludes that \"[g]iven the strict interpretation of the rules on necessity, it would not be persuasive to argue that the rule must be construed broadly so that its application is not unduly narrowed and hindered in its operation.\" See Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 73.\n\n512.\n\nAdditionally, Professor Dolzer opines that the applicability of the rules of the State of Necessity defense must be assessed in specific relation to the particular measures which form the subject of this proceeding. See Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 74. Relying on *Continental Casualty*, Claimants argue that the Emergency Tariff Measures must have been of actual necessity. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 554.\n\n513.\n\nClaimants also contend that Respondent provides no evidence that the Emergency Laws were of \"actual necessity.\" According to Claimants, Respondent sidesteps this requirement by jumping from the proposition that the failure of Argentina to take any action would have been socially detrimental, to the conclusion that the Emergency Laws were only to safeguard essential interests. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 555. Claimants\u2018 expert, Professor Dolzer, supports the contention that whether or not the general policies adopted by Argentina were appropriate does not answer the question as to whether the specific measures that affected Claimants met the strict standards of the State of Necessity defense. See Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 74.\n\n514.\n\nClaimants further argue that Respondent is not the sole judge of whether the conditions underlying a State of Necessity defense have been satisfied. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 556. Claimants\u2018 expert, Professor Dolzer, opines that, if the State of Necessity defense were self-judging, \"then the exception \" that is, \u2018necessity\u2018 \" would swallow the rule....\" See Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 75.\n\n**b) Essential Interest**\n-------------------------\n\n515.\n\nAccording to Respondent, a government can rely on the State of Necessity defense to preserve the very existence of the state and its people in times of public emergencies, including those of an economic nature. Respondent asserts that the economic turmoil threatened the very existence of Argentina and its public order, and thus, the element requiring an essential interest to be at stake is satisfied. See Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial at paragraph 663.\n\n516.\n\nRespondent contends that the essential interest at stake was the survival of the Argentine state, public order, the viability of the economy, the prevention of hyperinflations, and the personal as well as property rights and obligations of the general public. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraph 148. Respondent\u2018s economic experts, Messrs. Frenkel and Damill, opine that the abrogation of the Convertibility Law and the enactment of the Emergency Tariff Measures were aimed at halting increases in levels of poverty and hyperinflation. See Frenkel and Damill Expert Report at paragraph 191.\n\n517.\n\nIn response, Claimants argue that Respondent has failed to establish that an essential interest was at stake. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 576, 586. Claimants cite to comment 2 of ILC Article 25, which provides that \"[necessity] arises where there is an irreconcilable conflict, between an essential interest on the one hand and an obligation of the State invoking necessity on the other.\" See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 576.\n\n518.\n\nAccording to Claimants\u2018 expert, Professor Dolzer, \"essential interest\" is not a term defined in the U.N. ILC Articles but is an element of the State of Necessity defense that requires a thorough review of the facts. See Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 78. Professor Dolzer opines that the traditional view of the State of Necessity defense \"assumed that the very existence of the State and its people and the physical safety of the population had to be protected,\" and thus, \"[i]nterests similar in nature and magnitude would also be covered.\" See Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 79. In Professor Dolzer\u2018s view, \"[w]hile the situation was grave in Argentina at the end of 2001 and the political circumstances unusual, it is difficult to see that an interest of this particular kind and gravity existed.\" Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 79.\n\n519.\n\nClaimants contend that the facts of this case confirm Professor Dolzer\u2018s conclusion. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 578. First, Claimants contend that the ineffectiveness of the measures implemented in safeguarding the stated interests resulted in a lack of proportionality that shows there was no irreconcilable conflict between the objectives of protecting the poor and avoiding hyperinflation, on the one hand, and complying with international treaty obligations on the other. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 578 and 580. In this respect, Claimants\u2018 expert, Professor Arriazu, argues that the measures \"not only do not have any sustainable macroeconomic justification, they are also not economically linked, in their means-end relationship, to the economic crisis.\" See Arriazu Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 5.\n\n520.\n\nIn response, Respondent asserts that the protection of indigent classes and the prevention of hyperinflation are not the only two essential interests which were at stake, and suggests that it is incorrect to assume that, just because two interests were served ineffectively, that the other interests were ineffectively served as well. See Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraph 148.\n\n521.\n\nSecond, Claimants contend that Argentina is a country accustomed to living under economic crises for over the course of its history has cumulatively been in a state of emergency for a longer period of time than in a state of non-emergency. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 581 (citing to *LG&E*). Thus, that the economic turmoil must be viewed through such prism. *Id.* Claimants argue that while it is true that poverty rates and certain macroeconomics indices of Argentina rose sharply, the entirety of the economical, political and social incidents attendant to the crisis occurred within the framework of the Argentine Constitution. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 581. There was no *coup d' etat* or institutional breakdown, no foreign invasion, civil war, nor other scenario which would warrant finding that an essential interest relating to the protection of the fabric of the state was at issue.\n\n522.\n\nClaimants assert that the implications of Argentina\u2018s arguments should also be considered, for if the mere existence of a severe economic crisis or of a high level of poverty were by themselves sufficient to constitute an essential interest for purposes of the State of Necessity defense, there would be numerous countries in the world that would subsist in a quasi-permanent state of necessity. According to Claimants, the exceptional nature of the rule of necessity would consequently be degraded to a generic opt-out mechanism for countries to circumvent their international treaty obligations, since then every country with a risk of hyperinflation or other severe macroeconomic maladjustment as well as every country with a poverty level higher than 40% would be exempted from international treaty obligations. Claimants thus argue that it is unreasonable to propose that sovereigns with a high country risk must be considered, almost by definition, to be in a state of necessity. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 582.\n\n523.\n\nClaimants assert that the other tribunals\u2018 awards, which have found Argentina\u2018s policy decisions to not have been tailored \"to safeguard an essential interest,\" demonstrate a consensus that finding the conditions in Argentina to have been \"severe\" is insufficient to hold that a state of necessity existed, or to shield Argentina from liability for its treaty violations. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 583-84 (citing to *Enron*, *Sempra*, and *CMS Gas*).\n\n524.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent completely ignores these decisions. Instead, Respondent relies on *LG&E* and *Continental Casualty*, which found in favor of necessity only on grounds of Article XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT, a provision with no analogue in the Argentina-France BIT. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 585. With respect to *Metalpar*, Claimants argue that the award did not reach the State of Necessity defense. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 585 (citing to *Metalpar S.A. and Buen Aire S.A. v. the Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/5).\n\n**c) \"Grave and Imminent Peril\"**\n---------------------------------\n\n525.\n\nClaimants further contend that the State of Necessity defense must fail on grounds that there was no grave and imminent peril. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 587 and 591. Claimants cite to comment 15 of ILC Article 25, which provides that the peril must be \"objectively established and not merely apprehended as possible,\" and \"in addition to being grave, [it] has to be imminent in the sense of proximate.\"\n\n526.\n\nAlthough Claimants concede that the Argentine Economic Turmoil was profound, they contend that the survival of the state was never threatened and that there was never a significant institutional rupture, such as disintegration of the rule of law or of the constitutional order, that could have caused a state of ungovernability or anarchy. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 588. Claimants argue that while there was an unusual succession of Presidents in a short time span in early 2002, such succession was done entirely in conformity with relevant constitutional strictures. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 588.\n\n527.\n\nIn this respect, Claimants\u2018 legal expert, Professor Dolzer, concludes that \"[w]hile the situation was grave in Argentina at the end of 2001 and the political circumstances unusual, it is difficult to see that an interest of this particular kind and gravity existed.\" See Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 79. Claimants back this view by contending that other tribunals have confirmed the lack of a grave and imminent peril. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 589-90 (citing to *Enron*, *Sempra*, and *CMS Gas*).\n\n528.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Professor Dolzer\u2018s conclusion is not supported by authority other than the *CMS Gas*, *Enron*, and *Sempra* awards. Conversely, Argentina bases its assertions on the severity of Argentine Economic Turmoil, which is supported by evidence in addition to international decisions, including newspaper articles as well as reports by the U.N. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 678-79.\n\n529.\n\nRespondent argues that life, health, liberty and security of individuals, as well as the institutional continuity of the state, were seriously at risk\"social unrest claimed the lives of several and a wave of lootings, kidnappings and vandalizing ensued, levels of unemployment and poverty sharply increased, and healthcare services experienced dire shortages in medicine resulting in the outbreak of diseases such as yellow fever, dengue, malaria, and tuberculosis. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 679.\n\n**d) The \"Only Way\" to Safeguard Essential Interests**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n530.\n\nRespondent asserts that enacting emergency measures was the only way to safeguard Argentina and its people\u2018s essential interests from a serious or imminent danger. It is Respondent\u2018s position that the enactment of the Emergency Laws, which mandated the renegotiation of public utilities agreements, including the Concession Contract, was necessary at both federal and provincial levels. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 647.\n\n531.\n\nRespondent\u2018s expert, Professor Roubini, argues that Argentina attempted to implement other measures to overcome the economic turmoil. Many of the measures were recommended by international loan institutions, but proved insufficient. See Roubini Expert Report at paragraph 23.\n\n532.\n\nRespondent cites to newspaper editorials authored by economists Paul Krugman and Michael Mussa to assert that the cause of the economic turmoil was the fact that much of Argentina\u2018s private debt is indexed to the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the only solution was the issuance of a decree cancelling said indexation. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 649-50 and 655.\n\n533.\n\nRespondent\u2018s experts, Messrs. Frenkel and Damill, opine that the Emergency Laws were a proportionate and reasonable solution to the economic turmoil. According to Messrs. Frenkel and Damill, the evolution of the Argentine economy since the enactment of the Emergency Laws supports this conclusion. See Frenkel and Damill Expert Report at paragraph 184. Messrs. Frenkel and Damill further argue that the fact that the level of economic activity in Argentina ceased to fall as of the second quarter of 2002 suggests a trend of recovery. See Frenkel and Damill Expert Report at paragraph 184.\n\n534.\n\nRespondent\u2018s expert, Ms. de Riz, opines that the economic turmoil impoverished the people of Argentina due to budgetary and financial limitations suffered by the government. See de Riz Expert Report at paragraphs 25-30. Respondent\u2018s expert, Professor Roubini, agrees, stating that the enactment of the Emergency Laws became necessary and mandatory after the Argentine peso collapsed. See Roubini Expert Report at paragraphs 37-42.\n\n535.\n\nRespondent asserts that other tribunals have acknowledged that Argentina was in a situation of necessity and that the enactment of the Emergency Laws was the only way to address the economic turmoil. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 65762 (citing to *LG&E*, *Continental Casualty*, and *Metalpar*).\n\n536.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent has failed to prove that the enactment of the Emergency Laws was the only way to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 557. Claimants contend that Respondent not only misstates the relevant facts but also merely presents a general assertion regarding this particular element of the State of Necessity defense. Thus, Respondent fails to explain how the enactment of the Emergency Laws constituted the only way to protect social and political stability. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 557.\n\n537.\n\nClaimants contend that Respondent\u2018s reliance on *LG&E* to assert that an \"economic recovery package\" was the only means to respond to the economic turmoil is misplaced because there is a distinction to be made between the specific tariff measures which affected the Claimants\u2018 investment\"the Emergency Laws\"and macroeconomic measures\"such as the repeal of the Convertibility Law as well as the freezing of bank deposits. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 557, 563.\n\n538.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the relevant issue is not whether it was necessary for Respondent to adopt a general economic recovery package as the only way to respond to the economic turmoil, nor whether any particular macroeconomic measure constituted the only means. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 563, 566. Rather, Claimants contend the issue is whether the enactment of the specific measures which affected the legal framework, especially the provisions related to tariffs, were the only way to safeguard Argentina\u2018s social and political stability. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 564. Furthermore, Respondent\u2018s reliance on *Continental Casualty* to assert that devaluating the Argentine peso was the only means available to Argentina is flawed. In Claimants\u2018 view, the relevant question is whether the enactment of the Emergency Laws, not devaluation of the peso, constituted the only way. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at footnote 877.\n\n539.\n\nClaimants\u2018 expert, Professor Arriazu, opines that \"Argentina and its experts refer generally to \u2018the measures adopted during the economic crisis\u2018 without making an analytical distinction between the various macroeconomic measures of a general nature, and the narrower, more specific ones of which EDEMSA was a victim.\" See Arriazu Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 46.\n\n540.\n\nRespondent asserts that such a distinction is \"confusing and irrelevant since what Claimants refer to as specific measures involve only general emergency measures applied to every sector of the economy in particular.\" See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 626. Respondent asserts that pesification was a general measure applied to all public utilities services, and thus, \"it would be illogical to analyze the pesification only in the sector of public utilities services without considering the need for measures as part of a general policy to face a crisis affecting all sectors of the Argentine economy.\" See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 626.\n\n541.\n\nClaimants contend that the \"only way\" requirement must be interpreted strictly. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 558. Claimants contend that this element is not satisfied if ways to respond to situations of necessity with otherwise lawful means remain available, even if such means are more costly or less convenient. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 558 (citing to comment 15 to ILC Article 25, which provides that \"[t]he plea is excluded if there are other (otherwise lawful) means available, even if they may be more costly or less convenient.... Moreover, the requirement of necessity is inherent in the plea: any conduct going beyond what is strictly necessary for the purpose will not be covered.\").\n\n542.\n\nClaimants\u2018 expert, Professor Dolzer, argues that strict interpretation of the \"only way\" requirement is in line with the general principle that the State of Necessity defense must be applied in only the most extraordinary of circumstances, \"corresponding to the exceptional nature of necessity.\" See Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 81.\n\n543.\n\nClaimants contend that the narrowness of the \"only way\" requirement has been reaffirmed by other tribunals addressing the same measures at issue in this case. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 560-61 (citing to *Enron*, *Sempra* and *CMS Gas*). Claimants assert that all of these tribunals have concluded that a host state is free to make whatever economic policy decisions it sees fit, but that it must bear the consequences of those choices if they violate international legal obligations previously assumed by that state. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 560.\n\n544.\n\nClaimants\u2018 expert, Professor Dolzer, notes that even *LG&E* stated that the \"only way\" requirement implies \"that it has not been possible for the State to avoid by any other means, even a much more onerous one that could have been adopted and maintained the respect of international obligations.\" \"The State must have exhausted all possible legal means before being forced to act as it does.\" See Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 85 (quoting *LG&E*).\n\n545.\n\nClaimants contend that the enactment of the Provincial Emergency Laws was not the only means available to Argentina, and that in reality rather it did very little to achieve Respondent\u2018s stated objectives, particularly as compared to other options available at the time. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 565. Claimants\u2018 expert, Dr. Arriazu, asserts that the Emergency Tariff Measures \"were completely unnecessary and ineffective in their declared purpose of benefiting the neediest sectors of the population.\" See Arriazu Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 5.\n\n546.\n\nClaimants note that Argentina asserts that the measures enacted during the economic turmoil were designed to halt a dramatic increase in poverty and to avoid hyperinflation. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 567 (citing to Frenkel and Damill Expert Report at paragraph 191). Claimants contend that the measures in question were not the only way to address those stated concerns. Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 568.\n\n547.\n\nIn response, Respondent asserts that the protection of indigent classes and the prevention of hyperinflation are not the only two essential interests which were at stake, and suggests that it is incorrect to assume that just because two interests were served ineffectively the other interests were ineffectively served as well. See Respondent\u2018s PH Reply at paragraph 148.\n\n548.\n\nClaimants\u2018 expert, Professor Arriazu, opines that the measures were totally ineffective in halting the increase in poverty because (i) the average nationwide residential consumption of electricity represents only 1% of total consumer spending, (ii) empirical evidence shows that the price for all essential products in fact increased considerably in Argentina following the emergency measures, harming the poorest sectors, (iii) aggregate consumption by low-income sectors represents less than 10% of the total electricity demand in the country, and (iv) empirical evidence shows that poverty in Argentina increased subsequent to Argentina adopting its measures. See Arriazu Supplement Expert Report at paragraphs 62-70.\n\n549.\n\nFurthermore, Professor Arriazu opines that the measures failed to safeguard against hyperinflation as well due to the relatively small percentage that electricity and other utility services entail on the overall consumption basket. See Arriazu Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 91. Professor Arriazu concludes that \"[i]t is not reasonable to argue that, in order to contain inflation, it is justifiable to freeze some prices that are not very representative of the consumption basket while allowing others that are much more representative of this basket, to increase.\" See Arriazu Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 91.\n\n550.\n\nClaimants contend that Argentina took no measures whatsoever to control the prices of other items that make up a larger proportion of the basket of expenses of the Consumer Price Index, and that would therefore have had a more significant dampening effect on inflation rates. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 569.\n\n551.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimants\u2018 and Professor Arriazu\u2018s position overlooks the impact that the price of electricity as well as other public utilities has on prices throughout the economy, on inflation, and on the perception of inflation. See Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraph 149. Respondent adds that the Tribunal must also consider that Argentina had lost all support from international organizations, \"as a consequence of which it had to face a major crisis without any other resources but the economic policy measures to which it had access.\" See Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraph 150.\n\n552.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants\u2018 position also overlooks the impact that the devaluation of the Argentine peso had on the economy. In the view of Respondent\u2018s economic experts, Messrs. Frenkel and Damill, under such circumstances there was no other possibility but to redefine the parameters for determining the tariff rates because otherwise performance of the Concession Contract would have been impossible. See Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraph 147.\n\n553.\n\nMessrs. Frenkel and Damill added during the hearing that pesification was applied to thousands of public and private contracts, including mortgages, leases, and insurance contracts, all of which performance thereof had become unfeasible, hence possibly destructive on the economy if unregulated. See Transcript for Hearing on the Merits, Day 6 (Wed., 4 Nov. 2009), at 1791, lines 18-22; see also, Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at footnote 235.\n\n554.\n\nProfessor Arriazu opines that comparing Argentina\u2018s situation with that of Uruguay during the same economic turmoil shows that abstaining from freezing tariffs would not have led to hyperinflation. See Arriazu Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 94. Professor Arriazu observes that \"[t]he empirical experience of Uruguay under circumstances of devaluation similar to Argentina\u2018s confirms that not freezing prices in the Argentine electric power sector would not necessarily have resulted in an increase in inflation.\" See Arriazu Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 94.\n\n555.\n\nAs such, Claimants contend that not only has Respondent failed to establish that the measures adopted were the \"only way\" to address the stated goal of helping the needy and preventing hyperinflation, but also that the measures actually worsened the situation. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 570-71, 575.\n\n556.\n\nClaimants\u2018 expert, Professor Arriazu, opines that there were other measures available to Respondent that would have been much more effective and yet at the same time that would not have violated Argentina\u2018s international treaty obligations, alternatives being the implementation of a \"social tariff\" which would have protected the neediest sectors of society without affecting the real value of their consumption basket, or the exemption of electricity consumption taxes for low-income consumers thereby granting a preferential tariff through the equivalent of a government subsidy. See Arriazu Supplement Expert Report at paragraphs 83-85.\n\n**e) \"Not seriously impaired\"**\n-------------------------------\n\n557.\n\nMoreover, Respondent asserts that situations in which the situation of necessity has its origin in a certain decision adopted by a state vis-\u00e0-vis third-party states must be distinguished from circumstances related to the administration and internal government of a sovereign state. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 642-43 (citing *Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros).*\n\n558.\n\nAccording to Respondent, it has done nothing more than to adopt conduct expressly contemplated in the Argentina-France BIT, by maintaining public order, protecting the essential interest of security amidst popular unrest, and preserving the existence of a financial system and economy heading towards collapse. See Counter-Memorial at paragraph 667. As such, Respondent argues that essential interests of other contracting states to the relevant BITs were not affected by the Emergency Tariff Measures. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 664-65 (citing to *LG&E*).\n\n559.\n\nRespondent adds that foreign investors in Argentina were not treated differently vis-\u00e0-vis Argentine nationals, and neither were Claimants discriminated against vis-\u00e0-vis other foreign investors. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 666 and 668 (the former quoting *Continental Casualty*). Claimants not only controvert Respondent\u2018s assertions that the Emergency Tariff Measures were not discriminatory, but also contend that equal treatment is not a component of the State of Necessity defense. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 549.\n\n560.\n\nHowever, Respondent notes that Claimants do not deny that the measures at issue did not affect the essential interest of other contracting states to the relevant BITs or of the international community at large. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 739.\n\n**f) Excluding the possibility of invoking necessity**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n561.\n\nRespondent asserts that the State of Necessity defense is neither excluded nor limited by the Argentina-France BIT, nor any other BIT invoked by Claimants. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 670.\n\n562.\n\nRather, Respondent asserts that Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT, as well as Article 5(4) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, only binds Argentina to treat foreign investors no less favorably vis-\u00e0-vis nationals or investors of the most-favored-nation. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 671-72. As such, Respondent asserts that these provisions, far from excluding the possibility of invoking the State of Necessity defense, contemplate for \"exceptional situations that may also fit such institute.\" See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 671.\n\n563.\n\nRespondent notes that Claimants do not deny that provisions excluding the application of the State of Necessity defense are absent from the relevant BITs. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 740.\n\n**g) No contribution by Respondent**\n------------------------------------\n\n564.\n\nRespondent asserts that neither it nor the Province of Mendoza contributed to the creation of the situation of necessity. In this respect, Respondent asserts that not all forms of state contribution are actionable. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 636-37. According to Respondent, the only type of contribution warranting legal consideration is one that is sufficiently substantial, rather than being merely incidental or peripheral. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 638 (citing to U.N. ILC Report, 53d Session).\n\n565.\n\nRespondent\u2018s experts, Messrs. Frenkel and Damill, opine that the situation of necessity arose in Argentina due to several exogenous factors, including the rise in interest rates, the collapse of emerging markets, devaluation of the Brazilian currency, and the fall of exports-value, all of which Respondent did not contribute in any way. See Frenkel and Damill Expert Report at paragraphs 14-19; see also Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 645 (quoting an academic article authored by the Nobel Laureate in Economics, Professor Joseph Stiglitz).\n\n566.\n\nAs such, Respondent concludes that it did not contribute to the occurrence of a situation of necessity so as to preclude the invocation of the State of Necessity defense, since it is \"evident that it has not intended to provoke a situation that has the country as its own victim.\" See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 646.\n\n567.\n\nClaimants contend Argentina contributed to its own crisis. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 592. Claimants contend that this requirement is devised to prevent a party to take legal advantage of its own fault, and that contribution can materialize by act or omission. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 592 (relying on *Enron* and *Gabc\u00edkovo -Nagymaros*).\n\n568.\n\nClaimants contend that the contribution of external factors is not determinative nor particularly relevant to deciding whether Respondent itself contributed to the crisis irrespective of whether such external factors also played a role. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 594.\n\n569.\n\nClaimants\u2018 expert, Professor Arriazu, opines the cause of the economic turmoil to have been \"the existence of a serious and growing fiscal deficit, prolonged over time, which was unsustainable under the pegged parity of the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. This occurred as a consequence of a series of mistakes by successive Argentine administrations during the period, in particular, the decision not to make any fiscal consolidation after the reform of the social security system and the adoption of mistaken measures to fight the fiscal deficit.\" See Arriazu Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 14. Professor Arriazu also notes that \"in the economic literature on this subject, no one has asserted that the only cause of the Argentine economic crisis was the mere existence of... foreign crises. This argument would not withstand even the most rudimentary economic analysis and would defy logic as well.\" See Arriazu Supplemental Expert Report at paragraph 19.\n\n570.\n\nClaimants contend that even Respondent\u2018s own economic experts concede to Argentina\u2018s contribution to the economic turmoil. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 598. Claimants cite to paragraphs 21 and 22 of Professor Roubini\u2018s Expert Report, which provides that \"After 1998, the fiscal deficit and debt accumulation was exacerbated by the increase in nominal and real interest rate for Argentina. That increase was driven by a combination of external and domestic factors: the sudden stop of capital flows to emerging markets in 1998; the worsening domestic fiscal position and the inability of successive governments to achieve primary surpluses large enough to stop an unsustainable debt dynamic.\"\n\n571.\n\nProfessor Roubini asserts that \"[e]conomic theory suggests that a fixed exchange rate regime is eventually not consistent with severe and persistent recession, persistent fiscal deficits and debt accumulation: either a monetized deficit will lead to a loss of reserves eventually resulting in currency collapse, or budget deficits that are financed with debt will eventually lead to an unsustainable accumulation of public debt, domestic and external, that will trigger a currency run as investors expect a credit event such as sovereign default.\" See Roubini Expert Report at paragraph 21 -23, which concludes that Argentina\u2018s attempts to address this fiscal chaos only exacerbated the situation that eventually led to the economic turmoil.\n\n572.\n\nClaimants also cite to an economic publication authored by Respondent\u2018s experts, Professors Frenkel and Damill, which concludes that one of the causes of the economic turmoil was an \"intolerable debt burden\" produced by \"policy mistakes.\" See also Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 599, citing to The Argentinean Debt: History, Default & Restructuring.\n\n573.\n\nClaimants also cite to the *National Grid* case, which in turn cites to a report issued by the International Monetary Fund on the economic turmoil in reaching its conclusion that factors leading to the economic crisis were both internal and external, and that each was substantive and direct. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 601, 605-6. This IMF report stated that \"The measures surrounding the collapse of the currency board and public debt default\" notably the capital controls and the asymmetrical pesification and indexation\" have exacerbated the macroeconomic consequences of the crisis and complicated its resolution.\" See Lessons from the Crisis in Argentina, IMF Report of 3 October 2003 at paragraph 77.\n\n574.\n\nClaimants also contend that Respondent\u2018s own president at the time, President Eduardo Duhalde, publicly acknowledged in newspaper articles Argentina\u2018s own contribution. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 595; Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraph 60.\n\n575.\n\nClaimants also contend that the experience of other countries, such as Chile and Uruguay, reveal that Argentina\u2018s conclusion is untenable. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 602. Claimants\u2018 expert, Professor Arriazu, opines that \"[t]he fact that other similarly-situated countries \" whose economies did not collapse like that of Argentina \" is evidence that the Argentine crisis was self-generated.\" See Arriazu Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 4.\n\n576.\n\nProfessor Arriazu opines that \"Argentina was the only country in the world that suffered the effects of such crises so disproportionately. If the sole and exclusive cause of the Argentine economic crisis had been the mere existence of foreign crises, as Argentina argues, then effects as devastating as those occurring in Argentina would have also occurred in other countries in the world, which did not happen. On the contrary, Argentina was the only country in the world to fall into default and suffer an economic crisis of such magnitude. We only have to compare the situation of neighboring countries such as Chile and Uruguay, for example, to see that the true cause of the Argentine economic crisis was the irresponsibility of national officials in fiscal management during the second half of the 90s, which caused an uncontrollable fiscal imbalance, unprecedented in the history of this country.\" See Arriazu Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 19.\n\n577.\n\nProfessor Arriazu further opines that comparing the circumstances surrounding Argentina\u2018s economy during an earlier crisis\"the 1995 Tequila Crisis\"to the economic turmoil in question, shows that during the former, Argentina carried only a moderate fiscal deficit and was thus able to maintain solid macroeconomic stability notwithstanding the impact of the Tequila Crisis, which was comparable in absolute terms to that of the foreign economic crises of 1998. See Arriazu Supplement Expert Report at paragraphs 24- 35.\n\n578.\n\nClaimants contend that Respondent\u2018s misplaced reliance on *LG&E* was also acknowledged by the *National Grid* award, which at paragraph 261 concluded \"[t]he lack of an article in the Treaty equivalent to Article XI and the fact that the Tribunal considers it to be the burden of the Respondent to sustain its allegations may explain the different conclusion reached by the Tribunal.\" See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 607. Claimants contend that the awards rendered in the *CMS Gas*, *Enron*, and *Sempra* cases also support the conclusion that Respondent contributed to the economic turmoil. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 608-09.\n\n**h) Temporal component of necessity**\n--------------------------------------\n\n579.\n\nClaimants contend that even if a period of necessity had existed, Respondent still bears responsibility for harm caused before or after such period. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 611. Claimants cite to ILC Draft Article 27, which provides that \"[t]he invocation of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness in accordance with this Chapter [\"Circumstances Precluding Wrongfulness\"] is without prejudice to... compliance with the obligation in question, if and to the extent that the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer exists.\" See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 613. Comment 1 to ILC Draft Article 27 states that \"if the circumstance no longer exists the obligation regains full force and effect.\"\n\n580.\n\nClaimants\u2018 expert, Professor Dolzer, opines that full compliance with an international obligation is required immediately upon termination of any period of necessity, and thus, any policies or actions by Argentina that continued after such period had ended and that were not in compliance with the Treaty would constitute violations of international legal obligations for which compensation is warranted. See Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 90.\n\n581.\n\nClaimants contend that this principle has been confirmed by the ICJ in *Gabc\u00edkovo -Nagymaros*, which in paragraph 101 provides that \"even if a state of necessity is found to exist, it is not a ground for the termination of a treaty. It may only be invoked to exonerate from its responsibility a State which has failed to implement a treaty. Even if found justified, it does not terminate a Treaty; the Treaty may be ineffective as long as the condition of necessity continues to exist; it may in fact be dormant, but\"unless the parties by mutual agreement terminate the Treaty\"it continues to exist. As soon as the state of necessity ceases to exist, the duty to comply with treaty obligations revives.\" See Claimants\u2018 Reply at 613.\n\n582.\n\nClaimants contend that partial performance of treaty obligations is required when conditions preventing compliance gradually lessened, and thus, even if suspension of the contractually-mandated tariff regime had been briefly warranted by a state of necessity, a gradual restoration of the contract regime would have been required as soon as the circumstances permitted it. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 614 (citing to comment 2 of ILC Draft Article 27). As such, in Claimants\u2018 view nothing can justify Respondent\u2018s radical and seemingly permanent freeze, which continues to this day over seven years later. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 614.\n\n583.\n\nClaimants contend that, in the present case, it is impossible to determine a specific moment when *status quo ante* had to have been restored because there was never a real need for the Emergency Tariff Measures. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 615. In any event, Claimants posit that a distinction must be made between, on the one hand, the concept of necessity as it is understood in international law, and, on the other, the duration of a state of emergency or crisis as they are understood in common parlance. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 615.\n\n584.\n\nClaimants\u2018 position is that the duration of any state of necessity in Argentina cannot be the duration of the whole \"emergency\" period, since such period has formally lasted now for over seven years. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 616. Claimants add that the duration of any state of necessity may not be coextensive with the duration of the economic crisis itself because economic crises are foreseeable and recurrent under the cycle theory. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 617.\n\n585.\n\nClaimants argue that, under customary international law, the only relevant period during the economic turmoil which may be characterized as a situation of necessity was between 19 and 21 December 2001, the timeframe when the federal government declared a State of Siege pursuant to Article 23 of the Argentine Constitution. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 618. According to Claimants, the fact that a State of Siege was declared for only three days suggests that the Government of Argentina itself considered that the only stretch of the crisis in which it felt a threat to the constitutional order, and during which it endured the type of circumstances that may be deemed to satisfy the State of Necessity defense, was during those three days. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 619-20.\n\n586.\n\nAs such, Claimants contend that, even if Respondent\u2018s failure to comply with its obligations under the Treaty were to be deemed not wrongful for purposes of customary international law due to a situation of necessity, its exemption would only apply during the period of necessity itself, not before or after, thereby obligating Argentina to still responsibility for any violations of the Treaty occurring prior to 19 December 2001 and after 21 December 2001. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 621. Claimants posit that damages arising from Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the concession all predate 19 December 2001, and that injury from the Emergency Tariff Measures postdates 21 December 2001 for it was enacted in January 2002, and hence, fall outside any period that could exempt Respondent from liability for violations of the Treaty. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 622.\n\n587.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent has failed to demonstrate that any putative period of necessity extended for years following the brief three-day State of Siege declared between 19 and 21 December of 2001 so as to justify a continued failure to restore Claimants\u2018 contract as well as treaty rights. Claimants add that Respondent has also failed to establish that any situation of necessity existed with respect to the PreEmergency Measures affecting the concession. See Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraph 61.\n\n**i) Responsibility to Compensate**\n-----------------------------------\n\n588.\n\nLastly, Claimants contend that even if Respondent were able to satisfy all the elements of the State of Necessity defense, this would excuse Argentina only from a finding of wrongful conduct and not from the obligation to compensate arising for violations of international treaty obligations. In support, Claimants posit that ILC Article 27 aims at preventing the exclusion of compensation even if a situation of necessity is found to have existed. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 623, 628-29; Claimants\u2018 Post-hearing Brief on the Merits, paragraph 173.\n\n589.\n\nILC Article 27 provides:\n\nConsequences of Invoking a Circumstance Precluding Wrongfulness\n\nThe invocation of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness in accordance with this chapter [i.e., Circumstance Precluding Wrongfulness] is without prejudice to:\n\n(a) compliance with the obligation in question, if and to the extent that the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer exists;\n\n(b) the question of compensation for any material loss caused by the act in question.\n\n590.\n\nClaimants\u2018 legal expert, Professor Dolzer, opines that ILC Article 27\u2018s obligation to compensate irrespective of necessity is a well-established and long-recognized rule under international law. See Dolzer Supplement Expert Report at paragraph 92. Claimants back this view by citing to the drafting history of ILC Article 27, as well as various international decisions. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 624-26, 628.\n\n591.\n\nClaimants also argue that the wording of ILC Article 25 is consistent with (Claimants\u2018 interpretation of) ILC Article 27 insofar as the former is not worded in terms of an exemption from liability, but rather in terms of \"preclusion of wrongfulness\"\"in this respect, ILC Article 25 provides that \"Necessity may be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation....\" In Claimants\u2018 view, the drafters were careful not to formulate the State of Necessity defense in a manner that would automatically exonerate a host-state\u2018s duty to compensate, but rather only to enable such acts to be deemed lawful. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 627.\n\n592.\n\nRespondent additionally posits that all claims raised in this proceeding should be dismissed by virtue of the doctrine of necessity pursuant to customary international law (\"Necessity defense\"). See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraph 673. According to Respondent, the Necessity defense operates as a means to exclude illegality and to excuse any state responsibility which might result from situations where a state has absolutely no means but to act inconsistently with pre-existing international obligations in order to preserve an essential interest threatened by a serious and imminent risk. See Respondent\u2018s Counter Memorial at paragraphs 620-2.\n\n**D. QUANTUM OF DAMAGES**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Claimants**\n----------------\n\n**a) Valuation Model**\n----------------------\n\n**(1) LECG's DCF Method**\n-------------------------\n\n593.\n\nClaimants assert that the valuation models submitted by Respondent are unreliable and that instead the Tribunal should use LECG\u2018s Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") method as it follows the most realistic and conservative assumptions. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 1.\n\n594.\n\nClaimants assert that LECG\u2018s DCF model presents the most reliable set of calculations for a fair approximation of Claimants\u2018 damages. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 32.\n\n595.\n\nClaimants argue that LECG\u2018s model is consistent with the Provincial Electricity Law, thus accounting for the investor\u2018s reasonable rate of return on their full investment. See LECG Report of 28 April 2005, at paragraph 112; see also LECG Supplementary Report of 30 April 2009, at paragraphs 6(f) and 58-89. LECG\u2018s DCF model starts with the assumption that Claimants are entitled to earn a return of the full amount of their actual investment, US$ 209 million. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 32.\n\n596.\n\nAccording to Claimants, LECG\u2018s DCF model reasonably shows that Claimants\u2018 investment lost all value following the enactment of the Emergency Measures, which caused dramatic reductions in the tariffs\u2018 dollar value.\n\n597.\n\nTwo years after no tariff adjustments and with no prospect for improvement, Claimants signed an agreement in 2004 to sell their shares in EDEMSA for US$ 2 million. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 34. The deal closed in March 2005 and, according to Claimants, this was the fair market value at the time.\n\n598.\n\nClaimants assert that the residual value left of Claimants\u2018 investment in EDEMSA was the actual sales price. Claimants underscore Respondent\u2018s estimation of zero equity value in EDEMSA as of January 2005. According to Claimants, this shows Respondent\u2018s admission that the value left of Claimants\u2018 investment to be the actual sales price.\n\n**(a) LECG's Assumptions and Methodology**\n------------------------------------------\n\n599.\n\nLECG\u2018s DCF method determines the firm value by calculating the present value of future cash flows, and then adding the residual value of the company at the last year of the concession, discounted at its cost of capital. See LECG Report of 28 April 2005, at paragraph 118.\n\n600.\n\nLECG valuation takes into account the finite life of EDEMSA\u2018s Concession, thus factoring in cash flows only until the end of the concession. LECG adds at the very last year of EDEMSA\u2018s thirty-year (30) term, a \"terminal or residual value\" that considers the payment that EDEMSA is entitled to receive when its contract expires, which is equal to the unamortized portion of it investments. See LECG Report of 28 April 2005, at paragraph 119.\n\n601.\n\nTo determine the present value of the free cash flows, LECG uses a discount factor determined by the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which represents a measure of the cost of raising funds from shareholders and lenders in a company operating in the industry at hand. See LECG Report of 28 April 2005, at paragraph 117.\n\n602.\n\nThe cost of raising funds from lenders is given by the interest rate at which they are willing to offer loans, called the cost of debt; whereas the cost of raising funds from shareholders is measured by the so-called cost of equity, which represents the expected rate of return (distributed in the form of dividends) on the equity contributions.\n\n603.\n\nLECG calculates Claimants\u2018 damages by taking the difference in the value of Claimants\u2018 stake in EDEMSA as shareholder under the \"but-for\" and the \"actual\" scenarios. See LECG Report of 28 April 2005, at paragraph 126.\n\n604.\n\nWith respect to the requested valuation dates of 30 November and 31 December 2001, LECG advances its assessment as to what the values of EDEMSA and Claimants\u2018 investments would have been in the absence of the Emergency Measures (referred to as the \"but-for\" scenario). See LECG\u2018s Report of September 2010, at paragraph 10. According to LECG, its DCF model makes the following underlying assumptions:\n\n\u2022 LECG holds the macroeconomic conditions constant at the actual macroeconomic situation as known in 2005 in order to isolate the effect of the Emergency Measures on EDEMSA\u2018s cash flow. From 2005 on, LECG\u2018s macroeconomic projections are based on estimations by Estudio Broda, a specialized consulting firm. According to LECG, Estudio Broda\u2018 s estimations take into account the Argentine CPI and PPI, salaries index, as well as the nominal exchange rate and GDP growth rates;\n\n\u2022 For operating and capital expenditures, LECG projects and annually adjusts the figures by accounting for the evolution of various inflation indices, CPI, PPI, salary index, tariff level and foreign exchange rate movements;\n\n\u2022 As to energy-purchasing costs, LECG uses the actual electricity spot prices up to the end of 2004. From then on, spot prices are forecasted using a dispatch model, which takes into account the evolution of natural gas prices, as indicated in Decree No. 181/2004 and Resolution No. 208/2004 of the Ministry of Planning;\n\n\u2022 Concerning the electricity-demand factor, LECG has taken into account the change, which it divides into two categories, (i) the evolution of the number of customers and (ii) evolution of consumption per customer. LECG projects the former by accounting for the increase in population growth whereas the latter by factoring in projections of demand price-elasticity and the general movement of the economy; and\n\n\u2022 With respect to tariffs, LECG assumes that a \"but-for\" tariff review would have taken place in 2002, which would have allowed the company to recover the value of its tariff base over the life of the concession, at its cost of capital (as measured by its calculation the WACC). The new tariff level resulting from the but-for 2002 review takes into account the asset base as of the end of 2001 in U.S. dollars, which is the currency at which the investments were originally made.\n\n605.\n\nWith respect to the valuation date of 30 November 2001, LECG advances that it has made the following adjustments:\n\n\u2022 The present valuation discounts all cash flows starting on 30 November 2001, meaning that cash flows corresponding to the month of December 2001 are also included in computing EDEMSA\u2018s value;\n\n\u2022 The WACC rate used to discount as of 30 November 2001 has been adjusted to reflect the differences between November and December 2001 in the rate\u2018s fundamentals. In particular, LECG notes that the differing components are the risk-free rate and the standard deviations for the U.S. and Argentine equity markets. LECG has calculated the changes between these two dates to yield a WACC (in nominal terms) of 10.77 per cent as of November 2001 as opposed to 11.34 per cent as of December 2001; and\n\n\u2022 With respect to EDEMSA\u2018s financial debt as of November 2001, LECG has discounted by one month EDEMSA\u2018s book value as of 31 December 2001, using EDEMSA\u2018s estimated cost of debt of 9.94 per cent.\n\n606.\n\nIn assessing both valuation dates, LECG defines fair market value as \"the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.\" See LECG 2009 Supplemental Report, at footnote 10. Accordingly, LECG rules out the use of any discount rate that fails to capture a long-term view of the fundamental components of the firm value, regardless of the overall financial distress underlying the economy at the time.\n\n607.\n\nAs to the requested valuation dates as of January 31, 2002 and 31 January 2005, LECG understands such dates to concern assessment of EDEMSA\u2018s value in the presence of the Emergency Measures (referred to as the \"actual\" scenario). As stated in its Report of September 2010, LECG makes the following underlying assumptions:\n\n\u2022 Macroeconomic conditions are assumed to be equal to those of the \"but-for\" scenario in order to isolate the effects of the Emergency Measures;\n\n\u2022 As to general operating and capital expenditures, impact matrices as well as price indices are assumed to be equal across the two scenarios;\n\n\u2022 Energy-purchasing costs are assumed to be the same as that under the \"but-for\" scenario;\n\n\u2022 As a general matter, the electricity demand follows the same assumptions used in the but-for scenario. The demand level, however, is slightly higher, reflecting the impact of price-elasticity effects due to lower tariffs; and\n\n\u2022 With respect to tariffs, LECG assumes that a tariff scenario in which it could be expected that the Province would grant domestic inflation adjustments on tariffs from 2005 onwards.\n\n608.\n\nConcerning EDEMSA\u2018s financial debt, LECG asserts that, at the time of crisis, its book value as of 31 December 2001 fails to provide an adequate indication as to EDEMSA\u2018s debt as of 31 January 2002. See LECG Supplementary Report on Quantum, at paragraph 74, Table XII. As a result, LECG has used the fair market value of EDEMSA\u2018s debt at the time of valuation. LECG estimates the value of EDEMSA\u2018s debt to be zero.\n\n609.\n\nLECG has applied these assumptions to both valuation dates (i.e., as of 31 January 2002 and as of 31 January 2005). Accordingly, the cash flows for each year in both these valuations are identical, with only three differences between the two post-Emergency-Measures settings:\n\n\u2022 Cash flows have been calculated from the valuation date onwards, and then discounted to that date. As a result, the January 2002 valuation includes three years of cash flows that are not taken into account in the January 2005 valuation date exercise;\n\n\u2022 With respect to the discounting methodology, the WACC rate has been calculated based on the rate\u2018 s fundamentals as of each date, with the WACC as of 2002 estimated at 11.38 per cent and the WACC as of 2005 estimated at 10.41 per cent; and\n\n\u2022 For the January 2005 valuation date, LECG has used the actual information of EDEMSA\u2018s debt after its complete restructuring (completed in March 2007), and then discounted back to the valuation dates using EDEMSA\u2018s cost of debt.\n\n610.\n\nAs provided in Tables III and IV of LECG\u2018s Report of September 2010, LECG finds the firm value at both valuation dates to be negative, thereby yielding equity values of zero for both.\n\n**(b) LECG's WACC Calculation for December 2001**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n611.\n\nFor its damages calculation, LECG adopted a WACC using a Relative Volatility Approach as a measure of country risk premium, with a debt/equity ratio representing expectations of the future optimal capital structure for an efficient economy. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at page 103, paragraph 28. LECG considers\n\nWACC = 12.97% \\* 75% + 9.94% \\* (1-35%)\\* 25% = 11.34%\n\n***(i) Cost of Equity***\n------------------------\n\n612.\n\nLECG asserts that, to estimate the opportunity cost of equity, it is standard to use the Capital Asset Pricing Model (\"CAP\" Model). See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at page 94, paragraph 5. In this connection, LECG finds that other methods, such as the Arbitrage Pricing Theory and Fama-French three Factor Model, tend to be more subjective and are not as widely used.\n\n613.\n\nAccording to LECG, the CAP Model postulates that the opportunity cost of equity is equal to the return on risk-free securities, plus the company\u2018s systematic risk (\"beta\"), multiplied by the market price of risk (market risk premium). The equation for the cost of equity (kE) is as follows:\n\nkE = rf + [ E(rm) - rf ] \\* (beta) where:\n\nrf = the risk free rate of return.\n\nE(rm) = the expected rate of return on the overall market portfolio.\n\nE(rm) - rf = the market risk premium. beta = the systematic risk of the equity.\n\n614.\n\n*Risk-free rate*. LECG defines the risk free rate as the return on a security or portfolio that has no default risk, and as a return completely uncorrelated with anything else in the economy. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at 96, paragraph 7. Thus, LECG finds that the risk free rate would be the return on a zero-beta portfolio.\n\n615.\n\nLECG recommends the use of securities that match the duration of the cash flows being valued. In this connection, LECG finds that a 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond rate most closely matches the cash flows under consideration. According to LECG, the beta value from the 10-year rate is closer to zero than that of the thirty-year bonds (according to JP Morgan, thirty-year Treasury Bonds have a beta of 0.25).\n\n616.\n\n*Market Risk Premium.* LECG defines the market risk premium to be the difference between the expected rate of return on the market portfolio and the risk free rate. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at 97, paragraph 8.\n\n617.\n\nLECG advances that the main differences in the various approaches for calculating the market risk premium are (i) which historic time period should be used and (ii) whether an arithmetic or a geometric average should be calculated to arrive to the expected market risk premium.\n\n618.\n\nLECG recommends the use of the largest historic period of data available, finding that the market risk premium follows a random walk. In contrast, LECG finds it inappropriate to use an arbitrary shorter historic period. In addition, LECG\u2018s position is that the geometric averages should be used when calculating a WACC for discounting a long-term free cash flow. According to LECG, stocks are negatively correlated over time, so the arithmetic mean likely overestimates the return. See LECG Report of April 2009, page 34, at paragraph 52.\n\n619.\n\nAccordingly, LECG calculates the geometric average for the period from 1928 to 2001 to be 5.17%. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at 97, Table XIV.\n\n620.\n\n*Betas*. According to LECG, data of beta assessments from developing countries\u2018 stock exchanges are highly volatile and unreliable. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at 98, paragraph 9. In addition, betas of several companies are often needed, as this makes the sample much more stable. LECG opines that it is often difficult to find local companies from the relevant industry valued in the local stock exchange.\n\n621.\n\nLECG finds it more appropriate to estimate betas, and thus the cost of equity, for an equivalent company in a developed economy and then adjust to reflect the extra return required for investing in a developing economy. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at 98, paragraph 10.\n\n622.\n\nIn this connection, LECG relies on the beta measurements provided by Ibbotson, which, according to LECG, is most widely used in practice. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at 98, paragraph 11. Ibbotson provides betas based on U.S.-based industries by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. The SIC code 4911 comprises 51 companies from the electricity generation, transmission and/or distribution industry, which LECG estimates as appropriate and comparable to EDEMSA\u2018s business.\n\n623.\n\nThe raw and levered beta obtained from Ibbotson Cost of Capital Yearbook 2001 is equal to 0.06. LECG then adjusts the beta for the \"reversion to one\" according to the following methodology:\n\nAdjusted Beta = (0.67) \\* Raw Beta + (0.33) = 0.37\n\n624.\n\nLECG advances that this beta figure reflects the risk of a company with the average capital structure of the Ibbotson sample used. LECG posits that since typically the American and Argentine electricity sectors have different capital structures, the beta calculated above must be adjusted to reflect the appropriate leverage. The Ibbotson Yearbook 2001 provides the U.S. industry, average debt/ equity (D/E) ratio to be 84%.\n\n625.\n\nUsing these figures, LECG calculates the un-levered beta.59 Before adding back the Argentine debt/ equity ratio, LECG implements adjustments for regulatory differences.\n\nLECG calculates the un-levered beta using the following formula: BU = BL / (1+ ((1-t)D/E))\n\n626.\n\nAccording to LECG, U.S. electric utilities are typically regulated under a rate of return regime, while Argentine utilities are regulated under price cap regimes. LECG argues that rate of return regimes are less risky for investors as their rate of return on investments are assured. LECG advances that business risk is higher on a price cap regime because, once tariffs are fixed, any future inefficiencies are precluded from passing through to tariffs. LECG further argues that the higher risk is evident by the higher expected returns for investors regulated under price cap regimes. LECG posits that in previous tariff reviews, the Argentine regulator added a premium to the adjusted un-levered beta for this purpose.\n\n627.\n\nAfter adding the regulatory premium, LECG re-levers the beta to reflect the expected debt/ equity (D/E) ratio for the Argentine industry. LECG\u2018s D/E ratio reflects its expectations on the future optimal capital structure for a local company. See LECG Report of April 2005, at page 100, Table XV.\n\n628.\n\nLECG first calculates the debt / firm value (D/FV) for each year based on the D/FV ratios of several companies in the local industry. See Supplementary LECG Report of April 2009, at page 91, paragraph 172. Next, LECG calculates the market capitalization weighted average across several years to isolate any specific event that might have changed the ratio in any particular year. LECG then converts this D/FV average ratio into a D/E ratio. LECG calculates the average D/E, weighted by capitalization, to be 33.3% for the period 1994-2001.\n\n629.\n\nUsing these figures, LECG\u2018s calculation of the levered beta (adjusted to one) equals 60%.\n\n630.\n\n*Country Risk Premium.* LECG advances that adjustments to equity return must be made to reflect the risk of investing in Argentina. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at page 100, paragraph 18. In this connection, LECG recommends the Relative Volatility approach as opposed to the Country Debt Spread approach.\n\n631.\n\nLECG finds the Country Debt Spread approach unreliable in situations like the present case where high country risk figures are involved. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at page 101, paragraph 19. LECG finds that this methodology uses the country risk (spread between the local Government bond and US Treasury bonds) as a measure of risk, and simply adds this factor to get to the return on equity. LECG posits that using the sovereign debt spread as a measure of country risk poses difficulties. When countries are approaching default-like situations (like Argentina did in year 2001), the measure reaches high values, turning the proxy for country risk premium into an unrealistic measure for a cost of equity calculation. LECG further opines that when countries enter default, like Argentina did in 2002 the sovereign debt spread becomes almost irrelevant, as the country no longer has access to sources of finance.\n\n632.\n\nThe Relative Volatility approach adds to the equity return a factor based on the ratio of the volatilities of the local and the reference stock exchanges. LECG describes this approach as using the ratio of the volatilities of the returns of a developed country stock exchange and those of the analyzed country as a measure of country risk. LECG obtains the volatility factor, expressed by its sigma, from Bloomberg for both stock exchanges.\n\n633.\n\nIn sum, LECG\u2018s calculation of the cost of equity for Argentina follows the following formula:\n\nre = rf +Beta \\* US Market Risk Premium \\* (carg / cus)\n\n634.\n\nApplying the figures, EDEMSA\u2018s cost of equity as of 2001 yields as follows:\n\nre = 5.09% + 0.60 \\* 5.17% \\* (5.45%/2.15%) = 12.97%\n\n***(ii) Cost of Debt***\n-----------------------\n\n635.\n\nLECG calculates the cost of debt in a different way than by basing it on a developed world company (or industry), and then adding the country risk. Their justifications for not adopting such approach are that (i) in the present situation the country risk has an extremely high level, and (ii) local utilities get financing at rates the same as or lower than the government. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at page 102, paragraphs 23-24.\n\n636.\n\nLECG instead recommends both analyzing the historic cost of debt and credit ratings at each time, and estimating the future cost of debt by estimating the company\u2018s future credit rating.\n\n637.\n\nLECG\u2018s estimate of the future credit rating is the rating of mid 2001, before the collapse of the Argentine economy. According to LECG, at that time most utility companies had a credit rating similar to that of Standard & Poor\u2018s AA+ rating. This credit grading is used for calculating the 2001 WACC.\n\n638.\n\nFor the historic period, LECG uses the actual cost of debt for the AA+ ratings of sample local companies.\n\n639.\n\nIn order to arrive at the 2001 figure, the difference between the raAA+ of each year and the respective risk free rate is calculated. Then, a simple average of the differences is determined, and the 2001 risk free rate is added, with the final product yielding a cost of debt of 9.94%.\n\n***(iii) Other Assumptions Used***\n----------------------------------\n\n640.\n\nLECG applies the same discount rate (WACC rate of 11.34%) for both the actual and but-for scenarios. See LECG Supplementary Report of April 2009, at pages 88-89, paragraphs 162-65.\n\n641.\n\nThis is because LECG finds that the only difference considered between the two scenarios is the Emergency Measures affecting EDEMSA. LECG argues that the effects of such measures on EDEMSA\u2018s revenues and costs are already included in the company\u2018s cash flows and should not be double-counted by adjusting the discount rate.\n\n642.\n\nMoreover, LECG advances that the Emergency Measures pertain to neither the macroeconomic effects of such laws enacted nor the pesification of the whole economy, but rather EDEMSA\u2018s tariffs.\n\n643.\n\nAlternatively, LECG advances that if the discount rates were to be different in the two scenarios, the discount rate in the actual scenario should be higher, due to higher regulatory uncertainties, and the consequent increase in risks this causes.\n\n**(c) Asset Base and Circularity Argument**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n644.\n\nClaimants proceed with addressing Respondent\u2018s two primary critiques of the LECG model. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 35.\n\n645.\n\nFirst, Claimants seek to undermine Respondent\u2018s argument that LECG\u2018s asset base should be limited to the official valuation amount rather than the actual purchase price. According to Claimants, there is no objective support for such position. Claimants cite to the Hearing Transcript and Argentina\u2018s expert submissions to show that Argentina\u2018s expert, Dario Quiroga, had previously, in an almost identical case, taken the position that the purchase price, not the official valuation, should be included in the asset base. See Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, at page 2609, lines 4-18 (English) (Quiroga); see also MBG Cross-Examination Slide 22. Moreover, Argentina\u2018s expert, Mr. Bello, recognized at the merits hearing that nowhere in the SSB report was there a statement as to the investor\u2018s return being limited to the amount of the official valuation. See Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, at page 2558, lines 17-21 (English) (Bello). Rather, Mr. Bello admitted that the official valuation report repeatedly stated that the official valuation was merely designed to be a floor price. See Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, at page 2609, lines 9-16 (English) (Bello).\n\n646.\n\nThis finding is further supported by the fact that the official valuation decree60 itself establishes the purpose of the official valuation figure to be a floor price for the bids, not a target amount. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 38. Moreover, both before and after issuance of the official valuation decree, the Government of Mendoza promulgated decrees specifically finding that the value of EDEMSA\u2018s concession should be based on the amount paid, while failing to make any mention of the official valuation. See Decree No. 197 (11 February 1998), Claimants\u2018 Exhibit 19; Decree No. 1176 (27 July 1998), Claimants\u2018 Exhibit 57; see also Claimants\u2018 Quantum Opening, Slides 7-8.\n\nSee Articles 2 and 3 of Decree No. 901 of 16 June 1998, Claimants\u2018 Exhibit C-13 (\"The official valuation for... 51% of [EDEMSA\u2018s] capital stock... is established to be AR$122,197,000. Accordingly... no price offer shall be admitted that is lower than 70% of the official valuation, that is to say, AR$85,587,900\"); see also Claimants\u2018 Quantum Opening, Slide 6.\n\n647.\n\nSecond, Claimants seek to undercut Respondent\u2018s circularity argument. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 39.\n\n648.\n\nClaimants assert that LECG\u2018s DCF model takes into account EDEMSA\u2018s performance including the penalties applied against it, as well as the effects of the financial crisis. Consequently, LECG calculates a 29.4 per cent drop in equity for EDEMSA between 1998 and 2001. See Claimants\u2018 Quantum Opening, Slides 2-15. Such decrease would not have been made if, as asserted by Respondent, the LECG model sought to maintain a value that was equal to the price paid. According to Claimants, this percentage figure is comparable to the average decrease in value of analogous regulated companies on Argentina\u2018s stock market. See LECG Supplementary Report of 30 April 2009, at paragraph 134, Graph IX.\n\n649.\n\nClaimants further argue that LECG\u2018s calculation of EDEMSA\u2018s equity value as of December 2001 is consistent with EDEMSA\u2018s financials, which were showing an increase in profitability. In support of their view, Claimants advance the Fitch credit rating that EDEMSA received as late as 27 December 2001, as well as Standard & Poor\u2018s as of 17 December 2001. This matter is further discussed below in connection with Claimants\u2018 response to Respondent\u2018s DCF method.\n\n650.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2018s position that Claimants significantly overpaid for the EDEMSA shares, Claimants argue that no reasonable investor would have overbid given the terms of the applicable regulatory regime. This is so because the regulatory system established immutable tariffs for the first five years, with a tariff review at the end of such term and every five years thereafter. Accordingly, for the first five years, the investor was to receive no return at all on any amount that it may have overbid.\n\n651.\n\nIn this connection, Claimants argue that the investment would depreciate over the course of the fixed term and thus the amount depreciated would not be accounted for during the five-year tariff review.\n\n652.\n\nMoreover, Claimants assert that investors would not have calculated the amount of their bid based on a possibility of future tariff increases to cover the amount of the bid. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 39.\n\n653.\n\nThus, Claimants\u2018 position is that no rational investor would have overbid knowing it would be subject to the five-year time lag before any tariff increase, at which point the asset would have depreciated. Claimants seek further support of their views from the conclusions rendered by the Argentine electricity regulators in a final decision involving a tariff review of the Argentine electricity transportation company called TRANSENER. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits, at paragraph 191. According to Claimants, the regulators explicitly rejected this sort of circularity argument in their decision. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 39.\n\n654.\n\nIn addition, Claimants contests Respondent\u2018s argument that alleged overbidding was due to anticipation of synergies, asserting that there had been nothing in the record suggesting the existence of any synergies. In particular, Claimants underscore the fact that more than 99% of EDEMSA\u2018s activities were regulated ones, which inherently limits the scope of any potential synergies to almost nothing. In support, Claimants advance the testimony of Mr. Patrick Blandin, who had been the architect of the EDF bid. During the merits hearing, Mr. Blandin had testified that Claimants\u2018 bid for EDEMSA contemplated absolutely no amount for synergies. See Hearing Transcript of 2 November 2009, at 1027:7-12 (English) (Blandin); see also Hearing Transcript of 2 November 2009, at 1025:14-1026:2 (English) (Blandin). Moreover, Claimants advance that during the merits hearing, even Argentina\u2018s own experts initially admitted that the fair market value of Claimants\u2018 shares in EDEMSA was the price paid. See Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, at 2537:2-6 (English) (Bello).\n\n655.\n\nIn sum, Claimants assert that nothing in the bidding process or the regulatory framework purported to limit the investor\u2018s return on the EDEMSA investment to the official valuation amount. Rather, Claimants had a reasonable expectation that they would receive a return on their full investment. Moreover, there is no basis whatsoever to assume that Claimants overbid, whether due to expected synergies or for any other reason. In Claimants\u2018 view, the fact that other sophisticated investors bid similar amounts, which were also significantly in excess of the official valuation amount, confirms that the amount of Claimants\u2018 bid was reasonable.\n\n**(2) Claimants' View of MBG' Models**\n--------------------------------------\n\n656.\n\nWith respect to the models submitted by Respondent\u2018s Experts, Claimants point to three aspects which it finds to be fundamentally flawed. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 5.\n\n**(a) EDEMSA Did Not Benefit From the Emergency Measures**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n657.\n\nClaimants critique the models presented by Messrs. Molina, Bello and Gonz\u00e1lez (MBG), experts testifying at the request of Respondent. Claimants challenge what they see as an illogical conclusion that EDEMSA somehow benefitted from the Emergency Measures. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 4.\n\n658.\n\nIn support of their view, Claimants underscore the fact that almost all of EDEMSA\u2018s revenue came from tariffs while the impact of the Emergency Measures was to decrease the revenue of EDEMSA in dollar terms by 66%. Contrary to Respondent\u2018s assertion, the tariff levels assumed in LECG\u2018s model would have neither triggered a radical drop in the demand for electricity nor significantly increased theft and uncollectables. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 5. As indicated by Claimants\u2018 quantum expert, Dr. Manuel A. Abdala of LECG, even a large increase in tariffs in absolute terms would have had less of an actual impact on consumers because wholesale costs increased 118% as a result of inflation during the relevant time period. See Hearing Transcript of 14 February 2011, at 192:8 - 193:17 (English) (Abdala)61. Moreover, as explained by Professor Pablo T. Spiller of LECG, the tariff increase would have affected only the DAV portion of the tariff, making the overall increase in tariffs a much lower percentage than that asserted by Respondent. See Hearing Transcript of 14 February 2011, at 337:11 - 338:4 (English) (Spiller). According to Professor Spiller, the increase felt by consumers would have been only 30% in real terms. See Hearing Transcript of 14 February 2011, at 339:8 - 14 (English) (Spiller). The effect of the tariff increase would have been further muted by the fact that electricity is a necessity good and thus has low demand elasticity. See Hearing Transcript of 14 February 2011, at 338:16 - 339:2 (English) (Spiller). Professor Spiller further posits that it is unrealistic to assume the occurrence of theft and uncollectables by every residential user, let alone business entities.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the transcript incorrectly states that wholesale inflation was 180% rather than the correct figure, 118%.\n\n**(b) EDEMSA's Value as of 31 December 2001**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n659.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the MBG models are also flawed in that their calculation of zero value for EDEMSA in November and December 2001 is entirely at odds with common sense and the reality of the circumstances. Rather, as evidenced by the reports of credit rating agencies, EDEMSA\u2018s equity was not worthless as of December 2001. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 6-7.\n\n660.\n\nIn particular, in late December 2001, Standard & Poor and Fitch gave EDEMSA BBB+ and A- ratings, respectively, which supports the conclusion that EDEMSA had firm capacity to repay its debts. According to Claimants, Respondent admitted at the 2009 hearings on the merits that Fitch\u2018s credit rating reports described EDEMSA as a company with \"conservative\" debt and increasing profitability. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 7-8 (citing to Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, at 2614:18 - 2615:18 (English) (Molina); Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, at 2627:10-15 (English) (Molina); Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, at 2563:12 - 19 (English) (Bello)). In Claimants\u2018 view, these reports indicate that one of the key components of EDEMSA\u2018s high ratings was the guaranteed cash flows it received as part of the Concession Agreement.\n\n661.\n\nIn contrast, Fitch\u2018s April 2002 report, which followed after the enactment of the Emergency Measures, no longer listed \"flujo de fondos estables\" (translated in English as \"stable cash flow\") as one of EDEMSA\u2018s strengths. Accordingly, EDEMSA\u2018s ratings were dropped to a CCC. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 8.\n\n662.\n\nClaimants proceed to address Respondent\u2018s argument about the significance of EDEMSA\u2018s A- rating by Fitch. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 8-14.\n\n663.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent cannot seek support from the fact that Fitch provided high ratings even for other companies which later defaulted on their obligations. Not all of the companies listed by Respondent received a high rating from Fitch, whose valuations in fact ranged from AAA to D. Like EDEMSA, the regulated companies received high scores while some unregulated companies received extremely low ratings in the period just before the Emergency Measures. In Claimants\u2018 view, the fact that these regulated companies defaulted on their debt would not be surprising at all if such companies, like EDEMSA, had assumed debt in U.S. dollars while receiving guarantee of payment also in dollars. This is because the pesification and freeze of the tariffs would have eliminated such assurance, thereby rendering it onerous to meet financial obligations.\n\n664.\n\nWith respect to Respondent\u2018s argument that the Fitch reports were merely domestic ratings so as to exclude consideration of macroeconomic changes, Claimants respond by underscoring the language of the 27 December 2001 Fitch report, which explicitly recognizes \"the uncertainty of the macroeconomic context\" contributing to EDEMSA\u2018s decrease in rating from A to A-. See Fitch Ratings Report (27 December 2001), Exhibit C263, at page 1. In further support, Claimants highlight the fact that the Argentina\u2018s quantum expert admitted in his later testimony that Fitch had taken macroeconomic conditions into account when rating EDEMSA. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 11 (citing to Hearing Transcript of 14 February 2011, at 248:4 - 7 (English) (Molina)).\n\n665.\n\nAlthough recognizing that the Standard & Poor rating as of December 2001 was lower than Fitch\u2018s, Claimants clarify that the former\u2018s rating was merely one ranking below, BBB+, which meant that EDEMSA had an \"adequate financial risk profile.\" See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 13 (citing to S&P rates Corp Banca bonds BBB+). In Claimants\u2018 view, ratings of either A- or BBB+ are incompatible with Respondent\u2018s assertions that EDEMSA\u2018s equity was zero at the end of December 2001.\n\n666.\n\nClaimants further argue that, in any event, Respondent has failed to advance evidence of any international rating of EDEMSA that would undercut Fitch\u2018s analysis of EDEMSA\u2018s capacity to provide payment of principal and interest on its obligations. See Fitch Ratings Report (27 December 2001), Exhibit C263, at page 1.\n\n667.\n\nClaimants further underscore the inconsistency of Respondent\u2018s position with respect to its valuation for November and December 2001. Although MBG testified in the merits hearing that EDEMSA had experienced a significant drop in equity value between the end of November and the end of December 2001, their most recent calculations reflect no such decrease. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 14. At the merits hearing, MBG testified that the early part of December and later part of said month were \"very, very different\" for purposes of valuation62, positing that EDEMSA\u2018s equity value was \"probably... not 0 as of the 1st of December....\"63 In contrast, MBG\u2018s recent submission takes a different position that EDEMSA\u2018s equity between November and December 2001 showed no decrease at all, rather asserting that the value as of each month was zero.64\n\nClaimants cite to Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, at 2590:11 - 18 (English) (Bello).\n\nClaimants cite to Transcript of 6 November 2009, at 260:1 - 2 (English) (Bello).\n\nClaimants cite to MBG\u2018s Supplement Expert Report on Quantum, at paragraph 17.\n\n668.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, Claimants conclude that the value of EDEMSA as of 31 December 2001 could not have been zero.\n\n**(c) Further Inconsistencies in Respondent's Methodology**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n669.\n\nThe unreliability of the MBG models is further highlighted by the fact that said experts of Respondent abandoned their earlier model submitted during the merits phase of this proceeding. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 15. The quantum phase model submitted thereafter by the same experts is inconsistent with the prior model in that key figures have been modified, including a 77% decrease in firm value; increase in the country risk premium by 3% (from 7% to 10%); and the addition of an EBITDA/sales cap, which is further discussed below in relation to the Respondent\u2018s SSB model.\n\n670.\n\nIn addition, a lack of methodological rigor by Respondent\u2018s experts is further exposed from the fact that Argentina\u2018s experts failed to take into account the investor\u2018s reasonable rate of return assured in Article 43 of the Provincial Electricity Law. Claimants\u2018 PostHearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 6.\n\n671.\n\nClaimants seek to undermine Respondent\u2018s justification that the abovementioned calculation changes were implemented in accordance with the Tribunal\u2018s instructions. In Claimants\u2018 view, nothing in the Tribunal\u2018s instructions required a radical change in the valuation of EDEMSA as of 31 December 2001. Rather, the Tribunal simply requested that Argentina\u2018s experts explain what they had done in their previous model. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 17 (citing to the Tribunal\u2018s letter of 9 July 2010). Moreover, Claimants underscore that Argentina\u2018s experts have failed to advance any principled reason for their willingness to abandon the assumptions and results calculated in the merits phase.\n\n672.\n\nIn this connection, Claimants reiterate that the MBG models are wrong to assume that Claimants were entitled to a return only on the official valuation amount (Claimants\u2018 share being US$ 107 million), rather than the amount of their actual investment (US$ 209 million), which was approximately US$ 100 million higher than the former figure. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 3. Claimants highlight the fact that several sophisticated multinational companies bid far in excess of the valuation amount and that Argentina has failed to offer explanation as to why investors would have been willing to do that if the return on their investment would be limited to the official valuation amount. In Claimants\u2018 view, such restriction would have rendered it impossible for the investor to earn a return on its overall investment, and thus no rational investor would have done so.\n\n673.\n\nAccordingly, Claimants request that the Tribunal completely disregard the MBG models as their underlying methods lack soundness. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 15.\n\n**(3) Claimants' View of Salomon Smith Barney and Chase Manhattan (\"SSB\") Model**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n674.\n\nClaimants assert that the SSB model submitted by Respondent\u2018s experts is also unreliable for several reasons. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum of 11 March 2011, at paragraph 20.\n\n675.\n\nFirst, Claimants argue that, like Respondent\u2018s DCF calculations submitted by MBG, the SSB model fails to take into consideration whether an investor has earned a reasonable rate of return on its investment. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 20. Rather, the SSB model assumes that the initial 1998 tariff level would be kept constant in real terms throughout the whole life of the concession, with only two sources of adjustments, neither of which is based on the requirement to grant the investor the opportunity to obtain a reasonable rate of return on investment. See LECG\u2018s Report of September 2010, at paragraph 34.\n\n676.\n\nIn this connection, LECG finds the SSB model to operate by assuming that there would be an average annual tariff reduction of 0.12% per year, which is related to an efficiency factor. Although conceding that this is an accepted feature of price-cap regimes, LECG asserts that the SSB model does not explain how the magnitude of the expected efficiency gain is computed. See LECG\u2018s Report of September 2010, at paragraph 35.\n\n677.\n\nSecond, Claimants assert that the SSB model\u2018s inclusion of an ad hoc 25 percent EBITDA/sales cap is neither explained nor justified by Respondent\u2018s experts. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 21. Under this 25% EBITDA/sales cap, if at given tariff level the EBITDA exceeds 25% of revenues, a tariff reduction in real terms is implemented that year so that the resulting EBITDA would not exceed 25% of the adjusted revenues.\n\n678.\n\nAdvancing Professor Spiller\u2018s testimony made during the quantum hearings, Claimants argue that there is no basis for the EBITDA/sales cap. Although EPRE possessed authority to change tariffs in the event investor\u2018s profits were to become too high or otherwise unfair, the regulatory system did not allow the regulator simply to ignore Article 43 of the Provincial Electricity Law. See Hearing Transcript of 14 February 2011, at 127:11-129:3 (English) (Spiller) and 160:12-161:9 (English) (Spiller).\n\n679.\n\nAs explained by Professor Spiller, an EBITDA/sales ratio has nothing to do with determining whether an investor has received a fair rate of return. See Claimants\u2018 PostHearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 22. The EBITDA is basically sales less operating costs, so the higher the latter value, lower the EBITDA. See LECG Report of April 2009, at paragraph 176, Table XI. Accordingly, companies with high operating costs would have a low EBITDA/sales ratio and vice versa.\n\n680.\n\nIn this connection, Claimants underscore that the changes in the cost of wholesale electricity, which was designed in the regulatory system to be entirely a pass-through to the consumer, could affect the EBITDA and therefore the EBITDA/sales ratio. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 23.\n\n681.\n\nClaimants argue that Argentina\u2018s experts have failed to advance evidence of any instances in which the Argentine electricity regulator has used an EBITDA/sales cap. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 21. What is more, the 25 per cent figure is completely arbitrary and Respondent has failed to advance any justification for why the experts picked this particular percentage.\n\n682.\n\nIn further support, Claimants highlight the fact that Argentina\u2018s model of 29 January 1998, which purported to be the basis of the SSB model, did not contain an EBITDA/sales cap. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 26. Moreover, line 398 of the tab \"Model\" of that January 1998 model contains a line called \"EBITDA/ingresos,\" which represents the EBITDA/sales ratio for each year of EDEMSA\u2018s operation. Importantly, 18 out of the 30 years of the concession assume a ratio of over 25%. For these reasons, Claimants assert that the cap was clearly not contemplated in the regulatory framework.\n\n683.\n\nClaimants advance that, conceptually, the distributor\u2018s profit should be a percentage of the assets, rather than being linked to revenues. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 25.\n\n684.\n\nThird, Claimants state additional reasons why they find MBG\u2018s SSB model unreliable.\n\n685.\n\nAs admitted at the quantum hearings, MBG had ignored the demand growth assumptions of the original SSB model and rather used the demand assumptions from their own DCF model. See Hearing Transcript of 14 February 2011, at page 253, lines 14-22 (English) (Bello); see also MBG Cross-Examination Slides 23-25. This in effect significantly decreased EDEMSA\u2018s value under MBG\u2018s SSB model because the demand growth assumptions that MBG imported were slightly more than half of the growth assumed in the original SSB model.\n\n686.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the unreliability of MBG\u2018s SSB model is further elucidated by MBG\u2018s admission that certain nominal terms from the original SSB model was directly imported into MBG\u2018s version, which was stated in real terms. See Claimants\u2018 PostHearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 29.\n\n687.\n\nClaimants thus request that, regardless of the model adopted, the Tribunal decline to include in such model a feature fundamentally at odds with the relevant regulatory framework, which formed part of Claimants\u2018 legitimate expectations and were embodied in the applicable law. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 27.\n\n688.\n\nIn the event the Tribunal was inclined to rely on the SSB model, Claimants request that it use LECG\u2018s version, which excludes consideration of the EBITDA/sales ratio.\n\n**(4) Net Equity Analysis and Book Value Approach**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n689.\n\nClaimants\u2018 experts from LECG interpret the Tribunal\u2018s letters of 9 July 2010 and 4 August 2010 to request from the Parties a net equity analysis based on a book value approach. See LECG\u2018s Report of September 2010, at paragraph 4. The book value approach accounts for the value of the firm\u2018s assets, liabilities and equity as they are reflected in its accounting books.\n\n690.\n\nLECG recognizes that this approach has the advantage of being objective, in the sense that it is based on accounting principles and proven figures. See LECG\u2018s Report of September 2010, at paragraph 5. When using the book value as an approximation of the fair market value of a company, however, LECG questions its reliability as an indicator of the actual value of investment that can be recovered through future cash flows. See LECG\u2018s Report of September 2010, at paragraph 6. This is because book-value figures may not provide a proper representation of fair market value given that intangible assets, such as patents and brands, might not be registered in the books. More importantly, LECG avers that the book value approach fails to reflect expectations about the company\u2018s future value generation capabilities from the commercial use of its assets. Thus, Claimants\u2018 position is that the book value approach is not preferable when fair market value can be reasonably assessed through other methods, such as projections of expected cash flows. See LECG\u2018s Report of September 2010, at paragraph 6.\n\n691.\n\nIn particular, the book value of assets, following the Emergency Measures, fails to reflect the impact of the tariff pesification on the company\u2018s capability to generate cash flow, given that the regulated companies were not required to account for this effect. Specifically, LECG advances that, following the Emergency Measures, the depressed level of the DAV component of the tariffs eroded any possibility for EDEMSA to generate profits, a feature that would not have been captured in the books unless the company had voluntarily chosen to perform a write-off or an accounting impairment, which EDEMSA had not done as of January 2002 or January 2005. Consequently, LECG computation of damages under the book value approach was based on the market\u2018s expectations about the company\u2018 s future stream of cash flows, resulting in an equity value of zero.\n\n692.\n\nSimilarly, the book value of debt may also fail to reflect its fair market value in that, if following the tariff pesification the company\u2018s ability to generate cash flow was insufficient to cover debt obligations, then the fair market value of the debt would have been below its book value.\n\n693.\n\nLECG further highlights the presence of a large devaluation in proximity of the requested valuation dates, thereby finding that the book value of assets and liabilities will have drastic distortions with respect to their fair market values. See LECG\u2018s Report of September 2010, at paragraph 7.\n\n694.\n\nClaimants underscore that, at the quantum hearings, both side\u2018s experts found the implementation of the book value approach to yield critical distortions. Claimants thus request that the Tribunal find such method inappropriate as the basis for calculating Claimants\u2018 damages. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 31.\n\n695.\n\nIn any event, Claimants have submitted LECG\u2018s calculation of the book value of equity at the four valuation dates requested by the Tribunal, using information from EDEMSA\u2018s financial statements. See LECG\u2018s Report of September 2010, at paragraphs 9-13.\n\n696.\n\nThe 31 December 2001 valuation had been directly extracted from EDEMSA\u2018s 31 December 2001 financial statement, which has recorded a total equity value of US$ 426,327,595. Accordingly, LECG calculates the equity value of Claimants\u2018 investment to be US$ 191,335,825.\n\n697.\n\nWith respect to the other valuation dates (30 November 2001, 31 January 2002 and 31 January 2005), LECG advances that they cannot be derived directly from EDEMSA\u2018s financial statements, which are reported on a quarterly basis. As such, the closing dates for the relevant period were on 31 March, 30 June, and 30 September. The annual close was on 31 December.\n\n698.\n\nGiven that the November and January dates do not exactly tally with any of the closing dates of EDEMSA\u2018s quarterly or annual financial statements, LECG has proceeded to adopt the following methodology.\n\n699.\n\nTo assess book value as of 30 November 2001, LECG looked to the corresponding book values of equity from the 30 September 2001 and 31 December 2001 financial statements. Given that the figures for both months were similar, LECG calculated the book value of equity as of 30 November 2001 by using a linear trend between the three months.\n\n700.\n\nSimilarly, the book value of equity as of 31 January 2005 was calculated by using a linear trend from the information based on EDEMSA\u2018s 31 December 2004 and 31 March 2005 financial statements.\n\n701.\n\nFor the valuation date of 31 January 2002, LECG found the linear trend approach not applicable given the large currency devaluation that took place in January 2002, which would not yet be reflected in the December 2001 financial statements. Accordingly, LECG used the value in Argentine pesos as observed in EDEMSA\u2018s financial statement of 31 March 2002, finding this report to be the best approximation as to what the book value of equity might have been as of January 2002. LECG had then converted such figure to US dollars at the foreign exchange parity observed as of 31 January 2002.\n\n**b) Claimants' Calculation**\n-----------------------------\n\n702.\n\nAs discussed in detail above, Claimants request that the Tribunal rely on LECG\u2018s DCF method.\n\n703.\n\nLECG calculates Claimants\u2018 damages by taking the difference in the value of Claimants\u2018 stake in EDEMSA as shareholder under the \"but-for\" and the \"actual\" scenarios. See LECG Report of April 2005, at paragraph 126.\n\n704.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal\u2018s determination on the appropriate model, Claimants advance the following methodology in calculating Claimants\u2018 damages: (i) apply the but-for scenario from the relevant model; (ii) choose the date of valuation; (iii) subtract from the valuation the amount received by Claimants as a result of the sale of their shares in EDEMSA in 2005, expressed in dollars as of the chosen date of valuation; (iv) add those damages concerning the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession (which Claimants refer to as \"historical damages\"); and (v) add interest to account for the time value of money between the valuation date and the date of payment.\n\n**(1) Valuation Date and Amount**\n---------------------------------\n\n705.\n\nClaimants request that the Tribunal use 31 December 2001 to determine the value of Claimants\u2018 shares immediately before the Emergency Measures. See Claimants\u2018 PostHearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 45.\n\n706.\n\nWith respect to LECG\u2018s DCF calculations, Claimants assert that LECG\u2018s method takes the purchase price of EDEMSA\u2018s shares only as a starting point. The 2001 regulatory asset base is calculated taking the purchase price and adding the investments (net of depreciation) of the 1998-2001 period, as well as the 2001 stock of working capital. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Reply on the Merits, at paragraph 72.\n\n707.\n\nLECG calculates EDEMSA\u2018s firm value by taking into account this asset base as well as the market risks faced by the concessionaire, including diminution in value of the shares as a result of the Argentina recession. LECG\u2018s DCF calculations yield a firm value of US$ 448,855,587 as of 31 December 2001.\n\n708.\n\nTo determine the value to all shareholders, LECG subtracts EDEMSA\u2018s financial debt as of 31 December 2001 from the firm value. LECG uses the book value of the financial debt as of 31 December 2001, which totals US$ 119,644,020. See LECG Supplementary Report on Quantum, at paragraph 24, Table II.\n\n709.\n\nThus, LECG has calculated EDEMSA\u2018s equity value at US$ 329,211,567 million as of 31 December 2001. Accordingly, based on their 44.8% interest in EDEMSA, Claimants\u2018 value in EDEMSA equals US$147.8 million, equivalent to AR$ 147.8 million in 2001. See LECG\u2018s Report of 15 November 2010, Appendix D, at Table VI.\n\n710.\n\nAlternatively, Claimants suggest that the Tribunal use the amount offered by the second highest bidder for the EDEMSA\u2018s shares. When comporting to such assumption, LECG\u2018s calculations yield an equity value of US $125.2 million as of 31 December 2001. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 46.\n\n**(2) EDEMSA's Value Following the Emergency Measures and the 2005 Sales Price of Claimants' Shares**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n711.\n\nClaimants assert that the residual value of their investment is equal to the sales price as of 2005. As established in Article 3.1 of the Stock Purchase Agreement of 30 June 2004, the price had been US$2 million.\n\n712.\n\nClaimants advance that there is no evidence contradicting Claimants\u2018 position that the actual sale price of US$ 2 million was the fair market value of EDEMSA at the time. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 48. In this connection, Claimants take the position that subsequent tariff increases should have no bearing on assessment of the market price at the time of the sale because no such increase had yet been materialized, with no prospect in the foreseeable future.\n\n713.\n\nSpecifically, Claimants assert that the announcement made by the Province in February 2005 is irrelevant. This is because there was no basis to believe that the announced tariff increase would actually take effect in that it was simply made by the executive branch and thus subject to further approval by the provincial parliament. Furthermore, at that point, the sale contract had already been signed by EDEMSA in June 2004. Alternatively, Claimants advance that even if the tariff increase of 38.05%, which had finally been approved in 2006, had been taken into account, LECG\u2018s calculations would still show that EDEMSA\u2018s valuation was zero.\n\n714.\n\nAccordingly, Claimants request that the Tribunal subtract from the valuation amount (US$ 147.8 million) the sales price as discounted as of 31 December 2001 (US$ 1.3 million). See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 47.\n\n**(3) Pre-Emergency (Historic) Damages**\n----------------------------------------\n\n715.\n\nBesides the damages caused by the Emergency Measures, Claimants assert that additional injury resulted from other provincial actions implemented in relation to the PreEmergency Measures affecting the Concession. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 478. In this regard, Claimants seek recovery with respect to five sets of measures, which have been quantified by LECG.\n\n716.\n\nWith respect to those five categories, Claimants initially calculated a total of US $ 8,058,161 as of December 2001. This amount has been updated to a total amount of US$ 7,202,196 million.65\n\nSee Claimants\u2018 Closing Statement, Table VII, at page 3; see also Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, at 2359:12-18 (English) (Spiller) (\"We detect a couple of small errors in the historical damage section that correcting for these errors reduces the historical damages by $307,920 as of 31 December 2001. So our prior assessment of historical damages that were $7.5 million, are now $7.2 million\").\n\n717.\n\nAccordingly, Claimants request that the Tribunal add historic damages of US$ 7.2 million to the net value calculated above (i.e., $147.8 million less $1.3 million). As a result, Claimants\u2018 calculations yield a total amount of US $153.6 million as of December 2001.\n\n**(4) Interest**\n----------------\n\n718.\n\nClaimants request that the Tribunal add interest to the damages calculated above (US $ 153.6 million). See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 55.\n\n719.\n\nAccording to Claimants, both side\u2018s experts agree that the applicable interest rate for the relevant period after 2005 should be the U.S. risk-free rate.\n\n720.\n\nWith respect to the 2001-2005 period, Claimants contend that the applicable interest rate should be the WACC because this rate is equivalent to Claimants\u2018 opportunity cost for their invested amount during their operation of the concession.\n\n721.\n\nClaimants further request that the Tribunal apply a compound interest rate. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 56. In support of their view, Claimants cite to several prior awards.66 Claimants assert that both as a matter of law and economics, simple interest is not sufficient. Claimants\u2018 Reply of 30 April 2009, at paragraph 702. As one commentator has observed, \"in the last 10 years tribunals have predominantly awarded compound interest.\" Sergey Ripinsky with Kevin Williams, DAMAGES IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW 384 (citation omitted). Since 2000, numerous international tribunals have awarded compound interest in investor-state disputes.67\n\nClaimants cite to inter alia *Compa\u00f1ia del Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. and Vivendi Universal, S.A. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award (20 August 2007); *Enron, v. Argentina*, Award (22 May 2007).\n\nClaimants cite to *inter alia Semprav. Argentina*, (Award, 28 September 2007); *LG&E* *Energy Corp. et al. v. Argentina*, (Award, 25 July 2007); *Enron v. Argentina*, (Award, 22 May 2007); and *PSEG v. Turkey*, (Award, 19 January 2007).\n\n722.\n\nClaimants further argue that, from an economic standpoint, compound interest is necessary to compensate Claimants fully. Claimants\u2018 Reply of 30 April 2009, at paragraph 704. In this connection, Claimants advance LECG\u2018s expert opinion, positing that \"[i]n the real world, all interest is compound interest.\" *See* Supplemental LECG Report of 2009, at paragraph 125. LECG elaborates that \"compound interests reflect the economic reality that a dollar foregone could have otherwise been invested, and that the income on that investment could have been reinvested, so that funds grow at a compound rate.\" *Id.* According to Claimants, the same reasoning was applied in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, (Award, 17 February 2000), at paragraph 104.\n\n723.\n\nClaimants underscore that LECG follows a relatively conservative approach in that it compounds interest annually, rather than on a semestral or quarterly basis as several past tribunals have done.68 Claimants\u2018 Reply of 30 April 2009, at paragraph 705.\n\nClaimants cite to *inter alia* *PSEG v. Turkey*, (Award, 19 January 2007); *Enron v. Argentina,* (Award, 22 May 2007); and *Sempra v. Argentina*, (Award, 28 September 2007).\n\n724.\n\nTo fully account for the time value of money that Claimants could have put to productive uses, Claimants request that the Tribunal grant post-award interest up to the date of payment of the Award. Claimants\u2018 Reply of 30 April 2009, at paragraph 706. Particularly in light of the long delay by Argentina in honoring the award issued against it in the *CMS Gas* case, Claimants consider it appropriate for the Tribunal to order that Respondent pay post-award interest, compounded monthly until the date of payment.\n\n725.\n\nIn Claimants\u2018 view, there is ample precedent in the jurisprudence and doctrine for the application of compounding on a monthly basis, particularly in the post-award phase.69\n\nClaimants cite to *inter alia* *CMS Gas v. Argentina*, (Award, 12 May 2005), at paragraph 471; *Occidental Exploration v. The Republic of Ecuador*, (Award, 1 July 2004), at paragraph 471.\n\n726.\n\nApplying LECG\u2018s calculations, Claimants request that the Tribunal award damages in the amount of US $ 270,988,417 through 30 November 2010, plus compound interest through the date of the payment of the Award. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 57.\n\n**(5) Costs and Fees**\n----------------------\n\n727.\n\nClaimants assert that they are entitled to all costs and expenses of these proceedings, including attorneys\u2018 fees, arbitrator fees, and expenses of the Centre. In support of their position, Claimants advance several ICSID awards.70\n\nClaimants cite to inter alia *AGIP Company S.p.A. v. Government of the People's Republic of the Congo*, ICSID Case No. ARB/77/1, (Award, 30 November 1979), at paragraph 115; *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, (Award, 20 May 1992), at paragraph 257.\n\n728.\n\nClaimants believe an award of costs is particularly appropriate in this case. Claimants assert that they experienced long delays throughout the arbitral proceeding as a result of the Respondent\u2018s vexatious litigation tactics. As an example, Claimants advance that Respondent caused long and evidently tactically-motivated delays in challenging former Tribunal member Mr. Fernando de Trazegnies, as well as Tribunal member Ms. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler. See Claimants Reply of 30 April 2009, at paragraph 707.\n\n729.\n\nIn its Reply Memorial, Claimants have stated that they will submit their full request for such costs and expenses at the close of the arbitration.\n\n**2. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n**a) Valuation Models**\n-----------------------\n\n**(1) MBG's DCF Method**\n------------------------\n\n730.\n\nRespondent states that MBG, the group formed by Federico Molina, Fabian Bello, and Daniel Gonzalez, took into account the regulatory framework established for EDEMSA. They thus include relevant variables like sales or costs, making it more accurate than the LECG report that does not account for such factors. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 60.\n\n731.\n\nMBG performed valuations for the dates of 30 November 2001, 31 December 2001, 31 January 2002, and 31 January 2005. Respondent also provides information for 31 January 2010. See Report of 23 September 2010 on Issues Raised by the Tribunal at paragraph 2.\n\n732.\n\nIn the November 2001 and December 2001 valuations the main assumptions used by MBG are that the economic emergency measures were not implemented with respect to EDEMSA and that the average distribution tariff is expressed in U.S. Dollars. For the other three valuations, the main assumptions are that the economic emergency measures were adopted and are in force, and that the average distribution tariff is in Argentine Pesos. See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraphs 42-44.\n\n733.\n\nIt is also important to note that in the November 2001 and December 2001 valuations MBG used the same baseline information and projected the variables with the same hypotheses and calculation methods. The December 2001 valuation, however, assumed a greater impact on EDEMSA\u2018s demand in 2002 in order to reflect that the economic crisis had grown. The cash flow projections for their valuations are thus different and discounted at similar discount rates. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 45.\n\n734.\n\nRespondent\u2018s MBG value assumed actual macroeconomic data for the 2002-2009 period, which entails assuming conservative scenarios. The projection for the 2010-2028 period is the result of projections developed under the assumption of a stable macroeconomic situation. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 25-6.\n\n735.\n\nThe valuation used by MBG is a variation of the general discounted cash flow method, known as the adjusted present value. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal at paragraph 28. Under this method the value of EDEMSA\u2018s equity is calculated as the difference between the value of the business and its financial debt. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 28-9.\n\n736.\n\nUnder the adjusted present value method it is assumed that the company is financed exclusively with its own equity. The present value of a company is reached by adding up two values: (i) the present value of a company\u2018s free cash flow discounted by the cost of unlevered equity, and (ii) the present value of the tax savings related to financial interest which may be deducted from the tax base for income tax discounted at the cost of unlevered equity.\n\n737.\n\nNext, a residual/terminal value is determined for values (i) and (ii) above. This reflects the value that the company\u2018s shareholders would obtain at the end of the concession. This value is calculated through a perpetuity at the cost of unlevered equity on each of the cash flows for 2028. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal at, paragraph 31.\n\n738.\n\nFinally, the sum of values (i) and (ii) is the value of the business. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 32.\n\n739.\n\nIt is also important to note that the MBG report uses projections based on the information in EDEMSA\u2018s latest financial statements for each year. The November 2001 valuation, the December 2001 valuation, and the 2002 valuation are based on EDEMSA\u2018s financial statements for 31 December 2001, and the 2005 and 2010 valuations are based on EDEMSA\u2018s financial statements as of 31 December 2004 and 2009. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 35-6.\n\n740.\n\nIn addition, the MBG reports avers that using the company\u2018s latest available information to project its main variables helps to achieve more accuracy, and better reflects the situation of the company as of the valuation date. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 37.\n\n741.\n\nRespondent describes the main assumptions used by LECG and MBG within their evaluations of EDEMSA\u2018s and Claimants\u2018 assets and equity for 30 November 2001, 31 December 2001, 31 January 2002, and 31 January 2005. See Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 58-9.\n\n**(a) General Assumptions Made in MBG'sValuations**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n742.\n\nRespondent asserts that MBG\u2018s report in regards to the counterfactual valuations for 30 November 2001 and 31 December 2001 takes into account EDEMSA\u2018s regulatory framework, whereas LECG\u2018s valuations instead places the value of the company as practically equivalent to the tariff base, which means that relevant variables like sales and costs have no impact on the results they obtain. See Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 60.\n\n743.\n\nThe next general characteristic of the valuations is that MBG\u2018s actual valuations for 31 January 2002 and 31 January 2005 factor in the pesification, but assumes increases in the DAV, making it more accurate. LECG\u2018s valuations, however, assumes initial tariffs in Argentine Pesos that remain frozen until 2005. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 61.\n\n744.\n\nIn regards to the cost of energy assumed by the valuations, Respondent states that the MBG model uses a mean tariff for energy purchases, the quotient between the amount of money paid by the company to purchase energy and the volume of energy purchased each year. This mean tariff is adjusted differently in valuations before and after the emergency economic measures. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 64. In order to calculate the cost of energy, the volume of energy purchased is then multiplied by the mean tariff for energy purchases. LECG, however, uses spot prices until 2004 and its dispatch model from 2005 to 2011, and then from 2012 onwards they adjust it on the basis of the Argentine CPI. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 65-6.\n\n745.\n\nRespondent notes that in assumptions about operating, administration, and commercialization costs, the MBG report uses a polynomial formula that seeks to reflect the actual evolution of the company\u2018s costs to adjust the operating, administration and commercialization costs. These use different weighing factors for each valuation, and for the evolution of the Domestic Wholesale Price Index (\"IPIM\"), the salary variation coefficient, and the Peso/Dollar exchange rate. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 67.\n\n746.\n\nAlso, MBG\u2018s model projects that annual investments in fixed assets will equal 4% of existing fixed assets, minus all accumulated depreciation. When the company does not have enough funds available to invest this much, MBG\u2018s model assumes that the company will invest at least 1/3 of projected assets (which is equal to 4% of existing fixed assets minus all accumulated depreciation) and pay the rest the next period. By contrast, LECG\u2018s model assumes the same adjustment in all valuations, both before and after the Emergency Measures. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 69-70.\n\n747.\n\nAssumptions regarding tariff rates change depending on the valuation date, especially depending on whether the valuation was performed before or after the emergency measures. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 71.\n\n748.\n\nFor the efficiency factor assumptions, Respondent asserts that its MBG report adjusts EDEMSA\u2018s annual revenues based on a 0.5% efficiency factor per annum, which shows the productivity improvements. Respondent also states that in international regulatory practice, that as an efficiency factor is usually applied tariffs are reduced and the company thus becomes more efficient. This also lowers the value of the company. Such a method is superior to LECG\u2018s model which does not take into account the efficiency factor. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 73-7.\n\n749.\n\nIn addition, the MBG model uses an EBITDA/sales ratio cap of 25% per annum. This means that the DAV increases arising from annual and five-year adjustments in the years between tariff reviews have a maximum limit that is then triggered when the EBITDA/sales margin reaches 25% per year. The assumption is that if the margin was above such, then the company would be generating excess cash flows, leading to a review process that would reduce tariffs. Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 78. Their model is logical in that it takes into account the reduction in revenues in Dollars due to the economic crisis. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 80. In addition, this model is in accordance with the provincial regulatory framework and the Concession Agreement. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal at paragraph 34.\n\n750.\n\nFinally, in regards to the financial debt, Respondent states that MBG uses the nominal value of the debt. However, when the company\u2018s value is lower, the value of the debt is equal to the value of the company in the valuation. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 81.\n\n**(b) DAV Rates**\n-----------------\n\n751.\n\nRespondent states that in order to simplify the valuations, the MBG model sets a mean tariff for energy sales. The initial DAV is calculated as the difference between the \"mean tariff for energy sales\" (the quotient between the amount represented by energy sales and the volume of energy sold each year) and the annual \"mean tariff for energy purchases\" (quotient between the amount represented by energy purchases and the volume of energy purchased each year). See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 46-51.\n\n752.\n\nThe MBG report assumes that the variance in the price of energy EDEMSA purchases is directly reflected in the sale price of energy, as provided for in the regulatory framework. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 52.\n\n753.\n\nIn addition, the MBG report assumes that as a result of the economic crisis the rate increase in Argentine Pesos causes a reduction in the volume of energy EDEMSA sells, an increase in energy theft, and higher levels of uncollectibility. Furthermore, between November and December of 2001 different estimations on demand, uncollectibility and non-technical losses are assumed because of the economic crisis. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 53-5.\n\n754.\n\nTherefore, due to the crisis, the MBG report assumes that the sharp rate increase leads to an 8% reduction in demand, an 8% rate of uncollectibles, and incremental non-technical losses of 15% during 2002. The December 2001 valuation, however, assumes that the rate increases caused a 10% reduction in demand, a 10% rate of uncollectibles, and incremental non-technical losses of 20% during 2002. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 56-7.\n\n755.\n\nRespondent\u2018s MBG report asserts that it is reasonable to assume that the Provincial Electricity Regulatory Entity of Mendoza would correct rates and reduce them as part of a tariff review. This is because of the sharp tariff increase in terms of the Argentine Pesos in 2002, the fact that only a small portion of EDEMSA\u2018s expenses are adjusted as per the fluctuations of the U.S. dollar, and that most of EDEMSA\u2018s expenses followed the behavior of local currency. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 61.\n\n756.\n\nOn account of such, Respondent\u2018s MBG report assumes an extraordinary tariff review for 2002 in accordance with the provisions of the regulatory framework. Also, it is assumed that after the reduction of the DAV and the recovery of demand, the uncollectibility issues and the non-technical losses were corrected. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 62. Therefore, both valuations estimate demand increased by 5% in 2003 and later increased at progressively lower rates, so that in the least years of the concession the annual growth rate was 2%. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 64.\n\n757.\n\nIn this connection, the projections for non-technical losses are put at 10% in 2003 and 5% in 2004, and then no longer considered, and the projections for uncollectibles are placed at 5% in 2003 and 2.5% in 2004, and no longer considered from 2005 on. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 65-6.\n\n758.\n\nThe 2002 valuations assume that in 2002 and 2003 EDEMSA\u2018s DAV in Argentine Pesos is the same as late 2001, and is translated into U.S. dollars. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 67. Also, the report considers that from 2004 tariffs increase consistently with domestic inflation, so that 20% annual temporary increases of the DAV are assumed from 2004 to the end of 2008. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 68.\n\n759.\n\nThe first five-year tariff review is considered in early 2009, and it is assumed that EDEMSA\u2018s DAV is constant from 2001 to late 2003 in Argentine Pesos, which means that a 6% annual increase in demand is assumed between 2002 and 2004, and that, as from 2005, those increases stabilize at 3.5%. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 70-2.\n\n760.\n\nThen, in 2005 EDEMSA\u2018s DAV increased by 38.05%, as announced by EPRE in 2004. In 2006 and 2008, the MBG report assumes 20% annual DAV increases. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 74-5.\n\n761.\n\nRespondent\u2018s MBG report also states that it assumes EDEMSA\u2018s demand increases from 2005 until it stabilizes with annual increments of 2%. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 78.\n\n762.\n\nIn addition, the MBG report also assumed that the accounting information for 2009 incorporates the adjusted revenues and costs as are relevant at the end of the agreement renegotiation process, as well an increase in EDEMSA\u2018s DAV from 2010-13 due to inflation, and a tariff review in 2014. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 80-3.\n\n763.\n\nIn regards to the DAV adjustments for each five-year tariff review, a polynomial formula is used to reflect the evolution of the company\u2018s costs. Three different indices are used to reflect this evolution: the Salary Variation Coefficient (\"CVS\"), the IPIM, and fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate (\"TCN\"). See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 87-8.\n\n764.\n\nIn this connection, the cost categories used to make the valuations are operating costs, administration and commercialization costs, and labor costs. These are then adjusted in proportion to the CVS, IPIM, and fluctuations of the TCN, in accordance with actual behavior. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 89-91.\n\n765.\n\nThe MBG further reports that the DAV is subject to an EBITDA/sales limit of 25% per annum. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 99-102\n\n**(c) Discount Rates**\n----------------------\n\n766.\n\nAccording to Respondent\u2018s MBG report the Advisory Consortium uses different discount rates for each of its three scenarios: 11% in the low scenario, 10% in the medium scenario, and 9% in the high scenario. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 164.\n\n767.\n\nMBG asserts that in order to reflect the higher risk the Company faced in 2002 compared to the date of privatization, it is necessary to adjust the discount rates. Thus, the before and after valuations the cash flows projected are discounted at higher WACC rates. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 165.\n\n768.\n\nRespondent\u2018s MBG report asserts that in order to ensure that the estimated values are both rational and consistent, regardless of the methodology used, they are calculated based on the relationship between the cost of levered and unlevered equity. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 211.\n\n769.\n\nMBG\u2018s calculation method consisted of calculating the cost of unlevered equity for each of the dates the Tribunal requested, and then using such to estimate the cost of levered equity. The cost of unlevered equity is then estimated further to the CAP Model, and a risk premium is also added. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 213-4.\n\n770.\n\nSince there is no local company that is comparable to EDEMSA, a bottom up technique was used. The selected companies for such were American Electric Power Co. Inc., Entergy Cop., PPL Corp., Allegheny Energy inc., Wisconsin Energy Corp., and TECI Energy Inc. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 216.\n\n771.\n\nIn addition, the beta coefficient was adjusted so as to evolve towards the market median over time. In addition, it was correcting so as to reflect differences in regulatory risk. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 218.\n\n772.\n\nAlso, the market risk premium was calculated as the differential between the market historic performance and the risk-free rate, which yielded a value of 7.6%. In this connection, the country risk was calculated for the historic premium at 7% for the postdefault periods, and 10% for the default and pre-default periods. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraphs 219-20.\n\n773.\n\nRespondent\u2018s MBG report contends that their method to calculate the cost of levered equity is appropriate because EDEMSA\u2018s excess indebtedness had a strong impact on the cost of debt. Shareholders, however, transfer losses from such potential risk to creditors in advance. In addition, since EDEMSA provided a regulated utility, illiquidity costs is not easy to determine in the medium or long term. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 227.\n\n**(2) Salomon Smith Barney (\"SSB\") Model**\n------------------------------------------\n\n774.\n\nAccording to Respondent, in 1998 the Salmon-Chase Consortium (Salomon Smith Barney, Chase Manhattan Bank, and HaglerBailly & Esudio Q) estimated EDEMSA\u2018s value between US$188.9 and US$269.6 million, with a middle value of US$224.6 million. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 1-2.\n\n775.\n\nThe consulting firm hired by Claimants, LECG LLC (Manuel A. Abdala and Pablo T. Spiller) used the same valuation method and model and estimated the EDEMSA\u2018s value between US$263.1 and US$314.4, with a middle value of US$287.4 million. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 3.\n\n776.\n\nRespondent suggests that given the fixed exchange rate system established by Convertibility Law No. 23928, the amounts in U.S. dollars estimated by the SSB is the same in local currency; the value on 31 January 2010, given the Peso/Dollar exchange rate of ARS 3.82 for each Dollar, means that EDEMSA\u2018s estimated middle value is estimated by LECG at ARS 1,098 million. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 7-8.\n\n777.\n\nRespondent also avers that in the valuations both before and after the economic emergency measures MBG adjusts the SSB\u2018s projection to reflect EDEMSA\u2018s real performance during 1999-2001. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 83-6.\n\n778.\n\nIn regards to any inconsistencies in Respondent\u2018s reports, Respondent\u2018s witness Mr. Reos states that a continuous analysis and feedback process occurred, in order to gradually improve the quality of the analysis. Thus, technical document files available that were prepared during this process might include versions with different data that have some content variations. Thus should be the case regarding and differences noted by Mr. Abdala and Mr. Spiller between the report versions delivered to the Argentine Republic to the Tribunal and the Claimants compared with the final version adopted by the Province of Mendoza for tariff charts and valuations of the company. See Supplementary Witness Statement of Cesar Hugo Reos of 10 November 2010, at paragraphs 14-5.\n\n779.\n\nRespondent contends that their report is more accurate because LECG ignores EDEMSA\u2018s historical performance during the 1998-2001 and assumes, despite the economic crisis, that the EBITDA/sales ratio will grow more than it does in the Salomon-Chase Consortium model. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 87. Also, in its After scenario, LECG uses a negative average EBITDA/sales ratio, inconsistent with the positive return EDEMSA got during the 2002-2010 period. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 89.\n\n780.\n\nIn regards to the macroeconomic context, MBG\u2018s model is superior because they use actual macroeconomic data up to an including 2009 projections for 2010-2028. LECG, however, assumes no economic crisis took place in their \"before\" scenario, and in the \"actual\" scenario they use actual data until 2009 and Estudio Broda\u2018s projections from then until 2028. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 90-1.\n\n781.\n\nRespondent states that MBG\u2018s use of the official SSB valuation utilizes a mean tariff for energy purchases, adjusting it differently for Before and After evaluations. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 92-4.\n\n782.\n\nRespondent contends that the MBG report is accurate in that it takes into account operation, administration, and commercialization costs by using a polynomial formula that reflects the actual evolution of the company\u2018s assets. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 95.\n\n783.\n\nRespondent contends that LECG\u2018s investment projections from 2002 onwards are reduced by a nominal 28% each year until the end of the Concession, which means the projections are almost one third lower that the investments originally estimated by the Salomon-Chase Consortium. This is despite the fact that historically because of factors like inefficient management EDEMSA had to invest more than projected. MBG, however, keeps investments in fixed assets at a constant. This means that projections would have to be corrected to grow nominally. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 97-98.\n\n784.\n\nRespondent avers that MBG\u2018s report based on the SSB model assumes that in the Before scenario an extraordinary tariff review is made in 2002, and that five-year reviews are implemented as from 2008. In the After scenario, five 20% annual increases are applied. Five year tariff reviews are then implemented as from 2009 and between the reviews that DAV is adjusted according to variations of the Argentine CPI and the IPIM. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 100-1.\n\n785.\n\nAccording to Respondent, MBG adjusts EDEMSA\u2018s annual revenues based on an efficiency factor of 0.12%; LECG also uses 0.12% to account for efficiency in both scenarios. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum at paragraphs 104-5. Furthermore, this efficiency cap is reasonable, and is a low value that would have increased the estimated value of the company before bids were submitted. See Respondent\u2018s Comments on Quantum, at paragraphs 40-1.\n\n786.\n\nRespondent states that MBG uses the 25% EBITDA/sales cap used by the Salomon-Chase Consortium. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits, at paragraph 106.\n\n787.\n\nIn regards to financial debt, Respondent asserts that MBG uses the nominal value of the debt, and when the value of the company is lower, the value of such debt equal the value of the company obtained in the valuation. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 108.\n\n788.\n\nRespondent asserts that MBG\u2018s report with the Salomon-Chase Consortium model appropriately uses the 25% cap to the EBITDA/sales ratio included in the Salomon-Chase evaluation, which is both reasonable and reflects the regulatory framework. LECG\u2018s report, however artificially increases EDEMSA\u2018s value in their assessments by modifying the 25% cap to the EBITDA/sales ratio used by the Salomon Chase Consortium in their but-for scenario and replacing it with a 34% cap. This is thus a deviation from the Salomon-Chase Consortium Model that Claimants claim to apply. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum at paragraphs 110-111, 126-7; Respondent\u2018 s Comments on Quantum, 35-6.\n\n789.\n\nRespondent asserts that for Capex (investments) MBG keeps investments in fixed assets constant. In the after scenario LECG, however, uses EDEMSA\u2018s actual data until 2009 and the investment per user is kept constant from 2010. In regards to tariff calculations, MBG and LECG both use different assumption for the valuations before and after the measures. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 120-3.\n\n790.\n\nFinally, MBG corrected LECG\u2018s estimation of EDEMSA\u2018s value according to the SSB model as of 31 December 2010 by analyzing LECG\u2018s nominal projections of the DAV in Pesos. They converted the value from real Argentine Pesos into nominal Pesos by dividing those values by the deflator used by LECG, and then comparing these values with the adjustment that should have been applied to the DAV based on the increase granted by EPRE. It was concluded that LECG\u2018 s projections showed lower values than they should have. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 130-2.\n\n791.\n\nThus, according to Respondent, they properly adjusted LECG\u2018s assessment of EDEMSA\u2018s value, and established an appropriate, higher, value for the company. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 130-8.\n\n792.\n\nRespondent further contends that the SSB-HBQ valuation follows the regulatory framework and clearly outlined the expectations of the Province and of any possible bidder in connection with the Concession framework. Such is because the Province had a specific interest in the valuation being high, because it was the official value of the government-owned company that was about to be privatized. See Respondent\u2018s Comments on Quantum, at paragraphs 22-8.\n\n793.\n\nRespondent also argues that it is incorrect to use the bid submitted by the winning consortium to calculate future tariffs. In addition, only the official valuation prior to privatization was considered to calculate tariffs, but the price paid was never used for such a purpose. See Respondent\u2018s Comments on Quantum, at paragraphs 29-32.\n\n**(3) Book Value Methodology**\n------------------------------\n\n794.\n\nRespondent\u2018s MBG report first notes the different interpretation that it and Claimants came to regarding the book value method. When the Tribunal requested the parties perform a Net Equity Analysis (\"NEA\") Respondent understood it to be separate from a book value approach. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraphs 3-7.\n\n795.\n\nMBG calculated the NEA by subtracting EDEMSA\u2018s debt from the value of the company, which was obtained under a discounted cash flow method. See MBG Report of 10 November 2010, at paragraphs 3-6.\n\n796.\n\nLECG, however, simply used the book value as the NEA. Respondent contends that such an approach is faulty, as the book value is a well-known method. If the Tribunal had wanted such a calculation, they would have asked for it instead of the NEA. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 7.\n\n797.\n\nIn addition, Respondent\u2018s MBG report contends that the book value is an inadequate calculation method as it fails to address questions of expectations about the future evolution of a business. See Report on the Valuations Prepared by LECG of 10 November 2010, at paragraph 7.\n\n798.\n\nAccording to MBG, the book value is an unreliable barometer. The values obtained using this method do not reflect the future expected values of the company, which is what investors look at when buying or selling assets. Furthermore, the book value does not take into consideration the market value of the company. Instead, the accounting standards used in Argentina value a company based on historical cost. This method is superior because the value of capital contributions by shareholders of a company remains stable in accounting terms, regardless of outside factors that may affect a company\u2018s business. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraphs 8-11.\n\n799.\n\nMBG also suggests that in reality the assets and equity value of a company change as the conditions of the company\u2018s business change. Under the book value method, however, the value of a company and its equity erroneously remain without substantial modifications. See Report on the Valuations Performed by LECG, at paragraph 11.\n\n800.\n\nOverall, Respondent\u2018s MBG report asserts that the book value is a useless method because the value of a company and its equity are directly dependant on a company\u2018s accounting standards, so it reflects values that bear no relationship to market values. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 14. Thus, LECG\u2018s *ad hoc* constructions on the book value method are arbitrary and unjustified, and should be rejected, never mind the fact that no variation of the book value method is adequate to assess the value of a company. See Report on the Valuations Performed by LECG, at paragraph 20.\n\n**(4) Criticism of LECG's DCF Method**\n--------------------------------------\n\n801.\n\nRespondent\u2018 s report by MBG asserts that LECG does not determine the value of EDEMSA using the DCF method as they contend to. Instead, LECG simply argues that the value of the company is equal to the accounting value of its assets during the beginning of the first period of operations. See Report on the Valuations performed by LECG, of 10 November 2010, at paragraph 2.\n\n802.\n\nMBG does, however, agree with LECG that the DCF method is the most appropriate tool for which to calculate the value of the company. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 51.\n\n803.\n\nRespondent\u2018s MBG report asserts that in the case of EDEMSA it is necessary to estimate the value of EDEMSA\u2018s equity in order to determine damages compensation. It is not appropriate to calculate an equilibrium tariff that has the ability to compensate the investor for all the risks assumed by participating in the privatization. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 53.\n\n804.\n\nIn addition, LECG does not use the DCF method to determine the value of the company in their counterfactual valuations. Rather, they only use the DCF method to calculate the equilibrium tariff on the basis of the tariff base they arbitrarily establish. Instead of calculating the value of the company they calculate the tariff necessary for cash flows to equal the amount paid for EDEMSA\u2018s shares. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 54.\n\n805.\n\nRespondent contends LECG\u2018s only sensitive variable is the tariff base, which they falsely determine. Their model makes all adjustments through tariff changes; it is an inappropriate method to assess the value of EDEMSA before the emergency measures, and it is an inappropriate method to assess alleged damages. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 55.\n\n806.\n\nOverall, Respondent asserts that LECG uses the DCF method to calculate the tariff adjustment needed in 2002 to recover the price paid by the shareholders during privatization, rather than to assess the value of EDEMSA. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 56.\n\n807.\n\nRespondent also avers that LECG uses practically the same WACC rate in all their valuations. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 122.\n\n808.\n\nRespondent further states that LECG includes the expected component in the calculation of all their discount rates. This is then compensated with the inflation forecasted in cash flows, which are expressed in nominal terms. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 123.\n\n809.\n\nFurther, Respondent asserts that discount rates always reflect the return expected by an investor and are used to discount projected cash flows and establish their present value, therefore determining the value of the company, and then the value of equity. Under LECG\u2018 s valuations however, a single WACC rate is used to discount all the projected periods, and this rate reflects the average discount rate for the whole period under analysis. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 127.\n\n810.\n\nRespondent contends that nominal WACC rates LECG uses are inconsistently low and do not reflect the risk faced by a potential investor in Argentina. In addition, Respondent states that the difference between January 2002 and January 2005\u2018s nominal WACC rate is only 1%, but the risk differential between them was much higher, and the real WACC rates determined by LECG based on the method used by the Advisory Consortium entail nominal WACC rates higher than those used by LECG in their own evaluations. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 128.\n\n811.\n\nThe validity of these objections can be demonstrated by looking at the evolution of the country risk, which Respondent states is only one of the components that determine the return expected by an investor. For example, when an investor defines the discount rate he will apply to determine the value of a company; he takes into account his desire for a return that can cover the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. This risk premium will then consist of several factors, including the country risk premium. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraphs 129-30.\n\n812.\n\nRespondent also states that they do not agree with LECG\u2018s production of discount rates that range from 10.4% to 11.4%, with the average country risk coming in at 24%. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 136.\n\n813.\n\nAccording to Respondent LECG also uses unlevered betas in their model that range from 0.06 to 0.15. These are unreasonably low; a cursory review of the data of utilities that are publicly traded in the United States stock market provides an average value of 0.65, for instance. Such is important to note, as the using such low betas leads to a significant decrease in the market premium. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 137.\n\n814.\n\nTherefore, LECG\u2018s valuations use WACC rates that are similar to those calculated by Advisory Consortium in 1997, when the economic and financial situation in Argentina from the second half of 2001 was completely different. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 139.\n\n815.\n\nFurther, Respondent states that the values of the company obtained by LECG in their own valuations are all negative, but LECG uses positive financial debt values in each of those scenarios to determine the value of equity. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraphs 140-1.\n\n816.\n\nAccording to Respondent, LECG argues that the financial debt values taken into account are based on the value of the restructured debt of US$ 62.6 million (as of 31 December 2006) and that the debt values 31 January 2002 and 2005 was US$ 41 million and US$ 52 million, as obtained by discounting the debt value at a rate of 9.94%.\n\n817.\n\nHowever, the value of the financial debt of a company can never be higher than the value of a company. LECG fails to take such into account in their calculations. See MBG Report of November 2010 at paragraphs 142-4.\n\n818.\n\nFinally, Respondent states that if LECG\u2018s contentions are right that the value of EDEMSA\u2018s assets were nothing in January 2005, then company managers and creditors would not have agreed on a 61% debt reduction. Instead the company would have been transferred to creditors. Thus, contrary to what LECG states, the assets of the company have always had a positive value, both before and after the economic emergency measures. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraphs 147-8.\n\n**(5) Respondent's WACC Rate**\n------------------------------\n\n819.\n\nRespondent\u2018s MBG report uses a WACC rate of 18.6% for both the before and after valuations in their discount rate calculations. This number is used as a way to adjust the discount rates to reflect the higher risk that the company faced in 2002 compared with the date of privatization. See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraphs 166-7.\n\n820.\n\nRespondent also uses an unlevered beta value of 0,864 for the before calculations, and 0,861 for the after calculations. See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraphs 166.\n\n821.\n\nRespondent\u2018s MBG report states that the value of a company lies in its economic and financial fundamentals, and therefore should not vary depending on the valuation method used. See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraph 211.\n\n822.\n\nIn order to ensure that estimated values are both rational and consistent, regardless of the methodology used, MBG calculated the discount rates according to the relationship between the cost of levered and unlevered equity. See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraph 211.\n\n823.\n\nMBG also asserts that the most obvious difference between the adjusted present value methodology and the WACC is how the tax consequences brought about by the debt are treated. The adjusted present value incorporates the tax effects in the cash flows and WACC includes them in the discount rate. See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraph 212.\n\n824.\n\nMBG\u2018s discount rate calculations consisted of calculating the cost of unlevered equity for each requested date, and then with this basis estimating the cost of levered equity. Also, they further estimated the cost of unlevered equity to the capital asset pricing model; since EDEMSA operates in an emerging market, a country risk premium was added as well. The equation therefore looks like this:\n\nKu = Rf + Bu ERP + Rp Ku = unlevered equity Rf = the risk free rate\n\nBu = the sensitivity of the share to market performance\n\nERP = Equity Risk Premium, the differential of the market historic performance on the risk free rate.\n\nRp = the country risk\n\n825.\n\nThe Rf was calculated based on the performance of thirty year treasury bonds. MBG calculated B with information provided by U.S. companies operating in the same sector as EDEMSA, since no comparable companies can be found locally in Argentina. Such is known as the bottom-up technique, and MBG used information from the same companies as in previous reports, such as Entergy Corp., Allegheny Energy Inc., or TECO Energy Inc. Further, the P coefficient for each of these selected companies has been calculated based on public information on shares and indices. See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraphs 215-6.\n\n826.\n\nSuch information became the source for a linear regression analysis between the performance of the adjusted price of each share and the S&P 500 index, and the slope of this linear regression was then calculated (P coefficient). See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraph 217.\n\n827.\n\nMBG next adjusted the P coefficients according to the adjusted beta, the capital structure adjustment, and the regulatory framework adjustment. See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraph 218.\n\n**(a) Adjustment of Beta**\n--------------------------\n\n828.\n\nRespondent\u2018s MBG report states that as time goes by companies tend to grow in size, diversify their risk exposure, and generate more stable cash flows. Thus, their risk profile of market risk exposure is configured (with P being equal to 1). This assumption is based on past empirical studies. See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraph 218.\n\n829.\n\nThe adjustment was done according to the following relationship:\n\nAdjusted P = 0.67P + 0.33\n\n830.\n\nMBG asserts that since the levered betas were influenced by the capital structure of each of the companies for which data was used, MBG corrected them and calculated the unlevered betas. Such was done according to the following relationship:\n\nLevered B = Bu [1 + D/E(1-t)]\n\n831.\n\nThe debt value used corresponds to book value, and the equity value was calculated as the price of the share multiplied by the number of shares issued. See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraph 218.\n\n832.\n\nIn terms of the regulatory framework adjustment, MBG states that because Argentina uses a price cap methodology, and the United States typically adopts a rate of return methodology, the P coefficient is corrected to reflect the differences in regulatory risk. See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraph 218.\n\n**(b) Calculation of other factors**\n------------------------------------\n\n833.\n\nMBG calculated the market risk premium as the differential between the market historic performance and the risk-free rate, and obtained a value of 7.6%. In addition, the country risk was determined as a structural historic premium of 7% for the post default periods, and 10% for the default and pre-default periods. See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraphs 219-20.\n\n834.\n\nMBG further elaborates that the country risk was estimated as a historic average using the EMBI+ Argentina index. Such is adjusted to remove the effects of the crisis that forced the Argentine government to recognize the need to default on its public debt as from 2001. According to MBG, such circumstances have impacted the measurements of the country risk index, which started to show ever increasing values as the investors expected a reduction in equity. See MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraphs 221-2.\n\n835.\n\nAccording to the MBG report, country premiums were excessive when the performance of a bond was calculated against its par value. Thus, MBG imposed a 10% ceiling to their historical average (from the value in the 2001 and 2002 valuations). In addition, in order to consider the average country risk premium for the month when the valuation is performed when calculating the discount rate, it is necessary to take a premium of 27.68% as of November 2001, of 44.38% as of December 2001, and 43.75% as of January 2002. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 223.\n\n836.\n\nMBG states that the reason their valuations capture deterioration of the projected cash flow profit expectations is because when default is imminent, investors make gradual correction in the economic performance estimation and of the sectors to which they have allocated funds as they get new information from the market. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 224.\n\n837.\n\nThe cost of equity (ke) was obtained by releveraging the P coefficients, and taking into account EDEMSA\u2018s shareholders\u2018 equity structure for each of the dates assessed. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 225.\n\n838.\n\nThe cost of debt and levered equity was calculated based upon a few different situations: See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 226.\n\na. Instances where there is no possibility of benefitting from the tax advantages of debt, so that the cost of equity, both levered and unlevered, is equal to the weighted average cost of equity and debt. This yields the following formula,\n\nKu = (E/D+E)Ke + (D/D+E)Kd\n\nb. Instances were tax benefits are incorporated in the discount rate, as suggested by the WACC methodology. Since there are then no illiquidity costs, the cost of debt can be inferred from the first relationship, and used in the second relationship to calculate the levered cost of equity. This yields the following equation,\n\nKwacc = (E/D+E)Ke + (D/D+E)Kd (1-t)\n\n839.\n\nThe report suggests using the second method because (i) EDEMSA\u2018s excess indebtedness greatly affected the cost of debt. However, shareholders transferred the losses resulting from this potential risk to their creditors in advance; this is indicated by the shareholders\u2018 benefits that came out of the company\u2018s debt restructuring, and (ii) the service provided by the company is a regulated utility, so the presence of illiquidity costs is not easy to determine in the medium or in the long term. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 227.\n\n840.\n\nMBG estimated a debt-to-equity ratio of 22% which is consistent with the values reported in 2001, 2002, and 2010. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 229.\n\n841.\n\nFurther, the Ku and the WACC rates obtained are used to discount the projected cash flows in the \"medium\" scenarios. The \"low\" and \"high\" scenarios use rates that result from increasing and reducing the Ku and WACC rates by 10%. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal at paragraph 231.\n\n**b) Respondent's Calculations**\n--------------------------------\n\n842.\n\nRespondent asserts the importance of avoiding double recovery, in the event that the Argentine Republic is found to have violated a BIT. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 40, 44.\n\n843.\n\nRespondent suggests that three facts be taken into account in order to avoid such double recovery. First, both Claimants and LECG acknowledge that EDEMSA\u2018s value is higher today than before privatization, despite the economic crisis. Second, Mendoza users are currently paying tariffs that are over 225% higher than the ones before the emergency measures, with inflation rates reaching 142%. Third, neither Mendoza nor Argentina derived any benefit from Claimants\u2018 sale of their interest in EDEMSA. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 41-3.\n\n**(1) Valuation Date and Amount**\n---------------------------------\n\n844.\n\nRespondent contends that the only way to avoid double recovery is for the Tribunal to only award compensation for the potential temporary damages sustained by shareholders between 2002 and 2005. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 45.\n\n845.\n\nAccording to Respondent, it is necessary to estimate the dividends that the shareholders would have received had the measures not been adopted, if the Tribunal considers the economic emergency measures to be a breach of the BIT. Such a method would be consistent with the one used in *LG&E.* See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 45-6.\n\n846.\n\nRespondent avers that the method of calculating compensation based on the payment of potential dividends is consistent with a compensation scheme based on payment of interest, which was mentioned by Pablo Spiller during the last hearing of 14 February 2011. In such a scheme, the period of compensation would be between January 2002 and March 2005, the period between the challenged measures and Claimants\u2018 sale of their interest in EDEMSA. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 47-8.\n\n847.\n\nFurthermore, the exclusion of the emergency period would have to be further analyzed. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 48.\n\n848.\n\nIn this connection, as the dividends that shareholders would have expected if the emergency measures not been adopted are estimated, measures that benefitted EDEMSA, like the suspension of service quality requirement, would also have to be excluded in the counterfactual scenario. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 49.\n\n849.\n\nRespondent also states that valuing a company entails calculating the present value of projected cash flows. Such should not include the tariff base. The projections that do factor in are a reduction in tariffs, a drop in the number of physical units sold, an increase in investments, or an increase in the WACC rate. The higher the expenses forecasted, the lower the value of the company. See Report on the Valuations Performed by LECG, at paragraphs 57-61. In LECG\u2018s valuation method, however, the value of a company changes little despite changes in these factors. See Report on the Valuations Performed by LECG, at paragraphs 63.\n\n850.\n\nTherefore, LECG\u2018s model is clearly wrong, as their model used to assess the value of EDEMSA restores the balance by simply increasing the tariff level in order to keep the value of the company unaltered. See Report on the Valuations Performed by LECG, at paragraphs 63-4.\n\n851.\n\nIn terms of numerical damage calculations, Respondent determined the value of EDEMSA and its equity as of 30 November 2001, 31 December 2001, 31 January 2002, and 31 January 2005. It then prepared these with the point of view of what a potential investor would be willing to pay for EDEMSA as of those dates, thus taking into account the information available as of such date, except regarding the future evolution of a few macroeconomic variables such as inflation or exchange rate. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal at paragraph 6.\n\n852.\n\nRespondent therefore suggests that as of 30 November 2001 the Business Value 100% is US$23.72 million; as of 31 December 2001 US$12.22 million, 31 January 2002 US$75.86 million; 31 January 2005 US$127.20 million; 31 January 2010 US$162.69 million. The equity value 100% as of 31 January 2010 is US$94.19 million. Claimants\u2018 equity value as of 31 January 2010 is US$ 42.27 million. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal at paragraph 7.\n\n853.\n\nIn Argentine Pesos, the business value 100% as of 30 November 2001 is 23.72 million ARS; as of 31 December 2001 12.22 million ARS; as of 31 January 2002 155.52 million ARS; as of 31 January 2005 371.93 million ARS; as of 31 January 2010 623.91 million ARS. The equity value 100% as of 31 January 2010 is 361.22 million ARS. Claimants\u2018 equity value as of 31 January 2010 is 162.12 million ARS. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal at paragraph 7.\n\n854.\n\nNext, Respondent determined the value of EDEMSA and Claimants\u2018 interest in the company\u2018s equity as of 31 December 2001 and 31 January 2002, which are the before and after valuations. The Tribunal requires adjustment of the official valuations for these dates, considering the economic performance of the company during the 1998-2002 period. The business values 100% are as follows: before (31 December 2001), the low value is US$-28.42 million; the medium value is US$-28.31 million; the high value is US$-27.36 million. After (31 January 2002), the low value is US$10.38 million; the medium value is US$22.73 million; the high value is US$40.44 million. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal at paragraph 9.\n\n855.\n\nRespondent then determined the value of EDEMSA and its equity as of 31 January 2002, 31 January 2005, and 31 January 2010, with two values calculated for each date. The first was prepared as if the economic emergency measures had not been applied (referred to as \"but-for valuations\") and the second was prepared with the emergency measures in mind (referred to as \"actual valuations\"). The business values 100% are as follows: for actual valuations as of 31 January 2002 the low value is US$54.3 million; the medium value is US$64.73 million; the high value is US$78.64 million. The but-for valuations as of 31 January 2002 is a low value of US$-26.77 million, the medium value is US$-26.98 million, and the high value is US$-26.62 million. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal at paragraph 11.\n\n856.\n\nThe business values 100% for January 31 2005 is as follows: the actual valuations produce a low value of US$103.15 million, a medium value of US$119.76 million, and a high value of US$141.22 million. The but-for valuations produce a low value of US$15.45 million, a medium value of US$-13.19 million, and a high value of US$-9.86 million. In addition, the equity value 100% puts the high value as of 31 January 2005 at US$12.33 million, and a high Claimants\u2018 equity value at US$5.53 million. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal at paragraph 11.\n\n857.\n\nFurthermore, on 31 January 2010 the Actual scenario places EDEMSA\u2018s value at US$148.53 million for the low value, the medium value is US$170.8 million, and a high value of US$198.72 million. The but-for valuations produce a low value of US$18.97 million, a medium value of US$24.01 million, and a high value of US$30.5 million. In addition, the actual valuation equity value 100% is placed at US$78.76 million for the low value, US$101.03 million of the medium value, and $128.95 million as a high value. Claimants\u2018 Equity value for the actual valuation as of 31 January 2010 is US$35.35 million for the low value, US$45.34 million for a medium value, and US$57.87 million as a high value. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal at paragraph 11.\n\n858.\n\nThus, Respondent asserts that the economic emergency measures helped EDEMSA\u2018s shareholders, in that without the company would have been worth much less in 2002, 2005, and 2010. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 11.\n\n859.\n\nRespondent also provides the value of EDEMSA\u2018s debt in 2002, as they assert that the nominal value of EDEMSA\u2018s debt exceeded the value of its assets as of 31 January 2002. Therefore the company\u2018s financial debt as of such date must be considered equivalent to the value of its assets. The values of EDEMSA\u2018s financial debt arising from the 2002 valuation and from the after valuation, both performed in 31 January 2002, are as follows: the assets value in the 2002 valuation is US$75.9 million, and US$22.7 million in the after valuation. The debt value is calculated as US$75.9 million in the 2002 valuation and US$22.7 million in the after valuation. Finally, the equity value is calculated as 0 in the 2002 valuation and 0 in the after valuations. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 14.\n\n860.\n\nOverall, therefore, Respondent asserts that Claimants\u2018 equity in EDEMSA had no value at the time immediately preceding the adoption of the economic emergency measures. EDEMSA\u2018s poor operating performance until late 2001, high debt levels, and the economic crisis before the adoption of the emergency measures meant a dilution in Claimants\u2018 investment in late 2001. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 19.\n\n861.\n\nThus, Respondent contends that the Argentine Government\u2018s adoption of the economic emergency measures is thus what saved Claimants\u2018 equity from suffering an even greater depreciation. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal, at paragraph 19.\n\n**(2) Damages Caused by Law No. 25,561 and Subsequent Provincial Measures**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n862.\n\nRespondent contends that EDEMSA\u2018s average value in January 2010 was 28% higher in U.S. Dollars than before privatization, which demonstrates that the emergency measures did not damage EDEMSA. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Report, at paragraph 6.\n\n863.\n\nIn this connection Respondent avers that EDEMSA\u2018s value is also higher in real terms in 2010 than before the privatization. To prove such, Respondent takes into account U.S. inflation rates when doing their calculations. The results of such demonstrate that even after adjusting at constant value, investment in EDEMSA has maintained its value despite the economic crisis. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Report, at paragraphs 11-7.\n\n864.\n\nRespondent then goes on to suggest that EDEMSA\u2018s value is higher than the one put forth by Claimants because LECG makes a significant methodological error in their calculations. EDEMSA received a tariff increase of over 50% in August 2009, but LECG incorrectly projects cash flows for the subsequent years as if the increase was around 20%. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Report, at paragraphs 20-1. Such is because LECG uses the 2009 annual value, which is lower since the tariff increase happened at the end of the year. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Report, at paragraph 23.\n\n865.\n\nUsing LECG\u2018s corrected calculations, valuations show that before the privatization (valued in U.S. dollars as of January 2010) EDEMSA had a median value of US$301,744,372. As of January 31 2010, EDEMSA\u2018s median value was US$428,240,390; the percentage difference is thus 41.9%. See Respondent\u2018s PostHearing Report, at paragraph 25.\n\n866.\n\nThus, Respondent argues that the only conclusion is that EDEMSA was not damaged by the emergency measures, since the value today is higher than the value before privatization. In addition, any temporary fluctuation in the value of the company, or nonexistent potential damage, would be justified by the severity of the economic crisis. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Report, at paragraphs 27-30.\n\n**(3) Interest**\n----------------\n\n867.\n\nRespondent asserts that only a simple interest should be applied to losses alleged by Claimants. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraph 875.\n\n868.\n\nThey contend that this position is confirmed by international case law, as well as legal scholars. In this connection, Claimants\u2018 position that the developing trend is that compound, as opposed to simple, interest is applied is false, and would require departing from general public international law. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraph 876.\n\n869.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Argentina-France BIT clearly states that an \"appropriate\" interest rate is to be applied. Claimants\u2018 claim that the update rate should be the WACC rate is unreasonable, and not consistent with the treaty. The only purpose of using such a rate would be to artificially and spectacularly increase the amount claimed. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraphs 876-9.\n\n870.\n\nIn light of the treaty provisions a reasonable rate would be the interest rate of the U.S. Treasury Bills interest rate or the London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Respondent argues that such is more appropriate, since the Argentina-France BIT calls for an \"appropriate\" interest rate. Also, there are no reasonable grounds in arbitral practice for the kind of interest applied by LECG in their calculations. See Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial at paragraph 726.\n\n**(4) Attorneys' Fees, Costs of Arbitration and Administrative Expenses**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n871.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants should pay all expenses and costs for this proceeding, as they are at fault for any damage to their investment, and any objections raised were legitimately made according to Respondent\u2018s rights under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, and therefore are not a reasonable means by which to hold Argentina liable for Claimants\u2018 expenses and costs. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraphs 880-81.\n\n872.\n\nIn addition, Respondent asks for Claimants to pay interest on the costs and expenses incurred by the Argentine Republic. See Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Brief on the Merits, at paragraph 306.\n\n**(5) Claimants' Bad Business**\n-------------------------------\n\n873.\n\nRespondent asserts that Argentina is not at fault for any damage to Claimants\u2018 investment. This is because Claimants decided to sell their interests in EDEMSA as part of a global policy that had nothing to do with Argentina, and resulted in \"fire-sale prices.\" See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum at paragraph 31, 34.\n\n874.\n\nThis sale happened despite the fact that by the time the sale was concluded a 38.05% tariff increase had already been announced. This increase was followed by additional tariff increases of 51% and 56%. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum at paragraphs 31-2.\n\n875.\n\nAccording to Respondent Mendoza, Respondent, and the users of the local distributor did not benefit from the withdrawal of Claimants as shareholders of EDEMSA. They also did not benefit from the huge profits IADESA made in buying EDEMSA from Claimants and subsequently selling it to Andes Energia PLC. They also have not benefitted from Andes Energia PLC\u2018s current success. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum at paragraphs 35-9.\n\n876.\n\nRespondent suggests that Claimants may have made a bad deal in deciding to sell EDEMSA before its debt was restructured, before the tariff increases occurred, and before the recovery of the economy. Claimants cannot, however, use BITs to compensate for their bad business choices. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum at paragraphs 38-9, 57.\n\n**(6) Pre-Emergency (Historic) Damages**\n----------------------------------------\n\n877.\n\nWith respect to quantum for pre-emergency (historic) damages, Respondent does not appear to propose any figures which contrast with those offered by Claimants\u2018 experts. However, with respect to the Polvaredas claim, Respondent seems to suggest that some compensation might be due, although without any precision on the amount. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 791.\n\n**E. COSTS**\n------------\n\n**1. Claimants**\n----------------\n\n878.\n\nOn 16 February 2012, Claimants filed their Costs Submission in accordance with the Tribunal\u2018s request of 30 January 2012 and the extension of time it granted on 8 February 2012. Claimants\u2018 indicated total costs of US$ 15,786,490.54, including *inter alia* the fees and expenses of international and Argentine counsel, fees of Claimants\u2018 experts, and payments made to ICSID.\n\n**2. Respondent**\n-----------------\n\n879.\n\nOn 16 February 2012, Respondent filed its Planilla de Costos in accordance with the Tribunal\u2018s request of 30 January 2012 and the extension of time it granted on 8 February 2012. Respondent indicated costs in the total amount of US$ 3,640,566.77. including *inter alia* expenses of the Legal Team from the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, fees of Respondent\u2018s experts, and payments made to ICSID.\n\n**IV. PRAYERS FOR RELIEF**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. CLAIMANTS**\n----------------\n\n880.\n\nClaimants\u2018 seeks the following relief:\n\n\u2022 declaration that Respondent has violated its treaty obligations under the Argentina-France BIT by failing to provide to Claimants and their investment (i) Fair and Equitable Treatment, (ii) treatment equivalent to that afforded to nationals; (iii) prompt and adequate compensation for indirect expropriation; and/or (iv) full protection and security;\n\n\u2022 declaration that Respondent has violated its duty under the Treaty\u2018s MFN Clause by failing to (i) abstain from enacting discriminatory, arbitrary, unreasonable or unjustified measures; and/or (ii) respect specific commitments undertaken in connection to Claimants\u2018 investment;\n\n\u2022 finding that neither the \"necessity\" doctrine under customary international law nor any treaty provision or principle of domestic or international law excuses Argentina from its obligation to compensate Claimants for breaches of the Argentina-France BIT;\n\n\u2022 award of damages for (i) US$ 7.2 million at interest representing injuries caused by the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession ; and (ii) at least US$ 123.9 million at interest representing injuries caused by the Emergency Laws and ensuing failure of the Renegotiation Process. The Tribunal notes that Claimants\u2018 PostHearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraphs 45 thru 47, states that the damages would be US$ 147.8 million based on their own bid for EDEMSA, or US$ 125.2 million on the assumption that Claimants had paid the amount offered by the second highest bidder for the EDEMSA. In either event, Claimants would subtract the actual price received from IADESA on sale of EDEMSA on 30 March 2005, which is to say US$ 2 million discounted to US$ 1.3 million as of 31 December 2001; and\n\n\u2022 order directing Respondent to bear at interest the full costs and expenses of this proceeding, including attorneys\u2018 fees.\n\n**B. RESPONDENT**\n-----------------\n\n881.\n\nRespondent seeks the following relief:\n\n\u2022 the complete dismissal of all claims filed by Claimants; and\n\n\u2022 an order directing Claimants to bear at interest the full costs and expenses of this proceeding, including attorneys\u2018 fees.\n\n**V. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. APPLICABLE LEGAL NORMS**\n-----------------------------\n\n**1. Argentina-France BIT**\n---------------------------\n\n882.\n\nAlthough common ground that the Tribunal must look to the terms of the Argentina-France BIT, Respondent urges that the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT also becomes relevant as to claims derived through shares at one time owned by Claimant Le\u00f3n, a Luxembourg company.\n\n883.\n\nIn particular, Respondent asserts applicability of Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, which provides that investments shall enjoy protection and security, but without prejudice to \"measures necessary for the maintenance of public order.\"\n\n884.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants do not base their substantive request for relief on the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, except to the extent of provisions that might be incorporated by reason of the Most Favored Nation clause in the Argentina-France BIT. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits at paragraph 59.\n\n885.\n\nWhile Claimants did invoke the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT in their Request for Arbitration, as well as certain subsequent pleadings, they did so only insofar as that BIT might have been relevant to claims by Le\u00f3n. Claimant further noted that the relevant interests were held at the outset entirely by French companies.\n\n886.\n\nAt present, French investors again own all of the shares considered by the Tribunal in its findings of liability and quantum, including any which for a time were owned by Le\u00f3n. Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais (incorporated in France) was the initial owner of the relevant shares, which were subsequently transferred to Le\u00f3n, its wholly-owned subsidiary. Ultimately those shares were acquired by EDFI, at which point all of Le\u00f3n\u2018s rights to the ICSID claim were ceded to EDFI, a French investor which now possesses all relevant rights. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits, paragraphs 59-60.\n\n887.\n\nAccordingly, Claimants\u2018 claims may be decided solely on the basis of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n888.\n\nHad the Tribunal decided to grant relief on the basis of Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, then indeed the \"public order\" defense of that provision might have had consequences. Such is not the case, however.\n\n889.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal need take no position on whether the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT might apply in the abstract to the \"public defense\" question. It is enough to note that relief granted rests on the Argentina-France BIT,71 and more significantly, that the recovery ordered by this Tribunal in no way implicates Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT. Thus Argentina\u2018s reliance on that provision becomes moot.\n\nClaimants\u2018 principal Memorial of 2 May 2005 states in footnote 142, at pages 138-39, that the Luxembourg BIT will be invoked only to the extent the Tribunal determines that Le\u00f3n\u2018s \"substantive claims are more appropriately invoked under the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT.\" As indicated in the Tribunal\u2018s analysis, however, recovery has been based on the Argentina-France BIT, either by virtue of Articles 3 (Fair and Equitable Treatment) or 4 (Most Favored Nation). Any reference to a BIT other than the one concluded between Argentina and France becomes relevant only as incorporated into Argentina\u2018s duty pursuant to Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT, which imposes treatment no less favorable than that treatment accorded to investors of the most favored nation.\n\n890.\n\nAs discussed more fully below, the Tribunal has granted recovery to Claimants based only on (i) Article 3 of the Argentina-France BIT (Fair and Equitable Treatment) and (ii) Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT (Most Favored Nation Treatment) as it brings into consideration the so-called \"umbrella clauses\" of Argentina\u2018s BIT\u2018s with Germany and Luxembourg, requiring respect for the commitments undertaken with respect to investors.72\n\nThe Tribunal need take no position on the \"umbrella clause\" in the contested Argentina-Greece BIT, given that the analogous provisions of the German and Luxembourg treaties provide sufficient basis for analysis of Claimants prayers for relief.\n\n**2. Vienna Convention**\n------------------------\n\n891.\n\nThe Tribunal looks to the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties in interpreting both the Argentina-Luxembourg and Argentina-France BITs.\n\n892.\n\nArticle 31 (\"General rule of interpretation\") of the 1969 Vienna Convention provides as follows:\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\n4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n893.\n\nArticle 32 (\"Supplementary means of interpretation\") of the 1969 Vienna Convention reads:\n\nRecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n894.\n\nArticle 27 (\"Internal law and observance of treaty\") of the 1969 Vienna Convention prescribes as follows:\n\nA party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. This rule is without prejudice to article 46.\n\n895.\n\nArticle 53, which is titled, \"Treaties conflicting with a peremptory norm of general international law (\u2018jus cogens\u2018)\", provides:\n\nA treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law. For the purposes of the present Convention, a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.\n\n**3. Consideration of Other Arbitral Awards**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n896.\n\nThe Parties have cited prior decisions or awards rendered in other investment arbitrations, either to support their own contentions or to distinguish persuasive authority suggested by the other side.\n\n897.\n\nAlthough not bound by previous decisions of other international tribunals, the Tribunal has given them due consideration with the aim of enhancing consistent interpretation of comparable treaty language as applied to similar fact patterns, thereby promoting the legitimate expectations of both host states and foreign investors.\n\n**4. The Interaction of Argentine Law and International Law**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n898.\n\nIt is common ground that Treaty Article 8(4) imposes a choice of law as follows:\n\nThe arbitration organization shall rule based on the provisions of this Agreement, on the laws of the Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute [Argentina] \"including rules relating to conflicts of laws\"and on the terms of any special agreements made in connection with the investment, and on the principles of International Law on the subject.\n\n899.\n\nThe Parties also agree that lacunae in the Treaty must be supplemented by international law. In this respect, the Tribunal provisionally concluded in paragraph 65 of its Decision on Jurisdiction that \"[i]n the merits phase of the arbitration the Tribunal may well need to supplement this treaty framework with consideration of additional sources of law or principles of construction.\"\n\n900.\n\nThe Parties diverge, however, with respect to the role of Argentine law in determining international responsibility.\n\n901.\n\nClaimants contend the Argentina-France BIT and customary international law define the nature and scope of their rights as well as the standards against which the Parties\u2018 conduct will be assessed. In this connection, the Tribunal notes the Expert Report by Dr. Alberto Bianchi which opines that the Argentine Constitution ranks treaties as superior to and overriding inconsistent local laws. Bianchi Report, paragraph 70.\n\n902.\n\nThus Claimants consider Argentine law relevant only as it relates to the factual matrix of the case. In support of their position (Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 248-49) Claimants cite *LG&E* (Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006) as well as *Azurix v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12 (Award, 14 July 2006). The latter case suggests at paragraphs 67 that \"the law of Argentina should be helpful in the carrying out of the Tribunal\u2018s inquiry into the alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement to which Argentina\u2018s law applies, but it is only an element of the inquiry because of the treaty nature of the claims under consideration\"\n\n903.\n\nBy contrast, Respondent argues that Argentine law is essential in determining the nature and scope of Claimants\u2018 treaty-based rights as well as in deciding whether a breach of such rights has occurred.\n\n904.\n\nAfter due consideration of the Parties\u2018 arguments, the Tribunal finds that in the context of its mandate under the Argentine-France BIT, the terms of that treaty provide the lodestar for decision. It may well be that a national court deciding analogous issues would come to a different conclusion. However, in the present dispute the BIT supplies the primary foundation and framework for the Tribunal\u2018s consideration of investor protection.\n\n905.\n\nThe Tribunal finds support in its view from the provisions of Article 27 of the 1969 Vienna Convention, which precludes a state from \"invok[ing] the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform.\"\n\n906.\n\nIn addition, Article 3 of the 2001 International Law Commission\u2018s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts provides that the characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful \"is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.\"\n\n907.\n\nThus the legality of Respondent\u2018s acts under national law does not determine their lawfulness under international legal principles. The fact that the Argentine Supreme Court has vested Respondent with robust authority during national economic crises does not change the Tribunal\u2018s analysis.\n\n908.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that arbitrators in other cases have reached a similar conclusion. The *LG&E* Decision on Liability at paragraph 94 finds that \"[i]nternational law overrides domestic law when there is a contradiction[,] since a State cannot justify non-compliance of its international obligations by asserting the provisions of its domestic law.\" Similarly, in the Decision on Liability in *Suez v. Argentina*, the tribunal stated, \"Argentina may not avoid its treaty commitments with respect to the treatment to be accorded the Claimants by invoking the provisions of its internal law, regulations or administrative acts.\" See paragraph 65, Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. The Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, Decision on Liability, 30 July 2010.\n\n**5. Human Rights**\n-------------------\n\n909.\n\nIt is common ground that the Tribunal should be sensitive to international *jus cogens* norms, including basic principles of human rights. As defined by Article 53 of the Vienna Convention, such norms include standards \"accepted and recognized by the international community of States as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted.\"\n\n910.\n\nThe Parties, however, disagree over the application and scope of those norms. In Respondent\u2018s view, the Emergency Tariff Measures guaranteed free enjoyment of certain basic human rights such as life, health, personal integrity and education, which were directly threatened by the socio-economic crisis suffered by Argentina.\n\n911.\n\nBy contrast, Claimants argue that no *jus cogens* norms were threatened. According to Claimants, commonly recognized examples of *jus cogens* norms include prohibitions against genocide or slave trading, not a right of Argentine citizens to consume electricity at reduced prices.\n\n912.\n\nThe Tribunal does not call into question the potential significance or relevance of human rights in connection with international investment law. However, regardless of any political wisdom in a temporary pesification or provisional freeze of tariffs during the period of crisis, no showing has been made that Argentina was not able to comply with the relevant treaty provisions later, through a rectification of the economic equilibrium which had been disrupted by the Emergency Measures.\n\n913.\n\nThe imbalance of EDEMSA\u2018s economic equilibrium, as compared with the Claimants\u2018 legitimate expectations pursuant to the Currency Clause, persisted beyond the end of the third quarter 2002, when economic indicators in Argentina showed a stable trend toward recovery. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits, at paragraph 179 (citing to Arriazu\u2018s Supplementary Expert Report, at paragraphs 100-109).\n\n914.\n\nIn short, no evidence persuades the Tribunal that Respondent\u2018s failure to re-negotiate tariffs in a timely fashion, so as to re-establish the economic equilibrium to which Claimants were entitled under the Concession Agreement\u2018s Currency Clause, was necessary to guarantee human rights.\n\n**B. DISCRIMINATORY INTENT AS PREREQUISITE TO RECOVERY**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n915.\n\nRespondent argues that this Tribunal has set forth a requirement that Claimants must prove discrimination in order to recover. In this connection, Respondent cites to paragraph 146 of the Tribunal\u2018s Decision on Jurisdiction of 5 August 2008, which states as follows:\n\nTo establish treaty breaches, Claimants must prove that Respondent\u2018s enactment and implementation of the Emergency Measures constituted discriminatory behavior as defined in the French and Luxembourg investment treaties. The Tribunal would need to examine *inter alia* Respondent\u2018s motives and the impact of the Emergency Measures, and whether they constituted an attempt to deprive Claimants of their rights simply because they were foreign investors.\n\n916.\n\nWhen read in context, the quoted language does not require discrimination as a necessary pre-requisite to recovery. Rather, the relevant language addressed Respondent\u2018s jurisdictional objection pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n917.\n\nIn that connection, the Tribunal had to consider whether Claimants had demonstrated *prima facie* that the present dispute bore a direct relationship to their investments. Decision on Jurisdiction of 5 August 2008, at paragraph 142.\n\n918.\n\nIn finding that such a relationship existed, and for that purpose alone, the Tribunal noted Claimants\u2018 allegations about a pattern of discriminatory conduct.\n\n919.\n\nThe Tribunal then went on to say that Respondent would be given an opportunity to test such contentions, with Claimants bearing the burden of proving the alleged discrimination.\n\n920.\n\nThe Tribunal laid down no general requirement of discrimination as a basis for liability under relevant treaty provisions, but simply stated that any allegations of treaty breach based on discrimination would need to be proven by Claimants.\n\n**C. CLAIMS AND DEFENSES**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Specific Commitments: MFN Incorporation of Umbrella Clauses**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) MFN Provisions**\n---------------------\n\n921.\n\nPursuant to the MFN Clause in Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT, each Contracting Party shall provide to the investors of the other Party, with respect to their investments and activities associated with such investments, \"a treatment no less favorable than that accorded to... investors of the most favored Nation.\"\n\n922.\n\nClaimants\u2018 assert that by virtue of the MFN Clause they are entitled to any substantive protections in third-party investment treaties which might be considered more favorable than those contained in the Argentina-France BIT. In particular, Claimants seek protection of their specific commitments under the so-called \"umbrella clauses\" in other bilateral investment treaties entered into by Argentina.73\n\nIn support of their argument, Claimants advance expert report of Dr. Dolzer, wherein he opines that specific commitments undertaken in connection with Claimants\u2018 investment in EDEMSA are \"contained in the national and provincial regulatory framework, and in the Concession Agreement.\" Supplementary Report of Dr. Rudolf Dolzer, at paragraph 189.\n\n923.\n\nIn this connection, Claimants invoke Article 10(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, which provides as follows: \"Each of the Contracting Parties shall respect at all times the commitments it has undertaken with respect to investors of the other Party.\" In addition, Claimants invoke Article 7(2) of the Argentina-Germany BIT, which reads: \"Each Contracting Party shall comply with any other commitment undertaken in connection with the investments made by nationals or companies from the other Contracting Party in the former\u2018s territory.\"\n\n924.\n\nRespondent sets forth a multi-tier defense against incorporation of the \"umbrella clauses\" through the MFN Clause.\n\n925.\n\nFirst, Respondent asserts that the principle of *ejusdem generis* effectively bars Claimants from invoking substantive protections of a kind not explicitly contained in the Treaty itself. In Respondent\u2018s view, \"umbrella clauses\" constitute exceptions to the fundamental principle of customary international law that a breach of domestic law does not give rise to international responsibility. Respondent argues that such exceptions by their very nature must be considered to be specifically negotiated.74\n\nIn this connection, Respondent further argues *inter alia* that \"umbrella clauses\" are (i) consensual obligations arising independently of investment treaties rather than covering general requirements imposed by the law of the host state; (ii) not entered *into erga omnes* but with regard to particular persons; and (iii) obligations that do not transform into something else.\n\n926.\n\nIn support of its position, Respondent cites *inter alia* to Article 9(1) of the U.N. Draft Articles on the MFN Clause, which reads as follows: \"Under a most-favoured-nation clause the beneficiary State acquires, for itself or for the benefit of persons or things in a determined relationship with it, only those rights which fall within the limits of the subject matter of the clause.\"\n\n927.\n\nRespondent further argues that even if the scope of the MFN Clause is found to incorporate \"umbrella clauses,\" the Concession Agreement was signed with EDEMSA, and thus that Claimants lack contractual privity.\n\n928.\n\nFinally, Respondent contends that applying \"umbrella clauses\" to enforce provisions set forth in the Concession Agreement would lead to the forum selection clause contained therein, which grants exclusive jurisdiction to the administrative courts of the City of Mendoza.\n\n929.\n\nAfter due consideration of the Parties\u2018 arguments, the Tribunal concludes that the MFN clause does in fact permit recourse to the \"umbrella clauses\" of third-country treaties, which leads to arbitration rather than the administrative courts of the City of Mendoza.\n\n930.\n\nIn this connection, it is necessary to reject Respondent\u2018s argument based on the forum selection clause in Article 40 of the Concession Agreement. Claimants were not party to that Concession. Their claim rests on breach of investment treaties, which as such clearly fall within the Tribunal\u2018s jurisdiction.\n\n931.\n\nThere is nothing mysterious about the fact that the same acts may constitute both a contractual breach and a violation of relevant treaty obligations. This Tribunal\u2018s competence rests on the alleged violation of the \"umbrella clause\" in the relevant investment treaties as incorporated through the MFN clause in the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n932.\n\nTo ignore the MFN clause in this case would permit more favorable treatment to investors protected under third countries, which is exactly what the MFN Clause is intended to prevent.\n\n933.\n\nThe Tribunal finds unconvincing a narrow interpretation of Article 8(1) of the Argentina-France BIT which seeks to restrict the application of the MFN clause. The dispute in question clearly arises under the Argentine-France BIT even though that treaty, by its terms, incorporates some provisions from other conventions. To interpret the BIT otherwise would effectively read the MFN language out of the treaty. Such a result cannot be what the two countries intended by the treaty language.\n\n934.\n\nNothing in Article 9(1) of the ILC Draft Articles on the MFN Clause changes this result. In giving effect to the MFN provisions, the Tribunal does not in any way accord investors anything other than \"those rights which fall within the limits of the subject matter of the clause.\"\n\n935.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that a divergence of opinion exists with respect to application of MFN clauses. In particular, many arbitral tribunals hesitate in looking to jurisdictional and procedural terms of third-country treaties, as contrasted to more substantive provisions. Opinion remains particularly divided with respect to wholesale importation of third-country treaty dispute resolution mechanisms.\n\n936.\n\nThe Tribunal need take no position on this debate about the interaction of MFN clauses with jurisdictional and procedural provisions. Our current decision simply brings into consideration the clearly substantive provisions requiring respect for explicit host state undertakings such as concession agreements.\n\n937.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes the MFN Clause in Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT permits Claimants to incorporate the \"umbrella clauses\" from the Argentina-Luxembourg or Argentina-Germany BITs.\n\n**b) Scope of Umbrella Clauses**\n--------------------------------\n\n938.\n\nThe \"umbrella clauses\" in question are broadly worded. A clear and ordinary reading of these dispositions covers commitments undertaken with respect to investors, or undertaken in connection with investments. The Tribunal notes that Article 10(2) of the Argentina-Luxemburg BIT covers commitments \"undertaken *with respect to investors* \" while Article 7(2) of the German BIT, even broader in scope, covers \"commitment *undertaken in connection with the investments*.\"\n\n939.\n\nConcession agreements granted to foreign investors for specific investments, such as those at issue in this arbitration, fall within the protection of an \"umbrella clause.\"\n\n940.\n\nThis does not mean that all contractual breaches necessarily rise to the level of treaty violation. However, the serious repudiation of concessions obligations implicated by failure to respect the currency clause (Concession Anexo II, Subanexo 2) must clearly be seen as a violation of \"commitments... undertaken with respect to investors\" (Article 10(2), Argentina-Luxembourg BIT) and \"a commitment undertaken in connection with the investments made by nationals or companies from the other Contracting Party\" (Article 7(2), Argentina-Germany BIT).\n\n941.\n\nThe present case clearly implicates governmental acts. The regulatory changes implemented by the Republic of Argentina and the Province of Mendoza include the freeze of tariff rates, change in operative exchange rates, and regulation of the distribution of electricity. Respondent has admitted that the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession were exercises of the Province\u2018s sovereign capacity. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 727.\n\n942.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 12 of the Concession Agreement makes explicit mention of shareholders. That provision prohibits shareholders from transferring EDEMSA shares without prior consent from EPRE. Respondent itself mentions at paragraph 231 of its Counter-Memorial that \"the Concession Agreement required authorization by the Executive Power for the transfer of EDEMSA\u2018s majority shareholding \u2018only\u2018 during the first 5 years of the agreement\u2018s effective date.\"\n\n**c) Risk Allocation**\n----------------------\n\n943.\n\nThe Concession Agreement constitutes a concrete commitment to the Claimants\u2018 investment. Consistent with Professor Dolzer\u2018s view, the Tribunal finds that the relevant \"umbrella clauses\" oblige Argentina to abide by its commitments in the Concession Agreement.\n\n944.\n\nIn addressing Respondent\u2018s conduct in connection with the Concession Contract, the Tribunal does not act as a judge of contract questions, but rather as a tribunal considering treaty matters, in particular the specific commitments protected by the \"umbrella clause.\"\n\n945.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2018s consideration of the Concession Agreement through the lens of the applicable \"umbrella clauses\", particular attention must be paid to Anexo II, Subanexo 2, titled Calculation of Tariff Schedule Parameters (C\u00e1lculo de los Par\u00e1metros del Cuadro Tarifario). This provision provides in Section I, \"All the aforementioned costs shall be calculated and recalculated in U.S. dollars. The recalculated or resulting Rate Structure shall be expressed in Argentine pesos ($) at the time it is applied to the user invoices, at the peso conversion rate established in National Decree 2128/91, Article 3, and under the conditions established in [Federal] Law [No.] 23,298 [text corrected by hand to read: \"23,928\"].\"\n\n946.\n\nThe Currency Clause\u2018s cross-references to the Convertibility Law point to a federal legislation and its implementing executive order, respectively passed and issued in March and October of 1991, seven years prior to the signing of the Concession Agreement, as part of a national policy on economic reform instituted in the late-1980\u2018s and early-1990\u2018s. Upon its implementation, the Convertibility Law pegged the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar at a foreign exchange rate of one to one (1:1), which lasted until 6 January 2002.\n\n947.\n\nThe Currency Clause operates pursuant to a mechanism elaborated in Article 43(c) of the Provincial Electricity Law. Tariff rates invoiced to consumers must reflect EDEMSA\u2018s costs of purchasing and distributing electricity as described in the first paragraph of Section I of Sub-Annex 2, namely, costs representing the purchase of electricity from the Electricity Wholesale Market as well as the transportation, distribution and commercialization of electricity. These costs are then coupled with the concessionaire\u2018s return on capital to make up what is referred to as the DAV, which passes the costs of distributing electricity through to the consumer.\n\n948.\n\nThus the Currency Clause operates both in relation to the component of the tariff which compensates the distributor and the cost of the electricity bought by the distributor in the wholesale market which gets passed through to the end-users.\n\n949.\n\nThe Currency Clause prescribes the calculation of these costs in terms of U.S. dollar currency for purposes of assessing the ultimate tariff rate to be invoiced to consumers. Subsequently, user invoices would be expressed in Argentine pesos in accordance with the monetary policy and exchange rate contemplated for in the Convertibility Law.\n\n950.\n\nThe Currency Clause\u2018s reference to \"recalculation\" of costs concerns the periodic adjustment of tariff rates to account for the inflation of electricity distribution costs. In this connection, Section IV of Sub-Annex 2 establishes the Cost-Adjustment Clause, which in pertinent part provides:\n\nThe Actual Distribution Costs and the Marketing Costs shall be recalculated each year to coincide with the updating of the Wholesale Energy and Power Prices for the seasonal period beginning in November each year and shall be in effect for the twelve (12) months following the recalculation. The following expression shall be used for the annual recalculation:....\n\n951.\n\nThe Currency Clause represents a clear allocation of risk as between the host state and the foreign investor as to matters covered by that clause. The Concession Agreement, by incorporating provisions of the Provincial Electricity Law, sets forth the terms and conditions granted to EDEMSA, including mechanisms to protect the concessionaire against risks related to fluctuation of the Argentine currency.\n\n952.\n\nRespondent\u2018s position seems to be that neither the Concession Agreement nor the Regulatory Framework supplied appropriate means to restore the balance between the rights of the concessionaire and those of the users during the Argentine Economic Turmoil. Respondent thus asserts that the tariff system contemplated under the Concession Agreement was inapplicable both from economic and legal perspectives. Enforcing the Concession would have caused serious damages to the Province and the users. In support, Respondent cites to *inter alia* the report of Professor Ismael Mata, who opines that in a scenario where the Convertibility Law was repealed the tariff system under the Concession Agreement became \"impractical and impossible for service users.\" Report of Ismael Mata, at paragraph 220.\n\n953.\n\nUpon review of the legal framework and contractual commitments summarized above, the Tribunal finds that the Currency Clause, by establishing the calculation and recalculation of tariffs in U.S. dollar terms, allocated to the Province of Mendoza risks associated with fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Argentine peso.\n\n954.\n\nSuch a finding imposes itself in light of the fact that many investment costs, such as the purchase of equipment available only outside Argentina, and assumption of debt in U.S. dollars, required payments in non-Argentine currency. In particular, assuming debt in U.S. dollars allowed long-term financing from the international capital markets at lower interest rates than available through borrowings of Argentine currency.\n\n955.\n\nTo protect the investor from inflation risks, the Cost-Adjustment Clause provided for a mechanism to maintain the real value of tariffs constant. As set forth in the Cost-Adjustment Clause, electricity distribution costs were to be recalculated in accordance with an index combining variations in the U.S. producer and consumer price indices. This in effect afforded Claimants the protection against inflation risks as the costs and expenses could be adjusted annually.\n\n956.\n\nUnder the Provincial Electricity Law Respondent explicitly guaranteed long-term political and regulatory stability for the Concession Agreement. The tariffs were to be determined in a way that afforded the concessionaire sufficient income to cover all costs associated with the distribution of electricity as well as to obtain a reasonable return on any investments made in that connection.\n\n957.\n\nWhat is more, the Concession Agreement contemplated tariff schedules of five-year terms subject to interim modification only on grounds of extraordinary variations in the cost structure of the distributor caused by unforeseen events beyond the control of the parties, and at the expiration of such term, subject to revision only in conformity with predetermined procedures in order to augment the stability of the Regulatory Framework.\n\n958.\n\nIn paragraphs 177 thru 181 of its Counter-Memorial, Respondent to some extent acknowledges the apprehension of foreign investors with respect to currency fluctuations. Respondent suggests that it was reckless for Claimants to take on foreign currency debts, given that Claimants themselves suspected that the fixed convertibility regime would be abandoned. Respondent asserts that \"[i]n the year when SODEMSA was awarded the concession, Argentina went into a recession and the possibility of currency devaluation was strong and increasing.\" Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraph 179.\n\n959.\n\nTaking Respondent\u2018s allegation on face value, the conclusion would favor Claimants. If indeed there was a fear of fixed convertibility being abandoned, then it would be natural for foreign investors to seek some mechanism to protect against currency risk. Contemplation that the fixed-exchange regime would end would lead logically to reliance on something such as the Currency Clause.\n\n960.\n\nHad the Currency Clause been conditioned on the Convertibility Law, the contract provision could have said so. Moreover, it would have been unnecessary for Respondent to have repealed the Currency Clause or Cost-Adjustment Clause through the Emergency Tariff Measures.\n\n961.\n\nLogic as well as specific Concession language run counter to any suggestion that Claimants\u2018 rights to calculate tariffs in U.S. dollars were to depend on survival of the Convertibility Law.\n\n962.\n\nThe Tribunal finds persuasive Claimants\u2018 quantum expert, LECG, to the effect that \"[t]he use of individualized contracts, as opposed to simply using regulatory frameworks based on general legislation, grants investors an additional protection against governmental opportunistic behavior, as general regulatory frameworks can be changed by new legislation, while changing contracts require, in principle, the agreement of both parties to the contract.\" Expert Report of LECG dated 28 April 2005, at paragraph 46.\n\n963.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the very purpose and effect of the Currency and Cost-Adjustment Clauses were to protect the actual value of the tariffs from the likelihood of devaluation or depreciation of the local currency.\n\n964.\n\nThe Currency Clause refers to the Convertibility Law because the exchange rate at the time of contract was established by that Law. In the event the Convertibility Law were to be repealed, the conversion from dollars to pesos would have to apply a new official exchange rate, if existent, or the then-current market rate.75\n\nThis view is supported by Claimants\u2018 expert, Dr. Bianchi, who opines as follows:  \n There is no reason preventing the continued validity of the right granted to the concessionaire once the Convertibility Law was extinguished[,]... this right would acquire economic meaning if the peso was rated below the dollar, for example, 2 AR$ = 1 US$. Similarly, and from the hermeneutics point of view, it is more reasonable to maintain that the contract has no lacunae, and therefore the repeal of the Convertibility Law shall not produce the loss of the clause, but its substitution with another, in this case the substitution of the parity fixed by the Convertibility Law with another parity or different exchange rate. See Supplementary Report of Dr. Alberto B. Bianchi, at paragraph 30.\n\n965.\n\nSuch finding is further supported by the text of the Currency Clause, requiring the recalculated costs to be expressed in pesos \"at the time it is applied to the user invoices.\" As explained by Dr. Bianchi, the phrase \"at the time\" implies that the contracting parties \"foresaw that the exchange rate might not be known in advance at the time of billing, which can occur only with floating exchange rates.\" See Supplementary Report of Alberto B. Bianchi, at paragraph 35.\n\n966.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered, but cannot subscribe to, Respondent\u2018s view that only a change in the exchange rate itself would be taken into account for purposes of currency stability. In support of its position, Respondent cites to EDF\u2018s \"Plan Directeur\" dated 31 March 1998, stating in pertinent part:\n\nRisques.- Le risque de change parait faible, la formule de convertibilit\u00e9 dans les tarifs permet d\u2018exprimer les co\u00fbts de distribution en dollars am\u00e9ricains lesquels sont actualis\u00e9s chaque ann\u00e9e au 1er novembre suivant deux index de l\u2018inflation am\u00e9ricaine. Le prix au client final est converti en Peso au moment de la facturation suivant le d\u00e9cret 2128/1991.\n\nTant que la convertibilit\u00e9 US$/Peso est garantie par la loi, la formule d\u2018indexation couvre correctement le risque de change. En revanche dans un sc\u00e9nario de crise du Peso, le d\u00e9cret 2118/1991 pourrait alors \u00eatre amend\u00e9. Dans ce cas, la formule ne pr\u00e9voit pas le risque du taux de change r\u00e9el du peso, ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se produit normalement apr\u00e8s un subite d\u00e9valuation (\u00ab effet tequila \u00bb).\n\n967.\n\nThe Tribunal interprets the quoted paragraphs as expressing concern with respect to the peso\u2018s real exchange rate. As recognized in that paragraph, repeal of the convertibility law would expose the concessionaire to risks from the real exchange rate by way of a sharp devaluation followed by sharp inflation: the so-called \"tequila effect\" in that context.76\n\nThe Tribunal need take no part with respect to the Parties\u2018 slight disagreement on the proper rendering of the final sentence of the French text. Respondent speaks of a \"risk of modification\" of the real exchange rate of the peso while Claimants translate the sentence to read \"risk of appreciation\" of the real exchange rate of the peso. Both translations purport to discuss the so-called \"tequila effect,\" a phrase originally coined to describe the impact of the 1994 Mexican economic crisis on the South American economy, when a sudden devaluation in the Mexican peso caused other currencies in the region to decline.\n\n968.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal reads the Currency Clause itself as clearly intended to protect the concessionaire from the effects of peso devaluation. Costs would be calculated in U.S. dollars to that end. The secondary material in the \"Plan Directeur\" does not change the protections granted by the Currency Clause.\n\n969.\n\nIf only the Convertibility Law were repealed, the Currency Clause would protect the concessionaire from being negatively affected by a subsequent change such as a floating US$/ARS exchange rate of 1 to 3. The cost calculation in U.S. dollars would allow the concessionaire to collect three times more pesos than before.77\n\nEven the writings of Respondent\u2018s regulatory expert, Mr. Sruoga, recognize that the Currency Clause served as a general protection against peso devaluation. See C234, Alejandro Sruoga, *El Proceso de C\u00e1lculo de los Cuadros Tarifarios de Empresas Distribuidoras de Electricidad*, Asociaci\u00f3n de Distribuidores de Energ\u00eda El\u00e9ctrica de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina (ADEERA), Buenos Aires, September 2000, at 81 (translating the Spanish original text in English, the relevant text reads, \"With respect to the currency risk: if the tariffs have been established in dollars in the concession contract, the margin of \u2018country risk\u2018 that might have otherwise corresponded in that regard does not exist.\").\n\n**d) Emergency Measures and Concession Agreement**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n970.\n\nThe Tribunal is convinced that the pesification and freeze of tariffs pursuant to the Emergency Measures breached Respondent\u2018s obligation to respect its contractual commitments.\n\n971.\n\nClaimants assert that Respondent has violated the specific commitments undertaken in connection with Claimants\u2018 investment by breaching the terms of the Concession Agreement. In support, Claimants cite to several ICSID decisions that have ruled in the investor\u2018s favor in this regard, including the *Sempra, Enron* and *CMS Gas* cases.78\n\n*Sempra v. Argentina*, (Award of 28 September 2007); *Enron v. Argentina*, (Award of 22 May 2007); *CMS Gas v. Argentina*, (Award of 12 May 2005).\n\n972.\n\nIn defense, Respondent argues that under Argentine law every concession involving a public utility must search for and materialize, to the extent possible, an equilibrium between the advantages agreed upon and the burdens imposed on the concessionaire, thereby guaranteeing by way of the principle of fair and reasonable tariffs, the original contractual equivalence and the defense of the economic interests of users. Respondent further argues that the Emergency Measures not only helped EDEMSA\u2018s economic and financial position but also were legitimate and reasonable means to maintain tariffs at fair and reasonable rates that allowed, in time, for the gradual economic and social recovery which would benefit all constituents.\n\n973.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal notes the double-edged nature of Article 43 of the Provincial Electricity Law when the privatization framework was initially established. On the one hand, this provision endorses a policy of fair and reasonable rates to consumers. On the other hand, the law allows transmission companies and distributors to cover relevant costs and to obtain a reasonable rate of return.\n\n974.\n\nArticle 43, in pertinent part, provides as follows:\n\nThe rates charged by electricity transmission companies and distributors shall be fair and reasonable and shall be subject to the following principles: (a) Rates shall afford transmission companies and distributors... the opportunity to derive sufficient income to cover any operating, maintenance and expansion costs and taxes applicable to the services, and to obtain a reasonable rate of return defined pursuant to the provisions of Article 46 of this law; (c) For distribution rates, the electricity sale price shall include the specific distribution costs inherent in the distribution business recognized to the concessionaire, and a term representative of the cost of electricity purchased in the wholesale electricity market, in a manner such that any variations in this market may be reflected in the rates applied to the respective users; (d) Ensure the minimum reasonable cost to users, compatible with the security of supply, service quality and rational use of energy[\u2026]\n\n975.\n\nConsistent with industry practice, reference to \"specific distribution costs\" in Article 43 connotes a term of art recognized in the electricity sector as including the cost of capital. See Supplementary Report of Carlos Bastos, at paragraph 22.\n\n976.\n\nIn light of the standard provided under Article 43, the Tribunal finds unconvincing Respondent\u2018s argument that maintenance of the Currency Clause and related provisions of the Concession Agreement would have extinguished the principle of fair and reasonable rates. To the contrary, the Currency Clause permitted the distributor to cover costs and receive a reasonable rate of return.\n\n977.\n\nAs admitted by Respondent, even the Argentine Constitution recognizes that tariffs must allow account for costs of the services provided as well as the distributor\u2018s profitability. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 386-87. Under Article 45 of the Provincial Electricity Law, tariff rates are in fact capped at levels allowing for a rate of return that is compatible with the risk level characterizing the electricity transmission and distribution businesses as well as other industries of comparable risk.\n\n978.\n\nThe evidence shows that by virtue of the price cap system in Articles 13, 22 and 23 of the Concession Agreement operating collectively, the only way Claimants could increase profitability was by reducing costs and increasing efficiency, rather than through an escalation of tariff rates.\n\n979.\n\nThe facts of the present case do not indicate that any unreasonable excess in profit would have resulted from EDEMSA\u2018s operation. Rather, following the enactment of the Emergency Measures, the investor\u2018s profitability was zero.\n\n980.\n\nDespite Article 29 of the Concession Agreement requiring strict adherence to the approved tariff schedules, Respondent abrogated the Concession Agreement provisions that incorporate substantive terms set forth in the Regulatory Framework at the time of privatization.\n\n981.\n\nNo evidence suggests that the Emergency Measures benefited EDEMSA\u2018s economic and financial position. Rather, the measures not only affected EDEMSA\u2018s profitability, but also drastically changed the tariff regime so as to fundamentally alter the economic equilibrium of the Concession Agreement.\n\n982.\n\nIn particular, the Tribunal finds that the Emergency Tariff Measures caused a *de facto* freeze on the tariffs, thus depriving Claimants from their protection under the Cost-Adjustment Clause, as well as pesification of the tariffs so as to require the conversion of the dollar-denominated tariffs into peso-denominated tariffs at a ratio of 1 to 1.\n\n983.\n\nThe Concession Agreement\u2018s terms were effectively modified by the Emergency Measures. Prior to enactment of the Emergency Laws, consumer invoices were calculated in U.S. dollars and then converted to pesos for purposes of billing. Pursuant to the fixed 1:1 exchange ratio established by the Convertibility Law, the nominal figures between the costs calculated in U.S. dollars and the converted amount in pesos would be equal.\n\n984.\n\nFollowing the repeal of the Currency Clause, however, such formula was skewed so as to force the same billing invoice amount in peso terms, even though the fixed convertibility system had been scrapped. The peso was consequently devalued three-fold. Accordingly, the billed amount to consumers was worth only a third of what it had been prior to 2002, which in effect deprived Claimants of its protection against currency risks.\n\n985.\n\nAs a result, Claimants experienced significant decline in their revenue, which in turn reduced the cash flows to a level insufficient to cover operational costs, commercial debt, taxes and interest payments, as well as to improve infrastructure. EDEMSA\u2018s equity value depreciated. What is more, EDEMSA experienced sharp increases in costs due to inflation, resulting in further imbalance between the revenue and operational expenses.\n\n986.\n\nThe financial equilibrium of EDEMSA was never restored. The imbalance of EDEMSA\u2018s economic equilibrium persisted beyond the end of the third quarter 2002, when economic indicators in Argentina showed a stable trend toward recovery. See Arriazu\u2018s Supplementary Expert Report, paragraphs 100-109, discussed in Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits at paragraph 179.\n\n987.\n\nThe Emergency Measures required EDEMSA to abide by its contractual obligations, thereby creating an asymmetry that further exacerbated injury to Claimants\u2018 investment during the thirty-eight (38) months the Renegotiation Process took place. All the while, the Province of Mendoza failed to raise tariffs in a timely manner such as to restore the economic equilibrium to its original balance when rates were set in U.S. dollars.\n\n988.\n\nAlthough the Government of Mendoza had eventually agreed to a series of DAV increases, the adjustments took effect only after Claimants had decided to withdraw their investments by executing a sales contract with IADESA on 30 June 2004.\n\n989.\n\nThe failure to renegotiate takes on significance by virtue of Respondent\u2018s outright breach of the Currency Clause under Anexo 2, Subanexo 2, Section 1, which expressly required tariff calculations in U.S. dollars. The breach by Respondent might well have been temporary if Argentina had made timely efforts to raise tariffs to a reasonable level, in which case the liability for breach would have been only theoretical.\n\n990.\n\nClaimants, however, waited more than three years following the Emergency Measures before selling their investment in an attempt to mitigate damages. Pursuant to Article 5 of Provincial Decree No. 487/2002, the Renegotiation Commission was initially required by law to complete new concession terms within 180 days. The Renegotiation Process, however, was repeatedly delayed by local authorities, which continued to extendthe deadline while maintaining the tariff freeze during the 38 months the Renegotiation Process took place.\n\n991.\n\nOn the other hand, the sale of the investment was negotiated, executed and performed in the context of an open renegotiation process. This circumstance and the consequences thereof are addressed *infra* in determining the quantum of damages.\n\n992.\n\nRespondent asserts that Claimants are at fault for EDEMSA\u2018s loss in value. According to Respondent, such losses were due to Claimants\u2018 overbidding of the purchase price, which was caused by defective due diligence and faulty macro-economic forecasts, as well as to Claimants\u2018 poor performance of EDEMSA\u2018s operations, and dangerous policies on debt financing and capital reduction.\n\n993.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2018s view any overbidding by Claimants does not bear on the alleged violations of Respondent\u2018s obligations under the Argentine-France BIT, which exist regardless of how much Claimants paid for their investment. Any impact of the overbidding process is addressed in connection with quantum, that is, in determining the amount of the investment for which Claimants should be compensated.\n\n**2. Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n994.\n\nUnder the facts of this arbitration, Respondent\u2018s breach of certain obligations under the applicable umbrella clause operates in tandem with breach of Article 3 of the Argentine-France BIT, providing a duty to accord Fair and Equitable Treatment.\n\n995.\n\nWithin a reasonable time following the state of emergency, Respondent should have moved to re-establish the economic equilibrium provided by the Concession Agreement following which had been pushed aside by failure to calculate tariffs in U.S. dollars as required by Concession Agreement Anexo II, Subanexo 2, discussed *supra*. That balance was never restored during the time Claimants owned their Argentine investment, notwithstanding three years in which Respondent had an opportunity to do so.\n\n996.\n\nRather, Respondent waited to restore the equilibrium until EDEMSA had been transferred to local Argentine ownership during the first half of 2005.\n\n997.\n\nThe Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession contravened explicit and important rights granted by Respondent to Claimants as an inducement to invest. The Renegotiation Process was conducted in such a way that Claimants were left little alternative but to mitigate their losses by selling their investment to a local buyer. Only after the 2005 sale was the originally-promised economic equilibrium restored, even though during the intervening period the Provincial Emergency Law explicitly obligated EDEMSA to continue complying fully with the Concession Agreement, thus further exacerbating its financial plight and creating a markedly unfair asymmetrical relationship.\n\n**a) Interpretation of Article 3 and the Legal Standard**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n998.\n\nArticle 3 of the Argentine-France BIT provides that \"Each of the Contracting Parties undertakes within its territory and its maritime zone to grant Fair and Equitable Treatment according to the principles of International Law to the investments made by the investors of the other Party, and to do so in such a way that the exercise of the right thus granted is not impaired *de facto* or *de jure*.\"\n\n999.\n\nThe Fair and Equitable Treatment clause under Article 3 obligated Respondent to respect international law in principle and in practice. The Tribunal need not decide whether Article 3 establishes an autonomous and independent standard of fairness or simply coincides with customary international minimum standard. In either event, failure to abide by express commitments without re-establishing economic balance in a reasonable period of time constitutes inequitable conduct.\n\n1000.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the various authorities cited by Respondent with respect to the minimum standard,79 including the well-known 1927 case of *Neer v. Mexico*.80 These arguments fail to address the difficulty in Respondent\u2018s behavior.\n\nRespondent cites to *Alex Genin et al. v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case ARB/99/2, Award of 25 June 2001, at paragraph 367; *Saluka Investments v. Czech Republic* (Partial Award, 17 March 2006), at paragraph 292; and *M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6, Award of 31 July 2007, at paragraph 369.\n\nSee *Neer v. Mexico*, published at 21 AM. J. INT\u2018L L. 555 (1927). Respondent argues that this \" *Neer* standard\" does not impose obligations to keep the investment unharmed, and sets a high benchmark for unfair treatment as evidenced by the ICSID annulment decision in *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. the Argentine Republic*, Case No. ARB/03/97, Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002, at paragraph 113.\n\n1001.\n\nArticle 3 nowhere mentions \"minimum standard\" as such, but rather speaks simply of principles of international law. The treaty thus invites consideration of a wider range of principles related to fairness and equity. Such principles include the duty to aim for respect of specific commitments, such calculation of tariffs in dollars.\n\n1002.\n\nEven if such specific commitments might be temporarily suspended during a state of emergency, fairness requires the host state to repair the economic balance within a reasonable time after the state of emergency has ended.\n\n1003.\n\nRespondent\u2018s reliance on NAFTA jurisprudence is equally unavailing. The very title NAFTA Article 1105(1) is \"Minimum Standard of Treatment.\" The Argentina-France BIT contains no such language. In this regard, the Tribunal\u2018s finding is further supported by the NAFTA Free Trade Commission\u2018s binding Note of Interpretation of 31 July 2001, which essentially instructed arbitral tribunals to take such a restrictive approach. Nothing of that nature has been introduced in connection with The Argentina-France BIT.\n\n1004.\n\nDelineation of the contours of the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard of the Argentina-France BIT depends on the factual context of the host state\u2018s actions, including the evolution of the prevalent economic and social conditions.\n\n1005.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful that the economic crisis is relevant to the interpretation of the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard. The investor\u2018s expectations must be balanced against the host state\u2018s need to take action in the public interest at a time of crisis. By the same token, an integral part of fairness and equity must be constituted by respect for fundamental representations of a concession after a state of emergency has passed and economic equilibrium can be restored.\n\n1006.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no support for Respondent\u2018s position in the *Glamis Gold decision*,81 an UNCITRAL proceeding involving NAFTA. As underscored above, this Tribunal must apply the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n*Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Award of 8 June 2009.\n\n1007.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes that Article 3 of the Argentine-France BIT protects against impairment of rights either \" *de facto* or *de jure\"* which leads to the following discussion of the renegotiation process by which Respondent rejected re-establishment of the economic equilibrium.\n\n**b) Emergency Measures and Renegotiation Process**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1008.\n\nThe Province of Mendoza had clearly embarked on a campaign to attract foreign investors in purchasing 51% of EDEMSA Class \"A\" shares. Respondents road shows and Info Memo promoted *inter alia* a foreign investor-friendly legal regime that provided investors with reasonable returns as well as a series of protections tailored to make the investment more appealing to foreign capital markets. Respondent gave specific guarantees and commitments that created strong expectations of a long-term investment subject to only *de minimis* political or regulatory risk. Key features of the sales pitch included (i) the creation of a regulatory agency with independent oversight to insulate investors from politically motivated measures and actions; (ii) the Currency Clause; (iii) the Cost Adjustment Clause; (iv) the Extraordinary Tariff Adjustment Clause; (v) an initial tariff schedule with a fixed-term of five years; and (vi) a concession with a duration of thirty years.\n\n1009.\n\nThe due diligence obligations of a concession bidder provide no basis for the Tribunal to ignore Argentina\u2018s duties under its investment treaty with France. The failure of the Province to raise tariffs in a timely manner, so as to restore balance when rates were set in U.S. dollars, constituted unfair and inequitable treatment in and of itself.\n\n1010.\n\nHad the provisions in the Currency Clause not existed, pesification and failure to restore the economic balance might not have figured as unfair and inequitable treatment. The effects of abrogation of that Currency Clause were to leave the investor with 33.3% of its bargain with the host state, with no repair of the damage in a reasonable time.\n\n1011.\n\nDespite economic indicators showing a stable recovery trend during the third quarter 2002 (Arriazu Supplementary Expert Report, paragraphs 100-109) the Renegotiation Process was inordinately delayed. The process was expected to be concluded originally within 6 months. Nevertheless, Argentina repeatedly delayed raising tariffs.\n\n1012.\n\nHad tariffs been raised in a timely fashion, any breach of the Currency Clause might have been rendered largely theoretical. Instead, the local authorities continued to extend deadlines while maintaining the tariff freeze.\n\n1013.\n\nIn this connection, the details of the EDFI Renegotiation Process merit restatement. On 15 January 2002, the Province of Mendoza, pursuant to Articles 8, 9 and 10 of Federal Law No. 25,561, enacted Provincial Law No. 6,976.\n\n1014.\n\nArticle 9 authorized the Government to renegotiate all public utility contracts. Through the Provincial Decree No. 487/2002 of 26 April 2002, the Government of Mendoza created the Renegotiation Commission, which, acting under the aegis of EPRE and the ME&PW, was commissioned to handle the renegotiation of the EDEMSA Concession Agreement.\n\n1015.\n\nPursuant to Article 5 of Provincial Decree No. 487/2002, which marked the beginning of the Renegotiation Process, the Renegotiation Commission was initially required by law to complete the new concession terms within a time frame of 180-days that ran from July 2002 until December 2002. The renegotiation, however, was unsuccessful.\n\n1016.\n\nOn 17 January 2003, the Government of Mendoza extended the deadline for an additional 180 days up to July 2003 through Provincial Decree No. 89/2003. Prior to the passage of Provincial Decree No. 89/2003, however, on 13 December 2002, EPRE held a public hearing in which twenty-six entities, including EDEMSA, non-profit organizations, unions, service companies, and users participated.\n\n1017.\n\nOn 13 March 2003, the governor of Mendoza issued Provincial Decree No. 323/2003, which sought to institute a 3.4% increase to the DAV reflected in EDEMSA\u2018s tariff schedule to apply until the completion of the Renegotiation Process. Without acknowledging any specific right of EDEMSA, EPRE explicitly approved the governor\u2018s proposal by issuing Resolution No. 467/2002.\n\n1018.\n\nThe increase in DAV, however, was ultimately rejected by the Mendoza Senate and thus, never entered into force. Despite the extension, the renegotiation process proved unsuccessful once again, which prompted the Mendoza Executive\u2018s issuance of Provincial Decree No. 1539/2003 which made effective a second extension to expire on 10 December 2003.\n\n1019.\n\nUpon failure to reach an agreement on renegotiation terms by December 2003, Provincial Law No. 7,187 was passed on 24 February 2004 to extend the deadline to lapse in December 2004.\n\n1020.\n\nFinally, upon another failure to agree on renegotiation terms by the end of the third extension, the Government of Mendoza enacted Provincial Law No. 7,324 which extended the deadline to 30 June 2005. This was the fourth and last extension to the renegotiation deadline before Claimants notified EPRE in July 2004 of their intention to divest from EDEMSA.\n\n1021.\n\nOnly after sale of EDEMSA to Argentine purchasers, in March of 2005, did the renegotiation process bear any fruit in the form of the letter of Understanding.\n\n1022.\n\nFor good order, the Tribunal notes that in other cases some tribunals have found the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard to protect investors against instability and predictability of the legal framework,82 or to protect investors against unreasonable or arbitrary measures.83 Although mindful of these decisions, the Tribunal has made its determination in the present case on an independent finding of Respondent\u2018s breach of the specific commitments embodied in the Currency Clause followed by its failure to restore EDEMSA\u2018s financial equilibrium in a timely fashion.\n\nSee e.g., *Sempra v. Argentina* ; *Enron v. Argentina* ; *CMS Gas v. Argentina*.\n\nSee e.g., *Saluka Investments,* (Partial Award, 17 March 2006), at paragraph 309.\n\n**3. Pre-Emergency Measures Affecting the Concession**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n1023.\n\nClaimants assert that prior to the Emergency Measures Respondent unilaterally altered the Regulatory Framework and Concession Agreement in a way which had a negative impact on EDEMSA\u2018s operations, and changed the financial equilibrium of the contract to the detriment of EDEMSA. Claimants also contend that the changes adversely affected technical performance, making it increasingly difficult to meet quality standards.\n\n1024.\n\nIn Respondent\u2018s view, most of the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession, adopted under the regulatory authority of EPRE or the Government of Mendoza, give rise to strictly contractual claims which have already been addressed before local courts. For one of these claims, related to so-called \"quasi-currency\" obligations, Respondent seems to base its argument not on any local legal action, but rather contends the claim is groundless because the bonds could be used as payment of Provincial obligations and would mature in 2003.\n\n1025.\n\nRespondent views these claims as *res judicata* and outside the Tribunal\u2018s jurisdiction. Respondent further argues that EDEMSA and the Government of Mendoza executed a contractual renegotiation agreement, in which the parties agreed to honor the outstanding payments due to EDEMSA as at 31 February 2005. Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 777-78. According to Respondent, such agreement was memorialized in the Letter of Understanding dated 7 April 2005.\n\n1026.\n\nThe discussion immediately hereinafter considers the particular merits of each specific claim based on Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession. For reasons elaborated below, the Tribunal finds Respondent liable only on claims related to Modification of the Tariff Regime. In addition, the Tribunal notes Respondent\u2018s admission that some compensation is due with respect to the Polvaredas area. Later in this award, the Tribunal discusses the Respondent\u2018s more general arguments that the Letter of Understanding results in \"double recovery\" and bars Claimants\u2018 claims concerning Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession.\n\n**a) Enumerated Claims**\n------------------------\n\n**(1) Modification of the Tariff Regime under the Concession Agreement**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Network-Use Fee**\n-----------------------\n\n1027.\n\nClaimants argue that EPRE unilaterally altered the tariff regime under the Concession Agreement by modifying its fee structure applicable to large users.\n\n1028.\n\nConcession Agreement, Anexo II, Subanexo 1, \"Tarifa Nro. 2 (Grandes Demandas)\" of Chapter 2, Subsection 3, in pertinent part, provides as follows:\n\nBefore the commencement of the electrical supply, DISTRIBUTOR shall agree the maximum supply capacity with the user in writing.... The agreed upon value shall be valid and applicable, for invoicing purposes, in accordance with Subsection 5(b) for a term of 12 consecutive month as from the date the service is made available and, at the expiration thereof, for 12-month periods.\n\n1029.\n\nThe Concession Agreement\u2018s schedule with respect to T-2 large users can be summarized as follows. The Tariff Schedule permitted EDEMSA to recover the additional costs incurred as a result of having to supply greater levels of power for large electricity users. This scheme established a Network-Use Fee as part of the tariffs applicable to large users. The Network-Use Fee was to be calculated based on the power capacity that had been installed and made available to each large user. Every twelve months, each large user would notify EDEMSA of the power capacity required in the next year. The power capacity requested by and made available to each user determined the amount of the fee paid for using the network during the relevant twelve-month period.\n\n1030.\n\nResolution No. 8/98 set forth a fee structure different from that quoted above in that the new fee calculation would be based on the last non-null power recorded by each user immediately prior to the beginning of the concession on 1 August 1998.\n\n1031.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that EPRE did unilaterally modify the terms of the Concession Agreement by Resolution No. 8/98, which effectively allowed large users to only pay for the yearly minimum of their electricity use rather than the maximum as originally contemplated. The last non-null power usage immediately prior to the beginning of the concession would have been made in July, during the winter season in the southern hemisphere. As electricity consumption generally declines during the winter, EPRE regulations in effect permitted large users to contract for their minimum use regardless of the power capacity actually installed and made available to such users.\n\n1032.\n\nAccording to Respondent, this modification was consistent with the requirements of the Concession Agreement in order to ensure that the tariffs were just, proportional, and equitable. Respondent\u2018s witness, Mr. Sergio Rodr\u00edguez, opines that such modifications were sought in response to consumer complaints and applied in general to all power distributors in the province and not just to EDEMSA. See Witness Statement of Sergio Rodr\u00edguez, at paragraphs 33-42.\n\n1033.\n\nMoreover, Respondent argues that the original tariff schedule was only applicable to new large users, as opposed to those pre-existing at the date of the Concession Agreement\u2018s execution. Mr. Rodr\u00edguez further opines that, given the existence of over 4,000 large users, the parties could not have expected the agreements with users to be completed by the time of service take over.84 Rather, EPRE Resolution No. 8/98 served to clarify the different scheme applicable to pre-existing large users.\n\nRebuttal Witness Statement of Sergio Rodr\u00edguez, at paragraph 11.\n\n1034.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree with Respondent\u2018s view, however. EDEMSA could have executed the individual contracts with each large user, including those pre-existing at the time of the Concession Agreement\u2018s execution. EDEMSA\u2018s predecessor company, EMSE, had at its disposition the exact figures of maximum energy consumption of each large user from the twelve months prior to the beginning of the concession period.85 It would have been reasonable to project each consumer\u2018s energy consumption for the following year. Even agreements with pre-existing large users could have been accomplished prior to commencement of services.\n\nIn support of this view, Claimants cite to the Supplementary Witness Statement of H\u00e9ctor Gonella, at paragraph 12.\n\n1035.\n\nThe Concession Agreement did not permit EPRE to implement such unilateral modifications. Doing so resulted in substantial harm to EDEMSA, in breach of the applicable umbrella clause.\n\n1036.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this particular harm serious enough to rise to the level of a treaty breach, pursuant to the standards set forth above.\n\n**(b) Reduction of Contracting Period with Users**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n1037.\n\nClaimants also allege that EPRE improperly reduced the twelve-month period for contracting with large users. See Concession Agreement, Anexo II, Subanexo 1, \"Tarifa Nro. 2 (Grandes Demandas)\" of Chapter 2, Subsection 3.\n\n1038.\n\nThe Tribunal has found no evidence that the Parties ever agreed to a period of less than twelve months for calculating the Network-Use Fee. However, the evidence demonstrates that EPRE did in fact modify the duration of the contracts for large users.\n\n1039.\n\nIn practice, Resolution 73/99 permits large users with seasonable production cycles to pay EDEMSA for power capacity only during the months of maximum power, while paying lesser amounts during lower levels of activity, when separate contracts are concluded for a smaller power capacity.\n\n1040.\n\nThe change in contracting period from the original twelve months was unilaterally imposed by EPRE in breach of its obligations under the applicable umbrella clause. As with the network-use fee, the Tribunal finds this particular harm serious enough to rise to the level of a treaty breach pursuant to the standards set forth above.\n\n**(c) Optional T-2 Tariff Category**\n------------------------------------\n\n1041.\n\nThe third allegedly improper modification of the tariff regime concerns the Tariff Schedule under the Concession Agreement and relates to the temporary tariff, applicable to all users who, at the beginning of EDEMSA\u2018s concession, either (i) did not have the power measuring equipment appropriate for their classification level within the Tariff Schedule established by the Concession Agreement, or (ii) had yet to be classified under one of the categories provided in the Tariff Schedule.\n\n1042.\n\nIn these instances, the transitory tariff was to apply until classification under a tariff category. The Concession Agreement required EDEMSA to complete the meter installation and user classification by specific deadlines, which, depending on the user\u2018s level of service demand, was either 6 or 12 months.\n\n1043.\n\nThe Tribunal understands the Concession Agreement to require that a user be automatically classified under the Optional T-2 large user category if the first reading with the new digital readers exceeded 10kW.\n\n1044.\n\nSubsequent to the Concession, EPRE issued Resolution No. 125/99, which was later supplemented by Resolution No. 131/99. In the Tribunal\u2018s view, these resolutions effectively prevented EDEMSA from properly classifying temporary tariff users.\n\n1045.\n\nThe resolutions wrongfully permitted alteration of the tariff regime by allowing consumers to opt for the T-1 tariff category (applicable to small consumers) if successive readings from the first measurement showed power uses of less than 10kW.\n\n1046.\n\nRespondent admits that Resolution No. 125/99 permitted users whose consumption fell between 10 and 50 kW to continue with the original T-1 tariff category. See Respondent\u2018 s Rejoinder, at paragraph 799.\n\n1047.\n\nIn effect, some large users could avoid the T-2 tariff classification so long as later monthly readings fell below the threshold level. Such modification is clearly a violation of the Tariff Schedule which, under Anexo II, Subanexo 1, \"Tarifa Nro. 2 (Grandes Demandas)\" of Chapter 2, Subsection 1 expressly established that those users whose maximum power demand exceeding 10kW were to be categorized under the T-2 category.\n\n1048.\n\nMoreover, the evidence shows that Resolution No. 131/99 suspended payment obligations of those users which had already been reclassified or were about to be reclassified as T-2 large users, and mandated refund of any and all monies that may have been billed in excess due to their reclassification. Such refund was required from the date on which the reclassified tariffs were implemented. Such conduct by EPRE improperly modified the Concession Agreement.\n\n1049.\n\nRespondent seeks to justify its actions by arguing that Resolutions No. 125/99 and 131/99 were issued in the interest of the electricity consumers. The first resolution was allegedly enacted because the application of the measurement normalization plan under Chapter 5, subsection 2 of the Tariff Schedule was inadequate, resulting in only a series of measures aiming at safeguarding the information rights of users. The latter resolution was allegedly established as a precautionary measure.\n\n1050.\n\nThe Tribunal remains unconvinced by the suggested justification based on equity and the need to protect certain consumers. EPRE\u2018s imposition of the Optional T-2 tariff category, implemented through Executive Order No. 1632/00 unilaterally incorporated the transitory tariff into the Concession Agreement as a new tariff category as from 1 August 2000 to 31 July 2003. Although Respondent contends that the Optional T-2 tariff compensated for all costs related to the provision of the service (Rebuttal Witness Statement of Sergio Rodr\u00edguez, at paragraphs 60-61), the Tribunal finds that any imposition of new tariff categories was not contemplated in the Concession Agreement\u2018s terms.\n\n1051.\n\nThe original tariff system did not provide users with the option to choose between categories at their discretion. EPRE unilaterally modified the contract\u2018s terms by incorporating the Optional T-2 tariff category, thereby violating the Respondent\u2018s commitments under the Concession Agreement, protected by the applicable umbrella clause. As with the network-use fee and the reduction of contracting period, the Tribunal finds this particular harm serious enough to rise to the level of a treaty breach, pursuant to the standards set forth above.\n\n**(2) Expansion of the Scope of Concession Area**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1052.\n\nClaimants assert that EPRE unilaterally expanded the scope of the Concession Agreement by incorporating therein the town of Polvaredas as well as the Scattered Market without adequate remuneration in exchange. In defense, Respondent argues that such isolated areas are deemed public service and thus serve as an integral part of EDEMSA\u2018s distribution services.\n\n1053.\n\nThe evidence shows that these categories include users located in remote regions not linked to the interconnected distribution network. Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraphs 160, 162. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 752-53, 757. Moreover, the area of Polvaredas was not transferred to EDEMSA upon commencement of the concession as this region was self-serviced.\n\n1054.\n\nAfter an incident resulting in damages to the generation equipment and thus halt of power services to the Polvaredas inhabitants, Resolution EPRE No.183/99 was issued, expressly incorporating the town of Polvaredas into EDEMSA\u2018s area of concession. On 3 December, 1999, the Government of Mendoza issued Provincial Decree No. 2379/99, expressly incorporating into EDEMSA\u2018s area of concession the Scattered Market.\n\n1055.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 2 of the Concession Agreement states in pertinent part that the concessionaire \"shall also be responsible for handling any increase in demand in the AREA, be it through requests for new service or an increase in existing supply capacity. \"\n\n1056.\n\nThe quoted text clearly contemplates the possibility of expanding EDEMSA\u2018s responsibility to service areas within the agreed boundaries of concession.\n\n1057.\n\nAs admitted by Claimants, Polvaredas was geographically located within the area covered by EDEMSA\u2018s Concession Agreement. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 159. The Scattered Market also fell within EDEMSA\u2018s area of concession.\n\n1058.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no intention to depart from Article 2 of the Concession Agreement simply from the fact that documents presented in the \"data room\" during the due diligence process makes reference only to the distribution system.\n\n1059.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds such isolated areas to fall under EDEMSA\u2018s \"area\" of concession. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that Provincial Decree No. 2379/99 further required EDEMSA to apply to users within the Scattered Market the same quality of service that applied to those within the interconnected distribution network. The Tribunal finds that Respondent was within its authority to obligate EDEMSA to maintain quality standards as Article 2 of the Concession Agreement required the concessionaire to \"ensure it can supply services under the quality conditions specified in Sub-Annex 5\", titled \"Normas de Calidad Del Servicio P\u00fablico y Sanciones.\"\n\n1060.\n\nThe Tribunal remains mindful that Respondent seems to acknowledge that some compensation might be due EDEMSA for the Polvaredas area, noting that the Province of Mendoza undertook to provide Polvaredas the fixed material needed for power supply without EDEMSA having to invest money for such purpose. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraph 791-92. Respondent apparently concedes that EDEMSA was to be compensated through the PTC Fund, in order to balance the difference in distribution costs. With respect to the Scattered Market, Respondent stated that the increase in costs in relation to its servicing was expressly regulated in Schedule 1.2 of the Decree No. 2379/99, establishing a regime of subsidies and compensation payable to the concessionaire.\n\n1061.\n\nClaimants themselves do not provide any figures in their final iteration of damages for amounts due with respect to the Polvaredas area or the Scattered Market. See e.g., Claimants Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 53 as well as the LECG 2005 Report, at paragraphs 168-84. Earlier, in their initial 2005 Memorial, Claimants had requested $729,673 in compensation (paragraph 480) but seem to have abandoned this quantification in the revised LECG Report.\n\n1062.\n\nClaimants assert Respondent is liable, but provide no final accounting for amounts they believe should be paid. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants\u2018 position is insufficiently substantiated. For this reason, this claim must be dismissed.\n\n**(3) Modification of the Agricultural Subsidies Regime**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n1063.\n\nThe Transformation Law set forth a mechanism for subsidizing the electricity consumption of certain agricultural users engaged in irrigational activities. Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 214; see Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at 822. The Transformation Law mandated the application of a special tariff schedule to all agricultural irrigation users existing at the time the Regulatory Framework was passed. Under this system, EDEMSA was to be compensated for the difference between the subsidized tariff, referred as the Reference Tariff, and a benchmark tariff, known as the Tariff Payable to Distributor. Under Article 36 of the Transformation Law, all amounts due to EDEMSA were to be paid out from the PTC Fund.\n\n1064.\n\nThis subsidy mechanism implemented by the Transformation Law was incorporated into EDEMSA\u2018s Concession Agreement. Accordingly, Anexo II, Subanexo 1, Chapter 2 of the Tariff Schedule in the Concession Agreement set forth the government\u2018s obligation to compensate EDEMSA for the difference that may exist between the amounts billed to the beneficiaries of the subsidy and those that would result from the application of the Tariff Payable to Distributor.\n\n1065.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to whether under this subsidy framework EDEMSA was required to deposit back into the PTC Fund any excess amount in instances where the Reference Tariff resulted in a higher amount than that from the Tariff Payable to Distributor. See Claimants\u2018 Reply, at paragraph 216; see Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraph 828.\n\n1066.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the original subsidy regime was altered by way of EPRE preventing EDEMSA from collecting the excess amounts in instances where the Reference Tariff resulted in a higher amount than that from the Tariff Payable to Distributor. Claimants argue that nowhere in the Concession Agreement was there a requirement that EDEMSA reimburse the PTC Fund under the concerned scenario.\n\n1067.\n\nMoreover, Claimants assert that the contracting parties intended to limit the benefits of said subsidy framework to those agricultural users whose consumption was during hours of lowest demand. As such, Claimants assert that they were justified in charging the T-2 tariff category for those users failing to meet the aforementioned criterion for agricultural subsidy benefits. They argue that EDEMSA in fact did not charge a Reference Tariff higher than the Tariff Payable to Distributor, but rather simply applied the T-2 tariff category in those situations.\n\n1068.\n\nBy contrast, Respondent asserts that EDEMSA was not entitled to charge agricultural users a fee higher than the one under the Concession Agreement. Rather EDEMSA had agreed to collect the Tariff Payable to Distributor in relation to agricultural irrigation users, and thus that any excess resulting from the difference with the Reference Tariff should have been deposited back into the PTC Fund.\n\n1069.\n\nThe subsidy scheme set forth under Article 36 of the Transformation Law was explicitly incorporated in Annex II, Sub-Annex 1, Chapter 2 of the Concession Agreement. Upon close reading of Article 36 of the Transformation Law, the Tribunal finds that this subsidy was not restricted to those agricultural users that consume during low-demand hours. Article 36, in pertinent part, states as follows. In order to preserve the current tariff level and compensate the tariff difference from the application of the tariff system implemented by the [Regulatory Framework] for electrical power users for agricultural irrigation, resources from the Tariff compensator fund shall be annually assigned. The collection of this compensation shall only be applied to electrical power users for agricultural irrigation to the date of enactment of this law, in accordance with the regulations, and such compensation shall be gradually allocated in relation to the higher efficiency in the use of surface and ground water for agricultural irrigation....\n\n1070.\n\nThe Tribunal reads Article 36 to encourage consumption during low-demand hours by providing different prices for low- and high-demand hours. See Rebuttal Witness Statement of Raul Faura, at paragraph 48. The quoted text expressly limits the application of this subsidy to \"electrical power users for agricultural irrigation,\" but does not further restrict it to those agricultural users consuming at low-demand hours. Absent express agreement otherwise, the Tribunal is convinced that those users consuming during high-demand hours would also be able to seek the benefit of the agricultural subsidy, assuming their electricity use is for the purpose of agricultural irrigation.\n\n1071.\n\nThe Concession Agreement does not expressly contemplate what is to be done when the Reference Tariff results in a higher amount than the Tariff Payable to Distributor. In light of the purpose behind this subsidized tariff scheme, to benefit agricultural users engaged in irrigational activities, the Tribunal does not find it credible that the contracting parties would have agreed to a subsidy framework to compensate EDEMSA in the concerned scenario. Permitting EDEMSA to collect in excess of that charged to non-subsidized users would run afoul with such general objective. For these reasons, this claim must be dismissed.\n\n**(4) Failure to Pay Compensation**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1072.\n\nClaimants contend that the Tariff Schedule in the Concession Agreement provides for payment of the difference arising from application of specialized tariffs for specific groups (such as the elderly and users engaged in agricultural irrigation) as well as the provision of public lighting services. In addition, Claimants aver that EDEMSA was owed payment for extra costs incurred in purchasing power from the Nihuil IV power plant, which were to be reimbursed to EDEMSA through the PTC Fund.\n\n1073.\n\nClaimants argue that EDEMSA had submitted the necessary monthly statements itemizing the amounts due pursuant to the application of the subsidized tariffs, but that the provincial government failed to make the payments owed. Despite filing with both the administrative agency and judicial authorities, they were denied legal recourse to have their claims heard.\n\n1074.\n\nThe evidence shows that Article 37 of the Transformation Law mandated the assignment of EMSE\u2018s rights and obligations arising out of a contract entered into with a power generation company, Hidronihuil S.A. See Claimants\u2018 Memorial, at paragraph 172; see Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial, at paragraphs 777-83.\n\n1075.\n\nThe Nihuil IV Contract was for the construction, operation and maintenance of a hydroelectric power project known as \"NIHUIL IV Plant\" and provided *inter alia* for a commitment by EMSE to purchase all of the Nihuil IV power plant\u2018s output at a price higher than that available in the Electricity Wholesale Market. Article 37 of the Transformation Law established that \" [t]he difference between the price that EDEMSA must pay pursuant to this contract and the purchase value of energy in the electricity wholesale market, shall be compensated to EDEMSA by the Province with funds allocated pursuant to Article 47.\" In conformity with Article 37 of the Transformation law, Article 22.36 of the Concession Agreement memorialized the compensation scheme.\n\n1076.\n\nIn defense, Respondent states that Claimants failed to exhaust administrative procedures, that the Letter of Understanding removes any debt obligation of the Province of Mendoza in regards to this claim, and that Claimants failed to prove the lack of payment.\n\n1077.\n\nAbsent special circumstances, failure to pay money due under an agreement implicates claims of a contractual nature. As such, these claims were to be submitted to the courts of the Province of Mendoza. Claimants did so and the courts rejected the requests of payment on procedural grounds.\n\n1078.\n\nAfter their requests for payment were rejected by the courts, Claimants did nothing to obtain compensation from the Province or tackle the procedural objections stated by the courts. See Claim, paras. 179, 182, 190.\n\n1079.\n\nConsequently, no claim for denial of justice can be sustained.\n\n1080.\n\nAccordingly this claim must be dismissed. No persuasive argument has been presented which would raise the simple contract disagreement to the level of a treaty breach, whether by virtue of denial of justice, pursuant to an \"umbrella clause\" or otherwise.\n\n**(5) Quasi-Currency**\n----------------------\n\n1081.\n\nClaimants contend that EDEMSA was forced to accept notes issued by the Province\u2018s treasury as opposed to monetary currency, which were not legal tender and could not be used to pay their monetary obligations elsewhere; in addition if they refused to accept payment in this form under Section 2 of Provincial Law No. 6955 they faced a penalty equal to five times the amount of the particular transaction. Such was contrary to the tariff principles in the electricity regulatory framework.\n\n1082.\n\nRespondent argues that the magnitude of the economic crisis forced it to issue bonds in order to deal with their obligations, and that this tactic has been adopted previously by other governments, such as that of California. Respondent also asserts that Claimants were not treated unfairly because all distributors, Mendoza inhabitants, and economic sectors had to accept payment in this form, and the bonds could be used to pay taxes and other obligations owed to the Provincial government. Finally, Respondent asserts that Claimants are at fault for their loss, for if they had kept the bonds instead of selling them at an 80% depreciated value they would have matured to more than 110% their nominal value.\n\n1083.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that nothing in Claimants\u2018 calculation of quantum suggests that the amount of damages would be different if a theory of quasi-currency payments were included. No separate item for quasi-currency losses has been suggested.\n\n1084.\n\nClaimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, 11 March 2011, at paragraph 53, states that the historical damages claims (i.e., pre-emergency claims) have been quantified in the LECG Report of 28 April 2005 at paragraphs 168-84. However, that section of the report contains a Table XII for damages from measures taken prior to enactment of Law 25,561. No itemization of quasi-currency damages has been listed. Moreover, nothing on this line appears in the Updated Historical Damages Table included in Claimants\u2018 Closing Statement at the Quantum Hearings on 14 February 2011.\n\n1085.\n\nConsequently, after due consideration, the Tribunal finds that the claim with respect to quasi-currency payments is insufficiently substantiated and must therefore be dismissed.\n\n**(6) Imposition of Service Quality Conditions**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n1086.\n\nClaimants state that Provincial Law No. 6856 set forth new obligations and procedures on EDEMSA that are more onerous than those originally laid out in the Regulatory Framework. In particular, Claimants seek support in Sections 2 through 6, which set forth new more stringent procedures for those wishing to file claims against EDEMSA for damages caused by failures in the electricity distribution system.\n\n1087.\n\nRespondent contends that, first, Provincial Law No. 6856 is applicable to every concessionaire and all types of public services\u2018 providers, and was therefore not aimed in a discriminatory manner at the Claimants. Second, Respondent claims that the Provincial Supreme Court has found Law No. 6856 to be constitutional and non-arbitrary.\n\n1088.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that nothing in Claimants\u2018 calculation of quantum suggests that the amount of damages would be different if a theory of imposition of more stringent quality service conditions were included. No separate item for imposition of more onerous quality service conditions losses has been suggested.\n\n1089.\n\nClaimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, 11 March 2011, at paragraph 53, states that the historical damages claims (i.e., pre-emergency claims) have been quantified in the LECG Report of 28 April 2005 at paragraphs 168-84. However, that section of the report contains a Table XII for damages from measures taken prior to enactment of Law 25,561. No itemization of the imposition of more stringent quality service conditions damages has been listed. Moreover, nothing on this line appears in the Updated Historical Damages Table included in Claimants\u2018 Closing Statement at the Quantum Hearings on 14 February 2011.\n\n1090.\n\nAfter due consideration, the Tribunal finds that the claim relating to the imposition of more stringent conditions regarding quality of service is insufficiently substantiated and must therefore be dismissed.\n\n**b)** ***In Limine*** **Objections: Late Pleading of Denial of Justice**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1091.\n\nWithout admitting wrongdoing, Respondent asserts that any claim based on denial of justice should be dismissed *in limine* insofar as it is based on the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession because it was not pled in Claimants\u2018 Memorial, and thus, must be deemed untimely. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraph 768.\n\n1092.\n\nThe Tribunal must reject Respondent\u2018s inadmissibility defense. Respondent was on notice since the early stages of this proceeding that Claimants were bringing a general claim based on the Fair and Equitable Treatment provision. Respondent has had the opportunity to fully comment on this matter at the Hearings as well as in its post-hearing submissions.\n\n1093.\n\nAs discussed above, to the extent that Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession disregarded material financial and contractual commitments, EPRE ignored those obligations in a way that went beyond mere contractual breaches. The Province of Mendoza unilaterally modified the Concession Agreement on these matters, thus violating the specific commitments undertaken by the Respondent with respect to the Claimants\u2018 investment. Such conduct, inconsistent with the material terms of the Concession Agreement, breached the \"umbrella clauses\" incorporated through the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n1094.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimants\u2018 witness Mr. Gonella, testified that EDEMSA was required to submit any administrative claim in the first instance to EPRE, which in fact was the same independent government entity that had issued the administrative resolutions detrimental to EDEMSA. See Supplementary Witness Statement of Hector Gonella, at paragraph 79.\n\n1095.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of EPRE\u2018s role as both judge and party and finds that such dual responsibility is inherently suspect in providing justice before the administrative tribunal. In this connection, the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Gonella\u2018s description of the general way in which EDEMSA\u2018s claims were addressed, involving lengthy proceedings with long periods of time spent waiting for decisions to be adopted and notified. The administrative appeal process failed to provide meaningful recourse as each and every claim submitted before the ME&PW was rejected. As to the final stage of appeal, the Supreme Court of Mendoza rejected all claims made by EDEMSA.\n\n1096.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes that Claimants did not make a separate \"standalone\" claim with respect to denial of justice. Instead, their arguments contending that justice was denied were presented in the context of claims based on \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security.\" See Claimants\u2018 Reply of 30 April 2009 at pages 167-69, 176-77; Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief of 14 December 2009 at paragraph 102. Moreover, Claimants asserted in their Post-Hearing Reply of 8 January 2010 that showing denial of justice was not a necessary element of their indirect expropriation claim. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Reply of 8 January 2010 at paragraph 26.\n\n1097.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal need make no determination in connection with \"denial of justice\" theories as an independent basis for recovery, apart from considerations related to the other claims noted above.\n\n**c) Double Recovery**\n----------------------\n\n1098.\n\nAs discussed more fully below, in connection with Affirmative Defenses, the Tribunal cannot agree that Claimants receive a double recovery of damages caused by the PreEmergency Measures. In short, the Letter of Understanding of 7 April 2005 was concluded at a time when IADESA controlled EDEMSA.\n\n1099.\n\nClaimants received no redress for any Pre-Emergency breaches through the Letter of Understanding or local court proceedings. Claimants\u2018 treaty rights (expressly retained by EDFI and Le\u00f3n at the time of sale of EDEMSA shares) remain independent of any benefits given to the IADESA-controlled EDEMSA under the 2005 arrangements.\n\n1100.\n\nFor the sake of good order, the circumstances in which the sale took place will be discussed below, in connection with quantum.\n\n**4. Other Claims**\n-------------------\n\n**a) Discrimination and Arbitrariness**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1101.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects Claimants\u2018 assertions with respect to discrimination, arbitrariness, and unreasonable or unjustified treatment, to the extent that such contentions can be considered as stand-alone claims.\n\n1102.\n\nNothing in Claimants\u2018 calculation of quantum suggests that the amount of damages sought would be different if a theory of discrimination and arbitrariness were to form the basis of the Tribunal\u2018s calculations.\n\n1103.\n\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Award, the Tribunal has awarded damages on the basis of Respondent\u2018s breach of both the applicable umbrella clause and its duty of Fair and Equitable Treatment under Argentina-France BIT. Responsibility for such breaches implicates appropriate payment by Respondent.\n\n1104.\n\nIn coming to this conclusion, the Tribunal has carefully considered Claimants contention that Respondent did not accord Claimants treatment equal to Argentine and third party nationals (Article 4 of the Argentine-France BIT) and that such unequal treatment was demonstrated by the fact that tariffs increased soon after Claimants sold their interest to a local company. The Tribunal also notes Claimants\u2018 assertion that Respondent\u2018s actions were arbitrary and unreasonable in the sense of there being no legitimate justification for the Emergency Measures that targeted the public utilities, with the discriminatory intent evidenced by statements by legislators and executive officials.\n\n1105.\n\nAccording to Claimants, notions of \"arbitrariness\" become relevant, *inter alia*, by virtue of the MFN clause which bring into consideration Article 3(1) of the Argentina-Mexico BIT stating that each Contracting Party will not impair investors\u2018 enjoyment or disposal through \"arbitrary or discriminatory measures,\" which becomes relevant according to Claimants by virtue of Article 3 of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT. We also note Claimants\u2018 argument that a prohibition of \"unreasonable\" measures becomes relevant through Article 2(2) of the Argentina-Israel BIT as incorporated by the MFN clause.\n\n1106.\n\nThe Tribunal has also considered fully Respondent\u2018s argument that it did not engage in discriminatory, arbitrary or unjustified behavior because the Emergency Measures were effective for all sectors of the Argentine economy, and that Claimants knew there would be a raise in tariffs when they sold their shares. We have also noted Respondent\u2018s argument that the Emergency Measures were an effective response to the economic crisis, and that statements by individual legislators and officials are not dispositive evidence of a comprehensive plan to discriminate against Claimants.\n\n1107.\n\nNothing in either side\u2018s arguments changes the liability for damages, pursuant to a theory of discrimination and arbitrariness, as contrasted with the Tribunal\u2018s findings of breach of applicable \"umbrella clauses\" and its duty of Fair and Equitable Treatment under Argentina-France BIT, which carries liability and damages as discussed elsewhere herein.\n\n**b) Full Protection and Security**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1108.\n\nThe Tribunal declines to find liability based on Claimants\u2018 assertions with respect to full security and protection or denial of justice.\n\n1109.\n\nRespondent has been found to have breached treaty provisions on Fair and Equitable Treatment as well as failure to respect the Concession Agreement. Nothing in the Argentina-France BIT incorporates a duty to maintain a stable legal and commercial environment, apart from the impact that such an environment may have in connection with fulfillment of other treaty obligations.\n\n1110.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has taken note of Claimants\u2018 argument that Respondent violated Article 5(1) of the Argentina-France BIT by failing to afford full security and protection to Claimants\u2018 investment, or in the alternative that the MFN clause permits incorporation of such guarantees from the Argentina-Germany BIT. In a related argument, we note that Claimants assert they suffered a denial of justice as they were deprived of fair access to a legal system.\n\n1111.\n\nThe Tribunal has also taken due note of Respondent\u2018s contention that the claim should be inadmissible because it did not appear in Claimants\u2018 opening Memorial, that EDEMSA was never deprived of physical protection and security, and that Claimants\u2018 arguments fall outside the scope of the relevant treaties, and that Respondent did not engage in a denial of justice. For the sake of good order, the Tribunal notes that Respondent has had the opportunity to comment on the arguments both at the hearing and in post-hearing submissions.\n\n1112.\n\nResponsibility for such breaches implicates payment of damages as discussed elsewhere in this award. Nothing in Claimants\u2018 calculation of damages, or the Tribunal\u2018s analysis of quantum, suggests that the amount of damages would be different if based on a theory of denial of justice or absence of full protection and security.\n\n**c) Indirect Expropriation**\n-----------------------------\n\n1113.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects Claimants\u2018 assertions with respect to indirect expropriation. No evidence has been presented to persuade us that Claimants were \"substantially\" deprived of their investment by operation of the Emergency Measures. To the contrary, they continued to own and operate EDEMSA and later sold the company, albeit at an unfavorable price.\n\n1114.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken full cognizance of the Parties\u2018 disagreement on the proper legal standard for indirect expropriation claims.\n\n1115.\n\nClaimants contend that indirect expropriation is more expansive than direct expropriation, and that the Argentina-France BIT does not require an investment\u2018s obliteration as a precondition to indirect expropriation.\n\n1116.\n\nBy contrast, Respondent contends that it did not expropriate Claimants\u2018 investment, and that the threshold for indirect expropriation should not be lower than that for direct expropriation. Respondent suggests that the standard should be a material deprivation of value, and asserts that its actions do not qualify as such since Claimants maintained title to their investment and were able to sell it for a positive value, resulting in no violation of Article 5(2) of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n1117.\n\nUnder either theory, the Tribunal must decline to find indirect expropriation.\n\n1118.\n\nIn passing the Tribunal notes that the rejection of an \"indirect expropriation\" claim as such does not change its findings that Respondent breached the umbrella clause by breaching the Concession Agreement as well as the Fair and Equitable Treatment provisions of the Argentina-France BIT. Responsibility for such breaches implicates payment of damages in an amount discussed later in this Award.\n\n**D. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES**\n---------------------------\n\n1119.\n\nRespondent asserts several affirmative defenses, which the Tribunal considers into the following six categories: (i) *res judicata* and *litis pendens*, (ii) double recovery, (iii) Claimants\u2018 consent to the Emergency Measures, (iv) Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, (v) Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT, and (vi) State of Necessity. After due consideration of the Parties\u2018 arguments, the Tribunal finds that none of these defenses bars Claimants from recovery in this proceeding.\n\n**1.** ***Res Judicata*** **and** ***Litis*** **Pendens**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n1120.\n\nWith respect to Claimants\u2018 claims based on Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the concession, Respondent contends that Claimants are attempting to present contractual issues that are foreign to this Tribunal and, in some instances, are *res judicata*. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 205-08. The Tribunal notes Respondent\u2018s classification of Claimants\u2018 claims based on Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the concession, which has been organized in ten categories as detailed above and in Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 210.\n\n1121.\n\nRespondent argues that local courts rendered judgment on the merits of five of Claimants\u2018 ten claims relating to the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the concession. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 210. According to Respondent, these claims relate to the incorporation of the town of Polvaderas to EDEMSA\u2018s concession area, the creation of the Scattered Market, the creation of the operative tariff T-2, the modification of the subsidies regime, and the imposition of stricter standards of service quality. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at n. 229.\n\n1122.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent asserts that the three claims filed in local courts relating to Respondent\u2018s alleged failure to reimburse Claimants for energy purchased from the Nihuil IV hydroelectric plant were dismissed because they had not been exhausted at the administrative level, the claim relating to subsidies on Public Lighting was deemed extinct due to lack of prosecution because of EDEMSA\u2018s own negligence, and that the last claim relating to Respondent\u2018s use of \"quasi-currency\" lost currentness. Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 210-11, n. 229-31.\n\n1123.\n\nRespondent thus contends that these ten claims are barred from adjudication by this Tribunal because the claims are contractual in nature and have either been ruled on by Argentine courts or have not been exhausted by Claimants in local proceedings. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 205-10, 727-810.\n\n1124.\n\nIn response, Claimants argue that they are not required to exhaust their claims at the local level before seeking adjudication before this Tribunal and that decisions rendered by Argentine courts have no res judicata effect on this Tribunal. Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 254. To this effect, Claimants contend that Respondent\u2018s assertions would result in a \"fundamental \u2018 Catch-22, \u2018 in which Claimants\u2018 treaty rights would be unenforceable at the international level whether Claimants first pursued local remedies or elected instead to forgo them.\" Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 254.\n\n1125.\n\nAfter due consideration of the Parties\u2018 arguments, the Tribunal finds that Claimants\u2018 claims based on the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the concession are not foreign to this Tribunal and that any decisions made on these issues by Argentine courts do not render these claims *res judicata*.\n\n1126.\n\nClaimants are not required to exhaust local remedies before this Tribunal may hear their claims. In fact, the language of the ICSID Convention suggests that an agreement to arbitration precludes the parties from seeking local remedies. ICSID Convention, Article 26, provides, \"Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention *shall*, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration *to the exclusion of any other remedy*.\" (Emphasis added).\n\n1127.\n\nHaving elected not to incorporate a provision mandating the exhaustion of remedies prior to arbitration into the France BIT, Respondent cannot now argue that one implicitly exists. To hold otherwise would conflict with the plain reading of Article 26, as well as invite States to mandate the exhaustion of local remedies without giving fair warning of such a stipulation to investors who enter a treaty expecting a clear path to arbitration.\n\n1128.\n\nAs a corollary, Claimants decision to first pursue local remedies does not lead to a determination that such remedies are to the exclusion of arbitration, particularly when, as discussed in more detail below, local courts generally do not render claims res judicata with respect to international tribunals.\n\n1129.\n\nIn support of its contention that Claimants are required to exhaust local remedies before seeking adjudication by this Tribunal, Respondent relies on the fact that the Argentine Supreme Court required EDEMSA to exhaust administrative procedures before the court could declare the formal admissibility of certain claims. See Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial at paragraph 779-80. This fact is irrelevant, however, to the issue of jurisdiction in this proceeding. Local rules of procedure, as varied and complicated as they may be, are not binding on this Tribunal. Furthermore, Article 26 of the ICSID Convention presumes arbitration regardless of whether parties have pursued local remedies unless the contracting states agree to an exhaustion provision.\n\n1130.\n\nMoreover, the decisions of national courts are not binding on this Tribunal. Respondent contends, however, that the claims relating to the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the concession are purely contractual claims that arise not under the BIT, but under Argentine national law, and are therefore foreign to this Tribunal\u2018s jurisdiction. The Tribunal need not take a position on whether decisions on purely contractual matters preclude subsequent adjudication by international tribunals. Indeed, this is not the issue facing this Tribunal as these claims arise under the BIT.\n\n1131.\n\nMultiple sources of law may apply to a single set of facts, as is the case with the facts of the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the concession. While Argentina\u2018s national courts may have made decisions pursuant to national laws, the France BIT still furnishes Claimants the opportunity to seek redress before an international tribunal for violations of rights established under international law.\n\n1132.\n\nFurthermore, it is generally accepted that an identity requirement must be satisfied in order for a tribunal to take into account the decisions of national courts. As Claimants explain, there is a notable absence of the requisite parity relating to the parties, cause of action, and applicable legal standards between the claims brought in local courts by Claimants and those currently before this Tribunal. This lack of parity precludes satisfaction of the identity requirement in *res judicata* or *lis pendens*, rendering Respondent\u2018s defense in this respect moot.\n\n1133.\n\nThe Parties in this proceeding are EDFI, SAURI, and Leon Participaciones, while the parties in the local proceedings cited by Respondent included EDEMSA, EPRE and the Province of Mendoza. Parity is thus not satisfied with respect to the disputing parties.\n\n1134.\n\nIn the local proceedings, EDEMSA brought suit under the Concession Contract, whereas Claimants in the present proceeding seek redress under the BIT. Parity is thus not satisfied with respect to the causes of action.\n\n1135.\n\nFinally, the applicable legal standards employed by local courts and this Tribunal differ, as well. In the local proceedings, local courts analyzed contractual breaches according to the Concession Contract. This Tribunal, however, assesses the Parties\u2018 obligations and alleged breaches under the BIT and international law.\n\n1136.\n\nTherefore, Claimants\u2018 pursuit of or failure to pursue claims based on the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the concession in Argentine courts is irrelevant to whether this Tribunal may hear and adjudicate related claims.\n\n**2. Double Recovery**\n----------------------\n\n1137.\n\nRespondent expresses concern that Claimants might receive a double recovery if the Tribunal grants relief for claims based on Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession. According to Respondent, several of such claims (particularly those concerning outstanding payments for purchase of energy from the Nihuil IV power plant and the agriculture irrigation subsidies) have been settled through the Letter of Understanding of 7 April 2005 and subsequent annexes. Respondent\u2018s CounterMemorial at paragraphs 211, 785, 788, and 799.\n\n1138.\n\nIn support of this argument, Respondent cites to this Tribunal\u2018s Decision on Jurisdiction in which the Tribunal noted that \"[t]o the extent that the judicial process in Mendoza (pursuant to the forum selection clause) results in Claimants receiving compensation for their loss, recovery under the French and Luxembourg investment treaties would likely be barred.\" Decision on Jurisdiction at paragraphs 220.\n\n1139.\n\nAnnex II of the Letter of Understanding, Article 2 (\"Cancelaci\u00f3n Deudas\" or \"debt cancellation\") sets forth a list of the debts scheduled for \"cancellation\" by way of Mendoza making eight (8) equal and consecutive monthly installments from the legislative ratification of the Letter. This list establishes three categories of debt: (i) interest on Nihuil IV compensation of AR $3,548,492; (ii) interests on the agricultural irrigation subsidies of AR $4,919,839; and (iii) tax on interest of AR $1,778,850.\n\n1140.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes that claims related to outstanding payments from the Nihuil power plant and the agriculture irrigation subsidies have been dismissed, rendering moot Respondent\u2018s concern about any double recovery in that connection.\n\n1141.\n\nNevertheless, we remain mindful that the Letter of Understanding recognized the need to increase the DAV portion of the electricity tariffs and established a 38.05% tariff increase. Consequently, a portion of Claimants\u2018 recovery might to some extent be perceived as overlap with the increased payments to the IADESA-controlled EDEMSA.\n\n1142.\n\nSuch possible overlaps, however, in no way constitute double recovery. While Claimants are granted damages for the treaty breach pursuant to the Argentina-France BIT, any benefits from the Letter of Understanding went to an IADESA-controlled entity, following Claimants\u2018 sale of EDEMSA. The facts of the 2005 sale do not permit any inference that Claimants received indirectly the value of the prospective rise in tariffs.\n\n1143.\n\nTo the extent that debt cancelled by the Letter of Understanding implicated the 2005 sale price, the adjustment had been taken into account by LECG\u2018s calculations of damages as discussed below. See LECG April 2009 Report, footnote 112.\n\n**3. Consent to Emergency Tariff Measures**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1144.\n\nCiting Memorandum No. 1 of the Renegotiation Commission of the Public Contracts and EDEMSA, dated 20 March 2003, Respondent contends that Claimants consented to the Emergency Tariff Measures. Such consent was said to comprise the declaration of public emergency, the provisions that invalidated the mechanisms of adjustment or indexation of prices in foreign currency, and the Executive Power authorization to renegotiate the public service contracts. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 426-34; Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 160-68; Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraphs 154-59.\n\n1145.\n\nClaimants argue that Memorandum No. 1 was the result of Claimants\u2018 wishing to enter negotiations with Respondent as a means of voicing their objections to the Emergency Tariff Measures. See Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraph 64-66.\n\n1146.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no evidence that Claimants consented to the Emergency Tariff Measures. Any acknowledgement that Claimants may have made with respect to the severity of the economic conditions in Argentina before, during, or after the enactment of the Emergency Laws does not amount to termination of the Concession Agreement or a waiver of Claimants\u2018 contractual or treaty rights.\n\n1147.\n\nSelective citation of Memorandum No. 1, which states that \"the Parties acknowledge that the dynamic of the reigning crisis calls for the effective execution of the renegotiation process,\" merely evidences a desire to tailor performance according to economic conditions so as to meet objectives of the Concession Agreement. This intent is further demonstrated by the passage which states that \"the companies represented hereby maintain that the original conditions of the concession contract should be respected.\"\n\n1148.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no merit in Respondent\u2018s suggestion that consent was evidenced by Mr. Nitrosso\u2018s recognition that economic conditions necessitated readjustment of the electricity framework. See Respondent\u2018s Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits at paragraph 154. Readjustment in no way equates with abrogation of a fundamental underpinning of the Concession Agreement such as the Currency Clause.\n\n**4. Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1149.\n\nAgainst Claimant Le\u00f3n, Respondent asserts the defense of necessity based on Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT. See Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Brief on the Merits of 14 December 2009 at paragraphs 58-66; Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Brief on the Merits at paragraphs 142-45.\n\n1150.\n\nRespondent contends that Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT supports a defense of necessity by providing that investments are to enjoy safety and protection without prejudice to \"measures necessary for the maintenance of public order,\" and Respondent argues that the conduct at issue in this proceeding does not infringe on the guarantee provided in Article 3(2) because the conduct was necessary for the maintenance of public order in Argentina during the economic crisis. See Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Brief on the Merits of 14 December 2009 at paragraphs 58-66; Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Brief on the Merits at paragraphs 142-45.\n\n1151.\n\nAs previously explained, the relevant interests were owned at the outset by French investors. Although for a time such interests were held by a Luxembourg company, Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A., they have since been transferred to EDFI. See Exhibit C80, Letter sent by EDFI to the EPRE notifying the acquisition of Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas, S.A., 15 March 2004; Exhibit C131 Section 9.1.7. See generally LECG Supp. Rept. \u00b6\u00b6 191-99.\n\n1152.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal grants relief in this case on the Argentina-France BIT, not on the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, and therefore the \"public order\" defense provision of Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT is of no consequence in these proceedings.\n\n**5. Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n1153.\n\nRespondent contends that Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT precludes a host country\u2018s liability towards investors who \"have suffered losses owing to war or any other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, or rebellion\" as long as the host country provides \"treatment no less favorable than that granted to its own investors or to those of the most favored Nation.\"\n\n1154.\n\nAccording to Argentina **,** Article 5(3) comprises a general exception for acts which occurred during extraordinary circumstances that would otherwise be contrary to the State\u2018s obligations under the BIT. Under such circumstances, the BIT would, according to Respondent, oblige the State *only* to provide national treatment and most favorable treatment to foreign investors.\n\n1155.\n\nRespondent also argues that Article 5(3) is analogous to Article XI of the U.S.-Argentina BIT, which the *LG&E* and *Continental Casualty* tribunals interpreted as relieving Argentina of liability for particular measures enacted during the economic turmoil. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 131-37.\n\n1156.\n\nIn response, Claimants seek support from *Enron, Sempra*, and *CMS Gas*, cited already, which according to Claimants rejected such argument proposed by Respondent See Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraph 136. Moreover, Claimants assert that Article 5(3) \"bears no resemblance whatsoever to Article XI, either textually or functionally.\" Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraph 137.\n\n1157.\n\nThe plain language of Article 5(3) makes clear that it serves as a non-discrimination provision, not a shield against host state liability for treaty violation. Investors who suffered losses due to a national emergency receive treatment \"no less favorable\" than that granted to host state nationals or to nationals of a most favored nation. Respondent argues that such interpretation would make Article 5(3) redundant as investors already enjoy national and most favorable treatment under Article 4 of the BIT.\n\n1158.\n\nArticle 5(3) may best be understood against the background of the rules of customary international law on State Responsibility toward foreign investors during periods of war, insurrection and other extraordinary circumstances, which determines host State responsibility toward aliens.\n\n1159.\n\nArticle 5(3) leaves those customary rules untouched and indeed supplements their content by requiring equality of treatment in response to such extrordinary circumstances.\n\n1160.\n\nIf the host State grants redress or reparation for the losses suffered, it must give investors of the other Contracting Party treatment \"no less favorable\" than that granted to nationals of the host state or of a most-favored nation.\n\n1161.\n\nFurthermore, the substance of Article 5(3) bears no resemblance to Article XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT. The latter provides that the treaty \"shall not preclude the application by either party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance of or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests.\" By contrast, the former says nothing that would justify host state conduct to the detriment of the treaty partner\u2018s nationals.\n\n1162.\n\nAccordingly, after due consideration of the arguments, the Tribunal finds that Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT does not serve as an exemption clause to relieve Respondent of liability for injury suffered as a result of treaty violations.\n\n**6. State of Necessity Defense**\n---------------------------------\n\n1163.\n\nLastly, Respondent invokes the State of Necessity defense under customary international law. According to Respondent, to the extent the Emergency Measures breached Argentina\u2018s treaty obligations, such breach was justified as a means of preserving essential national interests threatened by a grave and imminent peril. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraphs 620-22. Consequently, Respondent argues that this Tribunal should dismiss Claimants\u2018 claims because the \"State of Necessity\" defense has been satisfied. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 637.\n\n1164.\n\nIn response, Claimants assert that Respondent has not met the elements of the State of Necessity defense. Even if these elements were satisfied, say Claimants, the State of Necessity defense does not excuse Respondent\u2018s obligation to compensate Claimants for any injury sustained prior to or after the emergency period. See Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraph 611.\n\n1165.\n\nFor the purpose of these proceedings, the Tribunal notes that both sides rely on ILC Article 25 rather than some different standard of international law. Claimants Posthearing Reply on the Merits at paragraph 54 appears to admit that ILC Article 25 \"reflects the customary international law for invoking necessity to excuse international treaty violations.\" Rather than challenging applicability of Article 25 as such, Claimants argue that Respondent simply has not met the stringent requirements of that provision. See Claimants\u2018 Post-hearing Brief on the Merits at paragraphs 147-149; Claimants\u2018 PostHearing Reply on the Merits at paragraphs 54-61.\n\n1166.\n\nClaimants also rely on ILC Article 27 to support their argument that Respondent must in any event compensate Claimants for injury sustained as a result of the Emergency Measures. See Claimants\u2018 Post-hearing Brief on the Merits, paragraph 173.\n\n1167.\n\nThe Tribunal need take no position on the theoretical question of how far the various aspects of ILC Article 25 codify customary defenses related to necessity. Although addressed by the International Court of Justice,86 the matter has continued to be subject to scholarly and judicial debate.\n\nSee e.g., Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Advisory Opinion, I.C.J. Reports 2004, p. 136, at 140.\n\n1168.\n\nAs discussed in more detail below, it is sufficient for the Tribunal to note that both sides in this arbitration stipulate that the Tribunal\u2018s analysis should take as applicable legal norms the State of Necessity defense presented by the contours articulated in ILC Article 25. Neither side has argued for application of a standard more favorable to host states than the norms of Article 25.\n\n1169.\n\nIn short, the Tribunal finds that the standards urged by both sides, as providing applicable norms, have not been met so as to excuse treaty breach by reason of the Emergency Measures.\n\n1170.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal notes that the Argentina-France BIT lacks the type of special provisions contained in Article XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT, discussed in the *Continental Casualty* and the *LG&E* cases. However, the Tribunal need take no position on these doctrinal matters.\n\n1171.\n\nNecessity must be construed strictly and objectively, not as an easy escape hatch for host states wishing to avoid treaty obligations which prove difficult. In this connection, Respondent has failed to meet its burden to demonstrate three key elements of ILC Articles 25 and 27: (i) that the wrongful act was the only way to safeguard Argentina\u2018s essential interest under Article 25 (1)(a); (ii) that Respondent did not contribute to the situation of necessity; and (iii) that Respondent did not return to the pre-necessity *status quo* when possible, or compensate Claimants for damage suffered as a result of the relevant measures.\n\n1172.\n\nThe Tribunal does not call into question Respondent\u2018s good faith in asserting that the tariff freeze was enacted to safeguard the country\u2018s vital interests, such as protecting of Argentina\u2018s indigent population (Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraph 148). However, regardless of whether the Emergency Measures related to the concession did much to affect the macro-economic conditions in Argentina, the Tribunal is not convinced that those measures, as presented and explained in these proceedings, were the only means by which Respondent could have protected its public interests.\n\n1173.\n\nEqually as important, the Tribunal has difficulty finding that Respondent did not contribute to the situation which produced the 2001 crisis. Quite significantly, in May 2002 the then President of the Argentine Republic, Mr. Eduardo Duhalde, affirmed in *The Washington Post* that, \"[O] *ur crisis is homegrown -- made in Argentina, by* *Argentines.* \" See Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Brief on Merits, at paragraph 167 and Exhibit CL-35. Although external factors may have aggravated the economic turmoil, Argentina\u2018s contribution to its economic situation is clear or was far from negligible.\n\n1174.\n\nIn addition, Respondent concedes that it was responsible at least in part, for creation of a poor economic climate, through the government\u2018s continued failure to achieve primary surpluses sufficient to stop an unsustainable debt ratio. See Professor Roubini\u2018s Expert Report at paragraphs 21-22.\n\n1175.\n\nRespondent added to the problem by continuing a fixed exchange regime which left the country susceptible to severe economic downturns for which it did not adequately prepare. Compounding this economic vulnerability were policies which decreased employer contributions to the social security system and which increased public spending so as dramatically to increase the country\u2018s debt and impair economic stability.\n\n1176.\n\nAlthough it is not for this Tribunal to opine acceptable or unacceptable economic risks as a general matter, the duty to consider the State of Necessity Defense raised by the Respondent requires the Tribunal to take note of the role played by Respondent in bringing about it own economic adversity.\n\n1177.\n\nFinally, even if Respondent\u2018s conduct might be excused under the State of Necessity Defense, Respondent remains obligated to return to the pre-necessity *status quo* when possible. Moreover, the successful invocation of the necessity defense does not per se preclude payment of compensation to the injured investor for any damage suffered as a result of the necessity measures enacted by the State.\n\n1178.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, at some reasonable point in time, Respondent should have compensated Claimants for injury suffered as a result of measures enacted during any arguable period of necessity in late December 2001. As mentioned earlier, ILC Draft Article 27 provides that \"[t]he invocation of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness [is without prejudice to] compliance with the obligation in question, if and to the extent that the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer exists.\"\n\n1179.\n\nSuch re-establishment of EDEMSA\u2018s economic equilibrium clearly did not happen. As discussed earlier in this Award, the Province of Mendoza failed to raise tariffs in a timely fashion such as to restore the concession\u2018s economic equilibrium. Although the Government of Mendoza eventually agreed to a series of DAV increases, the adjustments took effect only after Claimants had decided to withdraw their investments by executing a sales contract with IADESA on 30 June 2004.\n\n1180.\n\nThe breach by Respondent might well have been only temporary if Argentina had made timely efforts to raise tariffs to a reasonable level. However, Claimants waited more than three years following the Emergency Measures before selling their investment in an attempt to mitigate damages. The Renegotiation Process, which initially was expected to be concluded within six months, was delayed by local authorities which kept extending the deadline while maintaining the tariff freeze during 38 months.\n\n1181.\n\nIn this connection, to test the conclusion enunciated above, the Tribunal notes that eight other tribunals have rejected Argentina\u2018s necessity defense under ILC Article 25. The two tribunals that upheld a necessity defense by Argentina invoked Article XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT. See *LG&E Energy Corp. et al. v. Argentine Republic* (Decision on Liability; *Continental Casualty* (Award, 5 September 2008). See also Professor Dolzer\u2018s Supplemental Expert Report at paragraphs 93-95.\n\n**E. QUANTUM OF DAMAGES**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Overview**\n---------------\n\n1182.\n\nGiven the number of moving parts in determining quantum, the Tribunal sets forth the following road map of its computation, with details and justification included later in this section of the Award.\n\n1183.\n\nIn calculating the quantum of damages, the Tribunal has generally adopted the LECG model as follows, taking 31 December 2001 as the valuation date.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Claimants' Total Damages as of December 2001** |\n| Damages caused by Emergency Measures | US$ 133,635,633 |\n| Damages by Pre-Emergency Measures | US$ 2,502,797 |\n| Total Damages as of 31 December 2001 | **US$ 136,138,430** |\n\n(i) Damages caused by the Emergency Measures will be calculated as the difference between two values: the value of Claimants\u2018 stake in EDEMSA under a scenario free of the Emergency Measures (\" *but for* \" scenario) and the value of the same stake under a scenario with the Emergency Measures (\" *actual* \" scenario), taking 31 December 2001 as the valuation date.\n\n(ii) The \"but-for\" value (EDEMSA in the absence of the Emergency Measures) determined by DCF method discounted as of 31 December 2001;\n\n(iii) From that amount, the Tribunal subtracts the amount which should reasonably have been received by Claimants in the 2005 sale of its EDEMSA shares discounted to 31 December 2001;\n\n(iv) To that amount, the Tribunal adds damages attributable to Pre-Emergency Measures, again valued as of 31 December 2001;\n\n1184.\n\nFollowing this three-step approach yields figures as follows:\n\n**Step 1:** DCF calculation of Claimants\u2018 investments in the absence of the Emergency Measures as of 31 December 2001\n\nFirm Value (Discount rate, WACC 11.34%) US $ 448,855,587\n\nFinancial Debt(Dec 2001 book value) US$ (119,644,020)\n\nEquity Value US$ 329,211,567\n\nValue of Claimants\u2018 Investment in EDEMSA (44.88% share) US$ 147,750,151\n\n**Step 2:** Subtracting price which might reasonably have been received in the 2005 sale, valued as of 31 December 2001\n\nValue of Claimants\u2018 Investment in EDEMSA US$ 147,750,151\n\n2005 Sale discounted to 31 December 2001. US$ 14,114,518\n\nTotal damages caused by Emergency Measures US$ 133,635,633\n\n**Step 3** : Inclusion of Pre-Emergency Damages US$ 2,502,797.00\n\nTotal: US$ **136,138,430**\n\n1185.\n\nA final step will be to include calculation of interest, which for reasons discussed below should be added at the rate of 10-year U.S. Treasury bond from 31 December 2001 until payment.\n\n**2. Emergency Measures and Renegotiation Process**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Net Equity Analysis and SSB Model**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1186.\n\nAlthough differing in the methodology used for the net equity analysis, the Parties agree that the net equity analysis is less suitable for the present circumstances. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, paragraph 31; MBG Report on the Valuations performed by LECG of 10 November 2010, at paragraph 51.\n\n1187.\n\nSimilarly, although advancing valuations based on the SSB model, the Parties seem to agree that the SSB model does not provide the appropriate basis for determining Claimants\u2018 damages. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 32; see MBG Report on the Valuations performed by LECG of 10 November 2010, at paragraph 51.\n\n1188.\n\nHaving examined the Parties\u2018 arguments and expert submissions on all methods for calculating quantum of damages, the Tribunal is convinced that the DCF method is most suitable for the present case. The enterprise under assessment is a regulated utilities company with a predictable revenue stream. The DCF method is widely used in the context of tariff reviews for regulated utilities.\n\n**b) Inadequacy of MBG Model**\n------------------------------\n\n1189.\n\nThe Tribunal finds itself unable to accept Respondent\u2018s proposed valuation approach, which varies from the more normal DCF method. That valuation was performed according to the adjusted present value method, which determines the value of EDEMSA\u2018s equity as the difference between the value of the business and its financial debt. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal of 23 September 2010, at paragraph 28. Respondent used this method to perform five evaluations, for 30 November 2001, 31 December 2001, 31 January 2002, 31 January 2005, and 31 January 2010. Overall, Respondent\u2018s valuations purports to demonstrate that the emergency measures helped Claimants\u2018 business and that without the Emergency Measures EDEMSA\u2018s value would have been much lower, even in 2010. See Report on Issues Raised by the Tribunal of 23 September 2010, at paragraph 11.\n\n1190.\n\nAs further discussed below, the Tribunal finds MBG\u2018s models contain unreasonable assumptions. First, the Tribunal is not persuaded that EDEMSA benefitted from the Emergency Measures. Under the Regulatory Framework, almost all of EDEMSA\u2018s revenue came from tariffs, which, by operation of the Emergency Measures, decreased the revenue in dollar terms by 66%.\n\n1191.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal finds unreasonable Respondent\u2018s assertion that the tariff levels assumed in LECG\u2018s model would have triggered a radical drop in demand for electricity and significantly increased theft and uncollectables. To the contrary, the Tribunal was convinced by Dr. Manuel A. Abdala\u2018s testimony that even a large increase in tariffs in absolute terms would have had less of an actual impact on consumers because wholesale costs increased 118% as a result of inflation during the relevant time period. See Hearing Transcript of 14 February 2011, at 192:8 - 193:17 (English) (Abdala)87. Moreover, as explained by Professor Pablo T. Spiller of LECG, the tariff increase would have affected only the DAV portion of the tariff, making the overall increase in tariffs a much lower percentage than that asserted by Respondent. See Hearing Transcript of 14 February 2011, at 337:11 - 338:4 (English) (Spiller). The Tribunal agrees that the effect of tariff increase would have been further muted by the fact that electricity is a necessity good and thus has low demand elasticity. See Hearing Transcript of 14 February 2011, at 338:16 - 339:2 (English) (Spiller).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the transcript incorrectly states that wholesale inflation was 180% rather than the correct figure, 118%.\n\n1192.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal is unconvinced by MBG\u2018s calculation of zero value for EDEMSA in November and December 2001. As evidenced by the reports of credit rating agencies, EDEMSA\u2018s equity was not worthless as of December 2001. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 6.\n\n1193.\n\nThe evidence shows that in late December 2001, Standard & Poor as well as Fitch gave EDEMSA BBB+ and A- ratings, respectively. From this, the Tribunal finds clear that at the time of rating these agencies viewed EDEMSA to have a strong capacity to repay its debts. The Standard & Poor rating as of December 2001 was only one rank lower than Fitch\u2018s, which the Tribunal understands to mean that EDEMSA had an \"adequate financial risk profile.\" See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 13 (citing to S&P rates Corp Banca bonds BBB+). The Tribunal finds that ratings of either A- or BBB+ are incompatible with Respondent\u2018s assertions that EDEMSA\u2018s equity was zero at the end of December 2001.\n\n1194.\n\nAs indicated by the Fitch report, one of the key components of EDEMSA\u2018s high ratings was the guaranteed cash flows it received as part of the Concession Agreement. Fitch\u2018s April 2002 report, however, no longer listed \"flujo de fondos estables\" (translated in English as \"stable cash flow\") as one of EDEMSA\u2018s strengths. Accordingly, EDEMSA\u2018s ratings were dropped to a CCC. Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 8.\n\n1195.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2018s view, the significance of EDEMSA\u2018s high rating does not lose force simply because Fitch had provided similar ratings for other companies which also defaulted on their obligations. In fact, not all of the companies listed by Respondent received a high rating from Fitch, whose valuations in fact ranged from AAA to D. Like EDEMSA, the regulated companies received high scores while some unregulated companies received low ratings in the period just before the Emergency Measures. If such companies, like EDEMSA, had assumed debt in U.S. dollars while receiving guarantee of payment also in dollars, the pesification and freeze of the tariffs would have created a severe imbalance in the concessionaire\u2018s economic equilibrium, thereby making it arduous to cover obligations. Absent concrete evidence otherwise, the fact that these regulated companies later defaulted on their debt does not support Respondent\u2018s assertion that the ratings are unreliable.\n\n1196.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal cannot accept Respondent\u2018s argument that the Fitch reports were merely domestic ratings so as to exclude consideration of macroeconomic changes. To the contrary, the very language of the 27 December 2001 Fitch report explicitly recognizes that \"the uncertainty of the macroeconomic context\" contributing to EDEMSA\u2018s decrease in rating from A to A-. See Fitch Ratings Report (27 December 2001), Exhibit C263, at page 1.\n\n1197.\n\nWhat is more, Argentina\u2018s quantum expert admitted in his later testimony that Fitch had taken macroeconomic conditions into account when rating EDEMSA. Claimants\u2018 PostHearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 11 (citing to Hearing Transcript of 14 February 2011, at 248:4 - 7 (English) (Molina)). In any event, Respondent has failed to advance evidence of any international rating of EDEMSA that would undercut Fitch\u2018s analysis of EDEMSA\u2018s capacity to provide payment of principal and interest on its obligations.\n\n1198.\n\nThird, the difficulties with the MBG models are further highlighted by the fact that said experts of Respondent abandoned their earlier model submitted during the merits phase of this proceeding.\n\n1199.\n\nThe quantum phase model submitted by the same experts is inconsistent with the prior model in that key figures have been modified, including a 77% decrease in firm value; increase in the country risk premium by 3% (from 7% to 10%); and the addition of an EBITDA/sales cap.\n\n1200.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2018s argument, these changes are inconsistent with the Tribunal\u2018s instructions set forth in its letter of 9 July 2010. Nothing in the Tribunal\u2018s instructions required a change in the assumptions taken for the valuation of EDEMSA as of 31 December 2001. Rather, the Tribunal simply requested that Argentina\u2018s experts explain what they had done in their previous model. Moreover, Argentina\u2018s experts have failed to advance any principled reason for their willingness to abandon the assumptions and results calculated in the merits phase.\n\n1201.\n\nWith respect to the 25 per cent EBITDA/sales cap, Respondent\u2018s experts fail to advance any justification or evidence as to warrant its inclusion as a limitation on EDEMSA\u2018s revenue. Under this 25% EBITDA/sales cap, if at a given tariff level the EBITDA exceeds 25% of revenues, a tariff reduction in real terms is implemented that year so that the resulting EBITDA would not exceed 25% of the adjusted revenues.\n\n1202.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there is no basis for the EBITDA/sales cap. The cap is inconsistent with EDEMSA\u2018s right to obtain a reasonable rate of return on its investment, which had been established in Article 43 of the Provincial Electricity Law and incorporated by reference under Article 28 of the Concession Agreement.\n\n1203.\n\nAs explained by Professor Spiller, an EBITDA/sales ratio has nothing to do with determining whether an investor has received a fair rate of return. The EBITDA is basically sales less operating costs, so the higher the latter value, the lower the EBITDA. Accordingly, companies with high operating costs would have a low EBITDA/sales ratio and vice versa.\n\n1204.\n\nUnder Respondent\u2018s approach, changes in the cost of wholesale electricity, which was designed in the regulatory system to be entirely a pass-through to the consumer, could affect the EBITDA and therefore the EBITDA/sales ratio.\n\n1205.\n\nRespondent has failed to advance evidence of any instances in which the Argentine electricity regulator has used an EBITDA/sales cap. Moreover, Respondent\u2018s experts fail to explain how it has reached the 25 per cent figure.\n\n1206.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2018s assertions, the Tribunal does not find that the 25 per cent EBITDA/sales cap was a fundamental feature of the SSB model. The Tribunal\u2018s view is supported by the fact that Argentina\u2018s model of 29 January 1998, which purported to be the basis of the SSB model, did not contain an EBITDA/sales cap. Moreover, line 398 of the tab \"Model\" of that January 1998 model contains a line called \"EBITDA/ingresos,\" which represents the EBITDA/sales ratio for each year of EDEMSA\u2018s operation. As highlighted by Claimants, 18 out of the 30 years of the concession assume a ratio of over 25 per cent. The Tribunal thus finds that such cap on EDEMSA\u2018s revenue was not contemplated.\n\n1207.\n\nLast, the Tribunal notes the inconsistency in Respondent\u2018s position with respect to its valuation for November and December 2001. Although MBG testified in the merits hearing that EDEMSA had experienced a significant drop in equity value between the end of November and the end of December 2001, their most recent calculations reflect no such decrease. See Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, 260:1-2 (English) (Bello); compare with MBG Report of September 2010, at paragraph 7.\n\n1208.\n\nFor the abovementioned reasons, the Tribunal dismisses MBG\u2018s version of the DCF method.\n\n**c) The Reliability of LECG's DCF Method**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n1209.\n\nThe Tribunal has been convinced that LECG\u2018s DCF model presents the more reliable set of calculations for a fair assessment of Claimants\u2018 damages. Respondent has been found responsible for denying Fair and Equitable Treatment in the context of re-establishing the parties\u2018 economic equilibrium under the Concession Agreement.\n\n1210.\n\nThe fairest measure of damages for that breach would be the genuine value of the investment. Such a standard has been recognized in Article 5 of the Argentina-France BIT as the appropriate measure of compensation in cases of dispossession. Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT does not present any alternative formulation for determining the value of a business diminished by unfair or inequitable treatment. Consequently, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to examine the value of EDEMSA had it not been reduced by the Emergency Measures.\n\n1211.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of Respondent\u2018s argument that Claimants\u2018 DCF model is faulty since it argues that the value of the company is simply equal to the accounting value of its assets at the beginning of the first period of operations. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 2. Respondent asserts that LECG uses the DCF method to calculate the tariff adjustment needed in 2002 to recover the price paid by the shareholders during privatization, rather than to assess the value of EDEMSA. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraph 56. In Respondent\u2018s calculations, Claimants\u2018 share of the official valuation amount had been US$ 107 million, which was approximately US$ 100 million lower than the amount of Claimants\u2018 actual investment (US$ 209 million).\n\n1212.\n\nWith respect to Respondent\u2018s defenses against LECG\u2018s method, Claimants assert that nothing in the bidding process or the regulatory framework purported to limit the investor\u2018s return on the EDEMSA investment to the official valuation amount. Rather, Claimants had a reasonable expectation that they would receive a return on their full investment. Moreover, there is no basis whatsoever to assume that Claimants overbid, whether due to expected synergies or for any other reason. In Claimants\u2018 view, the fact that other sophisticated investors bid similar amounts, which were also significantly in excess of the official valuation amount, confirms that the amount of Claimants\u2018 bid was reasonable.\n\n1213.\n\nConsistent with the Provincial Electricity Law, LECG has accounted for the investor\u2018s reasonable rate of return on their investment. See LECG Report of 28 April 2005, at paragraph 112; see also LECG Report of 30 April 2009, at paragraphs 6(f) and 58-89.\n\n1214.\n\nIn light of such assurance, which had been incorporated by reference in the Concession Agreement, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants in that the proper asset base for determining Claimants\u2018 return on its investment should be the actual price paid for the EDEMSA shares.\n\n1215.\n\nThe Tribunal is unconvinced by Respondent\u2018s assertion that Claimants\u2018 return should be limited to the official valuation amount. This finding is supported by the fact that several sophisticated multinational companies also bid far in excess of the valuation amount. Moreover, Respondent has failed to offer any sound explanation as to why investors would have been willing to do that if the return on their investment would be limited to the official valuation amount. In the Tribunal\u2018s view, no rational investor would have been willing to agree with such restriction, which would have rendered it impossible for the investor to earn a return on its overall investment.\n\n1216.\n\nThe official valuation amount was simply referenced as a floor price, and thus the actual purchase price of the EDEMSA shares should be the basis for which Claimants reasonably sought a return on. During the merits hearing, it was found that even Argentina\u2018s expert, Dario Quiroga, had in a previous case taken the position that the purchase price, not the official valuation, should be included in the asset base. See Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, at page 2609, lines 4-18 (English) (Quiroga); see also MBG Cross-Examination Slide 22.\n\n1217.\n\nMoreover, Argentina\u2018s expert, Mr. Bello, recognized at the merits hearing that nowhere in the SSB report was there a statement as to the investor\u2018s return being limited to the amount of the official valuation. See Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, at page 2558, lines 17-21 (English) (Bello). Rather, Mr. Bello admitted that the official valuation report repeatedly stated that the official valuation was merely designed to be a floor price. See Hearing Transcript of 6 November 2009, at page 2609, lines 9-16 (English) (Bello).\n\n1218.\n\nThis finding is further supported by the very language of the official valuation decree.88 Moreover, both before and after issuance of such, the Government of Mendoza promulgated decrees specifically finding that the value of EDEMSA\u2018s concession should be based on the amount paid, while failing to make any mention of the official valuation. See Decree No. 197 (11 February 1998), Claimants\u2018 Exhibit 19; Decree No. 1176 (27 July 1998), Claimants\u2018 Exhibit 57; see also Claimants\u2018 Quantum Opening, Slides 7-8.\n\nSee Articles 2 and 3 of Decree No. 901 of 16 June 1998, Claimants\u2018 Exhibit C-13 (\"The official valuation for... 51% of [EDEMSA\u2018s] capital stock... is established to be AR$122,197,000. Accordingly... no price offer shall be admitted that is lower than 70% of the official valuation, that is to say, AR$85,587,900\"); see also Claimants\u2018 Quantum Opening, Slide 6.\n\n1219.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that the proper asset base for purposes of DCF calculations should be the actual price paid for the EDEMSA shares, not the official valuation amount.\n\n1220.\n\nRespondent further argues that Claimants\u2018 LECG report engaged in inappropriate and circular valuations. According to Respondent, LECG only uses the DCF method to calculate the equilibrium tariff on the basis of a predetermined value, the tariff base necessary for cash flows to equate to the amount paid for EDEMSA\u2018s shares. See MBG Report of November 2010, at paragraphs 51-54.\n\n1221.\n\nUpon close examination, the Tribunal does not find that LECG\u2018s DCF model engages in circular analysis. As highlighted by the Claimants, LECG\u2018s DCF model in fact yields a 29.4 per cent drop in EDEMSA\u2018s equity between 1998 and 2001. Such decrease would not have been made if, as asserted by Respondent, the LECG model sought to maintain a value that was equal to the price paid. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that this percentage figure is comparable to the average decrease in value of analogous regulated companies on Argentina\u2018s stock market. See LECG Report of April 2009, at paragraph 134, Graph IX.\n\n1222.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2018s position, the Tribunal finds that EDEMSA did maintain a positive value as of December 2001. Such finding is consistent with EDEMSA\u2018s financials, which were showing an increase in profitability. What is more, the reports submitted by Fitch as well as S&P further evidence that EDEMSA\u2018s equity value was not zero as of December 2001.\n\n**d) Purchase Price Starting Point for Analysis**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1223.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by Respondent\u2018s argument that Claimants significantly overpaid for the EDEMSA shares. Indeed, no evidence presented in this case detracts from the plausibility of the amount paid as a reasonable starting point for calculating quantum.\n\n1224.\n\nFor the first five years, the regulatory regime contemplated established immutable tariffs. Moreover, the investment would depreciate over the course of the fixed term, and thus the amount depreciated would not be accounted for during the five-year tariff review.\n\n1225.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2018s view, no reasonable investor would have overbid knowing it would be subject to the five-year time lag before a tariff increase, at which point the asset would have depreciated. In this connection, the Tribunal finds unreasonable that rational investors would not have calculated the amount of their bid based on a possibility of future tariff increases to cover the amount of the bid.\n\n1226.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no evidence that Claimants\u2018 overbid in anticipation of synergies. As underscored by Claimants\u2018 witness, Mr. Blandin, nothing in the record suggests the existence of synergies. See Hearing Transcript of 2 November 2009, at 1027:7-12 (English) (Blandin); see also Hearing Transcript of 2 November 2009, at 1025:14-1026:2 (English) (Blandin). Such finding is consistent with the fact that more than 99% of EDEMSA\u2018s activities were regulated, thereby inherently limiting the scope of any potential synergies to almost nothing.\n\n1227.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal finds no reason to depart from the price actually paid for EDEMSA (adjusted pro rata to correspond to Claimants\u2018 interest) as the starting point for analysis, we have neverthtless tested the rigor of our views by looking to the second highest bid, paid by Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Electricidad Mendoza, which was $207.7 million, or more than 87% of the $237.8 million actually paid.\n\n1228.\n\nThis alternative was considered by LECG as an alternative proposal. Were that path followed, the asset base would include $207.7 million as opposed to SODEMSA\u2018s $237.8 million bid. See Claimants\u2018 Observations on Supplementary Quantum Report by Argentina\u2018s Damage Experts, 15 November 2010 at paragraph 13; LECG Supplemental Report of 30 April 2009 at Graph VI, page 41.\n\n1229.\n\nAs discussed below, exploration of this alternative has confirmed the soundness for use of the highest bid, which also comports with practice in an industry where a variety of companies have included purchase price in the initial book value of their assets, which in turn factors into the expected return on investment.89\n\nSee 11LECG Report, Damage Valuation and Assessment, 30 April 2009, at paragraphs 70-74, including a survey of seventeen (17) entities which registered purchase price originally paid as their book value of assets.\n\n1230.\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Tribunal finds no reason to deviate from Claimants\u2018 actual investment in setting the initial asset base.\n\n1231.\n\nThe Argentina-France BIT provides only one valuation standard. Article 5(2) speaks of \" *la valeur r\u00e9elle* \" in the French and \" *el valor real* \" in the Spanish, both translated as \"genuine value\" in the English. This value must be established under \"normal\" conditions prior to any threat by the host state.\n\n1232.\n\nTo determine genuine value one usually asks what a willing buyer would have paid for a business as of a particular date, which in our case would be the end of December 2001. For an electricity company, such a buyer would look to revenue streams that might be generated, and thus examine the local tariff regulatory regime to see what cash might be expected. The buyer would note that Article 43 of the Mendoza Provincial Electricity Law says that investors receive a reasonable rate of return (una tasa de rentabilidad razonable) on the amount invested. Since we do not have an actual investment in December 2001, the next best starting point would be the amount actually paid for the investment, on which a reasonable return can be calculated. Bidders normally determine their price as a function of forecasts on the project\u2018s viability in light of variables which include projected revenues and costs.\n\n1233.\n\nThe willing buyer would also look at other aspects of the regulatory framework. Provincial Decree 197/98 allow share capital to be increased in an amount that reflects \"the societies\u2018 assets, the value of the concession granted by the Province of Mendoza, *determined by the proportional amount of the winning economic bid of the lender.'* Emphasis added.\n\n1234.\n\nOf course, the amount invested is not the end of the story. Other elements have been taken into consideration. Indeed, the method adopted by the Tribunal has yielded a value of approximately $147 million, down from the $209 million pro rata investment attributable to Claimants\u2018 shares in EDEMSA. For the sake of good order, the Tribunal again notes that Claimants\u2018 stake was 44.88% of the capital, and that the $237 million bid was made for 51% of EDEMSA Class \"A' shares offered by the Province of Mendoza.\n\n1235.\n\nIn other words, the Tribunal has adopted a quantum of approximately two-thirds (2/3) of the actual price paid.\n\n1236.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes the Award in *Azurix Corp. v. Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12) as one example of a tribunal using the second-best offer as the initial asset base. In *Azurix* the tribunal took into account a lower \"Canon Payment' than the one actually made by the claimant. In that case, however, the second highest bid was less than nine percent of the amount ultimately bid by the investor. The winning bid totaled $438 million, while the second place bid was approximately $38 million.\n\n1237.\n\nThe discrepancy between the highest and the second highest bid in Azurix is clearly distinguishable from this arbitration, where the second highest bid totaled 87% of the actual price paid: $207.7 million as contrasted with $237.8 million.\n\n1238.\n\nThus no evidence exists that Claimants\u2018 bid was unreasonably high. Several other firms made competitive bids. In total, there were nine bids: three over US$ 200 million, a fourth bid close to US$ 190 million, and the last five below this value. See LECG Supplemental Report of 30 April 2009 at paragraph 63.\n\n1239.\n\nThe closeness of the first and second bids provides strong evidence of the commercially realistic and reasonable nature of the purchase price.\n\n1240.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the Argentine Natural Gas Regulator (ENARGAS), in its 2001 methodological paper on how to proceed with a tariff review, provides a description of how to measure the asset base for the purpose of computing the tariff level in a tariff review, and such description explicitly includes a reference to the purchase price:\n\n\"The initial asset valuation for each five-year period under analysis will consist of.... The global price paid at the moment of the privatization for the totality of the assets acquired by the license. This value has the advantage of being known, objective, and furthermore, recognized by the Basic Rules of the Licenses as the base of the initial value of the Essential and Non-Essential assets.\"\n\nSee LECG Supplemental Report of 30 April 2009 at paragraph 75; ENARGAS, March 2001, op. cit. (Claimant\u2018s translation), Exhibit CE036.\n\n1241.\n\nIn determining the anticipated tariff rates, the LECG methodology, found reasonable by the Tribunal, takes into account the several criteria enumerated in Article 43, including subsection (d) of that provision, which attempts to ensure that consumers pay a minimum reasonable cost for electricity.\n\n**e) Valuation Assumptions**\n----------------------------\n\n1242.\n\nAs discussed below, the Tribunal finds the assumptions underlying LECG\u2018s DCF valuation method to be realistic. The Tribunal has paid particular attention to the WACC calculations, which prove critical to the DCF method. In calculating future income, a higher rate yields greater future income. Conversely, in working backwards, discounting future income streams to a starting point, the higher rates yield lower starting values. The more secure the investment, the lower the discount rate and vice versa. A $100 bank deposit in a trusted institution might earns 1%, interest over the course of a decade, while the same amount invested over the same time in a speculative commercial venture would command 5%. However, starting with an income stream rather than capital, the greater rate indicates a smaller initial value. Thus $10 earned over a decade in a secure bank at 1% simple interest suggests an initial deposit of $100. However, that same $10 income stream over the same period for the more speculative venture at 5% would indicate an investment of only $20.\n\n1243.\n\nThe key assumptions and figures in the LECG approach to WACC have been set forth below.\n\n**(1) Cost of Equity**\n----------------------\n\n1244.\n\nThe Tribunal starts with the LECG assumption on the cost of equity as a measurement of the return a company pays to its equity investors to obtain their capital. The Tribunal finds that the CAP Model is widely used to calculate the cost of equity. Under this model, investors must be compensated for time value of money and risk.\n\n1245.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the time value of money is represented by the risk-free rate. The risk component in that rate would normally be identified as \"beta' in economic measures. The beta quantifies the volatility (systematic risk) of an investment in relation to market movements.\n\n1246.\n\nThe CAP Model provides that the opportunity cost of equity is equal to the return on riskfree securities, plus the company\u2018s systematic risk (beta), multiplied by the market price of risk (market risk premium). The equation for the cost of equity (kE) is as follows:\n\nkE = rf + [ E(rm) - rf ] \\* (beta) where:\n\nrf = the risk free rate of return.\n\nE(rm) = the expected rate of return on the overall market portfolio.\n\nE(rm) - rf = the market risk premium. beta = the systematic risk of the equity.\n\n1247.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the applicable U.S. Treasury Bond rate. Claimants suggest the ten- year rate whereas Respondent the thirty-year rate. The Tribunal finds the 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond rate more suitable. The risk free rate would be the return on a zero-beta portfolio, and the beta value from the 10-year rate is closer to zero than that of the thirty-year bonds (according to JP Morgan, thirty-year Treasury Bonds have a beta of 0.25). In this regard, the Tribunal finds reasonable LECG\u2018s calculation of 5.09% as the applicable risk-free rate.\n\n1248.\n\nThe Tribunal understands the market risk premium as the extra return that the market provides over the risk-free rate to compensate for market risk. This is quantified by the difference between the expected rate of return on the market portfolio and the risk free rate. LECG advances that the main differences in the various approaches for calculating the market risk premium are (i) the time period for analyzing historic returns should be used and (ii) whether an arithmetic or a geometric average should be calculated to arrive to the expected market risk premium. The Tribunal finds it appropriate to look to long periods of historical data available, as the market risk premium tends to follow a random walk. In this connection, the Tribunal finds reasonable LECG\u2018s use of historic data for the period 1928-2001.\n\n1249.\n\nGiven the long time horizon under consideration, the Tribunal considers the geometric average (rather than the arithmetic mean) as a better indicator when calculating the risk premium, given the long-term historic negative correlation among stocks from different economic entities and sectors. The Tribunal finds suitable LECG\u2018s calculation of 5.17% geometric average for the period from 1928 to 2001. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at 97, Table XIV.\n\n1250.\n\nAccording to LECG, data of beta assessments from developing countries\u2018 stock exchanges are highly volatile and unreliable. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at 98, paragraph 9. In addition, betas of several companies are often needed, as this makes the sample much more stable. Respondent\u2018s experts also advance that it is difficult to find relevant local companies in the local stock exchange that are comparable with EDEMSA. Finding such views reasonable, the Tribunal is convinced that a more reliable beta value is yielded by estimating the beta for an equivalent company in a developed economy such as the U.S., and then adjusting to reflect the extra return required for investing in a developing economy. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at 98, paragraph 10. In this connection, the Tribunal finds more suitable the raw beta measurements established by Ibbotson, rather than relying on assessment of the few U.S. companies selected by MBG.\n\n1251.\n\nIbbotson provides betas based on U.S.-based industries by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. The SIC code 4911 comprises 51 companies from the electricity generation, transmission and/or distribution industry, which the Tribunal finds appropriate and comparable to EDEMSA\u2018s business.\n\n1252.\n\nThe raw and levered beta obtained from Ibbotson Cost of Capital Yearbook 2001 is equal to 0.06. When adjusted for \"reversion to one,' the beta value of one (1) represents that the security\u2018s price will move with the market. A beta of less than 1 indicates that the price is less volatile than the market. Consistent with the Parties\u2018 views, the raw figure is then adjusted according to the following methodology: Adjusted Beta = (0.67) \\* Raw Beta + (0.33) = 0.37.\n\n1253.\n\nThis adjusted value, however, only reflects the risk of a company with the average capital structure of the Ibbotson sample used. Since typically the American and Argentine electricity sectors have different capital structures, the beta calculated above must be further adjusted to reflect the appropriate leverage.\n\n1254.\n\nThe first task is to un-lever the adjusted beta value calculated above. The Tribunal understands the un-levered beta to be the systematic risk without any debt. The Ibbotson Yearbook 2001 provides the U.S. industry, average debt/ equity (D/E) ratio to be 84%. Using these figures, the un-levered beta is calculated under the following formula: BU = BL / (1+ ((1-t)D/E)).\n\n1255.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the un-levered beta must be adjusted for regulatory differences. The Tribunal agrees with LECG\u2018s observation that U.S. electric utilities are typically regulated under a rate of return regime, while Argentine utilities are regulated under price cap regimes.\n\n1256.\n\nRate of return regimes are less risky for investors as their rate of return on investments are assured. In contrast, business risk is higher on a price cap regime because, once tariffs are fixed, any future inefficiencies are precluded from passing through to tariffs. In the Tribunal\u2018s view, the higher risk is evident by the higher expected returns for investors regulated under price cap regimes.\n\n1257.\n\nAfter accounting for these regulatory adjustments, the beta is re-levered to reflect the expected D/E ratio for the Argentine industry.\n\n1258.\n\nLECG\u2018s D/E ratio reflects its expectations on the future optimal capital structure for a local company. See LECG Report of April 2005, at page 100, Table XV. LECG first calculates the debt / firm value (D/FV) for each year based on the D/FV ratios of several companies in the local industry. See LECG Report of April 2009, at page 91, paragraph 172. Next, LECG calculates the market capitalization weighted average across several years to isolate any specific event that might have changed the ratio in any particular year. LECG then converts this D/FV average ratio into a D/E ratio. LECG calculates the average D/E, weighted by capitalization, to be 33.3% for the period 1994-2001. In this connection, the weighted average D/E yields 25% for the weight of debt in the capital structure. In turn, the weight of equity equals 75%.\n\n1259.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that these percentages (25% for weight of debt and 75% for weight of equity) are not the only rates that might have been used. For example, a 21.9% weight of debt appears in the book values of the December 2001 financial statements. However, there is nothing inherently unreasonable about a 25/75 allocation as between debt and equity, which remains in line with the averages presented in Table XV of LECG\u2018s 2005 Report. See page 100.\n\n1260.\n\nFollowing the above-mentioned steps, the Tribunal finds that the calculation of the levered beta (adjusted to one) equals 60%.\n\n1261.\n\nLECG advances that adjustments to equity return must be made to reflect the risk of investing in Argentina. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at page 100, paragraph 18. In this connection, LECG recommends the Relative Volatility approach as opposed to the Country Debt Spread approach.\n\n1262.\n\nWhen involving investment in emerging countries such as Argentina, the cost of equity must account for a country risk premium. The country risk premium represents the premium required by an investor to place money in a foreign investment.\n\n1263.\n\nThe Tribunal understands the Country Debt Spread methodology to calculate the country risk through the spread between the local Government bond and U.S. Treasury bonds, and then to add this factor to get to the return on equity.\n\n1264.\n\nAlthough simple and widely used, the Country Debt Spread approach tends to be a volatile measure. In particular, it becomes unreliable in situations like the present case where high country risk figures are involved. When countries are approaching defaultlike situations, like Argentina did in year 2001, the measure reaches high values of risk, turning the proxy for country risk premium into an unrealistic measure for a cost of equity calculation. Moreover, when countries enter default, like Argentina did in 2002, the sovereign debt spread becomes almost irrelevant, as the country no longer has access to sources of finance.\n\n1265.\n\nInstead, the Tribunal finds the Relative Volatility approach to be more suitable under the present circumstances. The Tribunal understands the Relative Volatility approach to measure the volatility of the market in question relative to a referenced market. This methodology adds to the equity return a factor based on the ratio of the volatilities of the local and the reference stock exchanges. In this connection, the Tribunal finds reasonable LECG\u2018s use of Bloomberg\u2018s volatility factors, identified by the sigma factor in the equation below.\n\n1266.\n\nFor good order, the Tribunal notes Respondent\u2018s method in calculating the country risk premium. After due consideration, the Tribunal is less persuaded by Respondent\u2018s approach, which appears to render an excessive value of country risk premium and then apply a 10% ceiling to their historical average without sufficient justification.\n\n1267.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal finds that EDEMSA\u2018s cost of equity should be calculated using the following formula:\n\nre = rf +Beta \\* US Market Risk Premium \\* (oarg / ous)\n\n1268.\n\nApplying the figures, EDEMSA\u2018s cost of equity as of 2001 yields as follows:\n\nre = 5.09% + 0.60 \\* 5.17% \\* (5.45%/2.15%) = 12.97%\n\n**(2) Cost of Debt**\n--------------------\n\n1269.\n\nCost of debt is the overall rate that a company pays on its debt obligations.\n\n1270.\n\nLECG calculates the cost of debt in a different way than by basing it on a developed world company or industry, and then adding the country risk. Their justifications for not adopting such approach are that (i) in the present situation the country risk has an extremely high level, and (ii) local utilities get financing at rates the same as or lower than the government. See Appendix B of LECG 2005 Report, at page 102, paragraphs 23-24. LECG instead recommends both analyzing the historic cost of debt and credit ratings at each time, and estimating the future cost of debt by estimating the company\u2018s future credit rating.\n\n1271.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees. Credit ratings provide proper basis for cost of debt analysis in that established agencies such as Standard & Poor take into consideration the cost of debt of the valued company, generally yielding a negative correlation between the rating and cost of debt.\n\n1272.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal finds reasonable to use the ratings of mid 2001, which values EDEMSA before the collapse of the Argentine economy, in order to estimate future credit ratings.\n\n1273.\n\nAs advanced by LECG, the Tribunal finds that during mid 2001 most utility companies had a credit rating similar to that of Standard & Poor\u2018s AA+ rating. The Tribunal has thus used this credit grading for calculating the 2001 WACC rate.\n\n1274.\n\nFor the historic period, the Tribunal agrees with LECG\u2018s use of the actual cost of debt for the AA+ ratings of sample local companies.\n\n1275.\n\nIn order to arrive at the 2001 figure, the difference between the AA+ rating of each year and the respective risk free rate is calculated. Then, a simple average of the differences is determined, and the 2001 risk free rate is added, with the final value yielding a cost of debt of 9.94%.\n\n1276.\n\nUsing these figures, the Tribunal calculates the WACC rate as follows:\n\nWACC = 12.97% \\* 75% + 9.94% \\* (1-35%)\\* 25% = 11.34%\n\n**(3) Application of WACC Rate**\n--------------------------------\n\n1277.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it appropriate to apply the same discount rate (WACC rate of 11.34%) for both the actual and but-for scenarios. See LECG Report of April 2009, at pages 88-89, paragraphs 162-65.\n\n1278.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with LECG\u2018s approach to hold the WACC constant across the two scenarios. As advanced by LECG, the only difference considered between the two scenarios is the Emergency Measures affecting EDEMSA. This is because LECG has accounted for the effects of such measures on EDEMSA\u2018s revenues and costs under its cash flow assessment. In effect, adjusting the discount rate would result in double counting of the effects of the Emergency Measures. Moreover, the Emergency Measures pertain to neither the macroeconomic effects of such laws enacted nor the pesification of the whole economy, but rather EDEMSA\u2018s tariffs.\n\n1279.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the valuation date of 31 December 2001 should be used to determine the value of Claimants\u2018 shares immediately before the Emergency Measures.\n\n1280.\n\nTo determine the value to all shareholders, LECG subtracts EDEMSA\u2018s financial debt as of 31 December 2001 from the firm value.\n\n1281.\n\nWith respect to EDEMSA\u2018s financial debt under the \"but-for' scenario, LECG has used the book value of the financial debt as of 31 December 2001, which totals US$ 119,644,020. See LECG Report of September 2010, at paragraph 24, Table II. The Tribunal finds such assumption reasonable given that the book value prior to enactment of the Emergency Measures would have been a reliable indication as to the value of EDEMSA\u2018s debts.\n\n1282.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that LECG calculates the regulatory asset base as of 2001 by taking the purchase price of the EDEMSA shares and adding the net investments of the 1998-2001 period as well as the 2001 stock of working capital. In the Tribunal\u2018s view, LECG presents a reliable method in calculating the asset base and applicable market risks.\n\n1283.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal finds reasonable LECG\u2018s underlying assumptions including those concerning the macroeconomic conditions, operating and capital expenditures, energy-purchasing costs, as well as the electricity-demand factor.\n\n1284.\n\nWith respect to tariffs, the Tribunal finds that, in accordance with Article 28 of the Concession Agreement, an Ordinary Tariff Review would have taken place in 2002, which would have allowed the company to recover the value of its tariff base over the life of the concession, at its cost of capital.\n\n1285.\n\nTo determine the present value of the free cash flows, LECG has used a discount factor determined by the WACC, which represents a measure of the cost of raising funds from shareholders and lenders in a company operating in the industry at hand.\n\n**f) EDEMSA's Value Following 2005 Sale**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1286.\n\nClaimants assert that the residual value of their investment is equal to the sales price as of 2005, which as established in Article 3.1 of the SPA of 30 June 2004, was US$2 million.\n\n1287.\n\nIn the absence of any tariff revision, perhaps the Tribunal might find that figure a reasonable measure of the fair market value of EDEMSA in 2005.\n\n1288.\n\nHowever, the sale of EDEMSA was made in the context of a tariff renegotiation process required by law. Mendoza set up a commission for the renegotiation and fixed an initial time period for the renegotiation of 180 days after 2 February 2003. The time period was extended several times, through December 2003, December 2004, June 2005 and, finally, until December 2005.\n\n1289.\n\nDuring that process, in March 2003 a freeze of the quality standards was granted, allowing EDEMSA to postpone investment obligations. Furthermore, in February 2005 the Province of Mendoza announced a projected 38.05 % tariff increase. A reference to this announcement was included in EDEMSA\u2018s Financial Statements. On 7 April 2005, a Letter of Understanding (\"Carta de Entendimiento') was signed between EDEMSA and Mendoza, reaching an agreement on the renegotiation process and including that tariff increase and other measures. Later tariff increases were approved in 2008 (51%) and 2009 (56%).\n\n1290.\n\nRespondent asserts that the extended period of renegotiation was reasonable because the period between the measures and the end of the renegotiation was one of complete disruption of all relevant economic indicators.\n\n1291.\n\nClaimants allege that they had no obligation to maintain their shares until the renegotiation process ended. Moreover, according to Claimants, subsequent tariff increases should have little bearing on assessment of the market price at the time of the sale, given that such future increases were purely speculative, with no assurance of being realized in the foreseeable future.\n\n1292.\n\nWhile the renegotiation process was open, on 30 June 2004, Claimants signed an SPA with IADESA, another of EDEMSA\u2018s indirect shareholders. The closing took place on 30 March 2005, only a week before the Letter of Understanding was executed between EDEMSA and the Province of Mendoza in February 2005. Two years later, in 2007, IADESA sold its 51% stake in EDEMSA for $ 60 million.\n\n1293.\n\nRespondent contends that by selling EDEMSA in the middle of the renegotiation process, Claimants \"got off the horse in the middle of the river.' The consequences, they say, are not imputable to Respondent. See Hearing on Quantum, Argentina\u2018s Opening Statement, at 51, lines 5 to 15; reiterated by Respondent in Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum at paragraphs 31, 35, 43 and Post-Hearing Brief on Merits at paragraphs 94, 101, 105.\n\n1294.\n\nIn other words, Respondent alleges that the damages claimed in this arbitration were not caused by the Emergency Measures, but by Claimants\u2018 own decision to divest of its investment while the renegotiation process was still open.\n\n1295.\n\nClaimants allege that they were entitled, at any point following the Measures that caused the damage, to divest their interest in EDEMSA to mitigate the damage that they were suffering as a result of the measures adopted by Argentina (Claimants\u2018 Post Hearing Brief on the Merits at paragraph 108). Evidence shows that the Claimants withdrew from Argentina also as part of a larger EDF strategy to terminate certain damaged investments in anticipation of a public offer of EDF\u2018s Shares (Claimants\u2018 Reply at paragraphs 46). That is to say, the Claimants had entrepreneurial reasons for abandoning Argentina at that point in time.\n\n1296.\n\nEDFI sold the investment to IADESA, without including any provision in the SPA for the case that the renegotiation ended up with a tariff increase and/or any other measure that might reestablish all or part of the enterprises\u2018 potential value. The SPA did not contain any specific stipulation concerning the results of a renegotiation process that could entail a significant change in the concession economy.90\n\nThe SPA only contained a standard price revision clause (Article 3.2 Potential Additional Price) should EDEMSA\u2018s gross margin be higher than US$ 55 million. The additional payment would be equal to 15% of the surplus over that figure.\n\n1297.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that EDFI sold to IADESA for US$ 2 million its 44.88% stake in EDEMSA. IADESA in turn, resold that interest, together with its own 6.12%, for US$ 60 million.\n\n1298.\n\nBoth seller and buyer were EDEMSA\u2018s shareholders. Each side to the sale should have had a knowledge of the context for that transaction. IADESA, as buyer, already held a 6.12 % stake in EDEMSA. While negotiating the sale of EDEMSA, Claimants and IADESA knew that a tariff change was being discussed with the Province.\n\n1299.\n\nIn fact, the Document \"Projet EMMA\" (4 July 2004) shows that one of the \"important risks\" associated with the projected sale of EDEMSA that the Board of Directors of EDFI took into consideration was, precisely, the risk that crystallized in this case: a \"fast resale after a tariff raise with a significant capital gain, right under the threshold triggering the mechanism of complement pricing, exposing EDF to criticism for an inappropriate and bad managed exit.\" That notwithstanding, no specific provision was included in the SPA.\n\n1300.\n\nIn 2007 EDEMSA\u2018s shares were sold by IADESA to a third party for 60 million.\n\n1301.\n\nIt would be patently unfair to allow Claimants to recover damages for loss that could have been avoided by taking reasonable steps. In other words, the injured party must be held responsible for its own contribution to the loss.\n\n1302.\n\nThe duty to mitigate damages is a well-established principle in investment arbitration.91 This idea is reflected in *Middle East Cement v. Egypt,* where that tribunal clearly recognized it as a general principle of law:\n\nSee also Commentary to Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for International Wrongful Acts.\n\n1303.\n\n\"The duty to mitigate damages is not expressly mentioned in the BIT. However, this duty can be considered to be part of the General Principles of Law which, in turn, are part of the rules of international law which are applicable in this dispute according to Art. 42 of the ICSID Convention.'92\n\n*Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/6), Award, 12 April 2002, at paragraph 167. The same idea can be seen at *AIG Capital Partners, Inc. and CJSC Tema Real Estate Company v. Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/6), Award, 7 October 2003, at paragraph 10.6.4.\n\n1304.\n\nThe duty to mitigate damages was also considered by the International Court of Justice *obiter* in the *Case Concerning the Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia);* the principle was enunciated by the Court as follows:\n\n1305.\n\n\"It would follow from such a principle that an injured State which has failed to take the necessary measures to limit the damage sustained would not be entitled to claim compensation for that damage which could have been avoided.'93\n\n*Case Concerning the Gabc\u00edkovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary/Slovakia), Judgment, 25 September 1997, at paragraph 80.\n\n1306.\n\nWhether the aggrieved party has taken reasonable steps to reduce the loss is a question of fact, not law. What is reasonable depends largely upon the facts of the individual case.\n\n1307.\n\nIn this case both seller and buyer were shareholders in EDEMSA, which was renegotiating the Concession terms and a tariff review. The Claimants would normally be expected to have incorporated a specific clause in the SPA to take this process into account as well as the concomitant changes in the economic framework.\n\n1308.\n\nNevertheless, the SPA did not contain any stipulation for the case in which the renegotiation process ended with success, or the tariffs were raised, or other means of reparation were accorded to EDEMSA.\n\n1309.\n\nEDFI, the seller, only retained the international claim against the Republic of Argentina pending before this Tribunal (Article 9.1.7 of the SPA) and the rights pertaining to this claim, leaving any possible benefit derived from the renegotiation process to the buyer (except for the part of that benefit that the standard price revision clause could capture).\n\n1310.\n\nBy failing to take into account the renegotiation process in the SPA, Claimants failed to comply with their duty to minimize damages. Respondent is, thus, not liable for any loss attributable to Claimants\u2018 failure to take reasonable steps.\n\n1311.\n\nIn determining the extent to which the sales price should be deemed adjusted (and thus damages should be reduced) the Tribunal looks to the background of the renegotiation in course over the concession. A reasonable seller would try to retain some of the possible benefits and, therefore, in arm\u2018s-length transactions a seller and a buyer would accept to partake any substantial benefit. Absent any special circumstance, the Tribunal considers equitable to impute to each of the parties an equal share of 50% in those potential benefits. The buyer would have still enough incentives to buy and the seller would have taken a reasonable step to minimize its losses.\n\n1312.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal considers that an amount equivalent to the 50% of the value of their participation in EDEMSA, as evidenced by the 2007 sale, must be subtracted from the amount of damages to be awarded by the Tribunal.\n\n1313.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken into account that IADESA sold its stake in EDEMSA (51%) for an estimated US$ 60 million (LECG Supplementary Expert Report 30 April 2009 at paragraph 100 and Exhibit CE042). The Tribunal also notes that (i) when the Claimants sold their 44.88% in EDEMSA to IADESA in 2005 the latter already had a 6.12% stake in EDEMSA; and (ii) IADESA sold in 2007 its whole stake in EDEMSA (51%) to a third party. The price corresponding to the 44.88% stake is US$ 52.8 million, or US$60 million x 44.88 / 51 = $52.8 million.94.\n\nAccording to the purchaser\u2018s 2007 financial statements, the acquisition of IADESA\u2018s 51% stake in EDEMSA was completed on 2 October 2007 (25.5%) and 21 February 2008 (25.5%). See Andes Energ\u00eda plc 2007 Annual Report and Accounts (Exhibit CE043) at p. 2. For the sake of simplicity, the Tribunal will assume that the closing of the whole operation was completed on an intermediate date, *i.e.*, 31 December 2007.\n\n1314.\n\nThe Tribunal will discount that price to 31 December 2001. For this purpose, the Tribunal will use the following formula where *PV =* present value, *FV =* future value, and *wacc* = weighted average cost of capital.\n\nPV = FV / (1+wacc)t\n\n1315.\n\nApplying above formula the result is as follows where time is 6 years (from 31 December 2007 to 31 December 2001).\n\nPV = 52,800,000 / (1+0.11)^6 = 28,229,036\n\n1316.\n\nFifty per cent (50%) of the resulting amount yields $14,114,518, which would reasonably be the price obtained for the 2005 sale.\n\n1317.\n\nIn summary, the starting point for adjustment to damages is to recognize the $60 million obtained by IADESA for sale of its 51% share of EDEMSA in 2007. Claimant\u2018s 44.88% share would have been $52.8 million (44.88 / 51 = 88%. 60 x.88 = 52.8). Discounting that amount, at the 11% WACC rate, going back to 2001 would yield US$ 28,229,036 (US$ 52.8 million / (1 +.11) ^ 6 = $28,229,036). 50% of that amount would come to US$ 14,114,518.\n\n**3. Pre-Emergency Measures Affecting the Concession**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) Overview**\n---------------\n\n1318.\n\nAside from the damages caused by the Emergency Measures, Claimants assert that additional injury resulted from other provincial actions implemented in relation to the Pre-Emergency Measures affecting the Concession. The total due, as explained later, is set forth in the following table:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Pre-Emergency Measures Claims** | **Amount (US$ December 2001)** |\n| Modification of Large users Tariff Schedule | 5,576,643 |\n| Total Damages to EDEMSA | 5,576,643 |\n| **Total Damages to Claimants (44.88%)** | **2,502,797** |\n\n1319.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Tribunal has encountered a number of difficulties in analysis and quantification of these claims, given that their categorization changed as between discussions by Claimants and Respondent, and also as between Claimants\u2018 briefing and the analysis of their expert, LECG. On some items (such as the Quasi-Currency) Claimant did not break out any separate quantification. On Pre-Emergency Measures, Respondent did not present alternative calculations of quantum, although on one item (Polvaredas) Respondent seems to have admitted that some compensation might be due, but without any suggested figure. This matter has been addressed more fully below.\n\n1320.\n\nFor guidance, the Tribunal sets forth the following summary chart of the various iterations of claims for Pre-Emergency Measures, along with the Tribunal\u2018s own grouping and conclusions.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Claimants | Respondent | LECG | Tribunal | Disposition |\n| Modification \u2014Use of Network Fee\" and/or \u2014Reduction of contracting period.\" | Modification \u2014Use of Network Fee\" | Modification \u2014Use of Network Fee\" | Modification of Tariff Schedule | Respondent Liable US$ 5,576,643 (Claimant\u2018s pro rata share being US$ 2,502,797) |\n| Optional T-2 Tariff Category | Optional T-2 Tariff Category | Creation of New Subsidized Tariffs to Large Users |\n| Unilateral Expansion Scope of Concession | Incorporation of Polvaredas into Concession Area |  | Expansion of Scope of Concession | Claim not Substantiated |\n| Incorporation of Scattered Electricity |\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Market Users |  |  |  |\n| Failure to Make Payments and Denial of Access to Court | Failure to Make Payments in Regards to Nihuil IV (First Claim) | Failure of Compensation for Nihuil IV | Failure to Pay Amount Owed | Of a contractual nature. Not covered by the umbrella clause. |\n| Failure to Make Payments in Regards to Nihuil IV (Second Claim) | Late Reimbursement of Subsidy Obligations |\n| Failure to Pay Subsidies and Provision of Public Lighting Services | Irrigation Subsidies LECG discussion failure to pay; but Parties address as separate claim. |\n| Modification of Agricultural Subsidies Regime | Modification of \"Agricultural Irrigation\" Subsidies Regime | Agricultural Irrigation Subsidies | Respondent not Liable |\n| More Stringent Quality Service Conditions | Imposition of More Stringent Conditions Regarding Quality of Service |  | Service Quality Conditions | Claim not Substantiated |\n| Quasi Currency | Imposition of Obligation to Pay Quasi Currency from Users |  | Quasi Currency | Claim not Substantiated |\n\n1321.\n\nAlthough Respondent did not address quantum with respect to Pre-Emergency Measures, Claimants\u2018 Expert LECG provided several reports on the matter. These reports, however, took a number of twists and turns which the Tribunal will address below. Consequently, the Tribunal first recalls the LECG analysis, following which it presents its own conclusion\n\n**b) Tribunal Conclusions**\n---------------------------\n\n1322.\n\nFor reasons elaborated above, the Tribunal has found Respondent liable only on claims related to one of the Pre-Emergency Claims presented by the Claimants.\n\n1323.\n\nThe Tribunal remains convinced that EPRE unilaterally modified the tariff schedule under the Concession Agreement. This includes (i) alteration of the Network-Use Fee applicable to T-2 large users, (ii) reduction of the twelve-month contracting period with users and (iii) implementation of measures relating to the transitory tariff, as well as the Optional T-2 Tariff. In accordance with LECG\u2018s figures, the Tribunal finds that this amounted to US$ 5,576,643 as of 31 December 2001. Claimants\u2018 damages are 44.88% of that amount, 2,502,797.\n\n**4. Interest**\n---------------\n\n1324.\n\nClaimants request that the Tribunal add compound interest to their damages, as from 31 December 2001 through the date of the payment of the Award.\n\n1325.\n\nAs discussed below, the Tribunal sees the rate on U.S. Treasury Bonds as representing a reasonable expectation of return in situations such as the present one. Indeed, Respondent does not appear to challenge that this risk-free rate would be one appropriate benchmark for interest.\n\n**a) Period after 2005 Sale of EDEMSA**\n---------------------------------------\n\n1326.\n\nAccording to Claimants, both side\u2018s experts agree that the applicable interest rate for the relevant period after the sale in 2005 should be the U.S. \"risk-free\" rate. Although this request was made prior to the down-grading of United States credit rating by Standard & Poor on 5 August 2011, the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the Parties\u2018 perspective on the matter, which seems reasonable.\n\n1327.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will award compound interest for this period at the \"risk-free\" rate as discussed below.\n\n1328.\n\nThe 2009 LECG Report takes the U.S. \"risk-free\" rate as the rate for 10 year U.S. Treasury Bonds, which would have averaged 4.2% over the period from mid-2005 to March 2009.\n\n**b) Period before 2005 Sale of EDEMSA**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1329.\n\nWith respect to the 2001-2005 period Claimants contend that the applicable interest rate should be the WACC because this rate is equivalent to Claimants\u2018 opportunity cost for their invested amount during their operation of the concession.\n\n1330.\n\nClaimants\u2018 calculations apply the same rate to the Pre-Emergency Measures through 31 March 2005. According to Claimants, from the moment of Respondent\u2018s breach of its obligations until the moment of divesture of EDEMSA Claimants\u2018 capital was tied to their Argentine investment.\n\n1331.\n\nClaimants further request that the Tribunal apply a compound interest rate. See Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 56. In support of their view, Claimants cite to several prior awards.95 Claimants assert that both as a matter of law and economics, simple interest is not sufficient. Claimants\u2018 Reply of 30 April 2009, at paragraph 702. In this connection, Claimants cite to one commentator who posits that \"in the last 10 years tribunals have predominantly awarded compound interest.\" Sergey Ripinsky with Kevin Williams, DAMAGES IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW 384 (citation omitted). Since 2000, numerous international tribunals have awarded compound interest in investor-state disputes.96\n\nClaimants cite to inter alia *Compa\u00f1ia del Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. and Vivendi Universal, S.A. v. Argentina* (Award, 20 August 2007); *Enron v. Argentina*, (Award, 22 May 2007).\n\nClaimants cite to *inter alia* *Sempra Energy v. Argentina*, (Award, 28 September 2007); *Vivendi v. Argentina*, (Award, 20 August 2007); *LG&E v. Argentina*, (Award, 25 July 2007); *Enron v. Argentina*, (Award, 22 May 2007); *PSEG v. Turkey*, (Award, 19 January 2007).\n\n1332.\n\nClaimants note that from an economic standpoint compound interest is necessary to compensate Claimants fully. Claimants\u2018 Reply of 30 April 2009, at paragraph 704. In this connection, Claimants advance LECG\u2018s expert opinion, positing that \"[i]n the real world, all interest is compound interest.\" *See* LECG Report of April 2009, at paragraph 125. LECG opines that \"compound interests reflect the economic reality that a dollar foregone could have otherwise been invested, and that the income on that investment could have been reinvested, so that funds grow at a compound rate.\" *Id.* According to Claimants, the same reasoning was applied in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena,* *S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, (Award, 17 February 2000), at paragraph 104.\n\n1333.\n\nClaimants underscore that LECG follows a relatively conservative approach in that it compounds interest annually, rather than on a semi-annual or quarterly basis as several past tribunals97 have done. Claimants\u2018 Reply of 30 April 2009, at paragraph 705.\n\nClaimants cite to *inter alia* *PSEG v. Turkey*, (Award, 19 January 2007); *Enron v. Argentina*, (Award, 22 May 2007); and *Sempra Energy v. Argentina*, (Award, 28 September 2007).\n\n1334.\n\nBy contrast, Respondent contends that the Tribunal should apply a simple interest rate. Respondent asserts that under the Argentina-France BIT an \"appropriate\" interest rate should be applied. According to Respondent, a reasonable rate would be the interest rate of the U.S. Treasury Bills or LIBOR. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 875-76, 880-81. In this connection, Respondent contends that no reasonable grounds in arbitral practice exist for the kind of interest applied by LECG in their calculations. See Respondent\u2018s Counter-Memorial at paragraph 726.\n\n1335.\n\nRespondent argues that the WACC rate is unreasonable and artificially increases the amount claimed. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder at paragraphs 876-9. However, if a WACC rate is to be used, Respondent proposes 18.6%, higher than the Claimants\u2018 rate, which according to Respondent would be justified by the high risk during 2002.\n\n1336.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find the WACC rate appropriate in this context. No evidence has been presented that Claimants could or would have earned the high-risk WACC rate. Consequently, with respect to the 2001-2005 period, the interest is to be calculated following the same methodology adopted by the Parties for the 2005-2011 period: the US \"risk-free\" rate.\n\n**c) Compound Interest**\n------------------------\n\n1337.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants with respect to compound interest. The Argentina-France BIT provides in Article 5 that interest shall accrue at an \"appropriate\" rate up to the date of payment. Although this provision appears in connection with expropriation, no reason exists to find that any standard other than \"appropriate\" should be used for damages pursuant to the Fair and Equitable obligations of Article 3 of that BIT. Simple interest would not be appropriate, given that it would fail to account accurately for the time value of money until the date of payment.\n\n**d) Post-Award Interest**\n--------------------------\n\n1338.\n\nClaimants also note the long delay by Argentina in honoring the award issued against it in the *CMS Gas* case, and thus consider it appropriate that Respondent be ordered to pay post-award interest, compounded monthly until the date of payment. In Claimants\u2018 view, there is ample precedent in the jurisprudence for the application of compounding on a monthly basis, particularly in the post-award phase.98 Claimants\u2018 Reply of 30 April 2009, at paragraph 706 and Claimants\u2018 Post-Hearing Brief on Quantum, at paragraph 57.\n\nClaimants cite to *inter alia* *CMS Gas v. Argentina*, (Award, 12 May 2005), at paragraph 471; *Occidental Exploration and Production Co. v. The Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3467, Award (1 July 2004), at paragraph 471.\n\n1339.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that ICSID Tribunals commonly order post-award interest, notably in several Argentine cases.99 This practice appears appropriate, as not awarding post-award interest would fail to account for the time value of money for the period from the award to the payment.\n\nSee, e.g., *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (awarding interest until the date of payment); *LG&E v. Republic of Argentina* (awarding post-award interest, starting 30 days after the award, on the same terms as pre-award interest); *Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic* (awarding post-award interest, from 30 days after the award until the date of full payment); *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (awarding interest from the date of the award until the date of payment, with a 60-day break after the date of the award); *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (awarding interest from the valuation date until the date of payment).\n\n1340.\n\nIn connection with the terms of compound interest, the change from annual to monthly compounding sought by Claimants and adopted by some tribunals can be explained by the desire of these tribunals to ensure prompt compliance with the award by adding what can be seen as a punitive element, a change that this Tribunal cannot endorse.\n\n1341.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal awards post-award interest on the same terms as pre-award interest, to accrue until payment.\n\n**5. Attorneys' Fees, Costs of Arbitration and Administrative Expenses**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1342.\n\nClaimants assert that they are entitled to all costs and expenses of these proceedings, including attorneys\u2018 fees, arbitrator fees, and expenses of the Centre. In support of their position, Claimants advance several ICSID decisions.100 They suggest that an award of costs is particularly appropriate in the present case, where they experienced long delays throughout the arbitral proceeding as a result of the Respondent\u2018s vexatious litigation tactics. As an example, Claimants argue that Respondent caused long and evidently tactically-motivated delays in challenging former Tribunal member Mr. Fernando de Trazegnies, as well as Tribunal member Ms. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler. See Claimants Reply, at paragraph 707.\n\nClaimants cite to *inter alia* *AGIP S.p.A. v. People's Republic of the Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/77/1), (Award of 30 November 1979), at paragraph 115; *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, (Award, 20 May 1992), at paragraph 257.\n\n1343.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants should pay all expenses and costs for this proceeding, as they are at fault for any damage to their investment, and any objections raised were legitimately made according to Respondent\u2018s rights under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, and therefore are not a reasonable means by which to hold Argentina liable for Claimants\u2018 expenses and costs. See Respondent\u2018s Rejoinder, at paragraphs 880-81.\n\n1344.\n\nIn addition, Respondent asks for Claimants to pay interest on the costs and expenses incurred by the Argentine Republic. See Respondent\u2018s Post Hearing Brief on the Merits, at paragraph 306.\n\n1345.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2018 arguments, the Tribunal finds that both sides have presented some meritorious arguments, each side winning on some issues while losing on others. The Tribunal thus finds appropriate to direct each side to bear its own legal expenses, including fees for attorneys and experts. The costs of arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrators and the administrative expenses of the Centre, shall be divided on an equal (50/50) basis.\n\n1346.\n\nThe total costs of the arbitration, including arbitrators\u2018 fees and expenses, as well as ICSID administrative expenses, is set at US$ 1,631,297.95.\n\n**Disposition of the Case**\n---------------------------\n\n**For the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal decides as follows** :\n\nI. Respondent has breached its obligations to (i) respect specific commitments undertaken in connection with Claimants\u2018 investment and (ii) afford Claimants Fair and Equitable Treatment with respect to their investment.\n\nII. Claimants are entitled to damages in a principal amount equal to US$ 136,138,430 as of 31 December 2001.\n\nIII. Interest compounded annually shall accrue at the rate for the ten year U.S. Treasury Bonds for the period from 31 December 2001 up to the date of payment.\n\nIV. Each side shall bear its own legal expenses, including fees for attorneys and experts. The costs of arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrators and the administrative expenses of the Centre, shall be divided on an equal (50/50) basis. The total costs of the arbitration, including arbitrators\u2018 fees and expenses, as well as ICSID administrative expenses, is set at US$ 1,631,297.95.\n\nV.

Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n***A. Procedural History of the Annulment Proceedings***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 9 October 2012, the Centre received from the Argentine Republic (\"Argentina\") an Application (the \"Application\") for the Annulment of the Award rendered on 11 June 2012, by the Tribunal in the arbitration proceeding between EDF International S.A. (\"EDFI\"), Saur International S.A. (\"Saur\") and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. (\"Le\u00f3n\") (collectively \"the Claimants\") and Argentina. The Application contained a request for the stay of enforcement of the Award under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(1). On the same day, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Application and transmitted a copy to the Claimants.\n\n2.\n\nOn 11 October 2012, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(2), ICSID's Secretary-General registered the Application and transmitted a copy of the Notice of Registration to the parties. The parties were also informed that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n3.\n\nOn 2 January 2013, the *ad hoc* Committee was deemed constituted by Sir Christopher Greenwood (British), President of the Committee; Professor Teresa Cheng (Chinese) and Professor Yasuhei Taniguchi (Japanese).\n\n4.\n\nOn 22 February 2013, the First Session was held with the Members of the Committee present at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. and the parties participating via telephone conference. During that session, a procedural calendar for the conduct of the proceedings was agreed upon by the parties.\n\n5.\n\nOn 25 February 2013, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 concerning the schedule of the proceedings. On 5 March 2013, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the schedule of the proceedings for the continuation of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award which had been granted by the Secretary-General in accordance with Article 54(2) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n6.\n\nOn 18 March 2013, Argentina filed a formal request for the stay of the enforcement of the Award. On 3 April 2013, the Claimants filed observations on Argentina's request. On 17 April 2013, Argentina filed a response and on 29 April 2013, the Claimants filed a reply.\n\n7.\n\nOn 28 May 2013, Argentina filed its Memorial on Annulment.\n\n8.\n\nOn 18 July 2013, the Committee issued a decision continuing the stay of enforcement of the Award until 30 September 2013, upon which date the stay would be lifted unless Argentina provided by 16 September 2013 an unequivocal undertaking that, in the event the Award is not annulled (or is annulled only in part), it will make payment of the principal and interest awarded (or, in the event of partial annulment, awarded in those parts of the Award which are not annulled) within ninety days of the final decision of the Committee and without any requirement that the Claimants bring proceedings in the courts of Argentina or that those courts or other Argentine national authorities issue an order requiring payment, the stay of enforcement will be lifted with effect from midnight on 30 September 2013 unless the Committee otherwise decides.\n\n9.\n\nIn a letter dated 13 September 2013, Argentina declined to give the undertaking requested in the Committee's decision of 18 July 2013. Consequently, on 26 September 2013, the Committee issued a further decision lifting the stay of enforcement of the Award which took effect from midnight (Washington D.C. time) on 30 September 2013.\n\n10.\n\nOn 16 September 2013, EDF filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment. Argentina filed its Reply on Annulment on 6 December 2013 and on 25 February 2014, EDF filed its Rejoinder on Annulment.\n\n11.\n\nFrom 2 June to 3 June 2014 the Committee held a hearing on annulment at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C.. Present at the hearing were:\n\n- *the* ad hoc *Committee* : Sir Christopher Greenwood, President of the Committee; Professor Teresa Cheng and Professor Yasuhei Taniguchi, Members of the Committee; and Mrs. Anneliese Fleckenstein, Secretary of the Committee;\n\n- *for the Argentine Republic* : Dr. Javier Pargament, *Subprocurador del Tesoro* *de la Naci\u00f3n* ; Dr. Gabriel Bottini; Mrs. Mar\u00eda Alejandra Etchegorry and Soledad Romero Caporale, and Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Duhalde from the *Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n;* and\n\n- *for the Claimants* : Mr. Paolo Di Rosa, Ms. Mallory B. Silberman, Mr. Pedro G. Soto, Mr. Kelby Ballena (Legal Assistant) and Ms. Aimee Reilert (Legal Assistant) from Arnold & Porter LLP; and Mr. Jean-Paul Palma and Mrs. Isabelle Praud from EDF.\n\n12.\n\nIn a letter dated 29 July 2015, Argentina requested information from Professor Cheng in connection with a disclosure made in the *Total* case1. Argentina supplemented its letter with a further letter dated 3 August 2015, in which Argentina requested further information from Professor Cheng. By letter dated 6 August 2015, Professor Cheng provided answers to both of Argentina's letters.\n\n*Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1).\n\n13.\n\nOn 6 August 2015, Argentina filed a proposal for the disqualification of Professor Cheng in the present proceedings, in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (the \"Disqualification Proposal\"). On the same day, the Centre informed the parties that the proceeding had been suspended until the Disqualification Proposal was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n14.\n\nArgentina filed its arguments on the Proposal on 19 August 2015; the Claimants replied to the Proposal on 25 August 2015. Professor Cheng furnished explanations on 7 September 2015, as envisaged by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3). Argentina submitted additional comments on 14 September 2015. The Claimants did not submit any additional comments.\n\n15.\n\nOn 17 September 2015 Argentina wrote to the Secretary of the Committee requesting information from the members of the Committee regarding any past or present links with any of the parties or their counsel currently engaged in litigation with Argentina. Sir Christopher Greenwood and Prof. Yasuhei Taniguchi provided responses to this request by letters of 22 September and 6 October 2015, and 16 October 2015, respectively.\n\n16.\n\nOn 20 November 2015, the Majority issued its Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify Professor Teresa Cheng rejecting Argentina's Disqualification Proposal.\n\n17.\n\nOn 22 December 2015, the proceeding was declared closed, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n***B. Brief History of the Dispute***\n-------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe dispute, which is described in detail in paragraphs 50-176 of the Award, has its origins in the restructuring during the late 1990's of the framework for the distribution of electricity in the Argentine Province of Mendoza (\"Mendoza\"). On 28 May 1997, Mendoza enacted Provincial Law No. 6,497 (the \"Provincial Electricity Law\") and No. 6,498 (the \"Transformation Law\") which adopted a new regulatory framework for the provision of electricity supplies in the Province. In accordance with that framework, the state-owned electricity distributor was to be privatised. A new company, Empresa Distribuidora de Energ\u00eda de Mendoza S.A. (\"EDEMSA\") was created. Mendoza sought the sale of 51% of the Class \"A\" shares in EDEMSA and to that end retained Chase Manhattan Bank and Salomon Smith Barney as advisers. In accordance with their remit, Chase Manhattan and Salomon Smith Barney sought to attract foreign investors. They prepared an information memorandum (the \"Info Memo\") and held a number of \"road shows\", including an exclusive meeting with Electricit\u00e9 de France (\"EDF\"), the parent company of EDFI. They emphasised the guarantees to investors under the regulatory framework and the concession which it was envisaged would be granted to EDEMSA. That framework provided for tariffs to be fixed in such a way as to ensure an investor was able to recoup expenditure and obtain a reasonable rate of return on the investment. Tariffs were to be fixed for a five year period but with provision for both an ordinary tariff review and an extraordinary tariff review. At the time, the Convertibility Law of Argentina provided that the Argentine peso was convertible at the rate of one peso to one US dollar. It was envisaged that the concession would contain provisions guaranteeing that the costs and reasonable rate of return would be determined in US dollars for purposes of assessing the tariff rate and that customers would then be invoiced in pesos at the rate of one peso to one dollar. According to the Tribunal, these safeguards were \"key features of the sales pitch\" by Chase Manhattan Bank and Salomon Smith Barney.2 Investors wishing to bid for the shares in EDEMSA were required to accept and initial a copy of the proposed concession.\n\nAward, para. 1008.\n\n19.\n\nA consortium company, SODEMSA, incorporated in Argentina, was formed by EDFI, SAURI and Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais together with Argentine co-investors. EDFI acquired a 45% interest in SODEMSA and SAURI a 15% interest. The remaining 40% interest was acquired by MENDINVERT, an Argentine company, in which Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais held 70% of the shares, the remainder being held by Argentine investors. Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais subsequently transferred its interest in MENDINVERT to Le\u00f3n, a Luxembourg corporation which was wholly owned by Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais until 2004 when it became a wholly owned subsidiary of EDFI.3 SODEMSA successfully bid for 51% of the Class A shares in EDEMSA and in July 1998 EDEMSA and the Government of Mendoza concluded an agreement (\"the Concession Agreement\") on the terms envisaged. SODEMSA assumed control of EDEMSA and commenced operations on 1 August 1998.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, para. 133\n\n20.\n\nIn late 2001 and early 2002 Argentina experienced an acute economic emergency which saw the appointment and resignation of four presidents in a period of three weeks.4 The scale of the situation facing Argentina was described by the tribunal in the *Continental Casualty* case which spoke of - a crisis that brought about the sudden and chaotic abandonment of the cardinal tenet of the country's economic life, such as the fixed convertibility rate which had been steadfastly recommended and supported for more than a decade by the IMF and the international community; the near collapse of the domestic economy; the soaring inflation; the leap in unemployment; the social hardships bringing down more than half the population below the poverty line; the immediate threats to the health of young children, the sick and the most vulnerable members of the population; the widespread unrest and disorders; the real risk of insurrection and extreme political disturbances; the abrupt resignations of successive presidents and the collapse of the government, together with a partial breakdown of the political institutions and an extended vacuum of power...5\n\nAward, paras. 141-156.\n\n*Continental Casualty Co. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9), Award of 5 September 2008, para. 180 (\" *Continental Casualty* \").\n\n21.\n\nA National Emergency Law was adopted in January 2002 which abrogated the fixed parity between the peso and the US dollar and allowed the peso to float on the exchange markets. It rapidly dropped to an exchange rate of approximately three pesos to one dollar. The National Emergency Law, which was adopted in slightly modified form by the Province of Mendoza, also abrogated tariff terms in public utility concessions involving foreign currencies, including the relevant clauses in the Concession Agreement. The effect was that EDEMSA was obliged to accept payment calculated on the basis of parity between the peso and the US dollar even though the peso was then worth only approximately one third of a dollar; an effect known as \"pesification\". In addition, the emergency measures adopted by Argentina and Mendoza precluded utility companies from suspending or changing the performance of their obligations. The emergency measures made provision for renegotiation of contracts. EDEMSA entered into negotiations with the authorities in Mendoza6 but no revision of the tariff was agreed until 7 April 2005, one week after the Claimants had sold their interests in SODEMSA to an Argentine company, IADESA, owned by Argentine investors.\n\nAward, paras. 157-169.\n\n22.\n\nOn 16 June 2003, EDFI and SAURI filed a request for arbitration. That request was subsequently amended to add Le\u00f3n as a claimant. The Claimants maintained that the effect of (a) a series of measures taken by Mendoza prior to the emergency and (b) the measures taken as a result of the emergency which commenced in late 2001 was to destroy the economic equilibrium of the Concession Agreement. They contended that the equilibrium was not restored until after they had, in an attempt to mitigate their losses, sold their interests to IADESA. Under the terms of that sale, the Claimants retained their rights in respect of the ICSID claim they had instituted.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants maintained that the pre-emergency interference with their investment and the emergency measures constituted violations of the Argentina-France Agreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the \"Argentina-France BIT\"), and, to the extent relevant (a matter considered below), the Mutual Investment Promotion and Protection Treaty between Argentina and the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union (the \"Argentina-Luxembourg BIT\"). The Claimants contended that the measures taken both before and during the emergency were arbitrary and discriminatory, that they constituted unfair and inequitable treatment, violated the requirement of full protection and security and amounted to indirect expropriation. In addition, the Claimants maintained that the failure to respect the commitments entered into in the Concession Agreement and by means of the regulatory framework of laws adopted by Argentina and Mendoza contravened the Most Favoured Nation (\"MFN\") clause in Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT, because other BITs concluded by Argentina, notably those with Luxembourg and Germany, contained umbrella clauses making failure to comply with specific commitments entered into in connection with an investment a breach of treaty.\n\n24.\n\nArgentina challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on several grounds. For present purposes, the objections which are of particular relevance are that:-\n\n(i) the Claimants no longer owned any relevant investment after the sale of shares to IADESA; and\n\n(ii) the Claimants lacked standing to present claims for injuries allegedly suffered by EDEMSA.\n\nArgentina also denied that the claims were well-founded on the merits, asserting in particular that the emergency measures were necessary and legitimate responses to an acute economic emergency.\n\n***C. Summary of the Jurisdiction Decision and Award***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Jurisdiction Decision**\n--------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nOn 5 August 2008, the Tribunal issued a decision on jurisdiction (the \"Jurisdiction Decision\") dismissing Argentina's objections to jurisdiction. Although it will be necessary, in the course of this decision, to refer to other points in the Jurisdiction Decision, for present purposes it is sufficient to note two aspects of the Tribunal's findings on jurisdiction.\n\n26.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal considered that the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice and arbitral tribunals made clear that \"as a general matter, the date when proceedings are instituted serves as the relevant time to establish jurisdiction\".7 Accordingly, jurisdiction had to be assessed as at the date in 2003 when proceedings were commenced, irrespective of the subsequent transfers of interest. It therefore proceeded on the basis that SAURI and Le\u00f3n should remain parties,8 while leaving open the question whether they continued to possess substantive rights.9 The Tribunal approached Le\u00f3n's claims on the basis that they were founded upon the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT.10\n\nJurisdiction Decision, para. 93.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, para. 92.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, para. 95.\n\nSee, e.g., Jurisdiction Decision, paras. 7-8, 51, 68, 97 and 177-198.\n\n27.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal rejected Argentina's objection that the Claimants lacked standing. That objection was based upon a series of arguments concerning the nature of the Claimants' interests and, in particular, the fact that the Concession Agreement was between Mendoza and EDEMSA, whereas the Claimants held shares in SODEMSA, which in turn held shares in EDEMSA. The Tribunal held that neither Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, nor the relevant provisions of the Argentina-France and Argentina-Luxembourg BITs required that an investment be held directly, so that the fact that the Claimants' interests in EDEMSA were indirect was not an obstacle to jurisdiction.11\n\nJurisdiction Decision, paras. 137-8 and 157-163.\n\n28.\n\nArgentina had also argued that, in accordance with the judgments of the International Court of Justice in the *Barcelona Traction,*12*ELSI*13 and *Diallo*14 cases, international law did not recognize any right for the shareholders in a company to maintain a claim in respect of a wrong allegedly done to the company. The Tribunal held that these judgments concerned the right of diplomatic protection by a State and were inapplicable to claims brought by investors in their own name under the terms of a bilateral investment treaty.15 In the present case, the Tribunal held, the terms of both the Argentina-France BIT and the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT were broad enough to cover indirect investments. It also stated that:\n\n174. Finally, this Tribunal cannot ignore the common-sense meaning given to \"investment\". Holding shares in a company normally means ownership of an investment in the underlying economic activity conducted by that entity, directly or indirectly. Every day people speak of oil, mining or timber investments, even though ownership resides in shares rather than rigs, gold deposits or forests. Stock in a bank might be said to implicate an investment in the financial services industry, when in fact the ownership relates to corporate securities of a distinct legal person, which in turn owns a loan portfolio and the bricks and mortar of a vault or building. To use language in any other way would create an artificial formalism unworthy of a living legal system.\n\n175. In short, for treaty-based investment arbitration, the concept of investment must be understood to include the underlying business represented by the shares of the investment vehicle. Otherwise, an expropriation which left an empty corporate shell would never be compensable.\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company (Belgium v. Spain)*, I.C.J.

It concluded that Argentina had breached its obligations to respect its specific commitments undertaken in connection with EDF's investment and to afford the Claimants fair and equitable treatment.16 It rejected the Claimants' other claims. The Tribunal awarded damages to the Claimants in the amount of US$ 136,138,430 as of December 2001, with interest compounded annually at the rate for ten year U.S. Treasury Bonds until payment of the Award.17 The Award runs to over three hundred pages; it is unnecessary to summarise all of its reasoning here and the Committee therefore reviews only those parts that are directly relevant to the issues raised in the Application for annulment.\n\nAward, *Dispositif*, para. I.\n\nAward, *Dispositif*, paras. II and III\n\n***a. Applicable law***\n-----------------------\n\n30.\n\nLe\u00f3n invoked the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT in the Amended Request for Arbitration, and the Tribunal in its Jurisdiction Decision proceeded on the basis that Le\u00f3n's claims were governed by that Treaty.18 In the Award, however, the Tribunal noted that\n\nClaimant Le\u00f3n is said to be an assignee of the investment made in Argentina by its French parent company, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, and hence has standing to file arbitrations under the Argentina-France BIT. See Amended Request footnote 1. Nevertheless, to the extent its Luxembourgian corporate nationality is found to preclude standing, Le\u00f3n invokes provisions of the Agreement between the Government of Argentina and the Belgian/Luxembourg Economic Union for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, signed on 28 June 1990 and which entered into force on 20 May 1993 (\"Argentina-Luxembourg BIT\").19\n\nThe Tribunal subsequently concluded that the case should be decided exclusively on the basis of the Argentina-France BIT and that it was unnecessary to refer to the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, save in respect of the argument based on the MFN clause in the Argentina- France BIT.20\n\nSee para. 26, above. The claims of EDFI and SAURI were governed only by the Argentina-France BIT. The Argentina-Luxembourg BIT was relevant to those claims only insofar as it was invoked in connection with EDFI and SAURI's argument based on the MFN clause.\n\nAward, para. 9.\n\nAward, paras. 884-887.\n\n31.\n\nRegarding the role of Argentine law in determining Argentina's international liability, the Tribunal concluded that the terms of the Argentine-France BIT provided the foundation and framework for its decision.21 The fact that the Argentine Government was vested with broad authority by Argentine law to deal with the national economic crisis did not change the Tribunal's conclusion. Finally, the Tribunal was not convinced by the evidence that Argentina was not able to comply with its international obligations due to its need to guarantee human rights.22\n\nAward, paras. 898-908.\n\nAward, paras. 909-914.\n\n***b. The \"umbrella clause\" and Argentina's compliance with specific commitments***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimants argued that the MFN clause in Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT enabled them to rely upon \"umbrella clauses\" in other Argentine BITs and thus to claim in respect of alleged breaches by Argentina of commitments specifically undertaken with regard to the investment, in particular the clauses in the Concession Agreement guaranteeing the rate of return and the calculation of tariffs by reference to the US dollar. Argentina denied that the MFN clause could be used in that way and maintained that, even if the MFN clause was broad enough to permit reliance on the umbrella clauses in other BITs, those clauses did not assist the Claimants as they were not party to the Concession Agreement and that Agreement gave exclusive jurisdiction to the Argentine courts.\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal held that the MFN clause did permit recourse to umbrella clauses in other BITs.23 While noting the existence of considerable controversy over the use of MFN clauses to obtain recourse to arbitration on terms more favourable than those in the treaty applicable to an investor, it held that no similar controversy existed with regard to the use of MFN clauses to obtain recourse to the substantive protection afforded by other treaties. The Tribunal considered that the terms of Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT clearly permitted recourse to the umbrella clauses invoked by the Claimants.\n\nAward, paras. 925-937.\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal also rejected Argentina's arguments regarding the meaning and scope of the umbrella clauses on which the Claimants relied (principally those in the Argentina-Germany and Argentina-Luxembourg BITs). The Tribunal held that\n\nThis does not mean that all contractual breaches necessarily rise to the level of treaty violation. However, the serious repudiation of concession obligations implicated by failure to respect the currency clause... must clearly be seen as a violation of \"commitments... undertaken with respect to investors\" (Article 10(2) Argentina-Luxembourg BIT) and \"a commitment undertaken in connection with the investments made by nationals or companies from the other Contracting Party\". (Article 7(2) Argentina-Germany BIT).24\n\nAward, para. 940.\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal considered that the pesification of tariffs combined with the fact that EDEMSA was forbidden to vary or suspend its own performance under the Concession Agreement, and the absence of any increase in tariffs until 2005 undermined the entire basis on which the Province of Mendoza had solicited investment.25 The Tribunal stated that it was unconvinced by Argentina's argument that maintaining the Currency Clause and other provisions of the Concession Agreement would have extinguished the principle of fair and reasonable tariff rates and that the measures taken were in practice of benefit to EDEMSA.26 It held that there was no evidence that the Emergency Measures benefited EDEMSA's economic position; on the contrary, the Tribunal found that these measures affected EDEMSA's profitability, altering the economic equilibrium of the Concession Agreement.27 Additionally, this financial equilibrium was never restored, even after financial indicators showed a stable trend towards recovery.28 The Tribunal therefore concluded that Argentina had \"breached its obligations... to respect specific commitments undertaken in connection with Claimants' investment\".29\n\nAward, paras. 943-993 and 1008.\n\nAward, para. 976.\n\nAward, paras. 979-981.\n\nAward, para. 986.\n\nAward, *Dispositif*, para. I.\n\n***c. Fair and equitable treatment***\n-------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nWith regard to the claim that Argentina's actions contravened Article 3 of the Argentina-France BIT (fair and equitable treatment), the Award concluded that Argentina's violation of certain obligations under the umbrella clause, operated \" *in tandem* \" with the breach of its duty to afford EDF's investments Fair and Equitable Treatment.30 The Tribunal found that it did not need to decide whether Article 3 established an independent standard of fairness or coincided with the customary international minimum standard. According to the Tribunal, Article 3 required Argentina to respect international law in principle and in practice, and its failure to abide by express commitments without re-establishing the economic equilibrium within a reasonable time, constituted inequitable treatment.31 The Tribunal considered that the application of this provision depended on the factual context of the Host State's actions and, in this regard, it was mindful that the economic crisis was relevant to the interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard. The investor's expectations were to be balanced against the Host State's need to take action in a crisis. However, fairness and equity also required that the Host State respect the fundamental representations of a concession once the crisis was over.32 The Tribunal concluded that there had been a breach of Article 3 of the Argentina-France BIT.33\n\nAward para. 994.\n\nAward paras. 999, 1009-1011.\n\nAward paras. 1004-1005.\n\nAward, *Dispositif*, para. I\n\n***d. Claims in respect of actions taken before the emergency***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nSubsequently, the Tribunal dealt with EDF's claims that, prior to the enactment of the Emergency Measures, Argentina had breached its obligations by unilaterally modifying the regulatory framework and the Concession Agreement, in a way that had negative effects on EDEMSA, and changing the financial equilibrium of the contract to EDEMSA's detriment.34 The Tribunal found that Argentina was liable only in respect of the claims related to the modification of the Tariff Regime, namely:35 (i) modification of the fee structure for large users; (ii) reduction of contracting periods with users; and (iii) incorporation of an option for users to choose between categories at their discretion (Optional T-2 tariff category).36 It dismissed the other claims regarding actions taken before the emergency.\n\nAward para. 1023.\n\nAward para. 1026.\n\nAward paras. 1027-1100.\n\n***e. Other claims***\n---------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed the Claimants' other claims, holding that the measures taken by Argentina were not arbitrary or discriminatory37 and that they did not violate the requirement to provide full protection and security.38 The Tribunal also held that Argentina's actions did not amount to indirect expropriation.39\n\nAward, paras. 1101-1107.\n\nAward, paras. 1108-1112.\n\nAward, paras. 1113-1118.\n\n***f. Argentina's defences***\n-----------------------------\n\n39.\n\nDuring the proceedings on the merits, Argentina asserted several affirmative defences.40 The Award rejected the argument that these defences precluded a finding against Argentina, holding that they were not a bar to the Claimants' recovering compensation.\n\nAward paras. 1119.\n\n40.\n\nWith regard to Argentina's defence of necessity, the Tribunal held that, since the Award was based exclusively upon the Argentina-France BIT, the necessity defence in Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT was inapplicable.41 The Tribunal also concluded that Argentina had failed to establish that the requirements for a defence of necessity under customary international law had been met. The Tribunal maintained that \"necessity must be construed strictly and objectively, not as an easy escape hatch for host states wishing to avoid treaty obligations which prove difficult\".42 In that connection, the Tribunal considered that Argentina had failed to demonstrate that the measures taken were the only way for it to safeguard its essential interests, that it had not contributed to the state of necessity by its own actions, or that it had returned to the status quo when possible or paid compensation.43\n\nAward, para. 888 and paras. 1149-1152.\n\nAward, para. 1171.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal further dismissed Argentina's inadmissibility defence that any claim based on a denial of justice in connection with the Pre-Emergency Measures should be dismissed *in limine,* because they were not pleaded by EDF in its Memorial on the Merits.44 The Tribunal found that EDF had not made a separate claim of denial of justice, but instead framed its arguments in the context of fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security. Additionally, Argentina's defence regarding EDF's double recovery of damages caused by the Pre-Emergency Measures was dismissed; the Tribunal concluded that EDF had not received any redress for such damages.45\n\nAward paras. 1091-1096.\n\nAward, paras. 1098-1100.\n\n***g. Quantum of Damages***\n---------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal assessed damages on a discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") basis, having noted that the Parties agreed that the alternative methods of valuation considered were not appropriate.46 It awarded damages of US$ 2,502,797.00 in respect of the losses sustained prior to the emergency and of US$ 133,635,633 in respect of the losses caused by the emergency measures. The latter figure was calculated as at 31 December 2001 by taking the value of the Claimants' stake in EDEMSA (44.88% of the total)47 had the emergency measures not been taken (the \"but for\" scenario) and then deducting the amount which might reasonably have been received in the 2005 sale to IADESA, valued as of 31 December 2001.\n\nAward, paras. 1186-1188.\n\nIt will be recalled that SODEMSA held 51% of the Class A shares in EDEMSA but that 40% of the shares in SODEMSA were held by MENDINVERT, a company in which only 70% of the shares were held by one of the Claimants, the remainder being held by Argentine investors. Thus, only 88% of SODEMSA was ultimately owned by the Claimants. 88% of 51% yields a figure of 44.88%.\n\n**II. Grounds for Annulment**\n-----------------------------\n\n43.\n\nArticle 52(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that -\n\nEither party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:-\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n44.\n\nIn its Application, Argentina seeks annulment on all of the above grounds except for that set out in Article 52(1)(c), i.e. corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal. Argentina's objections to the Award concern six different issues, in respect of most of which it seeks annulment on more than one of the grounds set out in Article 52(1). The Tribunal has therefore structured its Decision by reference to these six issues, rather than by the Article 52 grounds on which annulment is sought. Argentina's arguments in respect of each issue, and the Claimants' response thereto, are considered in detail in the subsequent sections of this Decision. It is, however, useful to set out a brief overview of the six issues and the grounds invoked in respect of each of them at this stage.\n\n***A. Challenges to Two Members of the Tribunal***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nArgentina maintains that neither Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler nor Professor Jes\u00fas Rem\u00f3n possessed the requisite qualifications of independence and impartiality demanded by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention, with the result that the Award should be annulled because the Tribunal was not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a)) and there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)).\n\n46.\n\nIn the case of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, Argentina refers to the fact that in 2006 she became a director of the Swiss Bank UBS. When Argentina discovered this fact in November 2007, Argentina proposed, under Article 57 of the Convention, that she should be disqualified because UBS had various interests in, and links to, EDF.48 In accordance with Article 58 of the Convention, the challenge to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was heard by the two remaining members of the Tribunal, Professor Park and Professor Rem\u00f3n, who issued a decision on 25 June 2008 (\"the Disqualification Decision\") dismissing the challenge.49 Argentina maintains that when a challenge to an arbitrator is dismissed, it is open to the party which brought that challenge to seek annulment of the award and that an *ad hoc* Committee may annul the award under either or both of the grounds in Article 52(1)(a) and (d) if it considers that the challenged arbitrator lacked the qualifications required by Article 14(1).\n\nRA 512.\n\nRA 521.\n\n47.\n\nIn the case of Professor Rem\u00f3n, the application for annulment arises in a different context both procedurally and substantively. In April 2012 Professor Rem\u00f3n informed the parties that the law firm of which he was a partner acted for the Spanish company Repsol and that if the firm was asked by Repsol to represent it in any proceedings which it might bring against Argentina in connection with the measures taken by Argentina in relation to Repsol's interests in the Argentine company Yaciementos Petrofileros Fiscales (\"YPF\"), then he would abstain from any involvement in those proceedings until the Award in the present case had been issued.50 Argentina called for his resignation on the ground that this disclosure showed the existence of a professional relationship between the law firm and a company already in dispute with Repsol and that this relationship, together with the fact that Professor Rem\u00f3n had made clear that he was prepared to act for Repsol against Argentina in the future, showed that he lacked the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality.51 Professor Rem\u00f3n declined to resign. Since the proceedings had already been closed at the date of the disclosure, Argentina was unable to propose disqualification under Article 57. The matter is thus raised for the first time in the annulment proceedings.\n\nRA 531.\n\nRA 532.\n\n48.\n\nThis aspect of Argentina's case is addressed in Part IV of this Decision.\n\n***B. Applicable Law***\n-----------------------\n\n49.\n\nArgentina criticises the Tribunal's decision on the applicable law on three grounds. First, it maintains that the Tribunal should not have decided the entire case solely on the basis of the Argentina-France BIT given that Le\u00f3n, which remained a Claimant, was a Luxembourg corporation. Secondly, it maintains that the Tribunal wrongly underplayed the importance of Argentine law as part of the applicable law. Lastly, it contends that the decision of the Tribunal in the Award that there was no general requirement that a claimant prove the existence of discrimination in order to establish a breach of the Argentine-France BIT was at odds with what the Tribunal had said in its Jurisdiction Decision.\n\n50.\n\nFor Argentina each of these aspects of the Tribunal's findings constitutes an annullable error. It maintains that they involved a manifest excess of power (within Article 52(1)(b)). In addition, Argentina argues that the Tribunal failed adequately to state the reasons for its conclusions on these points, thus making the Award subject to annulment under Article 52(1)(e). Finally, Argentina contends that the manner in which the Tribunal dealt with these issues entailed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure calling for annulment under Article 52(1)(d).\n\n51.\n\nThe Committee addresses this aspect of Argentina's challenge to the Award in Part V of this Decision.\n\n***C. Derivative Rights and the Umbrella Clause***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nArgentina also seeks the annulment of the Award on the ground that the Tribunal mishandled the issue of the Claimants' assertion of derivative rights and their reliance on the umbrella clauses in treaties other than the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n53.\n\nArgentina maintains that the Tribunal erred in holding that, contrary to the principle of international law enunciated in the *Barcelona Traction, ELSI* and *Diallo* judgments,52 the Claimants could maintain a claim for wrongs which, if they existed at all, had been suffered by EDEMSA and not by the Claimants. It further contends that the Tribunal was wrong in holding that the MFN Clause in the Argentina-France BIT permitted the Claimants to rely upon the umbrella clauses in the Argentina-Luxembourg and Argentina-Germany BITs and that, even if the umbrella clauses were applicable, they did not assist the Claimants as they did not alter the nature of the Concession Agreement as a contract which, so far as the Claimants were concerned, was *res inter alios acta*. Again, Argentina contends that these errors entailed a manifest excess of power, a failure to state reasons and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\nSee para. 28 and footnotes 12-14, above.\n\n54.\n\nThis aspect of Argentina's challenge to the Award is addressed in Part VI of this Decision.\n\n***D. Necessity***\n------------------\n\n55.\n\nArgentina contends that the Tribunal committed further annullable errors in the way in which it treated the issue of necessity. Its decision not to apply Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, its decision that Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT did not justify the measures taken and its decision that the requirements for a defence of necessity under customary international law were inapplicable are, according to Argentina, grounds for annulment for manifest excess of power and failure to state reasons.\n\n56.\n\nThis aspect of the challenge to the Award is addressed in Part VII of the present Decision.\n\n***E. Failure to Decide on Fundamental Evidence***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nArgentina maintains that the Tribunal failed to address fundamental evidence which could have had a decisive influence on the case and thereby committed a manifest excess of power, failed to state the reasons for its decision and seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure. This part of Argentina's challenge to the Award concerns primarily evidence from official bodies in the French State critical of EDFI's investment strategy in Argentina and the evidence of Engineer Neme regarding the privatisation of electricity distribution in Mendoza, all of which Argentina claims is ignored in the Award.\n\n58.\n\nThe Committee will address this part of Argentina's challenge to the Award in Part VIII of the present Decision.\n\n***F. Failures in the Assessment of Damages***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nFinally, Argentina asserts that the Tribunal's assessment of damages is fundamentally flawed in several ways, including the examination of the question of causation, the evidence referred to in relation to quantum and the assessment of EDEMSA's viability in 2001. Argentina maintains that these errors amount to a manifest excess of power, failure to state reasons and a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n60.\n\nThis part of the challenge to the Award will be considered in Part IX of the Decision.\n\n**III. The Nature of Annulment and the Powers of an** ***ad hoc*** **Committee**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nBefore discussing the different grounds on which annulment is sought in the current case, it is necessary briefly to consider the nature of annulment proceedings and the powers of an *ad hoc* committee.\n\n62.\n\nFirst, it is clear from the text of Article 52(1) that it is only an award which a party may seek to annul, not a decision which a tribunal may have taken as part of the steps leading to an award.53 Thus, it is not open to a party to seek annulment of a decision not to disqualify an arbitrator or a decision that the tribunal possesses jurisdiction in a case. A party which is dissatisfied with a decision must wait until the tribunal gives its final award. Only then may it commence annulment proceedings. Of course, it is open to the party to argue that the award should be annulled because it is tainted by an error in the earlier decision; for example, a party is free to argue that the award entailed a manifest excess of powers because the tribunal had earlier taken a decision on jurisdiction which was fatally flawed. Indeed, one leading commentator considers that \"decisions on jurisdiction are eventually incorporated into awards either explicitly or by implication\" and that \"at that stage they become subject to annulment *as parts of* awards\".54 But it is the award itself, and only the award, which the *ad hoc* committee can annul.\n\nSchreuer, Malintoppi, Reinisch and Sinclair, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge, 2nd edition, 2009), Article 52, para. 61 (p. 921) (\"Schreuer, *Commentary* \").\n\n*Ibid*., Article 52, para. 62 (p. 921), emphasis added.\n\n63.\n\nArgentina's Application requests only the annulment of the Award. However, in the Prayer for Relief set out at the end of its Memorial,55 and in the Prayer at the end of the Reply,56 Argentina requests the Committee to annul both the Award and the earlier Decision on Jurisdiction. For the reasons just given, the Committee has no power to annul the Decision as such. However, in paragraph 2 of the Reply Argentina makes clear that \"the annulment of the Decision on Jurisdiction [is] not requested separately from, but jointly with, that of the Award\". The Committee considers that the Prayers in the Memorial and the Reply must be read in the light of the Application and the explanation in paragraph 2 of the Reply. It will therefore proceed to consider Argentina's criticisms of the Decision on Jurisdiction as advanced in support of arguments that the Award should be annulled and not as a request -which would necessarily fall outside Article 52 of the Convention - for the annulment of the Decision as such.\n\nMemorial, para. 198.\n\nReply, para. 157.\n\n64.\n\nSecondly, it is a well established principle that, as the *ad hoc* committee in *MTD Equity and MTD Chile* v. *Republic of Chile* put it -\n\nUnder Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, an annulment proceeding is not an appeal, still less a retrial; it is a form of review on specified and limited grounds which take as their premise the record before the Tribunal.57\n\n*MTD Equity and MTD Chile* v. *Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/07), Decision on Annulment of 21 March 2007, 13 ICSID Reports 500, para. 31 (\" *MTD* \").\n\n65.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in *Soufraki* v. *United Arab Emirates* was similarly insistent on this point, commenting that -\n\n... annulment review, although obviously important, is a limited exercise, and does not provide for an appeal of the initial award. In other words,... \u2018an ad hoc committee does not have the jurisdiction to review the merits of the original award in any way. The annulment system is designed to safeguard the integrity, not the outcome, of ICSID arbitration proceedings.'58\n\nThe *Soufraki* Committee went on to analyse this role of an *ad hoc* committee as the safeguard of the integrity of the proceedings in greater detail.\n\nIn the view of the *ad hoc* Committee, the object and purpose of an ICSID annulment proceeding may be described as the control of the fundamental integrity of the ICSID arbitral process in all its facets. An *ad hoc* committee is empowered to verify (i) the integrity of the tribunal - its proper constitution (Article 52(1)(a)) and the absence of corruption on the part of any member thereof (Article 52(1)(c)); (ii) the integrity of the procedure - which means firstly that the tribunal must respect the boundaries fixed by the ICSID Convention and the Parties' consent, and not manifestly exceed the powers granted to it as far as its jurisdiction, the applicable law and the questions raised are concerned (Article 52(1)(b)), and secondly, that it should not commit a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)); and (iii) the integrity of the award - meaning that the reasoning presented in the award should be coherent and not contradictory, so as to be understandable by the Parties and must reasonably support the solution adopted by the tribunal (Article 52(1)(e)). Integrity of the dispute settlement mechanism, integrity of the process of dispute settlement and integrity of solution of the dispute are the basic interrelated goals projected in the ICSID annulment mechanism.59\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki* v. *United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/07), Decision on Annulment of 5 June 2007, para. 20 (\" *Soufraki* \").\n\n*Soufraki*, note 58, above, para. 23.\n\n66.\n\nThirdly, as the *Soufraki* Committee also explained -\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention must be read in accordance with the principles of treaty interpretation forming part of general international law, which principles insist on neither restrictive nor extensive interpretation, but rather on interpretation in accordance with the object and purpose of the treaty.60\n\nThe reference to principles of treaty interpretation is to the principles laid down in Articles 31 to 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969. Although the Vienna Convention is not, as such applicable to the ICSID Convention, which predates it, the provisions of the Vienna Convention on treaty interpretation are generally regarded as declaratory of customary international law\n\n*Ibid*, para. 21.\n\n67.\n\nLastly, it is clear from the text of Article 52 that an award may be annulled only on one or more of the five grounds set out in Article 52. An *ad hoc* committee is not entitled to range beyond those five grounds. Its function is not to consider whether or not it agrees with the reasoning or the conclusions of the tribunal but only to determine whether or not one or more of the five grounds has been made out.\n\n68.\n\nNone of these points is contested in the present proceedings, although the Parties differ in the way that they seek to apply them to the specific issues in the case. They were also in broad agreement regarding the approach which a committee must take to questions of fact.\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the burden of proof is always upon the party seeking annulment.61 At the hearings the Claimants developed this argument in the following terms:\n\nThe second principle is that the burden of proof is on Argentina to substantiate its claims. Argentina is the proponent of annulment in this proceeding and, as such, bears the burden of proof. This means that if the Committee members are undecided or on the fence on particular arguments or issues, then it must decide - the Committee must decide against annulment.62\n\nArgentina does not dispute that, where it asserts the existence of a particular fact, it bears the burden of proving that fact, although it sometimes asserts that the Committee should infer or assume the existence of certain facts (see, e.g., para. 171, below). The Committee considers that the principle that a party bears the burden of proof in respect of any fact whose existence it asserts is well established both in ICSID jurisprudence63 and elsewhere.64 Nevertheless, in annulment proceedings the importance of the principle that a party bears the burden of proof in respect of a fact which it asserts has to be seen in the light of the principle that, as the *Helnan* Committee observes \"it is no part of the function of an annulment committee to reconsider findings of fact made by an ICSID arbitral tribunal\".65 Moreover, in the present case, many of the facts (particularly with regard to the allegations concerning the independence and impartiality of arbitrators) are not in dispute.66\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 30.\n\nTranscript, p. 114; see also p. 189.\n\nSee, e.g., in relation to the burden of proof in relation to an application to disqualify an arbitrator, *Nations Energy Corp. v. Panama* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/19), Decision on Challenge to an Arbitrator of 7 September 2011, para. 56.\n\nSee, e.g., the Judgment of the International Court of Justice in *Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay*, (*Argentina v. Uruguay*), ICJ Reports 2010-I, p. 71, para 162.\n\n*Helnan International Hotels A/S* v. *Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19), Decision on Annulment of 4 June 2010, (\" *Helnan* \"), para. 20. See also *Fraport AG* v. *Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25), Decision on Annulment of 23 December 2010 (\" *Fraport* \"), para. 84. Both are cited at Counter-Memorial, para. 3.\n\nArgentina expressly accepted as much; Transcript, p. 255.\n\n70.\n\nHowever, the Claimants' argument, as quoted above, goes beyond the burden of proof with regard to matters of fact and urges that \"if the Committee members are undecided or on the fence *on particular arguments or issues* \" (emphasis added), then the Committee must decide against annulment. That comes close to an argument that there is a presumption in favour of upholding the Award. In that context the Committee recalls the observation of the *Soufraki* Committee that \"such presumption... finds no basis in the text of Article 52 and has not been used by annulment committees\".67 The Committee agrees with that analysis. The concept of burden of proof is confined to matters of fact; it does not extend to a general principle that when in doubt about \"particular arguments or issues\" a committee must find in favour of upholding the award.\n\n*Soufraki*, note 58, above, para. 22.\n\n71.\n\nThere is, however, one issue regarding the powers of an *ad hoc* committee on which the Parties are in marked disagreement. That concerns whether a committee which finds that one or more of the grounds set out in Article 52 has been established in respect of an award is obliged to annul the award or has a discretion whether or not to do so. The Claimants assert that a committee always has a discretion not to annul and that it may exercise that discretion on grounds of fairness, taking account, for example, of the length of the proceedings.68 By contrast, Argentina maintains that, if a committee considers that one of the grounds for annulment has been made out, then the committee is obliged to annul the award.69\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 57; Transcript, pp. 110, 132 and 189.\n\nTranscript, pp. 271-274.\n\n72.\n\nThe Committee notes that the final sentence of Article 52(3) is in the following terms:\n\nThe Committee shall have *the authority to annul* the award or any part thereof on any of the grounds set forth in paragraph (1).\n\nEsta Comisi\u00f3n *tendra facultad para resolver sobre la anulaci\u00f3n* total o parcial del laudo por alguna de las causas enumeradas en el apartado (1).\n\nLe Comit\u00e9 *est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 annuler* la sentence en tout ou en partie pour l'un des motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a (1) du pr\u00e9sent article.\n\n(The emphasis has been added by the Committee.)\n\n73.\n\nThe Committee considers that the italicised words clearly indicate that committees were intended to have a degree of discretion. To say that a committee \"shall have the authority to annul the award\" is very different from saying that a committee \"shall annul the award\". Moreover, the Committee notes that other *ad hoc* committees have proceeded on the basis that annulment was not mandatory and that they enjoyed a discretion whether or not to annul the award under consideration.70 The Committee concludes that, even if an Article 52(1) ground is made out, it nevertheless retains a discretion as to whether or not to annul the award. That discretion is by no means unlimited and must take account of all relevant circumstances, including the gravity of the circumstances which constitute the ground for annulment and whether or not they had - or could have had - a material effect upon the outcome of the case, as well as the importance of the finality of the award and the overall question of fairness to both Parties.\n\nSee, in particular, *Amco v. Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on Annulment of 3 December 1992, 9 ICSID Reports 15, para. 1.20 (\" *AMCO II* \"); *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4), Decision on Annulment of 22 December 1989, 4 ICSID Reports 86, paras. 4.09-4.10 (\" *MINE* \"); *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment of 3 July 2002, 6 ICSID Reports 358, para. 66 (\" *Vivendi I* \").

Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n74.\n\nAs outlined above (paras. 46 to 47), Argentina maintains that the Award should be annulled because of the existence of conflicts of interest in the case of both Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and Professor Rem\u00f3n. In each case Argentina contends that the conflict of interest was such that the Tribunal cannot be regarded as having been properly constituted (thus affording a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention). It also argues that, since the right of each party to have the case determined by a tribunal whose members meet the requirements of independence and impartiality constitutes a fundamental rule of procedure, the fact that two members of the Tribunal did not meet those requirements means that there has been a serious departure from that fundamental rule (thus affording a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention).71\n\nMemorial, para. 33.\n\n75.\n\nSince the facts on which Argentina relies are, for the most part, not in dispute between the Parties, the Committee will briefly set out those facts before reviewing the arguments of the Parties.\n\n***B. The facts***\n------------------\n\n**1. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler**\n--------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nProfessor Kaufmann-Kohler became a director of UBS in April 2006, two and a half years after her appointment as an arbitrator and nearly two years after the Tribunal was constituted.72 It is not in dispute that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler did not inform the Parties of her appointment as a director of UBS. She did, however, give UBS a list of the arbitrations in which she was then involved and asked UBS to investigate whether there was a conflict of interests. According to a letter which she wrote to the other members of the Tribunal (Professor Park and Professor Rem\u00f3n) after she was challenged by Argentina,73 UBS replied that the only conflict was with her involvement as a member of the jury for the America's Cup, a conflict which arose from the fact that UBS sponsored one of the competitors. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler withdrew from the America's Cup jury in light of this response.\n\nAward, paras. 11-16.\n\nLetter of 21 December 2007.\n\n77.\n\nArgentina maintains that it became aware of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's appointment at UBS in November 2007. It then filed a proposal, in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention,74 that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler be disqualified from the Tribunal.75 In the light of that proposal, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler wrote to UBS inquiring whether the links between EDFI and UBS detailed in Argentina's challenge did in fact exist.76 By a letter dated 20 December 2007, Dr Karin Eugster, Legal Adviser to UBS, and Dr Bernhard Schmid, General Counsel of the Corporate Center of UBS, replied giving details of certain links between UBS and EDFI.77 That letter was sent to the Tribunal on 21 December 2007 under cover of a letter from Professor Kaufmann-Kohler.\n\nSee para. 112 below.\n\nRA 512.\n\nLetter of 17 December 2007, RA 513.\n\nRA 514.\n\n78.\n\nArgentina challenged Professor Kaufmann-Kohler on the basis of five connections between UBS and EDFI:-\n\n(a) that UBS had listed EDF, the parent company of EDFI, as one of the companies in which it recommended investment;78\n\n(b) that UBS and EDF had common interests in AEM Milan, an Italian company which was controlled by EDF through a subsidiary;79\n\n(c) that UBS and EDF both held shares in Motor Columbus, a Swiss company,80 although the 20 December 2007 letter from UBS made clear that UBS had disposed of its shareholding in Motor Columbus before Professor Kaufmann-Kohler became a UBS director;\n\n(d) that in October 2005 EDF and the French State had entered into an agreement with a group of financial institutions which included UBS in connection with a share offer in the French financial market;81 and\n\n(e) that the UBS Foundation listed EDF securities as part of its portfolio.82\n\nRA 512, para. 36.\n\nRA 512, para. 37.\n\nRA 512, para. 38.\n\nRA 512, para. 39.\n\nRA 512, para. 40.\n\n79.\n\nIn addition, on 14 May 2008, Argentina drew the attention of the remaining members of the Tribunal to a press release concerning Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's role in the removal of certain directors of UBS following problems at the bank. According to Argentina, this incident demonstrated the degree of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's influence on the Board of Directors.83\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 46.\n\n80.\n\nFinally, Argentina maintained that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's failure to notify the Parties of her appointment as a director was itself a factor which could raise questions concerning her impartiality or independence.84\n\nRA 512, paras. 56-64.\n\n81.\n\nIn accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention,85 Argentina's challenge to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler was heard by the remaining members of the Tribunal, Professor Park and Professor Rem\u00f3n. They issued their Disqualification Decision on 25 June 2008. That decision dismissed Argentina's proposal for disqualification on the grounds that:\n\nThe facts asserted by Respondent give no reason to suppose that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler would be biased in favour of Claimants. Her position as a non-executive director at UBS gives her no financial interest in any of the Claimant companies. Nor would she benefit in any way from an award in favour of Claimants.86\n\nThe remaining members of the Tribunal considered whether Professor Kaufmann-Kohler might favour the Claimants on the ground that a victory for them might result in some benefit to UBS \"an entity with which Professor Kaufmann-Kohler feels a sense of emotional solidarity and psychological identification by virtue of her position\"87 but concluded that:\n\nWhile the prospect of such subconscious influence can never be completely excluded, the possibility remains remote, tenuous and speculative. The outcome of this arbitration cannot be expected to have any material impact on the fortunes of UBS. Just as *de minimis* would be the effect on Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's psychological, social or economic well-being.88\n\nSee para. 112, below.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 71.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 72.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 73.\n\n82.\n\nThe remaining members also concluded that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had not violated any ICSID obligation of disclosure and that, in any event, \"we cannot accept that her nondisclosure of the Board membership indicated a manifest lack of reliability in the exercise of independent judgment\".89\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 98.\n\n**2. Professor Rem\u00f3n**\n----------------------\n\n83.\n\nAs the Committee has already noted (para. 47, above), the challenge to Professor Rem\u00f3n differs, both procedurally and substantively, from that to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. It differs procedurally, because it was raised only after the proceedings before the Tribunal had been closed. Accordingly, it could not be considered by the remaining members of the Tribunal under the procedure in Article 58 of the ICSID Convention. It differs substantively, because it involves a somewhat different allegation of a conflict of interest.\n\n84.\n\nPrompted by an announcement in the media on 16 April 2012 regarding Argentina's intention to expropriate an investment by the Spanish company Repsol, Professor Rem\u00f3n informed the parties on 18 April 2012 that the law firm in which he is a partner, Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez, had traditionally provided legal services to Repsol and that he had personally represented Repsol in various proceedings. He then stated that should Repsol request the assistance of Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez regarding the Argentine Republic's measures, he would refrain from taking part in the matter as long as the arbitration proceeding between EDFI and Argentina was ongoing.90 In light of these statements, Argentina requested the resignation of Professor Rem\u00f3n on 27 April 2012. According to Argentina, \"he could no longer be relied upon to exercise independent judgment pursuant to Article 14 of the ICSID Convention\".91\n\nMemorial, para. 62.\n\nMemorial, para. 63.\n\n85.\n\nIn response, Professor Rem\u00f3n asserted that his impartiality and independence in the EDFI case had not been compromised, because the drafting of the Award had been \"completed several weeks before the announcement of the expropriation\".92 Argentina argues, however, that although Professor Rem\u00f3n's letters made reference to information published in the media on 16 April 2012, the arbitration proceedings subsequently commenced by Repsol (in which it was represented by Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez) also concerned measures emanating from an earlier date. According to Argentina, this fact, compounded by Professor Rem\u00f3n's position in the law firm and the firm's previous representation of Repsol, points to the conclusion that Professor Rem\u00f3n knew about the dispute between Repsol and the Argentine Republic during the deliberations and the drafting of the Award in the present case, thereby compromising his independence and impartiality.93\n\nLetter of 11 May 2012, RA 535.\n\nMemorial, para. 65; Reply, para. 25.\n\n***C. Arguments of the Parties***\n---------------------------------\n\n**1. Argentina**\n----------------\n\n***a. General***\n----------------\n\n86.\n\nAs the Committee has already noted, Argentina bases this part of its case for the annulment of the Award on both Article 52(1)(a) and 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. It maintains that a tribunal cannot be regarded as properly constituted for the purposes of Article 52(1)(a) if one of its members did not offer the guarantee of independence and impartiality required by Article 14(1) of the Convention.94 In addition, it contends that for a tribunal to hear a case when one of its members could not be relied upon to be independent and impartial entailed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure affecting due process and a respondent's right of defence, warranting annulment of the award under Article 52(1)(d).95\n\nMemorial, para. 11. For the text of Article 14(1), see para. 107, below.\n\nMemorial, para. 59; Transcript, p. 82.\n\n87.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the standard required by Article 14(1) is that an arbitrator must be someone who can be relied upon to be impartial and to exercise independent judgement. Under Article 57, there has to be a manifest lack of those qualities. That exists where it can be discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis.96 Argentina contends that the decision on disqualification by the Chairman in *Blue Bank*97 confirms that, when a party challenges an arbitrator it need not prove actual bias but only the appearance of bias.98\n\nMemorial, para. 43.\n\n*Blue Bank International and Trust v. Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20) *,* Decision of the Chairman of 12 November 2013 (\" *Blue Bank* \").\n\nReply, paras. 28-29.\n\n88.\n\nAccording to Argentina, an *ad hoc* committee is empowered to determine whether or not such a conflict of interest exists and to annul the award if it concludes that one of the members of the tribunal manifestly lacked the qualities required by Article 14(1). That is the case irrespective of whether a challenge has been rejected by the remaining members of the tribunal in proceedings under Article 58 of the ICSID Convention.99 In such a case, Argentina maintains that an *ad hoc* committee has to approach the matter *de novo* and is not bound to follow the findings of fact or the ruling on the law made by the remaining members of the tribunal.100 Argentina contends that, if an *ad hoc* committee concludes that one of the members of the tribunal manifestly lacked the qualities required by Article 14(1), then it is required to annul the award. It denies that the committee has a discretion not to annul in such a case.101\n\nTranscript, pp. 82-87.\n\nReply, para. 6; Transcript, pp. 83-84.\n\nTranscript, p. 273-274.\n\n***b. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler***\n----------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nWith regard to the position of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, Argentina contrasts the findings made by Professor Park and Professor Rem\u00f3n in the Disqualification Decision with the analysis of a very similar allegation of conflict of interests, also arising out of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's membership of the UBS Board, by the *ad hoc* committee in *Vivendi II.*102 In its decision in that case, the *ad hoc* committee was, according to Argentina, highly critical of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's conduct. The *Vivendi II* committee had before it evidence from Professor Wolfram and Professor Mistelis on the independence of arbitrators.103 The *Vivendi II* Committee commented:\n\nAs to the basic issue of the compatibility of a directorship in a major international bank and the function of international arbitrator, Professor Wolfram, strongly supported by Professor Mistelis during the hearing, makes the obvious point that a director in the exercise of his or her function is under a fiduciary duty *vis-\u00e0-vis* the shareholders of the bank to further the interests of the bank and therefore postpone [sic] conflicting interests.\n\nThat is fundamentally at variance with his or her duty as independent arbitrator in an arbitration involving a party in which the bank has a shareholding or other interest, however small it may be. Since a major international bank has connections with or an interest in virtually any major international company (which companies are also the most likely to end up in international arbitrations), this suggests that the positions of a director of such a bank, and that of an international arbitrator, may not be compatible and should not be, or in a modern international arbitration environment, should no longer be combined.104\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal SA v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment of 19 August 2010 (\" *Vivendi II* \").\n\nA report by Judge Wolfram was submitted to the remaining members of the Tribunal in the present case and was part of the record before the *ad hoc* Committee in the annulment proceedings. Professor Mistelis did not testify in the present case and his evidence in *Vivendi II* is not part of the record in the present case; it cannot therefore be considered by the Committee; see Transcript, pp. 290-291.\n\n*Vivendi II,* note 102, above, paras. 217-218.\n\n90.\n\nThe *Vivendi II* decision continued:\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee thus understands the argument that the... Tribunal was no longer properly constituted after the board appointment of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, and that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and considers that this could lead to annulment whenever justified within the context of the case under consideration.105\n\n*Vivendi II*, note 102, above, para. 232.\n\n91.\n\nThe *Vivendi II* Committee did not, however, annul the award in that case, because it concluded that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had not become aware of the existence of UBS interests in the claimant companies until after the award had been rendered and the Committee consequently accepted \"that the relationship between UBS and the Claimants had no material effect on the final decision of the Tribunal, which was in any event unanimous\".106 Argentina points out that no such consideration applies in the present case, since Professor Kaufmann-Kohler became aware of the connection between UBS and EDFI not later than December 2007 when she received the letter from Dr Karin Eugster and Dr Bernhard Schmid.107 Argentina therefore maintains that the conflict of interest created by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's membership of the UBS Board should lead to the annulment of the Award.108\n\n*Vivendi II*, note 102, above, para. 235.\n\nSee para. 77, above.\n\nMemorial, para. 57-59.\n\n***c. Professor Rem\u00f3n***\n------------------------\n\n92.\n\nWith regard to Professor Rem\u00f3n, Argentina begins by explaining that it was unable to submit a proposal for his disqualification to the remaining members of the Tribunal, because it only became aware of his involvement with Repsol when it received his letter of 18 April 2012 whereas the proceedings had been declared closed on 13 March 2012. It had, however, expressly reserved its rights under Article 52(1)(a) and (d).109\n\nMemorial, para. 66.\n\n93.\n\nGiven the professional links between Professor Rem\u00f3n and his law firm, and between the latter and Repsol, Argentina maintains that a third party would perceive an obvious appearance of lack of impartiality.110 Further, Argentina asserts that the Repsol dispute materialized at the end of 2011, before the deliberations and drafting of the Award in the present case were concluded.111\n\nReply, para. 30.\n\nReply, para. 34.\n\n94.\n\nIn any event, Argentina maintains that, given the advice Professor Rem\u00f3n and his firm were providing Repsol during the deliberations, and given the fact that Repsol was during that time planning and implementing a legal strategy against Argentina, the date when the dispute finally materialized is almost irrelevant.112 Additionally, Professor Rem\u00f3n's obligation of impartiality and independence did not end when the Tribunal concluded its deliberations and drafting, but when the Award was actually rendered, which happened only after the disclosure.113\n\nReply, para. 35 and 38.\n\nReply, para. 36.\n\n**2. The Claimants**\n--------------------\n\n***a. General***\n----------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimants disagree with Argentina regarding the role and powers of an *ad hoc* committee confronted with the argument that a member, or members, of a tribunal lacked the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality. In their view, Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention, together with Rule 9 of the Arbitration Rules, require that any challenge to an arbitrator be made in a timely fashion (otherwise it will be deemed to have been waived, by virtue of Rule 27 of the Arbitration Rules) and that it be made to the remaining members of the tribunal (or, in certain circumstances to the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council). While the Claimants accept that, if the facts on which a challenge is based do not come to light until after proceedings have closed, recourse to this procedure is impossible and the matter can therefore be brought before an *ad hoc* committee, they maintain that the only ground on which annulment can be sought is that of a serious departure from the fundamental rules of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention). The Claimants deny that Article 52(1)(a) is relevant, since the reference to the tribunal having been \"properly constituted\" refers to whether the correct procedures for the appointment of arbitrators were followed, not to whether the arbitrators meet the requirements of independence under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.114\n\nTranscript, pp. 157-158.\n\n96.\n\nMoreover, where a challenge was made to, and rejected by, the remaining members of the tribunal, the Claimants contend that the role of the *ad hoc* committee is even more limited. Initially, the Claimants contended that, in such a case, it is not open to the aggrieved party to raise the issue at all in annulment proceedings since annulment is available only in respect of the award itself and not in respect of the separate decision on disqualification.115 In this respect, the Claimants refer to the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Azurix*.116 The *Azurix* Committee held that Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention was concerned only with the procedure for appointment of arbitrators and not with whether the requirements of Article 14(1) of the Convention were satisfied. It concluded that \"a Committee would only be able to annul an award under Article 52(1)(a) if there had been a failure to comply properly with the procedure for challenging members of the tribunal set out in the other provisions of the ICSID Convention\".117\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 25-27; Rejoinder, para. 6.\n\n*Azurix Corporation* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on Annulment of 1 September 2009 (\" *Azurix* \").\n\n*Ibid,* para. 280\n\n97.\n\nAt the hearing, the Claimants to some extent resiled from this position. They now accept that an *ad hoc* committee can review the question whether an arbitrator met the requirements of Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention in a case where the conclusion of the remaining members of the tribunal that that arbitrator did meet those requirements is so untenable that it is one which no reasonable decision-maker could have reached.118 However, the Claimants consider that the committee may not approach the matter *de novo,* that it is bound by the factual findings of the original decision-maker (*i.e.* the remaining members of the tribunal or the Chairman of the Administrative Council) and that it should defer to the legal findings of that body.119 According to the Claimants, the *Vivendi II* decision, far from supporting Argentina's case, merely serves to demonstrate how high is the standard for challenge to an arbitrator in annulment proceedings.120 It is necessary for the party seeking annulment to show that there was a manifest lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention and that the lack of independence and impartiality of the arbitrator had a material effect on the outcome of the proceedings.121 The Claimants also maintain that the burden of proof lies with the party challenging an award and that, in case of doubt, there is a presumption in favour of the validity of an award.122 Finally, the Claimants contend that even where a ground for annulment is made out, a committee has a discretion whether or not to annul the award and that, in the present case, the length of the proceedings and the hardship which annulment would cause to the Claimant suggest that it would be proper for the Committee to exercise its discretion not to annul the award even if it finds that one of the grounds for annulment has been made out.123\n\nTranscript, pp. 161-162 and 292-293.\n\nTranscript, p. 158-160.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 49.\n\nRejoinder, para. 16.\n\nTranscript, pp. 114-115.\n\nTranscript, p. 118.\n\n***b. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler***\n----------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nWith regard to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, the Claimants maintain that \"given that the factual predicate upon which this claim is based was squarely rejected by the authority empowered to decide that issue, Argentina's claims must be dismissed as an impermissible attempt at appeal\".124 The Claimants point to the findings in the Disqualification Decision that the links between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's participation in the UBS Board and EDFI were minimal and indirect and the finding that there was no evidential basis for holding that those links would have affected Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's approach to the case. The Claimants emphasise that the test of appearance of bias is an objective one; it is not enough that a party states that it considers there is an appearance of bias; it is necessary to establish that a reasonable person in possession of all the facts would conclude that there was a reasonable likelihood of bias.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 42.\n\n99.\n\nThe Claimants deny that the analysis in the Disqualification Decision is in any way untenable. They point to the fact that the remaining members of the tribunal in *Suez Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua SA* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17) and *Suez Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA and Vivendi Universal SA* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19), decision of 12 May 2008 (\" *Suez II* \"), confronted with a challenge to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler based upon her membership of the UBS Board, rejected that challenge on grounds very similar to those in the Disqualification Decision in the present case. According to the Claimants, the fact that another tribunal reached the same conclusion on closely similar facts is a powerful indication that the decision in the present case was not unreasonable.\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimants distinguish *Vivendi II* on the basis that the links between UBS and Vivendi were closer than the links on which reliance is placed in the present case. They also emphasise that the *Vivendi II* Committee did not, in the event, annul the award in that case. In this context, the Claimants point to the considerable weight given by the Committee in *Vivendi II* to the fact that the award in that case was unanimous and stress that the same is true of the Award in the present proceedings.\n\n101.\n\nFinally, the Claimants endorse the finding of the remaining members of the Tribunal that the failure to disclose Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's appointment to the UBS Board was not a ground for annulment of the Award and point to the fact that the *Suez II* decision was to the same effect.\n\n***c. Professor Rem\u00f3n***\n------------------------\n\n102.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Argentina's challenge to Professor Rem\u00f3n merely invokes Article 52 of the ICSID Convention as a ground for seeking annulment but fails to substantiate its claim; Argentina asks the Tribunal to assume certain facts that allegedly prove Professor Rem\u00f3n's lack of impartiality.125\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 64-66; Rejoinder, para. 32.\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimants argue that even on the limited discussion provided by Argentina, the circumstances surrounding Professor Rem\u00f3n's disclosure do not justify annulment.126 The drafting of the Award had been concluded well before 16 April 2012 when the media reported the Argentine Government's intention to expropriate the stake that Repsol had in the Argentine company YPF. On 18 April 2012, Professor Rem\u00f3n sent his disclosure to the parties.127 On 27 April 2012, Argentina requested the resignation of Professor Rem\u00f3n.128 On 11 May 2012, Professor Rem\u00f3n responded to the parties comments and informed them of the completion of the deliberations and drafting of the Award several weeks before the expropriation announcement,129 something which was confirmed by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler in a letter which she sent to the Tribunal on the same date.130 The Award was signed thereafter by all three Tribunal members.131 According to the Claimants, even if there was a conflict of interest, which it denies, such conflict could not have had a material effect on the outcome.132\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 69.\n\nRA 531.\n\nRA 532.\n\nRA 533.\n\nAC 16.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 70, 71, 73; Rejoinder, para. 31.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 74; Rejoinder, paras. 30, 43.\n\n104.\n\nRegarding Argentina's argument that the requirement that an arbitrator be independent and impartial exists until the award is rendered, the Claimants counter that neither they nor Professor Rem\u00f3n have ever suggested otherwise. In fact, Professor Rem\u00f3n stated in his letter that he would refrain from taking part in the Repsol matter as long as these \"proceedings are ongoing\".133\n\nRejoinder, para. 34.\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimants state that if, as argued by Argentina, it were the case that the conflict materialized in 2011, Argentina should have raised the issue then. By failing to do so, Argentina waived its right to challenge the Award on the basis of an alleged conflict of interests which had already arisen before the Award was completed.134\n\nRejoinder, paras. 36-37.\n\n106.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants argue, Argentina has not met the high threshold for annulment to be warranted in this case. Indeed, Professor Rem\u00f3n stated that he would not assume representation of Repsol as long as the present arbitration was ongoing. Contrary to what Argentina suggests, this declaration was not an admission that Prof. Rem\u00f3n would become adverse to Argentina as soon as this case was over. Moreover, the IBA Guidelines on Conflict of Interests impose no obligation of independence and impartiality once the arbitration has concluded and the tribunal becomes *functus officio*.135 Finally, the Claimants again highlight the fact that the Award was rendered unanimously.136\n\nRejoinder, para. 42.\n\nRejoinder, para. 44.\n\n***D. The Decision of the Committee***\n--------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Legal Framework**\n--------------------------\n\n***a. Article 14(1) of the Convention***\n----------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe qualifications which members of ICSID arbitration tribunals are required to possess are set out in Article 14(1) of the Convention. The English text of Article 14(1) provides that:\n\nPersons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, *who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.* Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators. (Emphasis added.)\n\nAlthough that provision deals with the qualifications which must be possessed by persons appointed to the Panel of Arbitrators137 maintained by ICSID in accordance with Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention, Article 40(2) requires that \"arbitrators appointed from outside the Panel of Arbitrators shall possess the qualities stated in paragraph (1) of Article 14\".\n\nArticle 14(1) is also applicable to persons appointed to the Panel of Conciliators.\n\n108.\n\nThere is a difference between the Spanish and English texts of Article 14(1). Where the English text refers to persons who \"may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment\", the Spanish version speaks of persons who \"inspirar plena confianza en su imparcialidad de juicio\". Since the Convention is equally authentic in English, French and Spanish,138 the general practice has been to require that arbitrators may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment and inspire full confidence in their impartiality.139 While the concepts of impartiality and independence have sometimes been viewed as one and the same,140 the Committee considers that, though closely related, they are in fact distinct. As one recent decision puts it:\n\nImpartiality refers to the absence of bias or predisposition towards a party. Independence is characterized by the absence of external control. Independence and impartiality both \u2018protect parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the merits of the case'.141\n\nThe French text requires persons who \"offrir toute garantie d'ind\u00e9pendance dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions\" and is thus substantially identical to the English.\n\nSee *Suez Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua SA v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17) and *Suez Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA and Vivendi Universal SA v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19), decision of the unchallenged arbitrators of 22 October 2007 (\" *Suez I* \"), para. 28; *Blue Bank*, note 97, above, para. 58; and *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/05), decision of the Chairman of 13 December 2013, para. 65 (\"*Burlington*\").\n\nSee, e.g., *Urbaser SA v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26), decision of the unchallenged arbitrators of 12 August 2010, para. 38 (*Urbaser* \").\n\n*Blue Bank*, para. 59. See also *Suez I*, note 139, above, para. 29; and *Burlington*, note 139, above, para. 66.\n\n109.\n\nArticle 14(1) does not require proof of actual dependence or bias; it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.142 The test, however, is an objective one. It is not enough that the party challenging an arbitrator perceives that that arbitrator lacks the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality.143 As the *Blue Bank* decision put it:\n\nThe applicable legal standard is an \u2018objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party'. As a consequence, the subjective belief of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the requirements of the Convention.144\n\n*Blue Bank*, note 97, above, para. 59.\n\nSee, e.g., the decision the unchallenged members of the *ad hoc* Committee in relation to the challenge to the President of that Committee in *Vivendi I*, note 70, above, para. 25, and *Suez I*, note 139, above, para. 41.\n\n*Blue Bank*, note 97, above, para. 60, quoting *Suez I*, note 139 above, at para. 39.\n\n110.\n\nThe standard of appraisal was also the subject of detailed analysis in the decision of the two remaining arbitrators on a challenge to an arbitrator in *SGS v. Pakistan* :\n\nThe standard of appraisal of a challenge set forth in Article 57 of the Convention may be seen to have two constituent elements: (a) there must be a fact or facts (b) which are of such a nature as to \u2018indicat[e] a manifest lack of the qualities required by' Article 14(1). The party challenging an arbitrator must establish facts, of a kind or character as reasonably to give rise to the inference that the person challenged clearly may not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment in the particular case where the challenge is made. The first requisite that facts must be established by the party proposing disqualification, is in effect a prescription that mere speculation or inference cannot be a substitute for such facts. The second requisite of course essentially consists of an inference, but that inference must rest upon, or be anchored to, the facts established. An arbitrator cannot, under Article 57 of the Convention, be successfully challenged as a result of inferences which themselves rest merely on other inferences.145\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13), Decision on challenge to an arbitrator of 19 December 2002, 8 ICSID Reports 402 (\" *SGS* \").\n\n111.\n\nThe Parties in the present case were largely agreed upon this standard. In the course of responding to a question put by a Member of the Committee at the hearing, the Claimants maintained that the *Blue Bank* decision and some other recent decisions went further in the direction of disqualification for the appearance of bias than had previous decisions and suggested that it would be unfair to apply the same approach to an evaluation of the decision on the challenge to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler (to which the Committee will shortly turn).146 However, the Committee does not understand the Claimants to suggest that the statement from *Blue Bank* quoted in paragraph 109, above, was incorrect. On the contrary, the Claimants expressly accepted that \"the notion that an arbitrator should not only serve justice but appear to serve justice is a long-standing one\".147 The Committee considers that the Claimants accepted that the standard to be applied is the one described above but took issue with certain recent applications of that standard. In the opinion of the Committee, the standard applied under Article 14(1) is whether a reasonable third party, with knowledge of all the facts, would consider that there were reasonable grounds for doubting that an arbitrator possessed the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality.\n\nTranscript, pp. 187-8 (Di Rosa).\n\nTranscript, p. 186 (Di Rosa).\n\n***b. The Convention Machinery for Challenging an Arbitrator***\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nIn addition to specifying the qualities which an arbitrator must possess, the Convention also lays down a machinery by which a party may challenge an arbitrator about whom it considers there is reason to doubt that he or she lacks one or more of those qualities. Article 57 of the Convention provides in relevant part that:\n\nA party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14.\n\nThat provision has to be read together with Article 58, which states that:\n\nThe decision on any proposal to disqualify a conciliator or arbitrator shall be taken by the other members of the Commission or Tribunal as the case may be, provided that where those members are equally divided, or in the case of a proposal to disqualify a sole arbitrator, or a majority of the conciliators or arbitrators, the Chairman shall take that decision. If it is decided that the proposal is well-founded the conciliator or arbitrator to whom the decision relates shall be replaced in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of Chapter III or Section 2 of Chapter IV.\n\n113.\n\nA number of points need to be borne in mind regarding these provisions. First, these provisions make clear that the decision on a challenge to an arbitrator for failure to meet the requirements of Article 14(1) should normally be taken by the two remaining members of the Tribunal, while providing a default decision-maker, in the form of the President of the World Bank in his capacity as Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council,148 to resolve that question in the cases specified in Article 58.\n\nICSID Convention Article 5.\n\n114.\n\nSecondly, because only a duly constituted tribunal can take a decision, a challenge may be brought under Article 57 only once the tribunal in the case has been constituted. Moreover, Rule 9(1) of the Arbitration Rules is explicit that a proposal under Article 57 may not be made after the proceedings have been declared closed.\n\n115.\n\nThirdly, the mechanism created by Articles 57 and 58 is clearly designed to ensure that a challenge can be swiftly resolved before the case proceeds any further. The emphasis on a swift resolution is confirmed by the Arbitration Rules. Rule 9 requires that \"a party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretariat\". A party that fails to file its request within a reasonable time of becoming aware of the circumstances which it maintains should lead to disqualification will be held, in accordance with Rule 27, to have waived its right to challenge the arbitrator.149\n\nSee, e.g., *Suez 1*, note 139, above, paras. 23-26.\n\n116.\n\nLastly, Article 57 expressly requires that a proposal for disqualification be based upon facts indicating a \"manifest\" lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. The term \"manifest\" is not defined in Article 57. Schreuer's *Commentary* points out that the case-law on the meaning of the same term in Article 52(1)(b) (annulment on the ground that a tribunal \"manifestly exceeded its powers\") has not always been consistent, sometimes treating \"manifest\" as referring to the ease with which the fault can be perceived and sometimes as related to the gravity of the fault.150 In the context of Article 57, however, the prevailing view is that \"manifest\" means \"evident\" or \"obvious\" and that, in the words of the *Blue Bank* decision \"it relates to the ease with which the alleged lack of the qualities can be perceived\".151 In the present case, both Parties have adopted this approach and the Committee agrees that it represents the correct interpretation of Article 57.\n\nSchreuer, *Commentary*, note 53, above, Article 52, paras. 134-154.\n\n*Blue Bank*, note 97, above, para. 61.\n\n***c. The Role of an ad hoc Committee***\n----------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nSince Articles 57 and 58 establish a machinery for dealing with challenges to arbitrators, the next question to be considered is whether there is any role for an *ad hoc* committee, or, to put the matter differently, can the fact that there is reason to doubt whether one or more of the members of a tribunal possessed the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the Convention constitute a ground for annulment under Article 52?\n\n118.\n\nThe *Azurix* Committee considered that that question had to be answered in the negative. Since the role of annulment was strictly limited under the Convention and Articles 57 and 58 created a machinery for the resolution of challenges to arbitrators, the *Azurix* Committee concluded that an *ad hoc* committee was limited to examining whether or not there had been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in the way in which the challenge had been addressed.152 Even where the facts said to demonstrate that an arbitrator lacked the requisite qualities came to light only after the proceedings had closed, and thus could not be dealt with under Articles 57 and 58, the *Azurix* Committee considered that the matter could not be a basis for annulment but could only be raised by way of proceedings for the revision of the award under Article 51.153 By contrast, the *Vivendi II* Committee, faced with a challenge to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler based upon facts which had come to light only after the proceedings had closed, was clear that such matters could constitute grounds for annulment.154\n\n*Azurix*, note 116, above, para. 280.\n\n*Azurix*, note 116, above, para. 281.\n\n*Vivendi II*, note 102, above, para. 232.\n\n119.\n\nWhether the existence of facts suggesting that an arbitrator lacks the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention is capable of being a ground for annulment depends, first, on whether this matter falls within any of the five grounds for annulment set out in Article 52.\n\n120.\n\nAs set out above, Argentina has relied upon two of these grounds. It argues, first, that if there is reason to believe that one of the arbitrators lacks the requisite qualities, then the tribunal has not been properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a)). Secondly, Argentina maintains that since the right to an independent and impartial tribunal is a fundamental rule of due process, if a case were decided by a tribunal whose members did not meet the requirements of independence and impartiality in Article 14(1), there would necessarily have been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)). The Claimants accept that annulment might be possible under Article 52(1)(d), although (at least initially) they maintained that this was true only where the relevant facts were discovered after the close of proceedings and thus could not have been dealt with under Articles 57 and 58. However, like the *Azurix* Committee, they dispute the relevance of Article 52(1)(a), arguing that that provision is limited to cases in which the procedure for constitution of the tribunal, laid down in Articles 37-39 had not been followed and that it does not provide that a tribunal is not properly constituted simply because one of its members does not possess all of the qualities required by Article 14(1). The Claimants suggest, however, that in practice it makes no difference whether the qualifications of an arbitrator are considered relevant to Article 52(1)(a) or (d) (or both) since the standard of review is the same under both provisions.\n\n121.\n\nThe Committee accepts that it may well make no difference whether these issues are considered under paragraph (a) or paragraph (d) of Article 52(1) but the matter was fully argued before it and has been the subject of differing views in the case-law and literature. It will, therefore, examine the relevance of both provisions.\n\n122.\n\nThere is general acceptance that Article 52(1)(d) may be applicable to a case in which a challenge to an arbitrator has been dealt with under Articles 57 and 58 of the Convention in a manner which itself involves a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, for example because one party was not given the opportunity to be heard. Such cases are, however, likely to be extremely rare and no allegation of that kind is made in the present case. The more important question, both as a matter of general principle and in connection with the present case, is whether the fact that a case has been heard by a tribunal one or more of whose members failed to meet the requirements of independence and impartiality in Article 14(1) means that the procedure as a whole is flawed.\n\n123.\n\nArticle 52(1)(d) gives a committee power to annul an award where there has been a *serious* departure from a *fundamental* rule of procedure. It is difficult to imagine a rule of procedure more fundamental than the rule that a case must be heard by an independent and impartial tribunal. The Committee accordingly considers that, in principle, an *ad hoc* committee can examine under Article 52(1)(d) not only allegations that the procedure by which a challenge to an arbitrator was determined was flawed but, more importantly, allegations that the lack of independence and impartiality of an arbitrator meant that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in the arbitration as a whole.\n\n124.\n\nIn that context, it is important to recall that it is only an award which can be the subject of annulment and not any previous decision of a tribunal (see paragraph 62 above). There can, therefore, be no question of an *ad hoc* committee annulling the decision taken by the remaining members of a tribunal under Article 58 to reject a proposal for disqualification. The only way in which that decision can be called into question in annulment proceedings is if it is considered to taint the award which is subsequently adopted. Any consideration of the role of Article 52(1)(d) must take that into account. If an award may be tainted by the fact that a decision whether or not to disqualify an arbitrator was taken in a manner which was procedurally deficient, *a fortiori* an award may be tainted by the fact that the award itself was adopted by a tribunal one or more of whose members did not meet the requisite standard of impartiality and independence.\n\n125.\n\nThe Committee therefore considers that the fact that there is reasonable doubt about whether an arbitrator possessed the qualities of independence and impartiality required by Article 14(1) is a ground on which an award might be annulled under Article 52(1)(d).\n\n126.\n\nTurning to Article 52(1)(a), the Committee considers that the Claimants take too narrow a view of the scope of that provision. In providing for annulment on the ground that \"the Tribunal was not properly constituted\", that paragraph must be taken as referring to compliance with all of the requirements of Chapter IV, Section 2, of the Convention, entitled \"Constitution of the Tribunal\". One of the provisions in that section is Article 40. Article 40(1) provides that arbitrators may be appointed from outside the Panel of Arbitrators maintained by ICSID but Article 40(2) then requires that \"arbitrators appointed from outside the Panel of Arbitrators shall possess the qualities stated in paragraph (1) of Article 14\". That provision is mandatory and is one of those relating to the constitution of a tribunal. It follows that an appointment from outside the Panel of an arbitrator who does not possess the qualities stated in Article 14(1) will mean that the tribunal has not been properly constituted in that it has not been constituted in accordance with all of the requirements of Chapter IV, Section 2. In the case of arbitrators appointed from the Panel of Arbitrators, since Article 14(1) already requires that they possess the qualities stated in that provision, it might be thought that whether a person does or does not possess those qualities is relevant to his appointment to the Panel rather than to the constitution of a particular tribunal. However, independence and impartiality are not qualities the existence of which can be assessed purely in an abstract or general way; what matters most is that an arbitrator can be relied upon to be independent and impartial in relation to the particular parties and issues arising in a given arbitration. Accordingly, whether appointed from the Panel or from outside it, an arbitrator must possess those qualities in relation to the specific case for which he or she is appointed. If he or she does not do so, then, in the view of the Committee, the tribunal has not been properly constituted.\n\n127.\n\nThe Committee therefore concludes that the fact that an arbitrator does not meet the standard required under Article 14(1), as set out in para. 111, above, is also a ground on which an award might be annulled under Article 52(1)(a).\n\n128.\n\nMoreover, the Committee does not consider that the question whether or not a tribunal has been properly constituted is one which can be answered only at the outset of proceedings. While it is obviously necessary to establish that a tribunal is properly constituted at the time that it begins work,155 once it is accepted that the proper constitution of the tribunal requires that each of its members fulfil the requirements of Article 14(1), it becomes clear that changes in the circumstances of an arbitrator may mean that a tribunal which was properly constituted at the outset may cease to be so during the course of the proceedings.\n\nIn the present case, the Parties confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted at the first session of the Tribunal, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 22.\n\n129.\n\nThat still, however, leaves the question how an *ad hoc* committee is to discharge its role under Article 52 in respect of allegations about the independence and impartiality of an arbitrator. In this respect, the Committee considers that there is an important difference between those cases in which the issue of disqualification has been raised under Article 57 and rejected under Article 58 and those in which it has not. That distinction is particularly important in the present case, because Argentina's case for annulment in respect of its challenge to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler falls into the first category, whereas its case with regard to Professor Rem\u00f3n falls into the second.\n\n*(1) The role of an* ad hoc *committee where no challenge has been made under Article 57*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nIt is convenient to begin with this second category. Article 9 of the Arbitration Rules requires that any challenge to an arbitrator must be raised \"promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed\". The Committee does not consider that this wording precludes a party from raising the matter on annulment in a case where the facts on which a challenge can be based came to light only after the proceedings had been declared closed. As has been explained in Part III, above, an *ad hoc* committee is the guardian of the integrity of the procedure. The Committee has already expressed the view that there is no rule of procedure so fundamental as that which stipulates that a case shall be decided by an independent and impartial tribunal as well as that a tribunal cannot be regarded as properly constituted if one or more of its members does not possess the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality. Accordingly, the Committee cannot read Rule 9 as precluding a party from raising this issue in annulment proceedings where it was not able to raise it before the closure of the main proceedings. The Committee has taken careful note of the views of the *Azurix* Committee (discussed in para. 118, above) that in such a case the issue should be raised in proceedings for revision under Article 51 and not for annulment but it respectfully disagrees and prefers the approach of the *Vivendi II* Committee on this point.\n\n131.\n\nNevertheless, the Committee must also take into account the requirement of promptness in Rule 9 and the provision of Rule 27 that -\n\nA party which knows or should have known that a provision of the Administrative and Financial Regulations, of these Rules, of any other rules or agreement applicable to the proceedings, or of an order of the Tribunal has not been complied with and which fails to state promptly its objections thereto, shall be deemed - subject to Article 45 of the Convention - to have waived its right to object.\n\nAccordingly, a party which is, or should have been, aware of the facts which it claims give rise to reasonable doubt about whether an arbitrator possesses the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality has a duty to raise the issue promptly. If it fails to do so, it will have waived its right to object. A party which could have raised the matter under Articles 57 and 58 before the proceedings were declared closed but failed to do so cannot, therefore, raise it on annulment. The mechanism created by the ICSID Convention for resolving challenges to arbitrators does not permit a party to keep such a challenge up its sleeve for use only at the annulment stage.156 The first task for an *ad hoc* committee faced with an application for annulment based upon allegations regarding the independence and impartiality of a member of the tribunal which was not raised during the proceedings before the tribunal is, therefore, to determine whether there has been a waiver under Rule 27.\n\nSee *CDC Group* v. *Republic of the Seychelles* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14), Decision on Annulment, 29 June 2005, 11 ICSID Reps. 206, paras. 51-55 (\" *CDC* \"). See also, Schreuer, *Commentary*, note 53, above, Article 57, paras. 11-12 and Article 52, paras. 119-129.\n\n132.\n\nIf the committee concludes that there has been no waiver, then it must proceed to consider the application under either or both of Article 52(1)(a) and (d). Since there has been no prior consideration of the issue under Articles 57 and 58, the committee must necessarily approach *de novo* the question whether there exist grounds which a reasonable third party would consider give rise to reasonable doubts whether a member of the tribunal was sufficiently independent and impartial (the standard which the Committee has already determined is the one applicable under the Convention, see para. 108, above) *.* That is so both in terms of finding the relevant facts and making the required legal rulings. The burden of proof in respect of any assertion is on the party making that assertion.\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, even if it concludes that there were reasonable grounds to doubt the impartiality or independence of a member of the tribunal, a committee may annul only if it concludes that there was a material effect on the award. The Committee has difficulty in accepting this proposition, at least in the terms in which it was put by the Claimants.157 It has already been established that the test is not one of whether an arbitrator actually lacked independence or impartiality but whether a reasonable third person, with knowledge of all the facts, would consider there were reasonable grounds for doubting that an arbitrator possessed the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality (see paras. 109 and 111, above). The Committee notes that it will generally be difficult to show how reasonable doubts about the independence or impartiality of an arbitrator - as opposed to actual bias or lack of independence - had a material effect on the award. Even in the case of actual bias or lack of independence, it may still be difficult to establish that such an effect existed, because of the confidentiality of the deliberations.\n\nSee, e.g., Transcript, p. 293.\n\n134.\n\nWhat can sometimes be established, however, is that even if the doubts about an arbitrator are well-founded - in other words if that arbitrator really did lack impartiality or independence -the award could not have been affected. That would be the case, for example, where the facts affecting the arbitrator's lack of independence or impartiality only came into existence after the award had been finalised but before it was actually rendered. While the Committee agrees with Argentina that the duty of independence and impartiality subsists throughout the proceedings until the award is rendered, it considers that if an arbitrator ceased to be independent or impartial only after the award has been finalised, his lack of the requisite qualities could not have affected the award and would not, therefore, constitute a ground for annulment. In short, the party seeking annulment is not required to prove that a lack of impartiality or independence *did* have a material effect on the award but it must establish that it *could* have done so.\n\n135.\n\nIn that context, it is necessary to consider a further argument advanced by the Claimants, namely that a lack of impartiality or independence on the part of one arbitrator could not have had an effect upon the award if the award was unanimous. That argument receives a degree of support from the decision of the *Vivendi II* Committee since one of the reasons it gave for its decision not to annul the award was that the tribunal had been unanimous. The Committee does not consider that that factor was decisive. The main reason given by the *Vivendi II* Committee for its decision was that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler became aware of the links between UBS and the claimant companies in that case only after the award had been rendered (a consideration which does not apply in the present case). There is nothing in the decision to suggest that the *Vivendi II* Committee considered that the fact that an award had been adopted unanimously meant that doubts regarding the independence or impartiality of one of the members of the tribunal would never be grounds for annulment. The present Committee does not consider that such a broad proposition could be correct. It is impossible to tell what degree of influence on one or both colleagues an arbitrator might have had in the course of what are necessarily confidential deliberations. The fact that an award was rendered unanimously may be a relevant consideration in relation to the exercise of the discretion not to annul an award but the Committee does not accept that unanimity necessarily precludes annulment.\n\n136.\n\nAccordingly, in a case in which an application for annulment is made on the basis that there were reasonable grounds to doubt the independence or impartiality of one of the arbitrators and no proposal for disqualification had been made before the proceedings were declared closed, the role of an *ad hoc* committee is to decide the following questions:-\n\n(a) was the right to raise this matter waived because the party concerned had not raised it sufficiently promptly ?\n\n(b) if not, has the party seeking annulment established facts the existence of which would cause a reasonable person, with knowledge of all the facts, to consider that there were reasonable grounds for doubting that an arbitrator possessed the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality ? and\n\n(c) if so, could the lack of impartiality or independence on the part of that arbitrator -assuming for this purpose that the doubts were well-founded - have had a material effect on the award ?\n\nWith respect to each question, the committee must approach the matter *de novo*.\n\n*(2) The role of an* ad hoc *committee where a challenge has been made, and rejected, under Article 57*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nWe turn then to the other category of case, namely one in which the party seeking annulment had proposed disqualification of the arbitrator during the proceedings but the remaining members of the tribunal (or the Chairman of the Administrative Council in those cases for which Article 58 so provides) hearing the matter under Article 58 of the ICSID Convention had dismissed the proposal. Here the entire procedural context is different. There is an existing evidential record which has been considered by the remaining members of the tribunal (or the Chairman) and their decision will contain findings of fact, as well as rulings on the legal issues arising from the facts as found. The question, therefore, is what is the relationship between those findings and rulings by the Article 58 decision-maker and the role of the *ad hoc* committee at the annulment stage?\n\n138.\n\nOn this question the Parties are in marked disagreement. Argentina argues that the role of the *ad hoc* committee is the same as it is in a case where no previous challenge has been made, namely to examine the issues *de novo* and take a decision. The Claimants, on the other hand, now contend (see paras. 96 to 97, above) that the committee's role is to review whether or not the decision taken under Article 58 was tenable, in the sense that it was one which a reasonable decision-maker could take. According to the Claimants, it is not open to a committee to reconsider the facts or to substitute its own view for that of the body charged with taking the decision under Article 58.\n\n139.\n\nThe Committee considers that with regard to this question two points are of fundamental importance. First, the drafters of the ICSID Convention considered that challenges to the independence or impartiality of an arbitrator should be heard by the remaining members of the tribunal (or the Chairman of the Administrative Council), and should be addressed promptly, and before the case proceeds any further. In this context, the Committee notes that the *Vivendi II* Committee seemingly accepted the suggestion that arbitrators called upon to determine a challenge to another member of their tribunal might be more inclined than would an *ad hoc* committee to raise the threshold for a challenge.158 That observation by the *Vivendi II* Committee was based upon the evidence of Professor Mistelis which, as the Committee has already observed (para. 89 and footnote 103, above), is not part of the record in the present proceedings and cannot, therefore, be taken into account. Nevertheless, even if the Committee had before it evidence of such a tendency on the part of arbitrators, that could not detract from the fact that the ICSID Convention entrusts decisions on proposals to disqualify an arbitrator to the remaining members of the tribunal (except where, as already explained, the Chairman of the Administrative Council acts as the default decision-maker). An *ad hoc* committee must respect that choice and work within the framework laid down by the Convention.\n\n*Vivendi II,* note 102, above, paras. 208-210.\n\n140.\n\nSecondly, however, the ICSID Convention also establishes the *ad hoc* committee as the guardian of the integrity of the arbitral procedure (see para. 65, above). As the Committee has already stated, the independence and impartiality of the members of the tribunal is a matter which goes to the very heart of the integrity of the arbitral procedure. The question, therefore, is how should an *ad hoc* committee act in order to respect both of these fundamental considerations.\n\n141.\n\nThe Committee considers that the second consideration must lead it to reject the approach taken by the *Azurix* Committee, namely that an *ad hoc* committee has no role in respect of a challenge to an arbitrator which had been considered by the remaining members of the tribunal under Articles 57 and 58 of the Convention beyond examining whether there had been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in the manner in which the remaining members had dealt with the proposal for disqualification. The Committee considers that such an approach is incompatible with the duty of an *ad hoc* committee to safeguard the integrity of the arbitral procedure. It thus rejects the position initially adopted on this issue by the Claimants, while observing, as it has already noted, that the Claimants resiled from that position at the hearing (see para. 97, above).\n\n142.\n\nNor, however, can the Committee accept that, as Argentina has suggested, an *ad hoc* committee should approach the issue of an arbitrator's independence and impartiality *de novo*, thus disregarding entirely the outcome of the proceedings under Articles 57 and 58. To do so would be incompatible with the scheme for resolving challenges to arbitrators devised by those who concluded the ICSID Convention. That scheme was designed to resolve such challenges swiftly and at the earliest possible stage of the proceedings, so that the parties were not involved in the expense and loss of time necessarily involved in obtaining a final award from the tribunal before it was established that the tribunal - as constituted - was entitled to hear the case. By contrast, reference to an *ad hoc* committee can be made only after a final award has been made by a tribunal. During the negotiation of the ICSID Convention a proposal that a party be given an immediate right of recourse to an *ad hoc* committee after the tribunal had decided that it was properly constituted, without having to wait for the award, was defeated.159 To allow a party which had unsuccessfully challenged an arbitrator at an early stage of the proceedings to raise the same challenge for consideration *de novo* before an *ad hoc* committee, after what may well have been lengthy and expensive proceedings on the merits, would run completely counter to the scheme for early resolution of a challenge. In effect, the proceedings under Articles 57 and 58 would serve no useful purpose, other than to ensure that the right to challenge the arbitrator was not waived; it would be as if such proceedings had never taken place.\n\nDocuments concerning the Origin and Formulation of the ICSID Convention, vol. II, pp. 851-853.\n\n143.\n\nMoreover, it must be recalled that annulment proceedings are not an appeal (see Part III, above). The role of an *ad hoc* committee in proceedings for the annulment of an award is not to determine whether the tribunal was correct in the decisions that it took; it is a supervisory role, limited to determining whether or not one of the grounds of annulment has been made out. The fact that questions as to whether or not a member of the tribunal which issued the award possessed the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality goes to a matter of fundamental importance does not alter the relationship between the role of the *ad hoc* committee and that of the body entrusted with making the original decision. The question whether a tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction is equally fundamental. Just as Article 57 entrusts decisions on challenges to an arbitrator to the remaining members of the tribunal (or the Chairman of the Administrative Council), so Article 41 empowers the tribunal to determine a challenge to its jurisdiction. *Ad hoc* committees have, however, declined to accept that every jurisdictional error has to be considered annullable, or to treat applications for annulment based on jurisdictional error as more akin to appeals.160\n\n*Soufraki*, para. 118.\n\n144.\n\nIn short, the role of an *ad hoc* committee is not to determine whether or not an arbitrator possesses the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality; Articles 57 and 58 entrust that function to the remaining members of the tribunal, or to the Chairman of the Administrative Council. Only if the matter is raised for the first time after the proceedings are closed does the *ad hoc* committee become the primary decision-maker in respect of this issue.\n\n145.\n\nThe Committee therefore considers that its role in relation to an application for annulment based on the alleged lack of independence or impartiality of an arbitrator is a more limited one in a case where the remaining members of the tribunal, or the Chairman of the Administrative Council, have already taken a decision on whether that arbitrator should be disqualified than in a case where the issue of independence or impartiality is raised only after the proceedings have closed. In the former type of case, an *ad hoc* committee does not write on a blank sheet: it is faced with existing findings of fact and assessment of those facts, as well as with an application of the law to those facts. While a committee is not bound to uphold the decision of the remaining members of the tribunal (or the Chairman of the Administrative Council), nor can it simply disregard that decision. It is limited to the facts found in the original decision on disqualification. Moreover, commensurate with the principle that an *ad hoc* committee is not an appellate body, it may not find a ground of annulment exists under either Article 52(1)(a) or 52(1)(d) unless the decision not to disqualify the arbitrator in question is so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decisionmaker could have come to such a decision.\n\n146.\n\nIt is within this legal framework that the Committee has considered Argentina's application for annulment on the basis of the alleged lack by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and Professor Rem\u00f3n of the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality.\n\n**2. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler**\n--------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nThe facts on which Argentina bases its claim that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler lacked the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality are set out in paras. 76 to 82, above. They are not in dispute. The grounds of Argentina's claim before the Committee are the same as those raised (see para. 81, above) before the remaining members of the Tribunal.161 The Disqualification Decision given by the remaining members, after reviewing the facts and the procedure which had been followed for dealing with Argentina's challenge, noted that the relevant test was \"whether Professor Kaufmann-Kohler \u2018may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment'\" and stated that \"if reasonable doubts exist on this matter, she should cease to serve in these proceedings\".162 As noted in paras. 81 to 82, above, Professors Park and Rem\u00f3n concluded that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's non-executive directorship at UBS gave her no financial interest in any of the Claimant companies and that she would not benefit in any way from an award in their favour.163 They also rejected as \"remote, tenuous and speculative\" the suggestion that, even without any prospect of financial benefit, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler might favour EDFI on the ground that she had a sense of solidarity with UBS.\n\nThere was at that time no challenge to Professor Rem\u00f3n and the grounds on which he was subsequently challenged by Argentina relate to events said to have occurred several years after he and Professor Park had ruled on the challenge to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 64.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 71.\n\n148.\n\nProfessors Park and Rem\u00f3n then reviewed each of the five grounds (see para. 78, above) on which Argentina maintained that there existed between UBS and EDFI connections sufficient to give rise to a conflict of interest on the part of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler once she had become a director of UBS. They concluded as follows:-\n\n(a) with regard to the fact that UBS recommended EDF, the parent company of EDFI, as a good investment opportunity, they noted that this gave Professor Kaufmann-Kohler no direct incentive to favour EDFI and concluded that \"the connection remains speculative and indirect, and thus not determinative for the purposes of this challenge\".164 They considered, however, that \"a different conclusion might be indicated if an arbitrator held a substantial equity stake in a bank which owned and actively promoted a company that was party to the relevant proceedings\".165\n\n(b) with regard to the fact that UBS and a subsidiary of EDF both held shares in AEM Milan, they noted that UBS's stake in AEM was below 1.5% and was held in the ordinary course of its business activity as one of the largest banks in the world. They did not consider that it could affect the independence of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler.166\n\n(c) they reached a similar conclusion with regard to the fact that UBS and EDF had both held shares in Motor Columbus,167 a conclusion which was reinforced by the fact that UBS had sold its shareholding before Professor Kaufmann-Kohler became a director.168\n\n(d) with regard to the involvement of UBS in a consortium that assisted in the placement of EDF shares on the French market, they noted that UBS had not itself bought shares in the course of this placement and concluded that \"we are unable to perceive any link between that consortium's activity and the way Professor Kaufmann-Kohler will evaluate the issues in this case\".169\n\n(e) it was the fact that the UBS Investment Foundation held an investment in EDF that the remaining members of the Tribunal considered \"stands on a somewhat different footing from Respondent's other arguments\". They noted, however, that the Foundation is an institution for the collective investment of assets by Swiss pension funds. Ultimately, the assets of the Foundation will benefit the various Swiss pension funds that have joined in the institutions which participate in the Foundation.170\n\nThey also noted that the total investment in EDF fell below 1.5%. Even had the investment in EDF been held by UBS itself, Professors Park and Rem\u00f3n considered that \"a stake of less than 1.5% would not be significant enough to have an impact on the independence of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler.\"171\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 76.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 78.\n\nDisqualification Decision, paras. 79-81.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 82.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 83.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 87.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 93.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 96.\n\n149.\n\nFinally, Professors Park and Rem\u00f3n considered whether Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's failure to disclose her directorship of UBS was, in itself a sufficient ground for disqualification. They concluded that it was not:\n\nWith respect to the alleged failure to disclose, we cannot accept that nondisclosure of the Board membership indicates a manifest lack of reliability in the exercise of independent judgment, the standard to be applied in this challenge. Whatever level of disclosure might be required under the ICSID Convention, a failure to inform the parties about this Board membership does not rise to that plane.172\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 98.\n\n150.\n\nProfessors Park and Rem\u00f3n also considered in detail the report by Professor Wolfram, submitted by Argentina, the decision of the United States Court of Appeals in *New Regency Productions Limited v. Nippon Herald Films Inc.*, 501 F 3d 211 (9th Circuit, 2007) to which Argentina had drawn their attention, and the press release regarding Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's role in removing certain officials of UBS but concluded that none of them altered the conclusions they had reached.\n\n151.\n\nThe Committee notes that there is no suggestion that, in considering the proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, Professors Park and Rem\u00f3n failed in any way to accord due process to both Parties. There is no hint here of any serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in the way in which the proposal for disqualification was handled.\n\n152.\n\nNor is there any suggestion that the remaining members of the Tribunal applied the wrong standard. It is true that in setting out that standard the Disqualification Decision refers only to whether Professor Kaufmann-Kohler \"may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment\" and makes no separate mention of a requirement of impartiality,173 whereas the Committee has held that the standard laid down in Article 14 of the Convention, taking account of the English, French and Spanish texts, is one of independence and impartiality (see para. 108, above). However, other passages in the Disqualification Decision make clear that Professors Park and Rem\u00f3n had both impartiality and independence in mind. Thus, they opined that \"non-disclosure in itself cannot be a ground for disqualification, it must relate to facts that would be material to a reasonable likelihood of *impartiality or lack of independence*, which is not the case here\".174 In the circumstances, the Committee does not consider that the fact that the remaining members of the Tribunal formulated the standard as they did can sustain the conclusion that their decision was one which no reasonable decisionmaker could have made.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 64.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 123 (emphasis added).\n\n153.\n\nNor is there a plausible argument that the Disqualification Decision did not address the different elements in Argentina's proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. As the Committee has endeavoured to show, that decision meticulously addressed each and every element which was said to demonstrate that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler lacked the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality.\n\n154.\n\nArgentina's case before the Committee comes down, therefore, to an argument that the Disqualification Decision came to the wrong conclusion. In advancing that argument, Argentina relies heavily upon the decision of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi II*. As the Committee has already explained (see paragraphs 89 to 91, above), that decision took a far more critical view of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's position than did the Disqualification Decision in the present case, although the *Vivendi II* Committee ultimately decided not to annul the award. Since the fact of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's appointment to the UBS Board did not come to light until after the proceedings in *Vivendi II* had been closed, the *ad hoc* Committee in that case necessarily had to approach the question whether there was reason to doubt Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's independence or impartiality *de novo*.\n\n155.\n\nThe Committee has studied the decision in *Vivendi II* with care. It notes, however, that, although, as in the present case, *Vivendi II* was concerned with Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's directorship of UBS, there are nevertheless differences between the two cases. In particular, there is a difference between the investment which UBS was found to have in the claimants in *Vivendi II* and its investment in EDF in the present case. As has already been explained, the investment in the present case consisted of a share of less than 1.5% in EDF, the parent company of the Claimant, EDFI. That investment was held by the UBS Foundation for the benefit of various Swiss pension funds. The other UBS shareholdings - in AEM Milan and its former shareholding in Motor Columbus - were in companies that were part-owned by the parent company of EDFI and were not involved in the arbitration. By contrast, in *Vivendi II,* it seems that UBS was the largest shareholder in the Claimant itself.175 In commenting on the decisions on disqualification in the present case and in *Suez II*, the *Vivendi II* Committee commented that\n\nEach relationship was different and must, like the relationship between UBS and Vivendi, be considered individually. *Notably, a larger or smaller* *participation of UBS in the one or in the other company may have relevance in this connection*. (Emphasis added)176\n\nThe Tribunal in the present case also considered that the size of an investment might be important in this regard.177\n\n*Vivendi II*, note 102, above, para. 20. See, however, para. 99. These paragraphs set out the submissions of the parties. The Tribunal did not make a finding about the extent of the UBS holding in Vivendi or whether any part of it was held on behalf of third parties.\n\n*Vivendi II,* note 102, above, para. 214.\n\nDisqualification Decision, para. 78\n\n156.\n\nIn addition, the Committee notes that the *Vivendi II* Committee placed considerable weight on what it described as \"the obvious point that a director in the exercise of his or her function is under a fiduciary duty *vis-\u00e0-vis* the shareholders of the bank to further the interests of the bank and therefore postpone [ *sic* ] conflicting interests\" and considered that \"that is fundamentally at variance with his or her duty as independent arbitrator in an arbitration involving a party in which the bank has a shareholding or other interest, however small it may be\".178 On that basis, the *Vivendi II* Committee considered that\n\nSince a major international bank has connections with or an interest in virtually any major international company (which companies are also the most likely to end up in international arbitrations), this suggests that the positions of a director of such a bank, and that of an international arbitrator, may not be compatible and should not be, or in a modern international arbitration environment, should no longer be combined.179\n\n*Vivendi II*, note 102, above, paras. 217-218.\n\n*Vivendi II,* note 102, above, para. 218.\n\n157.\n\nThe *Vivendi II* Committee emphasised, in this context, the report of Professor Wolfram (which is also part of the record in the present case) and the evidence of Professor Mistelis (which is not). Since the present Committee has not seen the evidence of Professor Mistelis, it cannot tell on what basis he suggested that there might be a conflict between the fiduciary duty of a director and the duty of an arbitrator and, specifically, whether he based his comments on any particular legal system's rules on fiduciary obligations. Before the present Committee, Argentina rightly did not attempt to rely upon Professor Mistelis180 and there is no evidence before the Committee regarding fiduciary duties under any particular system of law. The Committee can only, therefore, consider this issue as a matter of general principle and in the light of the report of Professor Wolfram. On that level, however, the Committee is not persuaded that a director of a bank would have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of the bank to act in any particular way when sitting as an arbitrator. The point which was emphasised by the *Vivendi II* Committee was that \"a director *in the exercise of his or her function* is under a fiduciary duty *vis-\u00e0-vis* the shareholders of the bank\" (emphasis added). The phrase \"in the exercise of his or her function\" can only refer to that person's function as a director. If a non-executive director of a bank sits as an arbitrator, they are not acting in the exercise of their function as a director when they exercise the quite different function of arbitrator. Of course, a conflict of interest *might* arise in such a case - it would obviously do so if the bank was a party to the arbitration in question - but, at least as a matter of general principle, it would not be the existence of any fiduciary duty to the shareholders of the bank which would be the basis of that conflict.\n\nTranscript, pp. 281 and 286.\n\n158.\n\nThe Committee also notes the observation of the *Vivendi II* Committee that the roles of director of a major international bank and arbitrator \"may not be compatible and should not be, or in a modern international arbitration environment, should no longer be combined\". It may be the case that, in future, such positions will not be combined. The Committee notes that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler has resigned from the UBS Board. However, what the position should be in the future is not the issue. What matters for the purposes of the present proceedings is whether the remaining members of the Tribunal acted unreasonably in concluding that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's directorship of UBS did not require her disqualification.\n\n159.\n\nThat another reasonable tribunal could have reached the same decision as Professors Park and Rem\u00f3n is clear from the fact that another tribunal did in fact do so. In the *Suez II* decision on disqualification, which again involved a proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler on the grounds of her directorship of UBS, the remaining members of the tribunal -Professors Salacuse and Nikken - dismissed the proposal to disqualify. They held (for the same reasons as this Committee, see para. 108, above) that an arbitrator was required to be both independent and impartial.181 Having noted the size of UBS and the enormous range of its investments,182 they held that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's membership of the UBS Board did not in itself give rise to a conflict of interest, as UBS was not involved in the arbitration, but was relevant only because it might suggest a degree of connection between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the claimants since UBS held shares in the claimants on behalf of third parties.183 They then stated:\n\nBut the fact of an alleged connection between a party and an arbitrator in and of itself is not sufficient to establish a fact that would establish a manifest lack of that arbitrator's impartiality and independence. Arbitrators are not disembodied spirits dwelling on Mars who descend to earth to arbitrate a case and then immediately return to their Martian retreat to await inertly the call to arbitrate another. Like other professionals living and working in the world, arbitrators have a variety of complex connections with all sorts of persons and institutions.184\n\n*Suez II*, para. 28.\n\n*Suez II*, para. 10.\n\n*Suez II*, para. 31.\n\n*Suez II*, para. 32.\n\n160.\n\nWhat was necessary, according to Professors Salacuse and Nikken, was to evaluate the degree of connection between the arbitrator and the party to the arbitration by reference to the proximity, intensity, dependence and materiality of that connection. In relation to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's connection with the claimants as a result of her membership of the UBS Board, they found that the link fell short of anything which would give rise to reasonable doubts about her impartiality or independence. The UBS investment was not strategic and \"with respect to any alleged benefit flowing to UBS as a result of this arbitration, it should be pointed out that UBS's holding in Suez and Vivendi would have an insignificant effect on UBS profitability given the enormous size and scope of UBS global operations\".185 Under the system which prevails in Switzerland of separation of the Board of Directors from the management of a company, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had no knowledge of the UBS shareholdings in the claimants until the challenge, had no role in making them or in monitoring their performance, and \"no direct relationship with the claimants by virtue of her directorship\".186 There was no frequency of interaction between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the claimants and Professor Kaufmann-Kohler would derive no benefit from an award in favour of the claimants. Professors Salacuse and Nikken also rejected the argument that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's failure to disclose her membership of the UBS Board was indicative of a lack of impartiality or independence. Such a duty arose only where the arbitrator reasonably believed that circumstances existed which might cause a reasonable person to doubt whether that arbitrator would behave independently and impartially. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had inquired with UBS about conflicts of interest and been told that (with the exception of her participation in the Americas Cup Jury) there were none; it had been reasonable for her to rely upon that advice.187\n\n*Suez II*, para. 36.\n\n*Suez II*, para. 40.\n\n*Suez II*, para. 48.\n\n161.\n\nThe Committee considers that both the Disqualification Decision in this case and the one in *Suez II* are carefully reasoned and comprehensive in their consideration of the issues. The Disqualification Decision in the present case carefully assesses the significance of the indirect links which Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's membership of the Board of UBS created with EDFI. The Committee considers that Professors Park and Rem\u00f3n were plainly correct in identifying the ownership by the UBS Foundation of shares in EDFI's parent company, EDF, as the critical issue. The fact that UBS and another subsidiary of EDF held shares in AEM Milan did not give UBS an interest of any kind in the success or failure of EDF or EDFI. *A fortiori*, no conflict of interest could arise from the fact that UBS had held shares in Motor Columbus, in which EDF also had a substantial shareholding, given that it had disposed of those shares before Professor Kaufmann-Kohler became a director of UBS. The participation of UBS in the financial consortium which assisted in the placement of EDF shares on the French market similarly created no community of interest between UBS and EDF, while the fact that UBS listed EDF as a good investment opportunity is too remote a connection to give rise to a conflict of interest. None of the findings in the Disqualification Decision on these points are ones which it could plausibly be said that no reasonable tribunal would have made.\n\n162.\n\nThe fact that the UBS Foundation held shares in EDF, as the Tribunal remarked, \"stands on a somewhat different footing\". Nevertheless, the Committee considers that, as Professors Park and Rem\u00f3n held, the fact that the ultimate beneficiary of any rise in the value of those shares would be the Swiss funds which participated in the Foundation and not UBS itself, the relative insignificance of the investment when seen in the context of the overall size of UBS's investments and the fact that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had no responsibility for, or involvement in, the management of this or other investments were grounds on which any reasonable decision-maker could, and would be likely to, conclude that there was no basis for holding that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler manifestly lacked the requisite independence and impartiality. It is noticeable that at least one other decision-maker, namely the tribunal in *Suez II*, did indeed reach such a conclusion.\n\n163.\n\nThe same is true of the failure by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to disclose her appointment to the UBS Board. Both Professors Park and Rem\u00f3n in the present case, and Professors Salacuse and Nikken in *Suez II*, carefully explained why that failure was not sufficient to indicate a lack of independence or impartiality.\n\n164.\n\nThe Committee has taken note of the fact that the *Vivendi II* Committee, though eventually deciding not to annul the award in that case, took a far more critical view of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's conduct. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that the *Vivendi II* decision does not cause it to conclude that the Disqualification Decision in the present case was unreasonable. It therefore dismisses the application that the Award should be annulled on account of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's directorship of UBS or her non-disclosure of that directorship.\n\n**3. Professor Rem\u00f3n**\n----------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Committee turns, therefore, to Argentina's challenge to Professor Rem\u00f3n. As has already been explained, this challenge is raised for the first time before the Committee and must therefore be considered *de novo*. The challenge came about because of a letter written by Professor Rem\u00f3n to the Secretary of the Tribunal on 18 April 2012.188 It is therefore worth quoting that letter in full:-\n\nOn 16 April 2012, the media have informed that Argentina has announced the expropriation of the 51% stake that the Spanish company Repsol has in Ypf. I hereby wish to inform:\n\n1. That the law firm Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez, of which I am a partner, is among the firms that have traditionally provided legal advisory services to Repsol. I have actually acted as counsel for Repsol in various proceedings.\n\n2. Naturally this fact does not affect nor shall it affect my impartiality or independence in any way whatsoever in this arbitration (ICSID case No. ARB/03/23).\n\n3. If Repsol were to request any kind of assistance from Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez in connection with the mentioned decision to expropriate, I would refrain from taking part in the matter while these proceedings are ongoing.\n\nProfessor Rem\u00f3n concluded by expressing his wish that this information be communicated to the Parties.\n\nRA 531.\n\n166.\n\nOn 27 April 2012, Argentina wrote requesting Professor Rem\u00f3n's resignation on the basis that his relationship, through the firm Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez, with Repsol, a company now in an adversarial situation vis-\u00e0-vis Argentina, created reasonable doubts about his independence and impartiality.189 The Claimants also submitted observations, on 2 May 2012, rejecting the suggestion that Professor Rem\u00f3n should resign.190 Professor Rem\u00f3n responded, on 11 May 2012, in the following terms:\n\nAfter the analysis of the communications of the parties, dated 27 April and 2 May, bearing in mind that the deliberations of the Tribunal and the drafting of the award were completed several weeks before the announcement of the expropriation, I confirm that the facts that, for the sake of transparency, I included in my letter of disclosure do not affect my impartiality or independence as arbitrator in these proceedings.\n\nThe Award was signed by Professor Park, the Chairman, on 8 May 2012, by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler on 11 May 2012 and by Professor Rem\u00f3n on 14 May 2012. It was handed down to the Parties on 11 June 2012. On 4 December 2012 Repsol commenced arbitration proceedings against Argentina. Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez represented Repsol in those proceedings.\n\nRA 532.\n\nAC 9.\n\n167.\n\nThose who have been required to take decisions on whether or not to disqualify an arbitrator on account of the involvement of his or her law firm in separate proceedings against one of the parties have unsurprisingly taken the view that the fact that the law firm of which an arbitrator is a member is acting against one of the parties to the arbitration in separate proceedings will frequently raise reasonable doubts about the independence and impartiality of the arbitrator, especially where the arbitration concerns legal issues similar to those involved in the other proceedings.191 However, those cases involved arbitrators whose law firms were already engaged in proceedings in which they acted for a party adverse to one of the parties in the arbitration before the arbitration proceedings had concluded. In the present case, the timetable is very different.\n\nSee *Blue Bank*, note 97, above, paras. 67-68 and *ICS Inspection Control Services Ltd. v. Argentina*, Decision of the Appointing Authority, 17 December 2009, pp. 4-5.\n\n168.\n\nThere is no indication in Professor Rem\u00f3n's letter of 18 April 2012 that Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez was at that stage actually representing or advising Repsol in a manner adverse to Argentina, only that it might at some future stage be asked to do so. That possibility does not, in itself, create a conflict of interests. Nor does the Committee accept Argentina's submission that Professor Rem\u00f3n's comment that \"if Repsol were to request any kind of assistance from Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez in connection with the mentioned decision to expropriate, I would refrain from taking part in the matter while these proceedings [i.e. those in the case between the present Claimants and Argentina] are ongoing\" indicates that once the arbitration in the present case had concluded he would be in a position adverse to Argentina. The Committee accepts that the fact that Repsol did not commence arbitration proceedings until 4 December 2012, nearly six months after the Award in the present case had been given to the Parties, is not in itself decisive. If an arbitrator's law firm is advising an entity in preparation for the commencement of legal proceedings against one of the parties to the arbitration, that fact would present a conflict of interests irrespective of whether those proceedings had actually been commenced at that time. However, the conflict of interests would not arise until the firm started to give such advice or otherwise to act for that entity in a matter in which it was adversarial to the party to the arbitration.\n\n169.\n\nArgentina points to the attendance of a partner in Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez, acting as Repsol's proxy, at a meeting of the shareholders of YPF on 6 June 2012, that is five days before the Award was given to the Parties. According to the minutes of that meeting,192 that partner made reference to a dispute between Repsol and Argentina. Argentina maintains that the duty of an arbitrator to act independently and impartially does not cease when the award is completed but only when the award is given to the parties. While the Committee agrees that the duty to act independently and impartially continues until the award has been delivered, it does not accept the conclusion which Argentina seeks to draw with regard to the present case. By 6 June 2012, the Award had already been completed and signed by all three members of the Tribunal. While an arbitrator remains obliged to act independently and impartially up to the moment that the award is delivered, once that arbitrator has signed the award there is normally no further occasion for the arbitrator to act in relation to the arbitration proceedings; certainly there is no evidence before the Committee that Professor Rem\u00f3n was called upon to perform any act as arbitrator after he had appended his signature to the Award on 14 May 2012.\n\nRA 542.\n\n170.\n\nMoreover, for the reasons already given (paragraphs 133 to 134, above), a conflict of interests would constitute a ground for annulment only if it could have had an effect upon the award. In the present case, Professor Rem\u00f3n's letter of 11 May 2012 makes clear that the drafting of the Award had been completed several weeks before the announcement of 16 April 2012. There is no reason to doubt the truth of that statement, which is confirmed on this point by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's letter of the same date. On the contrary, the length (over 300 pages) and complexity of the Award, together with the fact that it was to be rendered in both English and Spanish and thus had to be translated from the language in which it had been drafted, also point to the conclusion that the drafting must have been completed before 16 April if the Award was to be delivered on 11 June 2012. It follows that, even if Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez became involved in advising Repsol about possible proceedings against Argentina between 16 April and 11 June 2012, the conflict of interest thus created for Professor Rem\u00f3n could not have influenced the Award and cannot, therefore, constitute a ground for annulment.\n\n171.\n\nNevertheless, there is one further matter to consider. Argentina points to the fact that Repsol's Notice of Arbitration referred not just to formal expropriation but also to other steps taken before the announcement of 16 April 2012 and going back to the last weeks of 2011. Since Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez was, according to Professor Rem\u00f3n's letter of 18 April 2012, one of the firms which \"traditionally provided legal advisory services to Repsol\", it should be inferred that they were already engaged in advising Repsol regarding its relations with Argentina and the legal strategy it should adopt as early as November 2011.193\n\nMemorial, paras. 62-67.\n\n172.\n\nThe Claimants counter that this is pure speculation and that, even if it were well-founded, since Argentina knew what it intended to do vis-\u00e0-vis Repsol, it must be taken to have waived any objection to Professor Rem\u00f3n as regards any conflict of interest arising out of events in late 2011 or early 2012.\n\n173.\n\nThe Committee does not accept the Claimants' waiver argument. That argument would have been well-founded had Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez been representing Repsol in court or arbitration proceedings in the period November 2011 to March 2012, since Argentina would have been aware of the firm's involvement in proceedings against Argentina. The same cannot be said, however, regarding any advisory role that Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez might have had. There is no reason to assume that Argentina would have known which law firm, if any, was advising Repsol regarding its relations with Argentina in that period, unless that firm was openly engaged in correspondence or meetings and there is no evidence to suggest that that was the case.\n\n174.\n\nNevertheless, the Committee agrees with the Claimants that Argentina's argument about the role that Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez may have played before the announcement of 16 April 2012 is purely speculative. No evidence whatever has been put before the Committee that would enable it to conclude that Ur\u00eda Men\u00e9ndez was advising Repsol regarding a legal strategy *vis-\u00e0-vis* Argentina during that period. The Committee agrees with the observation of the *SGS* Tribunal quoted at paragraph 110, above, and, in particular, with that tribunal's comment that\n\n\"an arbitrator cannot, under Article 57 of the Convention, be successfully challenged as a result of inferences which themselves rest merely on other inferences\".194\n\n*SGS,* note 145, above, 8 ICSID Reports 402.\n\n175.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee also dismisses Argentina's application to annul the Award on the ground of a supposed lack of independence and impartiality on the part of Professor Rem\u00f3n.\n\n**V. Applicable Law Issues**\n----------------------------\n\n***A. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n176.\n\nArgentina maintains that, in deciding on the applicable law, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (ICSID Article 52(1)(b)), failed to state the reasons on which the Award was based (ICSID Article 52(1)(e)) and was guilty of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (ICSID Article 52(1)(d)).195\n\nApplication, paras. 32-47.\n\n177.\n\nThese allegations concern three aspects of the Award. The first concerns the decision of the Tribunal that the \"Claimants' claims may be decided solely on the basis of the Argentina-France BIT\",196 thereby excluding application of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT. The second concerns the failure of the Tribunal to apply Argentine law, which Argentina had argued was \"essential in determining the nature and scope of Claimants' treaty-based rights as well as in deciding whether a breach of such rights has occurred\".197 In addressing that argument, the Tribunal concluded that -\n\n... in the context of its mandate under the Argentine-France BIT, the terms of that treaty provide the lodestar for decision. It may well be that a national court deciding analogous issues would come to a different conclusion. However, in the present dispute the BIT supplies the primary foundation and framework for the Tribunal's consideration of investor protection.198\n\nThe third aspect of the Award challenged under this heading is the Tribunal's conclusion that, in its Jurisdictional Decision, it had \"laid down no general requirement of discrimination as a basis for liability under relevant treaty provisions\".199\n\nAward, para. 887.\n\nAward, para. 903.\n\nAward, para. 904.\n\nAward, para. 920.\n\n***B. Parties' Arguments***\n---------------------------\n\n**1. Argentina**\n----------------\n\n178.\n\nArgentina maintains that it is now well-established that one form of manifest excess of powers is the failure of a tribunal to apply the applicable law200 and that the Tribunal so failed in three respects. First, it held that Le\u00f3n's claim was governed by the Argentina-France BIT, rather than the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, notwithstanding that Le\u00f3n was a Luxembourg corporation. Secondly, it failed to apply Argentine law in breach of a clear directive in the BITs. Argentina also maintains that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for this aspect of its decision.\n\nMemorial, paras. 138-9.\n\n179.\n\nArgentina contends that Le\u00f3n, which remained a Claimant throughout the proceedings and thus benefits from the Award, could not have had standing to claim under the Argentina-France BIT, because it was at all times a Luxembourg corporation. To apply the Argentina-France BIT to Le\u00f3n's claims was, therefore, a manifest excess of power. According to Argentina, it was also contrary to the approach taken in the Jurisdiction Decision, where the Tribunal had found that it possessed jurisdiction over Le\u00f3n's claims under the Argentine-Luxembourg BIT.\n\n180.\n\nIn addition to exceeding its powers in this respect, the Tribunal also failed to explain how the Argentina-France BIT could apply to Le\u00f3n.201 To the extent that it could be said to have attempted to do so, its reasoning was contradictory in that it referred to Le\u00f3n's cession of its rights to EDFI after proceedings had commenced, whereas the Tribunal had made clear in the Jurisdiction Decision that it was the state of affairs at the time of the commencement of proceedings that was decisive.\n\nTranscript, pp. 68-75.\n\n181.\n\nWhile the application by the Tribunal of the Argentina-France BIT was one aspect of a manifest excess of powers, the failure to apply the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT to Le\u00f3n's claims was another. According to Argentina, it was that treaty which plainly constituted the applicable law in respect of Le\u00f3n and the Tribunal's failure to apply it deprived Argentina of the ability to rely on the \"public order\" defence afforded by Article 3(2) of the Argentine-Luxembourg BIT, which the Tribunal expressly recognized might have made a difference to the outcome of the case.202 Again, this decision entailed not just a manifest excess of powers but also a failure to state reasons. In particular, Argentina refers to what it characterizes as contradictions between different parts of the Award and between the Award and the Jurisdiction Decision.\n\nAward, para. 888.\n\n182.\n\nAs a distinct ground for annulment, Argentina challenges the Tribunal's decision that the case was to be decided by reference only to the Argentina-France BIT and international law and not to apply the law of Argentina. According to Argentina, this approach ignored the provisions of Article 42(1) of the Convention which requires a tribunal - in the absence of agreement by the parties - to \"apply the law of the Contracting State (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable\". The result was that the Tribunal failed to apply Argentine law as the law governing the Concession Agreement and, more fundamentally, disregarded the extensive powers which the Constitution of Argentina gave to the government to deal with emergencies such as that of 2001-02. The Tribunal had also failed to state its reasons since it referred only to the principle of international law that, in the event of a conflict, international law prevails over national law without giving any indication of what conflict it considered to exist between international law and the law of Argentina.\n\n183.\n\nFinally, Argentina refers to what it terms a contradiction between the Jurisdiction Decision and the Award with regard to the issue of discrimination. According to Argentina, in the Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal held that the Claimants would have to prove discrimination in order to establish a case of breach of either BIT. In the Award, however, it repudiated that finding and held that discrimination was not a requirement for the establishment of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard or certain other provisions of the treaties. Argentina again characterises this decision as a manifest excess of power and argues that the Tribunal failed to give a coherent and non-contradictory statement of its reasons, as well as departing in a serious way from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n**2. The Claimants**\n--------------------\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimants reject the suggestion that the Tribunal erred in any annullable fashion in relation to the applicable law. They maintain that Argentina invokes three separate paragraphs of Article 52(1) but treats them as largely indistinguishable. According to the Claimants, even though an application for annulment may raise more than one paragraph of Article 52(1), each is a separate ground for annulment which must be independently established.203 In particular, the Claimants maintain that Argentina has not properly pleaded, let alone substantiated, its argument that the Tribunal departed in a serious way from a fundamental rule of procedure.204 Moreover, according to the Claimants, Argentina's arguments fail to distinguish between a failure to apply the applicable law and misapplication of that law, as well as ignoring the limitations placed on annulment by the relevant parts of Article 52(1).\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 119-120.\n\nRejoinder, para. 77.\n\n185.\n\nWhile the Claimants accept that Article 52(1)(b) applies to a manifest failure to apply the applicable law, they maintain that it has no application to \"incorrect\" application, departure from the view taken by other tribunals regarding the same or a similar issue, or failure to cite any text to support a proposition that it considers to derive from the treaty.205\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 126-130.\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Le\u00f3n was added as a claimant in the Amended Request only because Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, its French parent company, had transferred to Le\u00f3n its shares in MENDINVERT. The Amended Request invoked the Argentina-France BIT and only pleaded the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT as a fallback position to be relied upon in the event that the Tribunal were to decide that Le\u00f3n could not rely upon the Argentina-France BIT.206\n\nRejoinder, paras. 83-85.\n\n187.\n\nWith regard to the non-application of Argentine law, the Claimants maintain that the claims were for violation of the Argentina-France BIT and were therefore necessarily to be decided in accordance with the terms of that treaty and the principles of international law. The Tribunal had carefully analysed and explained its decision not to apply Argentine law.\n\n188.\n\nOn the issue of discrimination, the Claimants maintain that Argentina misrepresents the Jurisdiction Decision and submit that the Award clearly explained that the Jurisdiction Decision was not laying down a general requirement of discrimination.\n\n189.\n\nFinally, the Claimants contend that Argentina's claim that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure is misconceived. There was no indication \"what aspect of Argentina's right of defense was impaired\".207 Indeed, the whole issue of applicable law was extensively briefed by both Parties.208\n\nRejoinder, para. 106.\n\nRejoinder, para. 107.\n\n***C. The Decision of the Committee***\n--------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Legal Framework**\n--------------------------\n\n190.\n\nBefore turning to the detail of this particular head of Argentina's Application for annulment of the Award, it is necessary first to make some observations regarding the three paragraphs of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention invoked by Argentina, although there appeared to be little if any difference between the Parties regarding the requirements of each paragraph (as opposed to their application to the facts of the present case).\n\n***a. Manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention)***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe terms of Article 52(1)(b) make plain that the paragraph lays down two requirements which must be met if an Award is to be annulled on this ground. First, the tribunal must have exceeded its powers and, secondly, that excess of power must be \"manifest\". The most obvious instance of an excess of power by a tribunal is the decision of an issue which falls outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal under the ICSID Convention or the relevant BIT (or other instrument conferring jurisdiction). However, decisions of *ad hoc* committees in other cases have made clear that it is also an excess of power for a tribunal to fail to apply the law applicable to the case or to the particular issue in the case.\n\n192.\n\nThe requirement that the excess of powers be \"manifest\" refers to how readily apparent the excess is, rather than to its gravity. In the words of one leading commentary on the ICSID Convention -\n\nIn accordance with its dictionary meaning, \"manifest\" may mean \"plain\", \"clear\", \"obvious\", \"evident\" and easily understood or recognized by the mind. Therefore, the manifest nature of an excess of powers is not necessarily an indication of its gravity. Rather, it relates to the ease with which it is perceived.... An excess of powers is manifest if it can be discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis.209\n\nThis view has been endorsed in several decisions of *ad hoc* committees. Thus, in *Wena Hotels Ltd*. v. *Egypt*, the committee stated that -\n\nThe excess of power must be self evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretation one way or the other. When the latter happens, the excess of power is no longer manifest.210\n\nSimilarly, the committee in *CDC Group v. Seychelles* stated -\n\nAs interpreted by various *ad hoc* committees, the term \"manifest\" means clear or \"self-evident\". Thus, even if a tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a tribunal's conduct, if susceptible of argument \"one way or the other\" is not manifest. As one commentator has put it, \"if the issue is debatable or requires examination of the materials on which the tribunal's decision is based, the tribunal's determination is conclusive.\"211\n\nSchreuer, *Commentary*, note 53, above, Article 52, para. 135.\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd. v. Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4) 6 ICSID Reports 129 at para. 25 (\" *Wena* \").\n\n*CDC,* note 156, above, para. 41.\n\n193.\n\nWhile the Committee agrees that an excess of powers will be manifest only if it can readily be discerned, it considers that this does not mean that the excess must, as it were, leap out of the page on a first reading of the Award. The reasoning in a case may be so complex that a degree of inquiry and analysis is required before it is clear precisely what the tribunal has decided. In such a case, the need for such inquiry and analysis will not prevent an excess of powers from being \"manifest\".212 Moreover, in any case some examination of the materials on which the tribunal's decision was based may be necessary. The Committee in *Duke Energy Ltd v. Peru* put the point in the following terms -\n\nAn *ad hoc* committee will not therefore annul an award if the tribunal's disposition on a question of law is tenable, even if the committee considers it incorrect as a matter of law. The existence of a manifest excess of powers can only be assessed by an *ad hoc* committee in consideration of the factual and legal elements upon which the arbitral tribunal founded its decision and/or award based on the parties' submissions. Without reopening debates on questions of fact, a committee can take into account the facts of the case as they were in the record before the tribunal to check whether it could come to its solution, however debatable. Is the opinion of the tribunal so untenable that it cannot be supported by reasonable arguments? A debatable solution is not amenable to annulment, since the excess of powers would not then be \"manifest\".213\n\nThe Committee agrees with this analysis. It notes also that the *Duke* Committee stated that -\n\nNo distinction is to be drawn in this regard between the standard to be applied to determining an excess of power based on alleged excess of jurisdiction and any other excess of power. In both cases, the excess must be manifest.214\n\nSee, e.g., the Decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Vivendi I,* note 70, above.\n\n*Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1 Limited v. Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28), Decision on Annulment of 1 March 2011, para. 99 (\" *Duke* \").\n\n*Ibid,* para. 98.\n\n***b. Failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention)***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe provision of Article 52(1)(e) that an award may be annulled if it \"fails to state the reasons on which it is based\" is closely tied to the provision of Article 48(3), which requires that \"the award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based\".\n\n195.\n\nThe requirement to state reasons is an important one but it is equally important that an *ad hoc* committee is not drawn into using Article 52(1)(e) as a means for conducting an appeal. Article 52(1)(e) empowers a committee to annul an award if there has been a *failure* to state the reasons on which the award is based; it does not entitle a committee to annul an award because it finds the reasoning unconvincing. The point was very clearly made by the *Vivendi I* Committee in the following passage -\n\nA greater source of concern is perhaps the ground of \"failure to state reasons\", which is not qualified by any such phrase as \"manifestly\" or \"serious\". However, it is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state *any* reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons. It bears repeating that an *ad hoc* committee is not a court of appeal. Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.\n\nIn the Committee's view, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal's decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an *ad hoc* committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal's reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.215\n\n*Vivendi I*, note 70, above, paras. 64-65.\n\n196.\n\nSimilarly, the *Wena* committee explained that -\n\nThe ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged award which would lead the *ad hoc* committee to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the tribunal's decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not. As stated by the *ad hoc* committee in *MINE*, this ground for annulment refers to a \"minimum requirement\" only. This requirement is based on the tribunal's duty to identify, and to let the parties know, the factual and legal premises leading the tribunal to its decision. If such a sequence of reasons has been given by the tribunal, there is no room left for a request for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n\u2026\n\nNeither Article 48(3) nor Article 52(1)(e) specify the manner in which the Tribunal's reasons are to be stated. The object of both provisions is to ensure that the parties will be able to understand the tribunal's reasoning. This goal does not require that each reason be stated expressly. The tribunal's reasons may be implicit in the consideration and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision.216\n\n*Wena*, note 210, above, paras. 79 and 81.\n\n197.\n\nA tribunal is required to answer each \"question\" put to it and must therefore give sufficient reasons to meet the \"minimum requirement\" referred to by the *Wena* committee in respect of each question. It is not, however, required to deal explicitly with every detail of every argument advanced by the parties or to refer to every authority which they invoke. As the *Enron* committee explained -\n\n... a tribunal has a duty to deal with each of the *questions* (\" *pretensions* \") submitted to it, but it is not required to comment on all arguments of the parties in relation to each of those questions. Similarly, the Committee considers that the tribunal is required only to give reasons for its decision in respect of each of the *questions*. This requires the tribunal to state its pertinent findings of fact, its pertinent findings as to the applicable legal principles, and its conclusions in respect of the application of the law to the facts. If the tribunal has done this, the award will not be annulled on the basis that the tribunal could have given more detailed reasons and analysis for its findings of fact or law, or that the tribunal did not expressly state its evaluation in respect of each individual item of evidence or each individual legal authority or legal provision relied on by the parties, or did not expressly state a view on every single legal and factual issue raised by the parties in the course of the proceedings. The tribunal is required to state reasons for its *decision*, but not necessarily reasons for its *reasons.*217\n\n*Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. and Ponderosa Assets LP v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Annulment of 30 July 2010, para. 222 (\" *Enron* \").\n\n198.\n\nThe Committee agrees with these observations regarding the scope and purpose of Article 52(1)(e). Nevertheless, it remains an important part of the annulment process and, as the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *CMS* demonstrates, where a tribunal has failed to give reasons which enable the parties to understand the decision on a question before it, that part of its award is liable to annulment.218\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on Annulment of 25 September 2007, para. 96 (\" *CMS* \").\n\n***c. Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d))***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nThe English text of Article 52(1)(d) provides that an award may be annulled if \"there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\". The French text is to the same effect, requiring \"inobservation grave d'une r\u00e8gle fondamentale de procedure\". However, the Spanish text speaks only of \"quebrantamiento grave de una norma de procedimiento\". While all three texts thus require that the breach must have been \"serious\" (\"grave\" in French and Spanish), only the English and French texts require that the rule of procedure involved must have been \"fundamental\". The English, French and Spanish texts of the Convention are equally authentic, so the difference between them has to be resolved by application of the principles of international law regarding treaty interpretation. The relevant principle is generally understood to have been codified in Article 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, paragraph (4) of which provides that \"when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application of Articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty shall be adopted\". In the case of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, the English and French texts unequivocally require a departure from a \"fundamental\" rule of procedure and are thus narrower than the Spanish text, which refers only to a rule of procedure. Since the common ground between the three texts is that they all permit annulment in the case of a serious breach of a \"fundamental\" rule of procedure, it would appear that the meaning which best reconciles the three texts is one which requires a \"serious\" departure from a \"fundamental\" rule of procedure. The Committee also considers that this interpretation sits more happily with the object and purpose of the Convention, which assigns a restricted role to annulment proceedings, as discussed in Part III of this Decision. This interpretation is also the one consistently adopted in the jurisprudence of *ad hoc* committees.219\n\nSee, in particular, *Repsol YPF Ecuador SA v. Petroecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10), Decision on annulment of 8 January 2007, para. 81 (\" *Repsol* \") and Schreuer, *Commentary*, note 53, above, Article 52, paras. 280-281.\n\n200.\n\nThe Committee therefore proceeds on the basis that Article 52(1)(d) authorizes annulment only if two conditions are met: the rule of procedure involved must have been fundamental and the breach of that rule must have been serious. The implications of this two-fold requirement were summarized by the *MINE* Committee in the following terms -\n\nA first comment on this provision concerns the term \"serious\". In order to constitute a ground for annulment the departure from a \"fundamental rule of procedure\" must be serious. The Committee considers that this establishes both quantitative and qualitative criteria: the departure must be substantial and must be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.\n\nA second comment concerns the term \"fundamental\"; even a serious departure from a rule of procedure will not give rise to annulment, unless that rule is \"fundamental\". The Committee considers that a clear example of such a fundamental rule is to be found in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration which provides: \"the parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given full opportunity of presenting his case.\" The term \"fundamental rule of procedure\" is not to be understood as necessarily including all of the Arbitration Rules adopted by the Centre.220\n\n*MINE,* note 70, above, paras. 5.05-5.06.\n\n**2. Application of the Argentina-France BIT and Non-Application of the Argentine-Luxembourg BIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nIn its Award, the Tribunal noted that \"the Parties are for the most part in accord that this case can and should be decided solely on the basis of the Argentine-France BIT\".221 It went on, however, to observe that an important exception lay in Argentina's\n\n\"affirmative defense, asserted exclusively against Claimant Le\u00f3n, namely that Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT applies to expressly exempt Argentina from any liability which might result from \"...measures necessary to maintain public order\".222\n\nAward, para. 179.\n\nAward, para. 180.\n\n202.\n\nThe Tribunal held, however, that the entire case fell to be decided under the Argentina-France BIT and that it was not necessary to apply the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT.223 Article 3(2) of the latter treaty thus became irrelevant to the decision, although the Tribunal noted that -\n\nHad the Tribunal decided to grant relief on the basis of Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, then the \"public order\" defense of that provision might have had consequences. Such is not the case, however.224\n\nAward, paras. 884-887.\n\nAward, para. 888.\n\n203.\n\nIn its Application, and in the written pleadings, Argentina complains of the failure to apply the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT.225 At the oral hearings, however, while maintaining that complaint, Argentina added an argument that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of power in deciding that the Argentina-France BIT applied to Le\u00f3n's claims; since Le\u00f3n was a Luxembourg company, Argentina argues, there was no basis on which its claim could fall within that treaty.226\n\nApplication, paras. 33-34; Memorial, paras. 141-144; Reply, paras. 90-99.\n\nTranscript, p. 60.\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that it was not open to Argentina to challenge the Award on this basis at so late a stage in the proceedings.227 The Committee does not agree. While it is a matter for regret that the issue was not more clearly pleaded, the Committee considers that the complaint about the *application* of the Argentina-France BIT is merely the other side of the coin from the complaint about the *failure to apply* the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT to Le\u00f3n's claims. The issue was therefore raised in a timely fashion.228\n\nTranscript, p. 211.\n\nThe Claimants also suggested that Argentina raised the issue of the application of the Argentina-France BIT in response to a question from the Committee (Transcript, p. 212). However, the transcript shows that counsel for Argentina had raised this point shortly before the Committee put the question to which the Claimants refer (see Transcript, pp. 60-61.\n\n205.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that the position of Le\u00f3n was irrelevant, because in 2005, long before the date of the Award or even of the pleadings on the merits, Le\u00f3n's interests in SODEMSA had been transferred to IADESA and its right to maintain the ICSID claim to EDFI, so that, by the time of the hearings on the merits, EDFI owned the rights to the entire ICSID claim.229 On that basis, the Claimants argue that \"the Tribunal reached the logical conclusion that it didn't need to apply the Luxembourg BIT because there was nothing there to apply it to\".230 Argentina counters that Le\u00f3n remained a claimant throughout the proceedings, that the *dispositif* granted relief, including the declaratory relief in its first paragraph, to \"the Claimants\" without distinguishing between them and that the Jurisdiction Decision had ruled that the critical date was that of the request for arbitration, which was why Le\u00f3n and SAURI had remained claimants.231\n\nTranscript, pp. 212-215.\n\nTranscript, p. 215.\n\nTranscript, pp. 60-68 and 265-270.\n\n206.\n\nIn order to analyse this argument, it is necessary to recall the history of the Claimants' involvement in EDEMSA. In July 1998, when the Government of Mendoza concluded with EDEMSA the Concession Agreement which was at the heart of the case before the Tribunal, 51% of the shares in EDEMSA were purchased by a consortium of EDFI, SAURI and Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais (all of which are, and were then, French companies) and Argentine co-investors. That shareholding was held by SODEMSA, a company incorporated in Argentina. EDFI held 45% of the shares in SODEMSA and SAURI 15%. The remaining 40% were held by another Argentine company, MENDINVERT. Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais held a 70% shareholding in MENDINVERT with the remaining 30% being held by Argentine investors. Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais subsequently transferred its shareholding in MENDINVERT to Le\u00f3n, a company incorporated in Luxembourg that was wholly owned by Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais. That was how matters stood at the time the Amended Request for Arbitration was filed on 4 August 2003. The Amended Request sought to add L\u00e9on as a claimant to the proceedings already instituted by EDFI and SAURI on 16 June 2003. The Tribunal noted that:\n\nClaimant Le\u00f3n is said to be an assignee of the investment made in Argentina by its French parent company, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, and hence, has standing to file arbitrations under the Argentina-France BIT. See Amended Request footnote 1. Nevertheless, to the extent its Luxembourgian corporate nationality is found to preclude standing, Le\u00f3n invokes the provisions of the [Argentina-Luxembourg BIT].232\n\nAward, para. 9.\n\n207.\n\nIn 2004 Le\u00f3n became a wholly-owned subsidiary of EDFI.233 Subsequently Le\u00f3n sold its shares in MENDINVERT to an Argentine company, IADESA, but transferred its right to the present ICSID claim to EDFI.234 At the same time, EDFI, which had earlier acquired SAURI's shares in SODEMSA, sold its entire shareholding in SODEMSA to IADESA, while retaining the right to the ICSID claims.235\n\nJurisdiction Decision, para. 7.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, para. 88.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, para. 91. In the Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal rejected Argentina's argument, based on the award in *Loewen Group v. United States of America,* 128 *International Law Reports* 334, that the lack of continuous ownership from the date the dispute arose to the culmination of arbitration proceedings precluded jurisdiction. No challenge is made to that ruling in the present proceedings.\n\n208.\n\nIn its Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal held that \"as a general matter, the date when proceedings are instituted serves as the relevant time to establish jurisdiction\"236 and cited both arbitral and International Court of Justice authority to that effect. Accordingly, the Tribunal concluded that, notwithstanding the transfers in 2004, SAURI and Le\u00f3n should remain claimants.237 Nevertheless, it added that \"whether SAURI and Le\u00f3n still have substantive rights is a different issue, which the Tribunal will need to review together with the merits\".238\n\nJurisdiction Decision, para. 93.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, paras. 92 and 95.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, para. 95.\n\n209.\n\nWhen addressing the merits in its Award, the Tribunal held:\n\n884. The Tribunal notes that Claimants do not base their substantive request for relief on the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT, except to the extent of provisions that might be incorporated by reason of the Most Favored Nation clause in the Argentina-France BIT. See Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits at paragraph 59.\n\n885. While Claimants did invoke the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT in their Request for Arbitration, as well as certain subsequent pleadings, they did so only insofar as that BIT might have been relevant to claims by Le\u00f3n. Claimant [sic] further noted that the relevant interests were held at the outset entirely by French companies.\n\n886. At present, French investors again own all of the shares considered by the Tribunal in its findings of liability and quantum, including any which for a time were owned by Le\u00f3n. Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais (incorporated in France) was the initial owner of the relevant shares which were subsequently transferred to Le\u00f3n, its wholly-owned subsidiary. Ultimately, those shares were acquired by EDFI, a French investor which now possesses all relevant rights. See Claimants' PostHearing Brief on the Merits, paragraphs 59-60.\n\n887. Accordingly, Claimants' claims may be decided solely on the basis of the Argentina-France BIT.239\n\nSee also Award, paras. 1151-1152.\n\n210.\n\nThere is no doubt that this passage demonstrates that the Tribunal considered that the real claim which it had to consider was that of EDFI which, by the time of the Award, possessed all relevant rights to the ICSID claims. The Committee sees no contradiction between that recognition and the finding, in the Jurisdiction Decision, that the critical date for purposes of ascertaining jurisdiction was the date on which the arbitration proceedings were commenced. As the Tribunal made clear in its Jurisdiction Decision, the issue of jurisdiction is separate from the question what, if any, substantive rights each Claimant possessed.240 Nevertheless, while the Tribunal quite rightly focussed on the position of EDFI, the Committee does not accept the Claimants' contention that the position of Le\u00f3n (and by implication also of SAURI, though no challenge has been made in respect of this company) became irrelevant. Le\u00f3n and SAURI remained Claimants and the relief granted in the *dispositif* was granted to \"Claimants\" without any distinction between them. While Le\u00f3n might be unable to enforce the award of damages given that it has assigned its rights to EDFI, all three Claimants may be said to have the benefit of the declaratory relief granted in paragraph I of the *dispositif*, which records the Tribunal's decision that -\n\nRespondent has breached its obligations to (i) respect specific commitments undertaken in connection with Claimants' investment and (ii) afford Claimants Fair and Equitable Treatment with respect to their investment.\n\nThe Committee is not persuaded by the Claimants' argument that this paragraph was not declaratory relief but \"really just articulation of the conclusion by the Tribunal that Argentina had violated the BIT\" and that \"it didn't actually confer any relief as such\".241 The form of the paragraph and its place in the *dispositif* means that it cannot be dismissed so readily. Moreover, the Claimants' Reply on the Merits in the proceedings before the Tribunal had concluded with a section entitled \"Claimants' Request for Relief\" which expressly requested that the Tribunal make the determination which appeared at paragraph I of the *dispositif*242 and the Award duly recited that request.243\n\nJurisdiction Decision, para. 95.\n\nTranscript, p. 214.\n\nClaimants' Reply on the Merits, para. 712; AC 15.\n\nAward, para. 880.\n\n211.\n\nThe question, therefore, is whether, in the light of its earlier ruling on jurisdiction, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by holding that Le\u00f3n possessed rights under the Argentina-France BIT. In the Committee's view the Tribunal did not do so.\n\n212.\n\nIt is necessary to recall that at all relevant times Le\u00f3n was wholly owned by a company with its seat in France - initially Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais and, later, EDFI. It held its investment in Argentina (the shares in MENDINVERT which in turn held shares in SODEMSA, which in turn held shares in EDEMSA) by virtue of an assignment from its then parent company, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, and later assigned its rights to the ICSID claims to EDFI. In other words, this was an essentially French investment, ultimate ownership and control of which rested at all times with a French company. It would be an unduly formalistic approach to hold that, in these circumstances, the claim fell outside the scope of the Argentina-France BIT unless the terms of that treaty compelled such a decision. The Committee does not consider that they do so.\n\n213.\n\nOn the contrary, the Committee notes that standing to claim under the Argentina-France BIT is governed by Article 8(1) of the BIT which covers \"any dispute concerning investments in the terms of this Agreement between one Contracting Party and *an investor of the other Contracting Party* \" (emphasis added). The term \"investor\" is defined by Article 1(2) of the BIT, paragraph (c) of which provides, in relevant part, that:\n\nThe term \"investors\" means:\n\nc) artificial persons effectively controlled directly or indirectly by... artificial persons having their seat in the territory of either of the Contracting Parties and constituted in accordance with its legislation.\n\nThe Committee considers that this provision encompasses Le\u00f3n, because it was effectively controlled at the time of the Amended Request by Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais and subsequently by EDFI, both of which were companies constituted under the law of France and having their seats in France.\n\n214.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Committee considers that the Tribunal's decision that Le\u00f3n's claims fell within the ambit of the Argentina-France BIT cannot be considered to involve a manifest excess of power. Since, as the Committee has already explained - and as is clear from Argentina's own submissions - the Tribunal's decision not to apply the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT is just the other side of the coin of its decision to apply the Argentina-France BIT, the Committee also concludes that that decision involved no manifest excess of powers.\n\n215.\n\nThe Committee does not accept that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its decision on the application of one BIT and the non-application of the other. The Tribunal made clear, first, that the claim was brought under the Argentina-France BIT with reliance being placed on the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT only as an alternative.244 It traced carefully the ownership of Le\u00f3n and its position vis-\u00e0-vis the other Claimants.245 Its reasoning shows that its conclusion that the only BIT to be applied was that between Argentina and France was based upon the fact that the investment was originally held entirely by French companies and that Le\u00f3n was involved only by virtue of a transfer from its parent company by which it continued to be owned and controlled, and that, by the time of the hearing, the relevant rights were held entirely by EDFI. The Committee considers that this reasoning is sufficient to enable the reader to follow the logic behind this aspect of the Award.\n\nAward, para. 9.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, paras. 9, 82-92; Award, paras. 72, 171-175, 884-887 and 1151.\n\n216.\n\nNor is the Committee persuaded by Argentina's argument that the Tribunal contradicted itself. The Committee sees no contradiction between the references to the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT in the Jurisdiction Decision and the conclusion in the Award that the law applicable to the substantive issues was that contained in the Argentina-France BIT. The fact that, even after concluding that the case fell to be determined by reference to the latter treaty, the Tribunal continued to refer to the interpretation of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT246 is explained by the fact that the Claimants were invoking the umbrella clause in that treaty. But they did so by relying upon the MFN Clause in the Argentina-France BIT and it was on that BIT that they based their claim. As for the supposed conflict between paras. 886 and 1099 of the Award, to which Argentina referred at the hearing,247 the Committee can discern no such contradiction. The two paragraphs are dealing with different matters: the first shows that EDFI ultimately acquired all of Le\u00f3n's rights to the ICSID claim, while the latter makes clear that Le\u00f3n and EDFI did not transfer the rights to the ICSID claim when they sold their shares in MENDINVERT and SODEMSA respectively to IADESA.\n\nSee, for example, Award, para. 889.\n\nTranscript, p. 59.\n\n217.\n\nFinally, the Committee does not accept Argentina's argument that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in respect of this issue. Although such a departure was alleged in the Application and the Memorial, it was not seriously developed until a brief passage in paragraphs 98-99 of the Reply, where Argentina alleged that the \"decision to depart from the critical date in the Decision on Jurisdiction and not to apply the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT impaired due process\". That impairment is said to result from the fact that Argentina was denied a defence (under Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT) that might have affected the quantum of damages. That, however, is not really an argument about due process but about the substance of the Tribunal's decision. Argentina considers that the Tribunal's decision on applicable law was wrong but that does not make it an abuse of process. There is no evidence that the matter was not fully argued or that Argentina was in any way denied the opportunity to put its case. Consequently, there is no ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d).\n\n**3. Non-Application of Argentine Law**\n---------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nArgentina also challenges what it characterises as the failure of the Tribunal to apply the law of Argentina and its failure to state its reasons for so doing. In this context it is important to recall the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the BIT on applicable law. Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides -\n\nThe Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be available.248\n\nArticle 8(4) of the Argentine-France BIT provides -\n\nThe arbitration organization shall rule based on the provisions of this Agreement, on the laws of the Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute -including rules relating to the conflicts of laws - and on the terms of any special agreements made in connection with the investment, and on the principles of international law on the subject.\n\nThe authentic texts are as follows -\n\nL'organe d'arbitrage statuera, sur la base des dispositions du pr\u00e9sent Accord, du droit de la Partie contractante partie au diff\u00e9rend - y compris les r\u00e8gles relatives au conflits de loi -, des termes des accords particuliers \u00e9ventuels qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 conclus au sujet de l'investissement ainsi que des principes de droit international en la mati\u00e8re.\n\nand\n\nEl \u00f3rgano arbitral decidir\u00e1 en base a las disposiciones del presente Acuerdo, al derecho de la Parte Contratante que sea parte en la controversia - incluidas las normas relativas a conflictos de leyes - y a los t\u00e9rminos de eventuales acuerdos particulares concluidos con relaci\u00f3n a la inversi\u00f3n como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n a los principios del Derecho Internacional en la materia.\n\nWhile the English translation may be a little inelegant (e.g. in using \"laws\", rather than \"law\" as the translation of \"droit\" and \"derecho\"), in substance there is no difference between these texts.\n\nThe French text reads -  \n Le Tribunal statue sur le diff\u00e9rend conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles de droit adopt\u00e9es par les parties. Faute d'accord entre les parties, le Tribunal applique le droit de l'Etat contractant partie au diff\u00e9rend\u2014y compris les r\u00e8gles relatives aux conflits de lois\u2014ainsi que les principes de droit international en la mati\u00e8re.  \n The Spanish text reads -  \n El Tribunal decidir\u00e1 la diferencia de acuerdo con las normas de derecho acordadas por las partes. A falta de acuerdo, el Tribunal aplicar\u00e1 la legislaci\u00f3n del Estado que sea parte en la diferencia, incluyendo sus normas de derecho internacional privado, y aquellas normas de derecho internacional que pudieren ser aplicables.  \n There appears to be no difference between the three texts.\n\n219.\n\nArticle 8(4) of the BIT constitutes the agreement between the Parties regarding the applicable law, since the BIT constitutes the text of the arbitration agreement.249 The applicable law thus consists of the text of the BIT itself, the law of Argentina and the principles of international law, as well as the terms of any relevant special agreement, such as the Concession Agreement. However, the fact that a particular legal system supplies part of the applicable law does not mean that that law governs a given issue in dispute between the Parties. Which of the various applicable laws determines the answer to any particular question will depend upon the nature of that question. Thus, the interpretation and application of the Concession Agreement clearly fall to be determined by reference to Argentine law as the proper law of that contract. By contrast, if the issue to be determined concerns the interpretation or application of the BIT, those are questions governed by international law.\n\nSchreuer, *Commentary,* note 53, above, p. 558, Article 42, para. 23.\n\n220.\n\nIt is in that light that the Tribunal's findings that \"in the context of its mandate under the Argentine-France BIT, the terms of that treaty provide the lodestar for decision\" and that \"in the present dispute, the BIT supplies the primary foundation and framework for the Tribunal's consideration of investor protection\"250 are to be understood. The issues before the Tribunal concerned allegations of breaches of the BIT. Those issues could only be resolved by reference to the terms of the BIT and the principles of international law on subjects such as treaty interpretation. Before the Tribunal Argentina had argued that Argentine law conferred broad powers for addressing an emergency such as the economic crisis confronting Argentina in 2001-2002. The Tribunal concluded, however, that even if Argentine law would have permitted the various actions taken by the Federal and Mendoza authorities which affected the Claimants' investment, that would not have prevented those actions from constituting a breach of the BIT. That conclusion followed from the principle of international law, reflected in Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 and Article 3 of The International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility, that a State cannot rely upon its internal law to justify a failure to perform its treaty obligations and that the wrongfulness of an act under international law is not affected by the characterisation of that act as lawful by national law.251 There was, therefore, no manifest excess of power in the form of a failure to apply the applicable law. The Tribunal had noted the relevant principles of Argentine law in its Award but its conclusion was that those principles did not affect the specific issues which the Tribunal had to decide because those issues were governed by the terms of the BIT interpreted and applied in the light of the relevant principles of international law. That conclusion is amply supported by authority252 and appears to the Committee irreproachable as a matter of logic.\n\nAward, para. 904.\n\nAward, paras. 905-908.\n\nSee, e.g., the authorities cited in para. 908 of the Award and the discussion in Schreuer, *Commentary,* note 53, above, pp. 617-630, Article 42, paras. 204-230.\n\n221.\n\nNor is the Committee persuaded that the Tribunal failed adequately to state the reasons for this conclusion. Argentina argues that the Tribunal referred to the primacy of international law in the event of a conflict between Argentine law and international law without anywhere indicating what conflict existed. However, the Tribunal's reasoning is quite clear. The Tribunal considered that whatever Argentine law provided would make no difference to the outcome on the issues before the Tribunal: if Argentine law pointed to the same outcome as international law, then it plainly made no difference, and if it pointed to a different outcome then international law prevailed. That reasoning plainly did not convince Argentina but Article 52(1)(e) does not permit annulment on the ground that a tribunal's reasoning appears unconvincing. As the Committee has already explained (see paras. 199 to 200, above), the only question is whether \"the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point\".253\n\n*Vivendi I*, note 70, above, para. 64.\n\n222.\n\nThe Committee cannot discern any basis on which the Tribunal could be said seriously to have departed from any fundamental rule of procedure in respect of this part of its decision.\n\n**4. Discrimination**\n---------------------\n\n223.\n\nArgentina's final challenge under this heading is to the Tribunal's decision on whether or not the Claimants had to prove discrimination in order to establish the existence of a breach of the BIT.\n\n224.\n\nThis challenge is founded upon paragraph 146 of the Jurisdiction Decision, in which the Tribunal stated -\n\nTo establish treaty breaches, Claimants must prove that Respondent's enactment and implementation of the Emergency Measures constituted discriminatory behaviour as defined in the French and Luxembourg investment treaties. The Tribunal would need to examine *inter alia* Respondent's motives and the impact of the Emergency Measures, and whether they constituted an attempt to deprive Claimants of their rights simply because they were foreign investors.\n\n225.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal dismissed the Claimants' claim that the measures taken violated the prohibition of discrimination.254 However, it rejected Argentina's argument that the passage just quoted from the Jurisdiction Decision laid down a general requirement of discriminatory intent as a pre-requisite to recovery under any of the provisions of the BIT. It is worth quoting the entire passage in the Award in which this issue was addressed. The Tribunal quoted paragraph 146 of the Jurisdiction Decision (set out above) and continued -\n\n916. When read in context, the quoted language does not require discrimination as a necessary pre-requisite to recovery. Rather, the relevant language addressed Respondent's jurisdictional objection pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n917. In that connection, the Tribunal had to consider whether Claimants had demonstrated *prima facie* that the present dispute bore a direct relationship to their investments. Decision on Jurisdiction of August 5, 2008, at paragraph 142.\n\n918. In finding that such a relationship existed, and for that purpose alone, the Tribunal noted Claimants' allegation about a pattern of discriminatory conduct.\n\n919. The Tribunal went on to say that the Respondent would be given an opportunity to test such contentions, with Claimants bearing the burden of proving the alleged discrimination.\n\n920. The Tribunal laid down no general requirement of discrimination as a basis for liability under relevant treaty provisions, but simply stated that any allegations of treaty breach based on discrimination would need to be proven by Claimants.\n\nAward, paras. 1101-1107.\n\n226.\n\nThe Committee considers that the conclusion reached by the Tribunal is entirely compatible with the terms of the BIT and with the relevant parts of the Jurisdiction Decision. It thus entailed no manifest excess of powers. The reasoning is clear and enables the reader to understand what the Tribunal decided, so that there is no annullable failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. Nor can the Tribunal see anything which might suggest a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n227.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee dismisses the application for annulment of the Award on the grounds discussed in this section of the Decision.\n\n**VI. Derivative Rights and Umbrella Clause Issues**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. The Relevant Treaty Provisions***\n---------------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nThis part of the case turns on the decision of the Tribunal that, by virtue of the MFN Clause in Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT, the Claimants could rely upon the umbrella clauses in the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT and the Argentina-Germany BIT. It then held that Argentina had violated its obligation to respect the commitments referred to in those umbrella clauses. Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT provides in relevant part -\n\nWithin its territory and in its maritime zone, each Contracting Party shall provide to the investors of the other Party, with respect to their investments and activities associated with such investments, a treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or the treatment accorded to investors of the most favoured Nation if the latter is more advantageous....\n\nThere is no suggestion that this English version is not a satisfactory translation of the authentic French and Spanish texts.\n\n229.\n\nThe umbrella clause in the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT (Article 10(2)) reads as follows -\n\nEach of the Contracting Parties shall respect at all times the commitments it has undertaken with respect to investors of the other Party.\n\nThis English translation was the one used throughout the arbitration proceedings. The Claimants referred to it as an agreed translation255 but that was contested by Argentina256 and it seems from the Jurisdiction Decision that it was in fact a translation provided by the Claimants.257 It is true, however, that it was the translation used, apparently without adverse comment, by both Parties throughout the proceedings before the Tribunal and, indeed, a copy of it was included in the bundle of core materials provided to the Committee by Argentina at the hearings on annulment. Nevertheless, during the course of the hearings, Argentina suggested that the translation was not an entirely accurate reflection of the authentic texts. The Spanish text reads -\n\nCada una de las Partes Contratantes respetar\u00e1 en todo momento los compromisos contra\u00eddos con los inversores de la otra Parte Contratante.\n\nAccording to Argentina, a more accurate translation would be -\n\nEach Contracting Party shall respect at all times the commitments entered into with the investors of the other Contracting Party.258\n\nTranscript, p. 328.\n\nTranscript, p. 331.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, p. 21, n. 14.\n\nTranscript, p. 239 and slide 9 from the Respondent's Closing Statement folder.\n\n230.\n\nA similar issue arose with regard to the umbrella clause in the Argentina-Germany BIT (Article 7(2)). The translation used in the proceedings before the Tribunal reads -\n\nEach Contracting Party shall comply with any other commitment undertaken in connection with the investments made by nationals or companies from the other Contracting Party in the former's territory.\n\nThe Spanish text reads -\n\nCada Parte Contratante cumplir\u00e1 cualquier otro compromiso que haya contra\u00eddo con relaci\u00f3n a las inversiones de nacionales o sociedades de la otra Parte Contratante en su territorio.\n\nAccording to Argentina, a more accurate translation would be -\n\nEach Contracting Party shall comply with any other commitment it has entered into in relation to the investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party in the former's territory.259\n\nTranscript, p. 239 and slide 9 from the Respondent's Closing Statement folder.\n\n231.\n\nThe Claimants object to the introduction by Argentina of these new translations during the oral proceedings, especially as they were introduced during the second round of argument.260 The Committee agrees that it is highly unfortunate that, if there was a problem with the translations into English, that point was not raised far earlier in the proceedings. It does not consider, however, that it can prevent Argentina from raising the point now. The Argentina-Luxembourg BIT is authentic in Dutch, French and Spanish, while the Argentina-Germany BIT is authentic in German and Spanish. In each case the translation into English is unofficial. To the extent that the issue is whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, the Committee considers that it cannot disregard a possible difference between the unofficial translation and the authentic texts. It is a different matter when the issue is whether the Tribunal failed to state its reasons. The Committee considers that a tribunal cannot be faulted, so far as the question whether it adequately stated its reasons is concerned, for having used a translation which neither Party had at any time during the proceedings before the Tribunal, suggested might be inaccurate. In the end, for the reasons given below, nothing turns on the differences between the various translations provided.\n\nTranscript, p. 328.\n\n***B. The Issues raised by Argentina and the Decision of the Committee***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nArgentina's challenge under this heading has three different limbs. Since each of these three limbs raises discrete issues, it is more convenient to organize this part of the Decision by addressing each limb in a separate section, rather than reviewing the Parties' arguments on all three points and then proceeding to the analysis of the Committee.\n\n233.\n\nIn respect of each limb, Argentina appears to argue that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, failed to state the reasons for its decision and was guilty of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.261 No particulars are given, however, and no supporting argument advanced in respect of the claim of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Committee therefore dismisses this aspect of Argentina's challenge, although it would add, for the sake of completeness, that it considers that there is nothing in the record which might suggest - let alone establish - a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\nApplication, paras. 23-25.\n\n***a. The MFN Clause and the Umbrella Clauses***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n*(1) Parties' Positions*\n------------------------\n\n234.\n\nArgentina's first argument is that an MFN clause cannot be used to import into the treaty in which it is located a form of protection different from those which are already provided for in that treaty.262 In that respect, it employs an *ejusdem generis* argument and invokes the decision in *Hochtief v. Argentine Republic,*263 in which an ICSID tribunal, called upon to determine the scope of the MFN clause in the Argentina-Germany BIT, observed -\n\n.. it cannot be assumed that Argentina and Germany intended that the MFN clause should create wholly new rights where none otherwise existed under the Argentina-Germany BIT... The MFN clause is not a *renvoi* to a range of totally distinct sources and systems of rights and duties; it is a principle applicable to the exercise of rights and duties that are actually secured by the BIT in which the MFN clause is found.264\n\nApplication, para. 23; Memorial, para. 95; Transcript, pp. 38-40 and 243-246.\n\n*Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31), Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 October 2011 (\"Hochtief\").\n\n*Ibid,* para. 81.\n\n235.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the application of the MFN clause by the Tribunal thus involved a manifest excess of powers. In addition, Argentina complains that the Tribunal never properly stated the reasons for its decision on this point.\n\n236.\n\nThe Claimants counter that this argument is precisely the one that was rejected in the Jurisdiction Decision.265 Whereas *Hochtief* concerned the use of an MFN clause to import an investor-State arbitration provision from another BIT (a matter which has proved very controversial), the Tribunal in the present case used the MFN clause in the Argentina-France BIT to import a substantive standard of protection entirely compatible with those already provided for in the Argentina-France BIT. According to the Claimants, that is precisely what such clauses have always been used to achieve and there is no controversy about the legality of such use. Moreover, the Tribunal explained in detail in its Award the reasoning which led it to its conclusion on the MFN clause.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 87-89; Rejoinder, paras. 55-57; Transcript, pp. 334-335.\n\n*(2) The Decision of the Committee*\n-----------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe Committee considers that the Tribunal's employment of the MFN clause involved no annullable error. The language of the MFN clause, which is quoted in paragraph 228, above, is quite broad enough to embrace the use of an umbrella clause in another BIT. The clause refers to \"treatment\" accorded to investors of the most favoured nation. If German investors in Argentina have the benefit of a treaty provision requiring the Host State to honour commitments undertaken (or entered into) in relation to their investment, then they are being accorded a form of treatment which is not expressly granted to French investors by the Argentina-France BIT. That situation falls squarely within the terms of the MFN clause. Even if Argentina is right in arguing that MFN clauses should be subjected to an *ejusdem generis* limitation - as to which, it is unnecessary for the Committee to comment - the umbrella clause is part of the same *genus* of provisions on substantive protection of investments as the fair and equitable treatment clause and other similar provisions which feature in the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n238.\n\nThe Committee considers that *Hochtief* dealt with an entirely different issue, namely whether an MFN clause can be employed so as to give the investor claiming under one BIT the benefit of a more generous arbitration provision in another BIT. That issue has divided tribunals with roughly equal numbers of decisions upholding and rejecting the application of the MFN clause to an arbitration provision.266 The present case, however, concerns the use of an MFN clause to take advantage of a provision on substantive treatment. On that question, there has been a far greater degree of unanimity. It is true that the comment in *Hochtief* quoted above (see paragraph 234, above) is cast in broader terms but it has to be seen in the context of the issue actually confronting the tribunal in that case. Moreover, as the Committee has already stated, the obligation to honour commitments undertaken with regard to investments is part of the same *genus* of treatment of investments protected by provisions in the Argentina-France BIT. The Committee thus rejects the argument that there was a manifest excess of powers when the Tribunal applied the MFN provision to allow the Claimants to rely upon the umbrella clauses in other Argentine BITs.\n\nCompare the decisions on this point in *Siemens AG* v. *Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, 3 August 2004, and *Hochtief* with those in *Wintershall AG* v. *Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/14, 8 December 2008, and *Daimler Financial Services* v. *Argentina,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/01, 22 August 2010. All four cases were decided under the Argentina-Germany BIT.\n\n239.\n\nNor was there any failure on the part of the Tribunal to state the reasons for its decision on this point. On the contrary, these are set out in some detail at paragraphs 921 to 937 of the Award.\n\n***b. Derivative Rights***\n--------------------------\n\n*(1) Parties' Positions*\n------------------------\n\n240.\n\nThe second limb of Argentina's argument under this heading is encapsulated in the following passage in the Memorial -\n\nGeneral international law does not allow indirect actions like those exercised by the Claimants in this arbitration and allowed by the Tribunal. To be able to lodge a claim in this respect, Claimants should have been holders of the rights invoked.267\n\nMemorial, para. 70. See also Reply, para. 61.\n\n241.\n\nArgentina maintains that this principle is based upon the decisions of the International Court of Justice in *Barcelona Traction*,268*ELSI*,269 and *Diallo*.270 According to Argentina, these cases, reflecting the position under municipal law, draw a sharp distinction between the shareholder and the company and should have been applied by the Tribunal to preclude the Claimants from claiming for wrongs allegedly done to EDEMSA.\n\n*Barcelona Traction*, note 12, above.\n\n*ELSI*, note 13, above.\n\n*Diallo*, note 14, above.\n\n242.\n\nIn addition, Argentina contends that the approach adopted by the Tribunal had the effect of rendering otiose the final clause of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that -\n\n\"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n\u2026\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and *any juridical person* *which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be* *treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.* (Emphasis added)\n\nAccording to Argentina, this provision was inserted in the Convention precisely because the general rule was that shareholders cannot claim for wrongs done to the company and a means had therefore to be found to enable a company incorporated in the respondent State to claim in its own right.\n\n243.\n\nTo allow shareholders to claim, according to Argentina, carries the risk of double recovery for the same wrong. Argentina accuses the Tribunal of having failed to recognize this risk in its Award. It also maintains that the Tribunal's reasoning is contradictory in that \"the Tribunal firstly mixed up and then separated EDEMSA and its shareholders in a particularly arbitrary way\".271 In particular, it complains that the Tribunal ignored the increase in tariffs permitted to EDEMSA in 2005 on the ground that the Claimants had already divested themselves of their interests in the company by then.272\n\nMemorial, para. 74.\n\nMemorial, para. 75.\n\n244.\n\nArgentina maintains that, by allowing the Claimants to claim for wrongs allegedly done to EDEMSA rather than to themselves, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers and also failed to state its reasons for so doing.\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the Tribunal correctly dismissed Argentina's argument on this point in its Jurisdiction Decision.273 According to them, the decisions of the International Court of Justice were concerned with the right of a State to diplomatic protection of nationals and not the right of investors to bring claims on their own behalf pursuant to provisions in a BIT. The provisions of the Argentine-France BIT define \"investor\" and \"investment\" in sufficiently broad terms that investors such as the Claimants were empowered to bring claims in respect of their investments notwithstanding the existence of a local company as the vehicle for that investment. Moreover, the Claimants maintain that it was Argentina which had insisted that the Concession could be held only through the medium of a locally-incorporated company.274\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 109-111.\n\nTranscript, p. 210.\n\n246.\n\nThe Claimants also reject the suggestion that the Tribunal ignored the measures adopted to EDEMSA's benefit after the Claimants had divested themselves of their interests. On the contrary, they assert that the Tribunal rejected the Claimants' argument that it should disregard events after that date and insisted on reducing the amount of damages payable as a result.275\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 112-116.\n\n247.\n\nThe Claimants thus deny that there was any manifest excess of powers and contend that the Tribunal adequately stated the reasons for its decision.\n\n*(2) The Decision of the Committee*\n-----------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nThe Tribunal rightly considered that whether or not the Claimants could maintain a claim in respect of measures which directly affected EDEMSA is a matter governed by the terms of the ICSID Convention and the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n249.\n\nWithin the Convention, the governing provision is Article 25, the relevant part of which provides that -\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\n\u2026\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\n250.\n\nIt is not contested that all of the Claimants are juridical persons which, on the relevant date, had the nationality of a Contracting State other than Argentina. It is also uncontested that EDEMSA was an Argentine juridical person and that there was no agreement of the kind mentioned in the final clause of Article 25(2)(b) which would have enabled EDEMSA to be a party to the proceedings. Finally, the Committee recalls that, in its Jurisdiction Decision, the Tribunal held that Article 25 required that \"the dispute must arise directly from an investment but the investment itself need not be direct\".276 That is plainly a correct reading of the language of the provision.\n\nJurisdiction Decision, para. 159.\n\n251.\n\nThe Committee does not agree that the Tribunal's approach rendered the final clause of Article 25(2) redundant. That clause deals with the situations in which a company, such as EDEMSA, incorporated in the respondent State can maintain a claim under the Convention. To hold, as the Tribunal did, that the investors who ultimately controlled EDEMSA can claim in their own right for a breach of treaty allegedly committed against EDEMSA is not at all the same as allowing EDEMSA itself to claim. For example, had there been an agreement of the kind envisaged in the final clause of Article 25(2), EDEMSA could have maintained a claim for breach of contract, something which the Claimants were unable to do.\n\n252.\n\nThe Committee thus concludes that the Tribunal committed no manifest excess of powers in ruling that the requirements of Article 25 of the Convention were satisfied.\n\n253.\n\nArticle 8(1) of the BIT provides that the dispute settlement provisions in Article 8 apply to \"any dispute concerning investments in the terms of this Agreement between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party\". The \"terms of this Agreement\" which govern the meaning of \"investments\" are those of Article 1(1), which provides -\n\nThe term \"investments\" means the assets such as goods, rights, and interests of any nature, including but not limited to:\n\n(a) movable and immovable property and any property rights such as mortgages, privileges, usufructs, bonds, and analogous rights;\n\n(b) shares, issue premiums, and other forms of participation, even minority or indirect participation, in companies established in the territory of one of the Contracting States;\n\n(c) debentures, claims, and rights to any performance under contract having a financial value;\n\n(d) copyrights, industrial property rights (such as invention patents, licenses, registered trademarks, industrial models and designs), technical processes, registered names and goodwill;\n\n(e) concessions granted by law or under contract, in particular concessions to search for, cultivate, extract, or exploit natural resources, including those located in the maritime zone of the Contracting Parties.\n\nWith the understanding that such assets must be or must have been invested and, in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, the associated rights defined in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party in whose territory or maritime zone the investment was made before or after the entry into force of this Agreement.\n\n254.\n\nThe term \"investors\" is defined by Article 1(2), the relevant part of which provides that -\n\nThe term \"investors\" means:\n\n(b) artificial persons constituted in the territory of either of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its legislation and having their seat in that country;\n\n(c) artificial persons effectively controlled directly or indirectly by nationals of either of the Contracting Parties or by artificial persons having their seat in the territory of either of the Contracting Parties and constituted in accordance with its legislation.\n\n255.\n\nThe Committee considers it plain that this language is broad enough to include a claim maintained by the Claimants in respect of damage allegedly caused to their investment, held through SODEMSA (and in one case through MENDINVERT and SODEMSA) in EDEMSA.\n\n256.\n\nThe Committee does not consider that the line of decisions in the International Court of Justice, beginning with *Barcelona Traction*, lays down a general principle of international law which precludes investors like the Claimants from maintaining a claim under the terms of a BIT if those terms are wide enough to permit them to do so. The International Court of Justice was not dealing in those cases with claims brought by shareholders under the terms of a BIT but with the exercise of diplomatic protection by a State which asserts that a wrong has been done to the State itself through the treatment of its national. That these cases are not addressing the situation of investors claiming under a BIT is made clear in the following passage from the 2007 Judgment in *Diallo -*\n\nThe Court is bound to note that, in contemporary international law, the protection of the rights of companies and the rights of their shareholders, and the settlement of the associated disputes, are essentially governed by bilateral or multilateral agreements for the protection of foreign investments, such as treaties for the promotion and protection of foreign investments, and the Washington Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes, which created an International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), and also by contracts between States and foreign investors. In that context, the role of diplomatic protection somewhat faded, as in practice recourse is only made to it in rare cases where treaty r\u00e9gimes do not exist or have proved inoperative. It is in this particular and relatively limited context that the question of protection by substitution might be raised. The theory of protection by substitution seeks indeed to offer protection to the foreign shareholders of a company who could not rely on the benefit of an international treaty and to whom no other remedy is available, the allegedly unlawful acts having been committed against the company by the State of its nationality. Protection by \"substitution\" would therefore appear to constitute the very last resort for the protection of foreign investments.277\n\nThe *Barcelona Traction* and *Diallo* judgments establish that there is no right *under customary international law* for a State to exercise diplomatic protection in respect of a wrong done to a company on the basis that the shareholders of the company are its nationals. They in no way preclude the possibility that States may agree by treaty to grant such a right to a State (as the Court found was the case in *ELSI*) or to the shareholders themselves. Whether they are considered to have done so will depend upon the terms of the treaty, which in this case are clear.\n\n*I.C.J. Reports 2007*, pp. 614-615, para. 88.\n\n257.\n\nThe Committee notes that the consistent practice of other tribunals and *ad hoc* committees has been the same in this respect as the approach taken by the Tribunal in the present case. Thus, the *ad hoc* committee in *CMS* held that -\n\n... nothing in general international law prohibits the conclusion of treaties allowing \"claims by shareholders independently from those of the corporation concerned... even if those shareholders are minority or non-controlling shareholders\". Such treaties and in particular the ICSID Convention must be applied as *lex specialis*.278\n\nA similar approach can be found in the other cases which have considered this issue.279\n\n*CMS*, note 218, above, para. 69 (quoting the Jurisdiction Decision in that case).\n\nSee, e.g., *Azurix Corporation v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12) Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 December 2003, paras. 64-65; *El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case NO. ARB 03/15), Decision on Jurisdiction of 27 April 2006, para. 138; *Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8), Decision on Jurisdiction of 3 August 2004; *Hochtief*, Decision on Liability of 29 December 2014, paras. 172.\n\n258.\n\nThe Committee understands the concern voiced by Argentina that claims by shareholders for wrongs done to the company might lead to double recovery. However, that risk is one against which any competent tribunal will be on its guard. The Tribunal in the present case was clearly aware of this risk and took steps to guard against it. Thus, it carefully discusses double recovery in paragraphs 1098-1100 and 1137-1143. There is no indication in the Award or in the pleadings before the Committee that there has been any double recovery.\n\n259.\n\nThus, the Committee concludes that there has been no manifest excess of power in this aspect of the Tribunal's decision.\n\n260.\n\nThe Committee also considers that the Tribunal has satisfied the requirements of the Convention to state the reasons for its decision. Those reasons are carefully set out at paragraphs 164-176 of the Jurisdiction Decision and are reflected in the Award. The Committee does not agree that the Tribunal's reasoning on this point is in any respect contradictory. It notes Argentina's argument that there is a contradiction between paragraphs 930 and 939 of the Award. Paragraph 930 states -\n\nIn this connection, it is necessary to reject Respondent's argument based on the forum selection clause in Article 40 of the Concession Agreement. Claimants were not party to that Concession. Their claim rests on breach of investment treaties, which as such clearly fall within the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\nParagraph 939 states -\n\nConcession agreements granted to foreign investors for specific investments, such as those at issue in this arbitration, fall within the protection of an umbrella clause.\n\n261.\n\nArgentina contends that the latter paragraph suggests, contrary to the reasoning of the earlier one, that the Claimants were themselves parties to the Concession Agreement. The Committee does not agree. Read in context, paragraph 939 of the Award is describing what the Tribunal considered to be the underlying economic reality, namely that the Claimants had invested in the Concession (in this respect, see also paras. 174-175 of the Jurisdiction decision, quoted in para. 28, above). It was not dealing with the issue of who was party to the contract in the strict sense. The Committee notices that Argentina itself sometimes used terms in a similarly general way. Thus, in its Counter-Memorial in the proceedings before the Tribunal, Argentina referred to \"the year when SODEMSA was awarded the concession\",280 whereas it was EDEMSA, not SODEMSA, which was party to the Concession Agreement.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, para. 179, quoted in the Award at para. 958.\n\n262.\n\nThe Committee thus dismisses Argentina's claim to annul the Award on this ground.\n\n***c. Privity of Contract***\n----------------------------\n\n*(1) Parties' Positions*\n------------------------\n\n263.\n\nLastly, Argentina argues that even if the umbrella clauses could be incorporated into the Argentina-France BIT, they would not alter the nature of the commitments undertaken (or entered into) in the Concession Agreement which were obligations undertaken by the Province of Mendoza to EDEMSA and not to the Claimants. According to Argentina, the application of an umbrella clause does not alter the requirement of privity of contract.281\n\nApplication, paras. 23-25; Memorial, paras. 72-91; Reply, paras. 43-70.\n\n264.\n\nArgentina's main argument in this respect is that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its decision.282 It relies heavily on the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *CMS* in which similar issues were raised regarding the effect of the umbrella clause in the Argentina-USA BIT. The *CMS* Committee stated that -\n\nThe effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation which is relied on into something else; the content of the obligation is unaffected as is its proper law. If this is so, it would appear that the *parties* to the obligation (*i.e.* the persons bound by it and entitled to rely on it) are likewise not changed by reason of the umbrella clause.283\n\nIt considered that the tribunal in that case had failed properly to grapple with that issue, so that \"in the end it is quite unclear how the Tribunal arrived at its conclusion that CMS could enforce the obligations of Argentina to TGN\"284 with the result that there existed \"a significant lacuna in the Award, which makes it impossible for the reader to follow the reasoning on this point.\"285\n\nTranscript, p. 236.\n\n*CMS*, note 218, above, para. 95(c).\n\n*CMS*, note 218, above, para. 96.\n\n*CMS,* note 218, above, para. 97.\n\n265.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the same failure is discernible in the Award in the present case. Argentina argues that the Tribunal confused the question of whether the obligations in question arose under the Concession Agreement or under the BIT. Argentina emphasised that it was \"not questioning the nature of the claims put forward but the person that has put them forward, *i.e.* EDF instead of EDEMSA\".286 It invokes two other cases in which tribunals faced with what it describes as umbrella clauses in effectively similar terms to those in the BITs at issue in the present case, held that an umbrella clause did not give a claimant the right to enforce, as treaty obligations, obligations contained in contracts to which that claimant was not party.287 It questioned why the Award in the present case made no reference to the first of those cases.288 Finally, Argentina contended that \"the Argentine Republic did not undertake any obligation whatsoever vis-\u00e0-vis the Claimants\".289\n\nReply, para. 58.\n\nSee Memorial, para. 88, and Transcript pp. 29-30, citing *Azurix Corporation v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12) Award of 14 July 2006, 14 ICSID Reports 374, para. 384, and *Burlington v. Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/05), Decision on Liability of 24 December 2012. Argentina also referred to the award in *Hamester v. Ghana* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24) Award of 18 June 2010, though without close analysis of the umbrella clause at issue in that case.\n\nTranscript, p. 31, referring to the *Azurix* award; the decision in *Burlington* did not appear until after the Award in the present case.\n\nMemorial, para. 87.\n\n266.\n\nAlthough Argentina's main argument concerned the alleged failure of the Tribunal to state the reasons for its decision, it also maintained that the Tribunal's decision to apply the umbrella clauses in the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT and the Argentina-Germany BIT so as to allow the Claimants to enforce against Argentina obligations to which they were not party involved a manifest excess of powers.\n\n267.\n\nThe Claimants deny that there was either a failure to state reasons or a manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal.290 They point, first, to what they maintain are significant differences between the umbrella clauses at issue in the present case and those in *CMS*, *Azurix* and *Burlington,* in particular, the fact that the umbrella clauses in the present case speak of commitments \"undertaken\", whereas those in the other cases use the phrase \"entered into\".291 They also refer to the award in *Continental Casualty*292as taking a different view of the scope of umbrella clauses, although the claim for a breach of the umbrella clause in that case was unsuccessful.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 78-117; Rejoinder, paras. 47-67; Transcript, pp. 206-210 and 327-335.\n\nTranscript, pp. 206-7.\n\n*Continental Casualty,* note 5, above, paras. 286-303.\n\n268.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the Tribunal set out the reasons which led it to its decision on the scope of the umbrella clause, adopting the reasoning of Professor Dolzer, who appeared as an expert witness for the Claimants, that the application of the clause was not dependent upon privity of contract. They contend that Argentina expressly argued the *CMS* point before the Tribunal which took full account thereof. With regard to the failure to cite the *Azurix* award, the Claimants emphasise that the duty to state reasons does not entail the requirement to refer expressly to every authority cited by the parties.\n\n*(2) The Decision of the Committee*\n-----------------------------------\n\n269.\n\nThe Committee considers that it should begin its consideration of this issue by addressing the Parties' submissions regarding the texts of the different umbrella clauses at issue in the present case and in the cases of *CMS, Azurix* and *Burlington*. In *CMS* and *Azurix*, the umbrella clause was that contained in the Argentina-USA BIT. In *Burlington* it was the umbrella clause in the Ecuador-USA BIT. In the present case, of course, the umbrella clauses are those found in the Argentina-Luxembourg and Argentina-Germany BITs. Although the Award refers to the English texts of those clauses, that text is not an official one, whereas in the case of the Argentina-USA and Ecuador-USA BITs English was one of the authentic languages of the treaty. By contrast, all four treaties are authentic in Spanish. For that reason, the Committee has already held (see paragraph 231, above) that, notwithstanding the late stage at which Argentina raised this point, it cannot exclude Argentina's argument that the English text referred to in the Award is not an entirely accurate translation.\n\n270.\n\nThe relevant clauses in the BITs at issue in *CMS, Azurix* and *Burlington* are in the same terms-\n\nEach Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\n\n271.\n\nThe Claimants have sought to distinguish those cases by highlighting the fact that the two BITs at issue in the present case use the term \"undertaken\", rather than \"entered into\". The Committee does not attach any weight to this point. The Spanish texts of all four treaties use the same term, \"contraido\" (or \"contraidos\"). No significance can therefore attach to the fact that the unofficial English texts of the Argentina-Luxembourg and Argentina-Germany BITs employ the word \"undertaken\" as a translation. In any event, the Committee does not see a meaningful distinction between \"entered into\" and \"undertaken\" in the context of the issues in this case.\n\n272.\n\nAlthough the point was not discussed in the annulment proceedings in the present case, the Committee also considers that the use of the term \"commitments\", in the two BITs at issue in the present case, as opposed to \"obligations\" (the term used in the BITs at issue in *CMS, Azurix* and *Burlington*) cannot be regarded as significant since, once again, the Spanish texts of all four treaties use the same term, \"compromisos\".\n\n273.\n\nThe Committee has therefore proceeded on the basis that the umbrella clauses in the present case are substantially the same as those in the *CMS, Azurix* and *Burlington* cases.\n\n274.\n\nSince Argentina has relied principally upon Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention, the Committee will begin by considering whether the Tribunal has failed to state the reasons for its decision that Argentina had violated its obligation to \"respect specific commitments undertaken in connection with Claimants' investment\".293\n\nAward, *Dispositif*, para. I(i).\n\n275.\n\nThe Award deals with the reasons which led the Tribunal to its conclusion as follows:-\n\n(1) the Claimants were claiming not for breach of contract but for breach of treaty;294\n\n(2) concession agreements constitute commitments undertaken (or obligations entered into) with respect to the investment;295\n\n(3) not all contractual breaches necessarily rise to the level of treaty breaches but the \"serious repudiation of concessions [sic] obligations implicated by failure to respect the currency clause... must clearly be seen as a violation of \u2018commitments... undertaken with respect to investors' (Article 10(2) Argentina-Luxembourg BIT) and \"a commitment undertaken in connection with the investments made by nationals or companies from the other Contracting Party\" (Article 7(2) Argentina-Luxembourg BIT);296\n\n(4) the Concession was carefully constructed so that the risk of currency fluctuation, in the sense of an end to the parity exchange rate and convertibility, was placed upon the Province and not the investors;297\n\n(5) the acts of which complaint was made were sovereign acts rather than acts carried out by Mendoza in the capacity of a party to the Concession Agreement;298\n\n(6) the Concession Agreement, though concluded with EDEMSA was clearly adopted with the shareholders in mind. Article 12 of the Agreement prohibited the transfer of shares without prior consent for a fixed period;299\n\n(7) the principal guarantees in the Concession Agreement were specifically employed in order to attract the Claimants as investors. As the Tribunal put it-\n\nThe Province of Mendoza had clearly embarked on a campaign to attract foreign investors in purchasing 51% of EDEMSA \"Class A\" shares.... Key features of the sales pitch included (i) the creation of a regulatory agency; (ii) the Currency Clause; (iii) the Cost Adjustment Clause; (iv) the Extraordinary Tariff Adjustment Clause; (v) an initial tariff schedule with a fixed term of five years; (vi) a concession with a duration of thirty years.300\n\nAward, para. 930.\n\nAward, para. 939.\n\nAward, para. 940.\n\nAward, paras. 943-969.\n\nAward, para. 941.\n\nAward, para. 942.\n\nAward, para. 1008.\n\n276.\n\nTaken together, these parts of the Award seem to the Committee to state the reasons for the Tribunal's conclusion in a way which enables the reader to follow the reasoning and thus sets the Award apart from the award in *CMS.* In particular, the Award highlights the extent to which the Province of Mendoza, whose acts are - for the purposes of international law -attributable to the Argentine Republic, went out of its way to make commitments to the Claimants as prospective foreign investors that the Concession regime would be a financially stable one.301\n\nIn addition to Award, para. 1008, see paras. 63-66.\n\n277.\n\nThe broad language of the umbrella clauses, particularly that in the Argentina-Germany BIT, which spoke of commitments undertaken (or entered into) with regard to *investments*, rather than with *investors*, was also emphasised.302\n\nAward, para. 938.\n\n278.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Committee cannot conclude that the Award is one in which, to borrow the language of the *CMS* Committee, \"it is quite unclear how the Tribunal arrived at its conclusion\". That conclusion is not altered by the fact that the Award does not expressly distinguish the *Azurix* award or the *CMS* decision. As the Committee has already explained (see paragraphs 194 to 198, above), it is not necessary for an award to address every authority cited to it in order to comply with the requirement to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n279.\n\nNor does the Committee consider that there was a manifest excess of powers. It is true that the reasoning of the Award on this point is somewhat different from that in *CMS, Azurix*, and *Burlington*. However, each of these cases has to be assessed in the light of its own facts. Moreover, the Award is similar in its reasoning to the statements made by the tribunal in *Continental Casualty*, although the tribunal there came to a different conclusion on the facts. The most that can be said is that an opposite approach to that adopted is also arguable and that is not enough to warrant annulment on the grounds of manifest excess of powers.\n\n280.\n\nThe Committee thus dismisses this part of Argentina's application for annulment. For the sake of completeness, it would add that, had it taken a different view, it would have annulled only the first part of paragraph I of the *dispositif* and not, as Argentina urges, the whole Award. Argentina points to the passage at the start of that part of the Award in which the Tribunal states that \"[Argentina's] breach of certain obligations under the applicable umbrella clause operates in tandem with breach of Article 3 of the Argentine-France BIT, providing a duty to accord Fair and Equitable Treatment\".303 Argentina argues that this passage shows that the finding of a breach of the duty to accord fair and equitable treatment is dependent upon, and inseparable from, the finding of a breach of the umbrella clauses. The Committee does not read it that way. Rather, the Committee considers that this passage, together with the section on fair and equitable treatment which follows, demonstrates that the inducements offered to investors - and specifically to the Claimants - to invest in EDEMSA were one of the reasons why the Tribunal considered that there had been a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. Even if the stricter approach to umbrella clauses espoused in some other cases had been adopted, the Committee considers that the significance of these inducements and the expectations which they engendered, would have remained valid, as the *CMS* Committee recognized.304 Since the award of damages in paragraph II of the *dispositif* would be sustained by a finding of breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation without any finding of a breach of the umbrella clauses, even if the Committee had upheld Argentina's case on the umbrella clauses, there would have been no basis to annul the whole of the Award.\n\nAward, para. 994.\n\n*CMS*, note 218, above, para. 89.\n\n**VII. Necessity Issue**\n------------------------\n\n***A. The Issues Raised by Argentina***\n---------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe next argument raised by Argentina concerns the Tribunal's treatment of three \"affirmative defences\" advanced by Argentina, each of which concerned the effects of the economic emergency which arose in Argentina and to which the Committee has already referred.305 Argentina complains of:-\n\n(1) the Tribunal's failure to apply Article 3(2) of the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT306 which the Tribunal acknowledged \"might have had consequences\"307 had the Tribunal found the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT applicable;\n\n(2) the Tribunal's failure to apply Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT,308 which Argentina maintains afforded it a defence; and\n\n(3) the Tribunal's handling of Argentina's defence based upon customary international law principles regarding the state of necessity.\n\nSee paras. 39-41, above.\n\nArticle 3(2) provides:  \n \"Without prejudice to measures necessary to maintain public order, investments shall enjoy permanent protection and security, to the exclusion of any unjustified or discriminatory measure that could impede in fact or in law its management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or liquidation.\" (Unofficial translation into English provided by Argentina).\n\nAward, para. 888.\n\nSee para. 283, below.\n\n282.\n\nThe Committee has already held (see paragraphs 201 to 217, above) that the Tribunal committed no annullable error in deciding that the case fell to be determined by reference to the Argentina-France BIT and that the Argentina-Luxembourg BIT was inapplicable. It is not, therefore, necessary to address in this part of the Decision the first point raised by Argentina. Accordingly, the Committee will here confine itself to the second and third points set out in the preceding paragraph.\n\n***B. Parties' Arguments***\n---------------------------\n\n**1. Argentina**\n----------------\n\n283.\n\nAccording to Argentina, because the measures which were the subject of the Claimants' main case were taken in response to the national emergency which confronted Argentina, the Tribunal should have applied Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT, the English translation of which provides:\n\nInvestors of one Contracting Party whose investments have suffered losses owing to war or any other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, or rebellion occurring in the territory or in the maritime zone of the other Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party treatment no less favourable than that granted to its own investors or to those of the most favoured Nation.\n\nAlthough there appears to be no ground for criticism of this translation, the importance of the provision makes it useful also to quote the official French and Spanish texts of Article 5(3), which provide:\n\nLes investisseurs de l'une des Parties contractantes dont les investissements auront subi des pertes dues \u00e0 la guerre ou \u00e0 tout autre conflit arm\u00e9, r\u00e9volution, \u00e9tat d'urgence nationale ou r\u00e9volte survenu sur le territoire ou dans la zone maritime de l'autre Partie contractante, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient, de la parte de cette derni\u00e8re, d'un traitement non moins favourable que celui accord\u00e9 \u00e0 ses propres investisseurs ou \u00e0 ceux de la nation la plus favoris\u00e9e.\n\nand\n\nLos inversores de una Parte Contratante cuyas inversiones hubiesen sufrido p\u00e9rdidas a causa de una guerra o de cualquier otro conflicto armado, revoluci\u00f3n, estado de emergencia nacional o rebeli\u00f3n ocurrido en el territorio o en la zona mar\u00edtima de la otra Parte Contratante, recibir\u00e1n de esta \u00faltima un tratamiento no menos favorable que el acordado a sus propios inversores o a los de la Naci\u00f3n m\u00e1s favorable.\n\n284.\n\nArgentina maintains that the situation which it faced was a \"national emergency\" (\"estado de emergencia nacional\") within the meaning of this provision and that, consequently, in taking measures to address that emergency, Argentina's only obligation to the Claimants was one of non-discrimination.309 In other words, the effect of Article 5(3) was that measures taken to address a national emergency were not subject to the obligations of fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security and the prohibition of expropriation set out in Article 5(1) and (2), or to any obligation arising out of an umbrella clause in another BIT which might have been given effect by virtue of Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT. That was the analysis arrived at in respect of a provision substantially identical to Article 5(3) by the tribunal in *L.E.S.I. S.p.A. and Astaldi S.p.A. v. Algeria.*310 The Tribunal, however, rejected Argentina's argument, holding that -\n\nThe plain language of Article 5(3) makes clear that it serves as a nondiscrimination provision, not a shield against host State liability for treaty violation.311\n\nMemorial, paras. 162-163.\n\n*L.E.S.I. S.p.A. and Astaldi S.p.A. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/03), Award of 12 November 2008 (\" *L.E.S.I*.\").\n\nAward, para. 1157.\n\n285.\n\nArgentina maintains that this decision renders Article 5(3) superfluous, because the Claimants were already entitled to non-discrimination by virtue of the provisions of Article 4 of the BIT.312 Argentina maintains that it had put that argument to the Tribunal, which had failed to address it in the Award. The Tribunal had failed to explain why Article 5(3) was not applicable and had not dealt with the authorities relied upon by Argentina.313 Moreover, the Tribunal had contradicted itself by saying that, while Article 5(3) did not operate to exempt Argentina from liability in respect of non-discriminatory measures taken to address the national emergency, that provision nevertheless had to be understood against the background of customary international law rules on State responsibility in times of war or national emergency,314 even though the Claimants' own expert315 had accepted that those rules provided for a degree of exemption from liability.316\n\nReply, para. 114.\n\nIn particular, the award in *L.E.S.I*., note 310, above; see Memorial, para. 165.\n\nAward, para. 1158.\n\nProfessor Dolzer, whose first report is exhibit RA 543.\n\nMemorial, para. 168; Transcript, p. 94.\n\n286.\n\nFurthermore, Argentina maintains that the Tribunal distorted its argument by saying that Argentina had likened Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT to Article XI of the Argentina-USA BIT.317 Article XI provides that:\n\nThis Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfilment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the Protection of its own essential security interests.\n\nThis provision was at the heart of the awards in *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*318 and *LG&E v. Argentine Republic,*319 in which tribunals assessing Argentina's emergency measures against the yardstick of the Argentina-USA BIT held that Argentina was relieved of its liability in respect of those measures by virtue of the provisions of Article XI. The Tribunal in the present case held that \"the substance of Article 5(3) bears no resemblance to Article XI of the Argentina-US BIT\".320 Argentina maintains, however, that it did not argue that Article 5(3) and Article XI were analogous but referred to the *Continental Casualty* and *LG&E* awards in order to draw similarities with the factual assumptions analysed in those cases.321\n\nSee, e.g., Award, para 1155.\n\n*Continental Casualty,* note 5, above.\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Decision on Liability of 3 October 2006 (\" *LG&E* \").\n\nAward, para. 1161.\n\nReply, para. 116.\n\n287.\n\nArgentina similarly criticises the Tribunal's approach to necessity under customary international law. The Tribunal held that customary international law recognized the state of necessity as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness. In applying this aspect of customary international law, it relied upon Article 25 of the International Law Commission (\"ILC\") Articles on State Responsibility. Article 25 provides:\n\n(1) Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:\n\n(a) is the only means for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and\n\n(b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.\n\n(2) In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:\n\n(a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or\n\n(b) the State has contributed to the situation of necessity.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that the question how far the provisions of Article 25 codified customary international law was a subject of debate322 but considered it did not need to enter into that debate, because\n\n... both sides in this arbitration stipulate that the Tribunal's analysis should take as applicable legal norms the State of Necessity defense presented by the contours articulated in ILC Article 25. Neither side has argued for application of a standard more favorable to host states than the norms of Article 25.323\n\nAward, para. 1167.\n\nAward, para. 1168.\n\n288.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded that Argentina's conduct fell outside the scope of the defence of necessity on three grounds, First, it was \"not convinced that those measures, as presented and explained in these proceedings, were the only means by which [Argentina] could have protected its public interests\".324 Secondly, and \"equally as important\" according to the Tribunal, it had \"difficulty finding that [Argentina] did not contribute to the situation which produced the 2001 crisis\".325 Lastly, the Tribunal considered that even if Argentina's conduct could have been justified under the state of necessity, Argentina was nevertheless obliged to return to the *status quo* once that became possible and that Argentina had failed to do so.326\n\nAward, para. 1172.\n\nAward, para. 1173.\n\nAward, para. 1177.\n\n289.\n\nArgentina maintains that the Tribunal distorted its position. While Argentina had referred to Article 25, it denies it had accepted that Article 25 codified the customary international law on the state of necessity. The Tribunal had therefore not been justified in proceeding to deal with Argentina's customary international law defence on the basis of Article 25 without explaining why that provision was authoritative, or in applying its provisions as though it was a treaty.327\n\nMemorial, paras. 170-176; Reply, paras. 120-122.\n\n290.\n\nArgentina also criticises the Tribunal's application of the necessity standard. Invoking the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Enron v. Argentine Republic*,328 Argentina maintains that the Tribunal failed to identify the legal standard to be applied in order to determine whether the emergency measures were the \"only means\" by which Argentina could safeguard its essential interests, failed to evaluate the evidence submitted by Argentina and failed to state reasons for its decisions. In particular, it did not set out the alternative measures which it considers could have been adopted.329 With regard to the requirement of \"noncontribution\", Argentina again argues that the Tribunal failed to identify the legal standard to be applied and did not properly explain its reasons. It maintains that the Tribunal wrongly considered, on the basis of an expert report tendered by Argentina, that Argentina had accepted that it was partly to blame for the crisis and should not have placed so much weight on a statement by the then President of Argentina in early 2002, regarding which counsel for Argentina referred to \"the relatively low weight that politicians' words have\".330\n\n*Enron*, note 217, above.\n\nTranscript, pp. 96-97; Memorial, paras. 177-178.\n\nTranscript, p. 98; Memorial, paras. 177-179; Reply, paras. 123-124.\n\n291.\n\nLastly, Argentina maintains that the Tribunal invented a new exception to the defence of necessity, over and above those in Article 25, when it held that even if there had been a state of necessity, Argentina was under a duty to re-establish the *status quo*, once the emergency had passed.331\n\nMemorial, paras. 175-176; Reply, para. 121.\n\n292.\n\nIn summary, with regard to both Article 5(3) and customary international law, Argentina contends that \"the Tribunal not only failed to state the reasons for its decision in this respect but manifestly exceeded its powers in failing to consider the laws it was required to apply and distorting the arguments presented by Argentina, thus departing from a fundamental rule of procedure\".332\n\nMemorial, para. 180.\n\n**2. The Claimants**\n--------------------\n\n293.\n\nThe Claimants counter that the Tribunal committed no annullable error in respect of this part of the case. With regard to Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal was right to conclude, after extensive consideration, that Article 5(3) was a non-discrimination provision and not a charter for dispensing with the protections afforded by other provisions of the BIT.333 The Tribunal did not distort Argentina's argument regarding Article 5(3) and Article XI of the Argentina-USA BIT; on the contrary, it accurately recorded Argentina's position that the Tribunal should apply, *mutatis mutandis,* the analysis in the *Continental Casualty* and *LG&E*, awards which had turned on Article XI.334 Argentina had thus been seeking to persuade the Tribunal to give Article 5(3) the same effect that the tribunals in *Continental Casualty* and *LG&E* had accorded to Article XI. The Tribunal had also addressed Argentina's argument that a restrictive interpretation of Article 5(3) would render that provision superfluous given the non-discrimination obligation already inherent in Article 4,335 and rejected it. Lastly, the Claimants contend that, even if this analysis was wrong (which they maintain was not the case), it was not ground for annulment.336\n\nTranscript, p. 217.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 180-181; Rejoinder, paras. 114-119; Transcript, pp. 217-218.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 112-113, citing para. 1157 of the Award.\n\nRejoinder, para. 113.\n\n294.\n\nOn the customary international law of necessity, the Claimants maintain that Argentina had in fact accepted that Article 25 of the ILC Articles reflected customary international law and had submitted arguments regarding each part of the provisions of Article 25.337 The Claimants deny that the Award is not fully reasoned. They contend that the Tribunal was clear about the standard to be applied and held that \"necessity must be construed strictly and objectively, not as an easy escape hatch for host states wishing to avoid treaty obligations which prove difficult\".338 With regard to the *Enron* Committee's decision, they criticise it as containing internal contradictions339 and emphasise that even that decision makes the point that reasons may be implicit.340 According to the Claimants, the Tribunal dealt carefully with the arguments regarding whether the measures adopted by Argentina were the only way of dealing with the crisis and whether Argentina had contributed to the crisis by its own actions. The statement by the President regarding the latter point was only one of the factors taken into account and, in any event, the Committee lacks jurisdiction to re-assess the probative value which the Tribunal accorded to evidence before it.341\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 162-165; Rejoinder, paras. 122-123; Transcript, pp. 218-219.\n\nAward, para. 1171.\n\nTranscript, pp. 219-220.\n\nTranscript, p. 221.\n\nRejoinder, para. 126.\n\n***C. Committee's Decision***\n-----------------------------\n\n**1. The** ***CMS*** **and** ***Enron*** **Decisions**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nThe Committee begins by noting that the issues raised in this part of the case have been the subject of considerable attention from tribunals and *ad hoc* committees in other cases. In particular, the Parties have referred at some length to the decisions of the *ad hoc* committees in *CMS* and *Enron*, both of which concerned the same Argentine crisis. While there is no concept of binding precedent in ICSID jurisprudence, it is important that the Committee takes note of what other committees have said in respect of the issues which it is now required to consider. The Committee will, therefore, begin with a brief analysis of the *CMS* and *Enron* decisions.\n\n296.\n\nThe *CMS* case concerned a claim brought under the Argentina-USA BIT in response to which Argentina raised arguments under Article XI of that treaty and the customary international law of necessity. Those arguments were rejected by the Tribunal and raised again by Argentina in the annulment proceedings in which Argentina alleged that the tribunal had failed to state the reasons for its decision and manifestly exceeded its powers. The *CMS* Committee rejected the application for annulment on those grounds (although it annulled the award in part on a different ground).\n\n297.\n\nThe *CMS* Committee was critical of what it saw as the tribunal's failure properly to analyse the relationship between Article XI of the BIT and the customary international law on necessity. In the view of the Committee, Article XI of the BIT was a threshold requirement in that, if it applied, the substantive obligations under the rest of the BIT were rendered inapplicable. By contrast, Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provided for an excuse which became applicable only once it was established that there had otherwise been a breach of the obligations under the BIT.342 It considered that the tribunal had failed to understand or explain this relationship and had thereby made an error of law.343 Moreover, by treating necessity and Article XI as existing on the same footing it had made a further error, since if necessity meant that there had not even been a *prima facie* breach of the treaty, then it occupied the same field as Article XI, which was *lex specialis* and should have been accorded priority.344 The tribunal's failure to appreciate this relationship also entailed a misinterpretation of Article XI. Nevertheless, while recognizing that these errors \"could have had a decisive impact on the operative part of the Award,\"345 the *CMS* Committee held that it was not empowered to annul the award. It summed up the position in the following terms:\n\nThe Committee recalls, once more, that it has only a limited jurisdiction under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. In the circumstances, the Committee cannot simply substitute its own view of the law and its own appreciation of the facts for those of the Tribunal. Notwithstanding the identified errors and lacunas in the Award, it is the case in the end that the Tribunal applied Article XI of the Treaty. Although applying it cryptically and defectively, it applied it. There is accordingly no manifest excess of powers.346\n\n*CMS*, note 218, above, para. 129.\n\n*CMS*, note 218, above, paras. 131-132.\n\n*CMS*, note 218, above, paras. 133-134.\n\n*CMS*, note 218, above, para. 135.\n\n*CMS*, note 218, above, para. 136.\n\n298.\n\nThe Committee also declined to annul for failure to state reasons. It was critical of the tribunal's brief explanation of why Article XI was considered inapplicable on the facts347 but held that \"although the motivation of the Award could certainly have been clearer, a careful reader can follow the implicit reasoning of the Tribunal\".348\n\n*CMS*, note 218, above, para. 125.\n\n*CMS*, note 218, above, para. 127.\n\n299.\n\nThe *Enron* case likewise concerned a claim brought under the Argentine-US BIT. Again the Tribunal had rejected Argentina's arguments based on Articles IV(3) and XI of that BIT and the customary international law of necessity, and again Argentina sought annulment of the award on the grounds of failure to state reasons and manifest excess of powers. Unlike the *CMS* Committee, however, the *Enron* Committee annulled the award for manifest excess of powers in relation to the findings on Article XI and the customary international law on necessity, as well as for failure to state reasons.349\n\n*Enron,* note 217, above, operative part, paras. 1 and 2.\n\n300.\n\nThe *Enron* Committee began by noting that both Parties had treated Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility as representing the customary international law on necessity and the tribunal had proceeded on that basis. The *Enron* Committee observed that, even if the Committee had taken a different view of the status of Article 25, \"it could not amount to an annullable error for the Tribunal to give an applicable legal rule an interpretation on which both parties were agreed.\"350\n\n*Enron,* note 217, above, para. 356.\n\n301.\n\nThe *Enron* Committee held, however, that the tribunal's application of the Article 25 criteria was flawed in important respects. First, it considered that the tribunal had failed to \"address a number of issues that are essential to the question of whether the \u2018only way' requirement was met\".351 In this context, the *Enron* Committee considered that the requirement that the measures taken be, in the words of Article 25, \"the only means for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril\" was open to more than one interpretation and that the tribunal had failed to identify what legal standard was to be applied, whether the relative effectiveness of different measures was a factor to be taken into account and who was to determine whether or not alternative means had actually been open to the State at the relevant time.352 The Committee concluded that -\n\nIt is not for the Committee in these annulment proceedings to provide answers to these questions. It was however necessary for the Tribunal, either expressly or *sub silentio,* to decide or assume the answers in order to apply the \u2018only way' provision of Article 25(1)(a) to the facts of the case.353\n\nThe *Enron* Committee considered that the tribunal had placed too much reliance on the report of an economic expert whose view could not be said to have been an analysis of whether other means were open to Argentina as a matter of law. The *Enron* Committee accepted that the parties had not identified these issues in their pleadings but nevertheless stated that \"the Tribunal is required to apply the applicable law, and is required to state sufficient reasons for its decision\".354\n\n*Enron,* note 217, above, para. 368.\n\n*Enron,* note 217, above, paras. 370-372.\n\n*Enron,* note 217, above, para. 373.\n\n*Enron,* note 217, above, para. 376.\n\n302.\n\nSecondly, the *Enron* Committee held that the tribunal in that case had failed to make a clear finding on whether or not the measures taken by Argentina had \"seriously impair[ed] an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole\" and had confused this issue with that of nonjusticiability in a different context.355 The Committee held that -\n\nThe Tribunal nowhere states expressly that it finds the requirement in Article 25(1)(b) of the ILC not to be satisfied in this case. The Committee considers it unclear whether the Tribunal ultimately did make such a finding or not. To the extent that the Tribunal did make such a finding, the Committee considers that it is entirely unclear on what basis that finding of law was made.356\n\n*Enron,* note 217, above, paras. 379-384.\n\n*Enron,* note 217, above, para. 384.\n\n303.\n\nLastly, the *Enron* Committee considered that the tribunal's finding that Argentina had contributed to the emergency and was therefore precluded by the principle stated in Article 25(2)(b) from relying on the defence of necessity was flawed. The tribunal had failed to address the question what was the legal standard to apply and had again uncritically adopted the findings of the economic expert witness.357\n\n*Enron,* note 217, above, paras. 385-393.\n\n304.\n\nThe *Enron* Committee thus concluded that the tribunal's finding on necessity under customary international law involved a manifest excess of powers (in the form of a failure to apply the applicable law) and a failure to state reasons. Since that finding by the tribunal also laid the foundations for its finding that Argentina could not rely upon Article XI of the Argentina-USA BIT, the *Enron* Committee also annulled the finding regarding Article XI.358\n\n*Enron,* note 217, above, para. 405.\n\n305.\n\nAs has already been explained, the analysis of these issues by the *CMS* Committee and the *Enron* Committee are not binding upon the Committee in the present case. The Committee has, however, taken them into account in its own examination of the issues raised concerning Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT and necessity under customary international law.\n\n**2. Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nWith the analysis of the *CMS* Committee in mind, the Committee considers that it must begin with the question whether the Tribunal committed an annullable error in its treatment of Argentina's reliance on Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT (the text of which is set out at para. 283, above).\n\n307.\n\nThe Tribunal did not make the mistake for which the *CMS* Committee criticised the tribunal in that case359 of confusing the application of this provision with the question whether the customary international law of necessity was applicable. On the contrary, the Tribunal began by determining whether or not Article 5(3) meant that Argentina was not *prima facie* in breach of treaty360 before considering whether, if there was a *prima facie* breach of treaty, the wrongfulness of the act was precluded by the circumstance of necessity.361\n\nSee para. 297, above.\n\nAward, paras. 1152-1162.\n\nAward, paras. 1163-1181.\n\n308.\n\nThe Tribunal rejected Argentina's proposed interpretation of Article 5(3) as providing that, in the event of an emergency of the kind described in that provision, the host State's only duty towards the investor was one of non-discrimination. It found, instead, that \"the plain language of Article 5(3) makes clear that it serves as a non-discrimination provision, not a shield against host state liability for treaty violation\".362 It determined that Article 5(3) may best be understood against the background of the rules of customary international law on State responsibility toward foreign investors during periods of war, insurrection and other extraordinary circumstances, which determines host State responsibility toward aliens.363\n\nAward, para. 1157.\n\nAward, para. 1158.\n\n309.\n\nContrary to what has been suggested by Argentina, the Committee sees no contradiction between these two paragraphs of the Award. It is important to bear in mind that much of the jurisprudence on customary international law on State responsibility towards aliens during times of war and other emergency was concerned with the obligations of the State to compensate for damage caused by acts which were not attributable to the State itself (e.g., damage done to a foreign investor's property by rioters or insurgents). In general, customary international law did not require compensation in such circumstances.364 The Tribunal's reasoning that \"Article 5(3) leaves those customary rules untouched and indeed supplements their content by requiring equality of treatment in response to such circumstances\"365 is in no way incompatible with its decision that it does not operate as a \"shield against host state liability for treaty violation\"366 by disapplying other substantive protections afforded by the BIT.\n\nSee, e.g., the *Award in the Home Missionary Society of the United Brethren in Christ (United States) v. United Kingdom*, (1920 VI Reports of International Arbitral Awards), p. 42.\n\nAward, para. 1159.\n\nAward, para. 1157.\n\n310.\n\nAs the Tribunal pointed out, the contrast with Article XI of the Argentina-USA BIT (the text of which appears at para. 286, above) is striking. The latter provision expressly states that the other provisions of that treaty \"shall not preclude the application... of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order\". No such language appears in Article 5(3).\n\n311.\n\nTurning to Argentina's contention that the Tribunal distorted its argument regarding Article 5(3), the Committee doubts whether, even if this contention were accepted, such a distortion would amount to a manifest excess of powers, a failure to state reasons or (to the extent that Argentina makes such a case) a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. The Committee does not, however, accept that the Tribunal distorted Argentina's argument. It is true that the Tribunal observed that Argentina \"argues that Article 5(3) is analogous to Article XI\"367 whereas Argentina had denied an allegation by the Claimants that it sought to assimilate the two provisions.368 Nevertheless, the essence of Argentina's argument before the Tribunal was that Article 5(3) had the same effect as Article XI in that, according to Argentina, in the conditions of emergency described therein, Article 5(3) rendered inapplicable the other provisions of the BIT affording investors substantive protections and replaced them with a significantly more limited obligation of non-discrimination.369 In these circumstances, the Tribunal's analysis that Argentina treated Article 5(3) as \"analogous\" to Article XI cannot be regarded as a distortion.\n\nAward, para. 1155.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits (RA 524), para. 641.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits (RA 523), para. 256.\n\n312.\n\nThe Tribunal's interpretation of Article 5(3) is an entirely plausible one. It accords more naturally with the text of the provision than does that advanced by Argentina. The Committee is not persuaded by Argentina's contextual argument, namely that if Article 5(3) were treated as no more than a non-discrimination provision it would be otiose since Article 4 of the Argentina-France BIT requires each Party to provide to investors of the other Party \"treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors\". It is by no means unusual for the parties to a treaty to include, *ex abundante cautela,* a provision which may not be strictly necessary. Indeed, the Argentina-USA BIT includes a provision (Article IV(3))370 which is quite similar to Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT, notwithstanding that it contains not only a general non-discrimination provision but also the more sweeping exclusionary provision of Article XI. The Committee also notes that the *Enron* tribunal (in a part of the award which was not annulled by the *ad hoc* committee in that case) reached a very similar interpretation of the comparable provision in the Argentina-USA BIT.\n\nArticle IV(3) provides -  \n Nationals or companies of either Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded treatment by such Party no less favorable than that accorded to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the more favourable treatment, as regards any measures it adopts in relation to such losses.\n\n313.\n\nThe Committee is aware that the tribunal in *L.E.S.I. S.p.A. and Astaldi S.p.A. v. Algeria*371 took a different view of the scope of a provision substantially identical to Article 5(3) (a fact noted by the Tribunal372). In an annulment proceeding, however, an *ad hoc* Committee is not required to choose between two such different interpretations. The question is not whether the Tribunal was correct in its interpretation of Article 5(3) but whether it applied that provision. In the words of the *Enron* Committee -\n\nIt may well be that different interpretations of this provision are possible. However,... it is not for the Committee to determine whether or not the interpretation given to this provision by the Tribunal was correct or not. Whether it did so correctly or not, the Tribunal applied this provision as part of the applicable law.373\n\n*L.E.S.I.,* note 218, above.\n\nAward, para. 485, footnote 54.\n\n*Enron,* note 217, above, para. 398.\n\n314.\n\nThe Committee thus concludes that the Tribunal's treatment of Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT involved no manifest excess of powers.\n\n315.\n\nNor does the Committee consider that the Tribunal failed to state reasons as required by Article 48(3) and Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. As the Committee has already explained, what is required is that a reader can follow the Tribunal's reasoning, not that he or she must be persuaded by it.374 The reasoning in the Award on the scope and application of Article 5(3) is perfectly comprehensible. The Committee does not accept that the Tribunal committed an annullable error by not referring expressly to Argentina's contextual argument (outlined in paragraph 312 above). As the *Enron* Committee explained, while a tribunal has a duty to deal with each question put to it, \"it is not required to comment on all arguments of the parties in relation to each of those questions\".375 In the present case, the questions which required an answer were: what was the meaning of Article 5(3) and how did it apply to the facts of the present case. The Tribunal answered those questions and stated sufficient reasons for the answers which it gave.\n\nSee paras. 194 to 197, above.\n\n*Enron,* note 217, above, para. 222.\n\n316.\n\nFinally, and for the sake of completeness,376 the Committee observes that it can see no trace of a serious departure on the part of the Tribunal from a fundamental rule of procedure in the Tribunal's handling of the Article 5(3) issue.\n\nIt is not entirely clear whether Argentina intended to raise this issue as a separate ground for annulment under Article 52(1) (d) of the Convention.\n\n**3. Necessity under Customary International Law**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nSince it had held that Article 5(3) of the BIT did not relieve Argentina of liability and that there was a *prima facie* breach of the BIT, it was therefore necessary for the Tribunal to consider Argentina's subsidiary plea377 of necessity under customary international law.\n\nSo termed by Argentina in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (RA 523), para. 620.\n\n318.\n\nIn addressing this plea, the Tribunal applied the provisions of Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (the text of which is set out at paragraph 287, above). It did so, without entering into the \"theoretical question of how far the various aspect of ILC Article 25 codify customary defences related to necessity,\"378 because \"neither side has argued for application of a standard more favorable to host states than the norms of Article 25\".379 As a threshold question, it is necessary to consider whether the Tribunal committed an annullable error in taking this approach, since Argentina had maintained that -\n\nThere is no doubt that the ILC Draft takes from customary law the state of necessity institute. However, international custom does not make such a detailed statement as to the requirements or exceptions of such cause which excludes illegality, as it appears in each of the paragraphs which constitute the ILC articles.380\n\nAward, para. 1167.\n\nAward, para. 1168.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits (RA 523), footnote 679.\n\n319.\n\nThe Committee does not consider that the Tribunal can be faulted for having taken the provisions of ILC Article 25 as its point of reference. It is true that Argentina questioned whether all of the detail of Article 25 reflected customary international law and disputed what it described as the Claimants' propensity to \"refer to each of the paragraphs of Article 25 as though it were the final text of a treaty in full force and effect\".381 At no point, however, did Argentina indicate what aspects of Article 25 it considered did not reflect customary international law. Nor, more importantly, did it at any stage advance a positive case in favour of a standard of necessity materially different from that set out in Article 25. On the contrary, Argentina joined issue with the Claimants on each of the principal requirements of Article 25 and it summed up the differences between the Parties in the following terms:\n\n... the discussion between the Parties as to whether the *state of necessity* can be applied as a principle of customary international law seems to be limited to knowing: (a) whether the measures were necessary; (b) whether the Argentine Republic did not \"substantially\" contribute to cause the crisis; (c) whether those measures were the only suitable means.382\n\nThose are precisely the key issues under Article 25. The Committee therefore concludes that the Tribunal was correct in stating that \"neither side has argued for application of a standard more favorable to host states than the norms of Article 25\" and committed no annullable error in treating Article 25 as a statement of the applicable customary international law.\n\nSee Rejoinder on the Merits (RA 524), para. 629.\n\nComments of the Argentine Republic on Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief (RA 529), para. 146.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal then stated the test it had to apply and its overall conclusions in the following terms:\n\nNecessity must be construed strictly and objectively, not as an easy escape hatch for host states wishing to avoid treaty obligations which prove difficult. In this connection, [Argentina] has failed to meet its burden to demonstrate three key elements of ILC Articles 25 and 27: (i) that the wrongful act was the only way to safeguard Argentina's essential interest under Article 25(1)(a); (ii) that [Argentina] did not contribute to the situation of necessity; and (iii) that [Argentina did not return to the *status quo* when possible, or compensate Claimants for damage suffered as a result of the relevant measures.383\n\nAward, para. 1171.\n\n321.\n\nElaborating upon its reasons, the Tribunal made the following comments:\n\n1172. The Tribunal does not call into question [Argentina's] good faith in asserting that the tariff freeze was enacted to safeguard the country's vital interests, such as protecting of Argentina's indigent population (Respondent's Post Hearing Reply on the Merits at paragraph 148). However, regardless of whether the Emergency Measures related to the concession did much to affect the macro-economic conditions in Argentina, the Tribunal is not convinced that those measures, as presented and explained in these proceedings, were the only means by which [Argentina] could have protected its public interests.\n\n1173. Equally as important, the Tribunal has difficulty finding that [Argentina] did not contribute to the situation which produced the 2001 crisis. Quite significantly, in May 2002 the then President of the Argentine Republic, Mr Eduardo Duhalde, affirmed in *The Washington Post* that, \"[O]*ur crisis is homegrown - made in Argentina, by Argentines\u2019\"*. See Claimants' Post Hearing Brief on Merits at paragraph 167 and Exhibit CL-35. Although external factors may have aggravated the economic turmoil, Argentina's contribution to its economic situation is clear or was far from negligible.\n\n322.\n\nIn paragraphs 1174-1176, the Tribunal discussed further the nature of Argentina's contribution to the emergency, referring to the Argentine Government's continued failure to achieve primary surpluses sufficient to stop an unsustainable debt ratio (para. 1174), the fixed exchange regime, policies which decreased employer contributions to the social security scheme and increases in public spending (para. 1175) and concluding (para. 1176) that -\n\nAlthough it is not for this Tribunal to opine acceptable or unacceptable economic risks as a general matter, the duty to consider the State of Necessity Defense raised by [Argentina] requires the Tribunal to take note of the role played by [Argentina] in bringing about its own economic adversity.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal then turned to the duration of any state of necessity. It held that -\n\n1177. Finally, even if [Argentina's] conduct might be excused under the State of Necessity Defense, [Argentina] remains obligated to return to the prenecessity *status quo* when possible. Moreover, the successful invocation of the necessity defense does not per se preclude payment of compensation to the injured investor for any damage suffered as a result of the necessity measures enacted by the State.\n\n1178. The Tribunal considers that, at some reasonable point in time, [Argentina] should have compensated Claimants for injury suffered as a result of measures enacted during any arguable period of necessity in late December 2001. As mentioned earlier, ILC Draft Article 27 provides that \"[t]he invocation of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness [is without prejudice to] compliance with the obligation in question, if and to the extent that the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer exists\".\n\nThe Tribunal considered that Argentina had failed to restore compliance once it had become possible to do so, as there had been no increase in tariffs until more than three years had elapsed and the Claimants had sold their interests in an attempt to mitigate damages.384\n\nAward, paras. 1179-1180.\n\n324.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal observed that eight other tribunals had rejected Argentina's necessity defence under Article 25 and that the only two tribunals to have upheld a state of necessity defence had done so by invoking Article XI of the Argentina-USA BIT.385\n\nAward, para. 1181.\n\n325.\n\nArgentina attacks this part of the Award as a failure to apply the applicable law, thus entailing a manifest excess of powers, and for a failure to state the reasons on which the Award was based. In doing so, it relies heavily upon the decision of the *Enron* Committee, maintaining that the Tribunal in the present case fell into the same error in respect of its findings on \"only way\" and \"contribution\" that had led to the annulment of the award in *Enron*. Argentina also contends that the Tribunal invented the requirement of restoring the *status quo*.\n\n326.\n\nAt the outset, three points require emphasis. First, the three findings by the Tribunal -namely, that the measures adopted were not the only means by which Argentina might have responded to the crisis, that Argentina had itself contributed to the economic crisis, and that Argentina had failed to take steps to restore the *status quo* or compensate the Claimants once it became possible to do so - have to be considered together. The question before the Tribunal, at this point in the Award, was whether Argentina could successfully rely upon the customary law defence of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of its acts. The Tribunal considered that Argentina could not do so, because it had failed to discharge its burden in relation to each of these three requirements.\n\n327.\n\nSecondly, there can be no doubt that the Tribunal did make clear findings in respect of each of these matters. There is no scope here for the Committee to arrive at the conclusion reached by the *Enron* Committee that it is unclear whether the Tribunal made any finding at all. Nor, again in contrast to the *Enron* case, did the Tribunal simply adopt the evidence of an expert as to economic matters and treat that as conclusive of a legal question.\n\n328.\n\nLastly, it is again important to recall that the standard on annulment is not whether a tribunal applied the applicable law correctly, but whether it applied it at all, and not whether its reasons are persuasive but whether they explain the basis on which the tribunal arrived at its conclusions.\n\n329.\n\nThe Committee considers that there is no doubt that the Tribunal applied the customary international law of necessity. The first two tests which it applied - whether the measures taken by Argentina were the only means to address the crisis and whether Argentina had contributed to its own economic plight - not only feature in Article 25 of the ILC Articles but also in all contemporary discussion of necessity and were expressly identified by Argentina (as well as the Claimants) as key issues for decision.386 The fact that the Tribunal's reasoning on these points was concise cannot, in the Committee's opinion, amount to a failure to apply the law and thus a manifest excess of powers. In that regard, the Committee respectfully differs from the approach of the *Enron* Committee and prefers that of the *CMS* Committee.387\n\nSee para. 319, above.\n\nSee para. 297, above, quoting para. 136 of the *CMS* Decision, note 218, above.\n\n330.\n\nThe third requirement, namely to restore the *status quo* or compensate the Claimants, requires more discussion. That requirement, which the Committee derived from Article 27 of the ILC Articles, had not been the subject of such detailed argument by Argentina (although it had been raised by the Claimants). Nevertheless, the Committee cannot accept that it was \"invented\" by the Tribunal. The Tribunal's analysis on this point seems to the Committee to reflect what is inherent in the very concept of necessity. If a departure from a legal obligation can be justified by a state of necessity, it can be justified for only so long as that state of necessity exists. That limitation is clearly stated in the correspondence between the British and United States Governments in the *Caroline* case, which is generally regarded as a critical instance of State practice leading to the development of the modern law of necessity.388 Moreover, the Committee observes that the Tribunal's finding on this point was *obiter*, since the Tribunal had already found that Argentina was not entitled to rely upon the defence of necessity in any event.\n\nSee Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (Cambridge, 2013), p. 310 and the correspondence between the British and United States Governments quoted therein.\n\n331.\n\nFinally, the Committee considers that the Tribunal cannot be faulted for having approached this part of the case on the basis that the burden was on Argentina to establish that its conduct satisfied the requirements of customary law, as it is for the Party which seeks to rely upon a defence to establish that its conduct satisfies the requirements of the law for the application of that defence.\n\n332.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee rejects the argument that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n333.\n\nThe Committee therefore turns to the question whether the Tribunal failed adequately to state the reasons for its decision. The Tribunal's reasoning on each of the three issues on which it held that Argentina had failed to establish its case - namely whether the emergency measures adopted were the \"only means\" by which Argentina could have protected its essential interests, whether Argentina had contributed to the emergency in which it found itself and whether Argentina should have restored the *status quo* after the immediate emergency had passed or paid compensation - is concise. Relying, in particular, on the *Enron* Committee's decision, Argentina is critical of this brevity. It points, for example, to the fact that the Tribunal's findings on the \"only means\" issue are set out in a single paragraph which gives no indication of any alternative means which might have been available and states simply that \"the Tribunal is not convinced that those measures, as presented and explained in these proceedings, were the only means by which [Argentina] could have protected its public interests.\"389\n\nAward, para. 1172.\n\n334.\n\nThat brevity must, however, be seen in context. As the Committee has already explained, the question which the Tribunal was required to answer was whether or not Argentina could successfully rely upon the customary law defence of necessity in order to preclude the wrongfulness of its acts. The burden was on Argentina to establish that it could do so. The Tribunal found that it had failed to discharge that burden. It gave two principal reasons for that decision. Those reasons were, first, that it was not convinced that the measures adopted satisfied the \"only means\" requirement; and secondly, that it was not convinced that Argentina had not contributed to the emergency. It added that, even if - contrary to its principal conclusion - Argentina had satisfied it on those two points, it would still have been unable to rely upon the defence of necessity in respect of its failure either to restore the *status quo* or pay compensation once the state of necessity had come to an end. A reader would have no difficulty following this line of reasoning (whether or not they were persuaded by it). While each of the reasons on which the Tribunal based its conclusion regarding necessity might have been more fully explained, a tribunal is required only to state the reasons for its decision, not to give reasons for each and every one of those reasons.390\n\nSee *Soufraki,* note 58, above, para. 131 and *Enron,* note 217, above, para. 222.\n\n335.\n\nMoreover, the part of the Award in which the Tribunal set out its decision on necessity (paras. 1163-1181) has to be read together with the earlier section (paras. 493-592) in which it reviews the arguments of the Parties and summarises the evidence before it. It is clear, for example, if one reads paragraph 1172 together with paragraphs 530-556 that the Tribunal's finding regarding the \"only means\" reason did not come out of the blue but was based upon a careful analysis of the evidence before it regarding whether other avenues had been open to Argentina. The Committee understands the point, made by the *Enron* Committee, that the concept of \"only means\" is open to more than one interpretation but it notes that other courts and tribunals have found it unnecessary to elaborate upon those interpretations in reaching a conclusion regarding whether the measures before them were the only means open to the party claiming necessity. The International Court of Justice, for example, did not elaborate upon the meaning of this requirement in its judgment in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* (*Hungary/Slovakia*)391 or in its advisory opinion in *Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Palestinian Occupied Territory*.392 In the light of the principle that necessity is an exceptional plea which must be strictly applied (a principle expressly stated in paragraph 1171 of the Award), one leading commentary on the law of State responsibility observes succinctly that \"here \u2018only' means \u2018only'; it is not enough if another lawful means is more expensive or less convenient\".393\n\n*I.C.J. Reports 1997,* pp. 44-45, para. 56.\n\n*I.C.J*. Reports 2004, p. 195, para. 140.\n\nNote 388, p. 311.\n\n336.\n\nHaving examined both the finding of the Tribunal and its analysis of the evidence, the Committee considers that it is implicit in the reasoning of the Tribunal in the present case that the Tribunal considered that, whatever test was applied, the evidence submitted by Argentina failed to establish that the measures which it had taken were the only means of protecting its essential interests in the face of the economic crisis. Since even the *Enron* Committee accepted that it was sufficient that reasons be implicit, the Committee concludes that there was no failure to state reasons on this point. The same applies to the Tribunal's findings regarding Argentina's contribution to the crisis and the failure to restore the *status quo* or pay compensation. Accordingly, the Committee rejects Argentina's argument that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for this part of the Award.\n\n337.\n\nLastly, and in the event that Argentina is raising a challenge under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention,394 the Committee concludes that there is nothing in the record to suggest that the Tribunal was guilty of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure in relation to this part of the Award.\n\nSee para. 316 and footnote 376, above.\n\n**VIII. Failure to Address Evidence**\n-------------------------------------\n\n***A. The Issues Raised by Argentina***\n---------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nArgentina also seeks the annulment of the Award on account of what it describes as the failure of the Tribunal to consider \"fundamental evidence. which could have had a decisive influence\" on the outcome of the case.395 This ground relates to (a) evidence tendered by Argentina regarding the criticism of EDF and EDFI's management and global investment strategy and (b) the evidence given under cross-examination by Engineer Neme (a witness called by the Claimants but who had been involved on behalf of the Province of Mendoza in the privatisation of electricity provision) concerning the link between the Currency Clause in the Concession and the Argentine Convertibility Law regarding convertibility between the Argentine peso and the United States dollar. Argentina maintains that the failure of the Tribunal to consider this evidence is cause for annulment on the ground of (i) manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention), (ii) failure to state the reasons on which the Award was based (Article 52(1)(e)), and (iii) serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)).\n\nMemorial, para. 113.\n\n***B. Parties' Arguments***\n---------------------------\n\n**1. Argentina**\n----------------\n\n339.\n\nArgentina's first complaint concerns the failure of the Tribunal to mention a number of reports from French State entities (notably the National Assembly Investigation Committee on the Management of State-Owned Companies and the Court of Audit) on the management of EDF. These reports were highly critical of EDF's investments in certain parts of the world and blamed EDF management for poor investment decisions.396 According to Argentina, they demonstrated that the investment in Argentina had been a bad decision and that EDF withdrew from Argentina in 2005 for reasons unconnected with the emergency measures.\n\nMemorial, paras. 113-119; Reply, para. 72.\n\n340.\n\nThe second point raised by Argentina concerns the response given by Engineer Neme to questions from Argentina's counsel regarding the scope and purpose of the Currency Clause in the Concession. Engineer Neme had said that when the Concession was drafted, no-one had contemplated that the peso would cease to be convertible, although they did envisage that the exchange rate might alter. He added that, had anyone contemplated the possibility of an end to convertibility, he doubted that the Currency Clause would have been included.397 According to Argentina, this testimony was \"conclusive evidence submitted by Claimants that the reference to the calculation in U.S. dollars would never have been conceived to be applied within the framework of the abandonment of convertibility\".398\n\nHearing on the Merits, English Transcript, Day 3, pp. 942-943, excerpted in Memorial, para. 131.\n\nMemorial, para. 132.\n\n341.\n\nNeither the French State reports, nor the evidence of Engineer Neme, is referred to by the Tribunal in its Award.\n\n342.\n\nArgentina makes clear that it does not seek annulment on the ground that the Tribunal should have given weight to these two pieces of evidence but only on the ground that the Tribunal should not have ignored them.399 It maintains that, by doing so, the Tribunal made three errors. First, it failed to deal with all of the questions submitted to it by the Parties, thereby contravening Article 48(3) of the Convention which requires a tribunal to deal with every question submitted to it. As was demonstrated by the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Amco I*400 and confirmed by the leading commentary on the Convention,401 such a failure can amount to a manifest excess of powers. Secondly, the absence of any discussion of these items of evidence meant that there was a failure on the part of the Tribunal to state the reasons on which the Award was based. Lastly, by failing to consider or evaluate evidence which was \"a central part of [Argentina's] defense\", the Tribunal was guilty of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.402\n\nReply, paras. 77-78.\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and Others v. Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on Annulment of 16 May 1986, para. 32, 1 ICSID Reports 509 (\" *Amco I\").*\n\nSchreuer, *Commentary,* note 53, above, pp. 816-817, para. 47.\n\nReply, para. 74. See also Transcript, pp. 40-54.\n\n**2. The Claimants**\n--------------------\n\n343.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that there was no annullable error in the Tribunal's handling of the evidence. Although a tribunal has a duty to deal with every question that was submitted to it, it is not obliged to deal expressly with each argument or piece of evidence put before it in respect of each question.403 It was for the Tribunal to decide upon the admissibility and probative weight of each item of evidence put before it.404 The Tribunal had carefully analysed and evaluated all the evidence put to it and had decided all of the questions submitted by the Parties. The Claimants therefore maintain that the Tribunal's reasoning was clear and met the requirements of Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention. They therefore contend that there was no excess of powers, failure to state reasons or departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 184-190; Rejoinder, paras. 70-74.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 184; Rejoinder, para. 70.\n\n***C. Committee's Decision***\n-----------------------------\n\n344.\n\nAlthough Argentina raises three separate grounds for annulment in respect of the Tribunal's handling of the evidence, these are closely related, as is shown by the decisions of the *Amco I* and *Kl\u00f4ckner I* Committees, to which Argentina refers.405\n\n*Amco I,* note 400, above, para. 32; *Kl\u00f4ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH v. Cameroon* (ICSID Case No. ARB 81/2), Decision on Annulment of 3 May 1985, para. 115, 2 ICSID Reports 95.\n\n345.\n\nWith regard to Argentina's claim that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, the Committee accepts that a failure on the part of a tribunal to decide one or more of the questions submitted to it by the Parties could constitute such an excess (just as a failure to exercise jurisdiction is capable of amounting to an excess of powers),406 although it notes that the principal remedy in such a case appears to lie in an application for a supplementary decision under Article 49, rather than for annulment under Article 52(1)(b).407\n\nSee *Vivendi I*, note 70, above, para. 86.\n\nSee Schreuer, *Commentary*, note 53, above, p. 816, para. 43 and *Wena Hotels*, note 210, para. 75. A proposal to make the failure to decide every question a separate ground for annulment was rejected (*History of the ICSID Convention,* vol. II, pp. 848-849).\n\n346.\n\nNevertheless, Article 48(3) requires only that a tribunal decide every *question* submitted to it. A \"question\" within the meaning of Article 48(3) is an issue which must be decided in order to determine all aspects of the rights and liabilities of the parties relevant to the case in hand. In making its case in relation to such a question, a party may advance several distinct arguments and refer to one or more items of evidence and legal authorities in support thereof. A tribunal is not required to rule separately on each argument of law or point of fact on which the parties are in disagreement, so long as it decides the question to which those arguments relate. What does, or does not, constitute a question that has to be decided is an objective matter and not one which can be shaped by the way in which a party chooses to put its case or the emphasis which it places on any particular point.408\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in *CDC,* note 156, above, para. 57, made the point that the terminology used by a party could not define the question the tribunal was obliged to answer; \"the Tribunal was required to answer a legal question, or to put it another way, come to a conclusion about the Parties' rights and liabilities\".\n\n347.\n\nThe reports of the various French State bodies regarding the management of EDF and EDFI constituted part of the evidence put forward by Argentina in support of an argument that the Claimants were partly to blame for their own predicament and that they divested themselves of their participation in SODEMSA for reasons that had nothing to do with the emergency measures but rather reflected a changed investment strategy in light of the criticism of the management made in those reports. The significance of that evidence was not a question in its own right but merely one of the factors put forward by one Party in support of its arguments. The Tribunal rejected the argument that the rights and liabilities of the Parties were affected by the quality of EDF's decision to invest.409 As such, the Tribunal decided the question submitted to it and was not obliged to mention all of the evidence which had been put forward.\n\nAward, paras. 992-993; see also paras 1223-1229.\n\n348.\n\nThe same is true of the evidence of Engineer Neme. The answers given by Engineer Neme in cross-examination suggested that the Province of Mendoza had not approached the Currency Clause with a view to its application in the event of the convertibility of the peso being ended. That evidence was, however, only part of the evidence invoked by Argentina in support of an argument that the Currency Clause was tied to the continuation of the Convertibility Law and therefore did not apply to measures taken after the peso ceased to be convertible. In other words, the question which the Tribunal had to decide was whether, in light of all that evidence, the Currency Clause was or was not applicable when the peso ceased to be convertible in January 2002. The Tribunal considered that issue at some length in paragraphs 943-969 of the Award and rejected Argentina's interpretation of the Currency Clause (see, in particular, paragraphs 953 and 958-960). It therefore decided the question which had to be determined in order to arrive at a conclusion as to the rights and liabilities of the Parties. Accordingly, the Committee considers that the Tribunal was not guilty of an excess of powers.\n\n349.\n\nThe same reasoning must also lead the Committee to reject Argentina's argument that the Award should be annulled for failure to state the reasons on which it was based. As the Committee has already explained, the requirement to state reasons is limited in scope. So long as a reader can follow the reasoning in the Award, the fact that it does not deal with each authority or every item of evidence is immaterial.410 The fact that the Tribunal did not find it necessary to deal with Engineer Neme's evidence as to what was or was not within the contemplation of the Mendoza authorities at the time of the drafting of the Concession is not, therefore, a failure to comply with the requirement of Article 48(3) or grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\n\nSee the authorities cited in paras. 194 to 198, above and, in particular, *Enron*, note 217, above, para. 222.\n\n350.\n\nNor does the Committee consider that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Of course a tribunal must comply with the rules of due process411 and those include the duty to afford the parties an equal opportunity to present their case, to call witnesses and to cross-examine the witnesses of the other party. That does not, however, require a tribunal to discuss any particular item of evidence in detail, or at all, where it is not necessary to do so in order to decide the questions before it. Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention cannot be used to impose a duty to give reasons which goes beyond the duty already set out in Article 48(3) and given effect, in the context of annulment, by Article 52(1)(e).\n\nSee paras. 199 to 200, above.\n\n351.\n\nThe Committee therefore rejects Argentina's application for annulment on the basis of an alleged failure to consider certain evidence.\n\n**IX. Causation and Damages**\n-----------------------------\n\n***A. The Issues Raised by Respondent***\n----------------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nFinally, Argentina seeks the annulment of the Award on the grounds that, in assessing the damages payable in respect of the breaches which it identified, (i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to apply the applicable law, (ii) failed to state the reasons on which this part of the Award was based, and (iii) was guilty of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n***B. Parties' Arguments***\n---------------------------\n\n**1. Argentina**\n----------------\n\n353.\n\nArgentina maintains that the Tribunal relied exclusively on the evidence of the Claimants' valuation experts (LECG), without properly considering the fact that their methodology had been challenged by Argentina and its experts (MBG).412 Argentina alleges, in particular, that the Tribunal committed the following errors.\n\nMemorial, paras. 181-187; Reply, paras. 133-156.\n\n354.\n\nFirst, it ignored what Argentina characterises as serious flaws in LECG's macroeconomic analysis and, in particular, LECG's assumption that if there had been an increase in tariffs after the start of the emergency, that would not have resulted in a sharp drop in demand for electricity, thefts and failures to collect payment from customers. Argentina contends that it challenged these assumptions on the part of LECG but that the Tribunal ignored its counter-arguments.413\n\nMemorial, para. 183-185.\n\n355.\n\nSecondly, Argentina points to the fact that, in rejecting Argentina's argument that by December 2001 EDEMSA had no value, the Tribunal relied on the ratings given to EDEMSA at that time by the credit ratings agencies and ignored Argentina's argument that the agencies' methodologies were flawed and their rating unreliable as an indicator of value.414\n\nMemorial, para. 186.\n\n356.\n\nThirdly, according to Argentina, LECG failed to take proper account of the debt accrued by EDEMSA between the date of the Claimants making their investment in 1998 and the end of 2001 and the Tribunal failed to address this criticism of the LECG Report.415\n\nMemorial, para. 187.\n\n357.\n\nLastly, Argentina maintains that the Tribunal awarded over US$ 2 million in respect of preemergency measures notwithstanding its comment that the Claimants' expert reports \"took a significant number of twists and turns in this respect\",416 and took account of contractual issues which were not assessed even by the Claimants.417\n\nAward, para. 1321.\n\nMemorial, para. 188.\n\n358.\n\nIn addition, Argentina maintains that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers by failing to apply the law applicable to determining the standard of compensation in respect of a breach of the requirement of fair and equitable treatment. According to Argentina, the Tribunal took as the standard the \"genuine value\" standard provided for by Article 5(2) of the Argentina-France BIT in respect of expropriation, without explaining how that standard could be applied to a case in which the allegation of expropriation had been rejected.418 In doing so, the Tribunal ignored the distinction between primary and secondary rules and failed to apply the international law standard of reparation for unfair or inequitable treatment.419\n\nMemorial, paras. 189-193.\n\nIn this respect, Argentina pointed in particular to the award in *Lemire v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18), Award of 28 March 2011, paras. 148-149. See Reply, para. 151.\n\n359.\n\nArgentina also criticises the Tribunal for taking the value of the Claimants' investment in EDEMSA as at 1998 when the Tribunal had itself accepted that the appropriate date was 31 December 2001, thereby requiring Argentina to compensate the Claimants for losses suffered as a result of the changed economic conditions in the country, as well as for those caused by the emergency measures.420\n\nMemorial, para. 194.\n\n360.\n\nWith regard to the Claimants' duty to mitigate their loss, Argentina accuses the Tribunal of having accepted the principle but then failing properly to apply it. The Claimants had sold their share in EDEMSA in March 2005, shortly before the revision of tariffs, for US$ 2 million to IADESA. IADESA had then resold the shares in 2007 for a much higher price. Although the Tribunal had accepted that damages had to be reduced to take account of the difference between the 2005 and 2007 sale prices, it had without explanation reduced that difference by 50% and then applied a discount to arrive at a 2001 price.421\n\nMemorial, para. 196.\n\n361.\n\nFinally, Argentina maintains that the Tribunal reversed the burden of proof by holding that Argentina had failed to offer any convincing explanation as to why the official valuation figure of 1998 should be used as the basis for valuation rather than the amount actually paid by the Claimants, whereas the burden was on the Claimants to justify the figure which they asserted should be used as the basis of valuation.422\n\nMemorial, para. 197.\n\n**2. The Claimants**\n--------------------\n\n362.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Argentina's complaints are no more than a reflection of its disappointment that the Tribunal rejected its preferred methodology for calculating compensation and do not point to any annullable error.423 They point to authorities which show that a tribunal enjoys a broad discretion in relation to the assessment of compensation424 and to a series of awards which had adopted the same approach to compensation for unfair or inequitable treatment as that taken by the Tribunal.425\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 197.\n\nIn particular, the decision of the *ad hoc* committee in *Impregilo SpA v. Argentina* (ICSID Case No. 07/17), Decision on annulment of 24 January 2014 (\" *Impregilo* \"), para. 160.\n\nIn particular, *Ron Fuchs v. Georgia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/15), Award of 3 March 2010, paras. 532-537.\n\n363.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Tribunal carefully analysed both the Claimants' and Argentina's experts' reports and gave reasons for preferring the analysis of LECG to that of Argentina's expert (MBG).426 The Claimants cite the observation of the *Vivendi II* Committee that\n\n... a Tribunal may rely in this connection on expert and other testimony with which it agrees and may disregard other testimony. That is one of its principal tasks; cf also [Arbitration] Rule 34. It is generally accepted that a Tribunal has in these matters substantial discretion and does not need to explain expert views... where a Tribunal agrees with one of the parties or with experts, it is not improper or unexpected for it to adopt the language used by them in the pleadings or in written testimony.427\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 197-205.\n\n*Vivendi II*, note 102, above, para. 249.\n\n364.\n\nWith regard to mitigation of loss, the Claimants maintain that the Tribunal agreed with Argentina and substantially reduced the Claimants' damages accordingly.428\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 114-117; Rejoinder, para. 134.\n\n365.\n\nThe Claimants deny that the Tribunal exceeded its powers, failed to state the reasons on which this part of the Award was based or committed a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n***C. Committee's Decision***\n-----------------------------\n\n366.\n\nUnsurprisingly, given the nature of the case before it, the part of the Award which deals with the issue of damages is complex. In paragraphs 593-877, the Tribunal reviews in detail the arguments of the Parties. Its own analysis and findings are set out at paragraphs 1182-1336. Before considering Argentina's challenge to that part of the Award, the Committee considers it useful to set out the Tribunal's own summary of its findings. The Tribunal held:\n\n1182. Given the number of moving parts in determining quantum, the Tribunal sets forth the following road map of its computation, with details and justification included later in this section of the Award.\n\n**Claimants Total Damages as of December 2001**\n\nDamages caused by Emergency Measures US$ 133,635,633\n\nDamages caused by Pre-Emergency Measures US$ 2,502,797\n\nTotal Damages as of 31 December 2001 US$ 136,138,430\n\n1183. In calculating the quantum of damages, the Tribunal has generally adopted the LECG model as follows, taking 31 December 2001 as the valuation date.\n\n(i) Damages caused by the Emergency Measures will be calculated as the difference between two values: the value of Claimants' stake in EDEMSA under a scenario free of the Emergency Measures (\" *but for* \" scenario) and the value of the same stake under a scenario with the Emergency Measures (\" *actual* \" scenario), taking 31 December 2001 as the valuation date.\n\n(ii) The \"but for\" value (EDEMSA in the absence of the Emergency Measures) determined by DCF429 method discounted as of 31 December 2001;\n\n(iii) From that amount the Tribunal subtracts the amount which should reasonably have been received by the Claimants in the 2005 sale of its EDEMSA shares discounted to 31 December 2001;\n\n(iv) To that amount, the Tribunal adds damages attributable to PreEmergency Measures, again valued as of 31 December 2001.\n\n1184. Following this three-step approach yields figures as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Step 1:** DCF calculation of Claimants' investments in the absence of the Emergency Measures as of 31 December 2001 |\n| Firm value (Discount rate, WACC430 11.34%) | US$ 448,855,587 |\n| Financial Debt (Dec 2001 book value) | US$ (119,644,020) |\n| Equity Value Value of Claimants' Investment in EDEMSA | US$ 329,211,567 |\n| (44.88% share) | US$ 147,750,151 |\n| **Step 2:** Subtracting price which might reasonably have been received in the 2005 sale valued as of 31 December 2001 |\n| Value of Claimants' Investment in EDEMSA | US$ 147,750,151 |\n| 2005 Sale discounted to 31 December 2001 | US$ 14,114,518 |\n| Total damages caused by Emergency Measures | US$ 133,635,633 |\n| **Step 3:** Inclusion of Pre-Emergency Damages | US$ 2,502,797.00 |\n| Total: | **US$ 136,138,430** |\n\nDiscounted Cash Flow.\n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital.\n\n367.\n\nThe Committee also considers it important to recall the limits which the annulment process necessarily imposes upon its task in considering this aspect of the case. Those limits were aptly summed up by the *Impregilo* Committee in the following terms:\n\nThe Committee cannot review *de novo* the facts, evidence and criteria used by the Tribunal in assessing the damages nor the amount of compensation awarded to Impregilo. It is clear that Argentina disagrees with the causal connection found by the Tribunal between the damages and the disputed measures; that it considers that there was a gap in the analysis of causation and that the evidence produced should have resulted in a different compensation; and that it disagrees with the interpretation by the Tribunal of the applicable law in the assessment of the damages. However, a disagreement with the analysis of the Tribunal as to causation, or with respect to the assessment of the evidence or the interpretation of the law does not constitute ground for annulment under Article 52.... Of course, the assessment of damages cannot be arbitrary, but a Tribunal's determination of the amount of compensation allows for a high level of discretion and a disagreement with the criteria used by the Tribunal cannot be a ground for annulment of an award.431\n\n*Impregilo*, note 424, above, para. 160.\n\n368.\n\nThat is not to say that an award cannot be annulled on the basis of the tribunal's treatment of the issue of damages. As the last sentence of the passage from *Impregilo* quoted above makes clear, assessment of damages cannot be arbitrary. If a tribunal, in assessing damages, manifestly exceeds its powers by failing to apply (as opposed to arguably misapplying) the applicable law, fails to state the reasons on which its award is based, or is guilty of a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, then the award can be annulled and awards have been annulled on account of such errors in the treatment of damages. Nevertheless, criticisms of the way in which the tribunal has applied the law or disagreements with its handling of the evidence, the methodology selected, or its computation of damages - even if well-founded - cannot lead to annulment. Nor is a tribunal required to address each point raised in evidence in order to comply with the requirement to state reasons for its award.\n\n369.\n\nWith those considerations in mind, the Committee begins with what it regards as Argentina's most fundamental criticism of this part of the Award, namely that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law in order to determine the standard of damages and thus manifestly exceeded its powers. That criticism turns on paragraph 1210 of the Award, in which the Tribunal, after noting that it had found that Argentina was responsible for denying the Claimants fair and equitable treatment, said:\n\nThe fairest measure of damages for that breach would be the genuine value of the investment. Such a standard has been recognized in Article 5 of the Argentina-France BIT as the appropriate measure of compensation in cases of dispossession. Article 4 [sic]432 of the Argentina-France BIT does not present any alternative formulation for determining the valuation of a business diminished by unfair or inequitable treatment. Consequently, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to examine the value of EDEMSA had it not been reduced by the Emergency Measures.\n\nFair and equitable treatment is actually dealt with in Article 3.\n\n370.\n\nSince the Tribunal had already held that the Claimants had not been dispossessed,433 Argentina complains that this finding constitutes a manifest excess of power, because the Tribunal applied the standard of compensation laid down for one type of breach to another, quite different, one without any warrant for doing so.\n\nAward, paras. 1113-1118.\n\n371.\n\nParagraph 1210 must, however, be taken in context. The Tribunal did not simply take the BIT standard of compensation for expropriation and apply it to a denial of fair and equitable treatment without justification. It had already explained (in paragraph 1183 of the Award, which is quoted in paragraph 366, above) that damages would be calculated on the basis of the difference between the actual value of the Claimants' investment in EDEMSA (i.e. after the effect of the emergency measures) and the value which that investment would have had \"but for\" the effect of those measures. That is no more than an application of the principle that the purpose of damages is to place the injured party, as nearly as possible, in the position which it would have occupied had the wrongful act not occurred. That principle is so well established in international law434 as to require no discussion. There is no reason to think that, as a matter of general principle, it does not apply to a denial of fair and equitable treatment and nothing in the Argentina-France BIT requires a tribunal to apply a different standard in such a case, as the Tribunal noted in paragraph 1210 of the Award. In the Committee's view, in selecting this standard as the basis for calculating damages, the Tribunal correctly applied international law, which was the law applicable to determining the consequences of a breach of treaty. Moreover, even if it were open to argument that the Tribunal had misunderstood the relevant international law, that would have been a case of misapplication rather than non-application of the applicable law and would thus have entailed no excess of powers within Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nSee, e.g., the Judgment of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Factory at Chorzow*, *P.C.I.J. Series A, No. 17,* p. 47 and Article 36 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the commentary thereon.\n\n372.\n\nThe Committee therefore rejects the argument that, in determining the standard of compensation the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers. It also rejects the argument that there was a failure to state reasons on this point. Taken as a whole, this part of the Award makes quite clear the basis on which damages were awarded. Nor can the Committee see any basis here for a finding that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n373.\n\nTurning to the way in which the Tribunal applied the standard just set out and the methodology it used to determine the actual and \"but for\" valuations, it is true that the Tribunal generally adopted the approach set out in the LECG Report and rejected the alternative methodology suggested by Argentina and MBG. The Committee cannot accept, however, that the Tribunal did so uncritically, or that it failed to explain why it preferred one approach to the other. On the contrary, paragraphs 1189-1208 of the Award explain - in considerable detail - why the Tribunal considered that MBG's methodology could not be accepted. The Tribunal identified a number of specific flaws in MBG's methodology. It then stated that \"the difficulties with the MBG models are further highlighted by the fact that said experts of [Argentina] abandoned their earlier model\" during the proceedings and \"failed to advance any principled reason for their willingness to abandon the assumptions and results calculated in the merits phase\".435 It then went on, in paragraphs 1209-1222 (as well as in the subsequent analysis), to show why it was relying upon the LECG approach and to verify different aspects of that approach.\n\nAward, paras. 1198 and 1200.\n\n374.\n\nWith regard to the four specific points made by Argentina (and summarised in paragraphs 354 to 357, above), the Committee would make the following observations. First, the Tribunal explained (in paragraph 1191 of the Award) why it rejected Argentina's argument that a rise in the tariffs would have led to a dramatic drop in demand and its criticisms of the macroeconomic assumptions in the LECG reports.\n\n375.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal explained (in paragraphs 1192 to 1197 of the Award) why, contrary to the position advanced by Argentina, it considered that the credit agencies' ratings of EDEMSA were probative of the value of that company and thus of the Claimant's investment. It commented, in particular, on the fact that one agency, \"Fitch\", had relied upon the guaranteed cash flows to which EDEMSA was entitled under the Concession as a key element in its high valuation in late 2001 and had removed those cash flows following the emergency measures, when it gave EDEMSA a far lower rating.436\n\nAward, para. 1194.\n\n376.\n\nThirdly, contrary to what is suggested by Argentina, the Award shows that the debt burden taken on by EDEMSA was taken into account in arriving at a valuation of the Claimants' investment as of 31 December 2001, as the calculations in paragraph 1183 of the Award (set out in paragraph 366, above) make clear.\n\n377.\n\nLastly, the fact that the Tribunal found that the Claimants' experts engaged in a number of \"twists and turns\" in relation to quantification of the effect of the pre-emergency measures in no way invalidates the Tribunals' own analysis of this issue at paragraphs 1318-1323.\n\n378.\n\nOf course, Argentina disagrees with the analysis of the Tribunal on all of these points and disputes the reasoning it adopted and the evaluation it made of the different expert reports but, as the Committee has already explained,437 that is not a basis on which the Committee could annul the Award even if it agreed with every one of those criticisms.\n\nSee para. 367, above.\n\n379.\n\nSimilarly, the Committee sees no basis for annulling the Award on the basis of the way in which the Tribunal calculated the value of the Claimants' investment or its approach to causation. The essence of Argentina's challenge on this point is that the Tribunal, having accepted Argentina's submission that the investment had to be valued as at 31 December 2001,438 based its valuation on the price which the Claimants had paid in 1998. However, the Tribunal did not take the 1998 price as the \"but for\" valuation but only as a starting point for arriving at the \"but for\" figure. That is clear from the following passage in the Award:\n\n1232. To determine genuine value one usually asks what a willing buyer would have paid for a business as of a particular date, which in our case would be the end of December 2001. For an electricity company, such a buyer would look to revenue streams that might be generated and thus examine the local tariff regulatory regime to see what cash might be expected. The buyer would note that Article 43 of the Mendoza Provincial Electricity Law says that investors receive a reasonable rate of return (una tasa de rentabilidad razonable) on the amount invested. Since we do not have an actual investment in December 2001, the next best starting point would be the amount actually paid for the investment on which a reasonable return can be calculated. Bidders normally determine their price as a function of forecasts of a project's viability in the light of variables which include projected revenue and costs.\n\n1233. The willing buyer would also look at other aspects of the regulatory framework. Provincial Decree 197/98 allow [sic] share capital to be increased in an amount that reflects \"the societies' assets, the value of the concession granted by the Province of Mendoza, *determined by the proportional amount of the willing economic bid of the tender,\"* Emphasis added.\n\n1234. Of course, the amount invested is not the end of the story. Other elements have to be taken into consideration. Indeed, the method adopted by the Tribunal has yielded a value of approximately $ 147 million, down from the $ 209 million pro rata investment attributable to Claimants' shares in EDEMSA. For the sake of good order, the Tribunal again notes that Claimants' stake was 44.88% of the capital, and that the $ 237 million bid was for 51% of EDEMSA Class \"A\" shares offered by the Province of Mendoza.\n\n1235. In other words, the Tribunal has adopted a quantum of approximately two-thirds (2/3) of the actual price paid.\n\nAward, paras. 1183 and 1279.\n\n380.\n\nThere was, therefore, no contradiction between the decision that the \"but for\" valuation had to be made as of 31 December 2001 and the way in which the Tribunal made use of the price actually paid by the Claimants in 1998, nor has the Tribunal ignored factors (other than the emergency measures) which came into being between 1998 and the end of 2001 and affected the valuation.\n\n381.\n\nThe Committee also rejects Argentina's criticism of the Tribunal for employing the actual price paid, rather than the official valuation, as the starting point, as well as its allegation that the Tribunal improperly reversed the burden of proof in this regard. The Tribunal explained (in paragraphs 1213-1214 and in paragraphs 1227 and 1232-1234) why the price paid for the investment was relevant to the valuation. That was because the Provincial law and the terms of the Concession provided for a reasonable rate of return on the investment, so that (as explained in paragraphs 1232-1233) a willing buyer would have taken account of the scale of the investment in calculating the income stream which could reasonably be expected. That in turn raised the question whether the reasonable rate of return was to be calculated on the actual price paid by the investor or the official valuation at the time of bidding. Unsurprisingly, Argentina preferred the latter (which was far smaller) and the Claimants the former.\n\n382.\n\nThis part of Argentina's case before the Committee centres on paragraph 1215 of the Award:\n\nThe Tribunal is unconvinced by [Argentina's] assertion that Claimants' return should be limited to the official valuation amount. This finding is supported by the fact that several sophisticated multinational companies also bid far in excess of the valuation amount. Moreover, [Argentina] has failed to offer any sound explanation as to why investors would have been willing to do that if the return on their investment would be limited to the official valuation amount. In the Tribunal's view, no rational investor would have been willing to agree with such restriction, which would have rendered it impossible for the investor to earn a return on its overall investment.\n\n383.\n\nThat paragraph has to be read in context. The Tribunal had already (in paragraphs 12131214) given an indication that it was persuaded by the Claimants' case that the actual price was the basis for calculation of the reasonable rate of return. In paragraphs 1216-1218, the Tribunal went on to explain why it considered that the language of the official valuation decree, the way in which it was described to investors and the testimony of Argentina's own experts (in the case of Mr Bello, in the proceedings before the *EDFI* Tribunal, and, in the case of Mr Quiroga, in another arbitration) supported the Claimants' position. In paragraph 1215 it was showing that Argentina had advanced no explanation in support of its alternative view. There is no reversal of proof in that. Nor was the Tribunal's approach to this issue one which could give rise to annulment on other grounds.\n\n384.\n\nLastly, the Committee considers that the Tribunal's calculation of the \"actual value\" and its approach to mitigation is not tainted by annullable error. The Claimants had asserted that the actual value of their investment as of 31 December 2001 was US$ 2 million, the figure for which they sold that investment to IADESA in March 2005. The Tribunal considered that \"in the absence of any tariff revision, perhaps the Tribunal might find that figure a reasonable measure of the fair market value of EDEMSA in 2005\".439 However, the Tribunal considered that, as the sale was made between shareholders in EDEMSA in the middle of a tariff renegotiation procedure, each party to that transaction should have been aware of what was going on and of the prospect of a tariff revision.440 Moreover, it held that \"it would be patently unfair to allow Claimants to recover damages for loss that could have been avoided by taking reasonable steps\" and that \"the injured party must be held responsible for its own contribution to the loss\".441\n\nAward, para. 1287.\n\nAward, para. 1298.\n\nAward, para. 1301.\n\n385.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that IADESA sold the shareholding in EDEMSA which it had purchased from the Claimants, together with its own 6.12% shareholding, in 2007 for US$ 60 million.442 On that basis, the Claimants' shareholding was valued at US$ 52.8 million443 in 2007 after the tariff revision had taken place. The Tribunal determined that the actual value of the Claimants' investment as at March 2005 had to be greater than US$ 2 million. It held:\n\nIn determining the extent to which the share price should be deemed adjusted (and thus damages should be reduced) the Tribunal looks to the background of the renegotiation in course over the concession. A reasonable seller would try to retain some of the possible benefits and, therefore, in arm's-length transactions a seller and a buyer would accept to partake any substantial benefit. Absent any special circumstances, the Tribunal considers equitable to impute to each of the parties an equal share of 50% in those potential benefits. The buyer would still have enough incentives to buy and the seller would have taken a reasonable step to minimize its losses.444\n\nAward, para. 1300.\n\nThe Claimants' shareholding in EDEMSA (44.88% of the total) had been 88% of the 51% shareholding which IADESA owned after March 2005 and sold in 2007. 88% of US$ 60 million yields a figure of US$ 52.8 million.\n\nAward, para. 1311.\n\n386.\n\nIn short, far from the 50% reduction being unexplained, as Argentina suggests, it was based upon the Tribunal's calculation of how, in an arm's length transaction, a buyer and seller might have approached the value of the shareholding knowing that a tariff increase was possible but far from certain. Of course, one can argue over whether 50% is too large (or too small) a reduction but it cannot be said to fall outside the scope of the Tribunal's discretion to calculate damages. Nor is the Tribunal's figure one which is unexplained. In addition, the Tribunal naturally discounted the price to arrive at a 2001 figure, something which was both necessary and inevitable as the object of this part of the valuation was to determine what the investment was actually worth at the critical date of 31 December 2001.\n\n387.\n\nThe Committee therefore rejects Argentina's application to annul the Award under any or all of Articles 52(1)(b), (d) and (e) in relation to the treatment of the damages and causation issues.\n\n**X. Costs**\n------------\n\n388.\n\nThe Committee turns, finally, to the question of costs. In accordance with Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), Argentina, as the Party seeking the annulment of the Award, has been responsible to date for all of the advance payments required to cover the costs of the Committee and the Centre. The Committee, however, has discretion, under Article 61(2) of the Convention and the Rule 28 of the Arbitration Rules to apportion these costs between the Parties. The Committee also has discretion to order that one Party bear all, or part, of the costs incurred by the other Party in respect of its legal representation.\n\n389.\n\nThere is no general rule in ICSID proceedings that the losing party should pay the successful party's costs, nor is there even a presumption in favour of such an outcome.445 The decisions of past *ad hoc* committees cannot be said to have given rise to a *jurisprudence constante*, although they do suggest that committees have sometimes drawn a distinction between the costs of the committee and of the Centre, on the one hand, and the costs of representation of the parties on the other, with the unsuccessful party more frequently being required to pay the whole of the former than to reimburse all or part of the latter. Some committees have also suggested that a relevant consideration is whether or not the application for annulment was made in good faith and whether it was so \"fundamentally lacking in merit\" that it was \"to any reasonable and impartial observer, most unlikely to succeed\".446\n\nIn contrast to the position under Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, under which the starting point is a presumption that the unsuccessful party must bear the whole costs of the tribunal.\n\n*CDC,* note 156, above, para. 89.\n\n390.\n\nThe Committee has no hesitation in saying that it regards the request for annulment in the present case as having been advanced in good faith and having been based on arguments that were generally plausible. This is not a case in which the annulment application was \"fundamentally lacking in merit\" and the fact that the Committee has dealt with Argentina's arguments at such length is an indication that it does not consider that they were doomed to failure from the outset.\n\n391.\n\nIn these circumstances, but taking account of the fact that Argentina has been unsuccessful in respect of all of the grounds on which it has sought annulment, the Committee considers that it would be equitable to order that Argentina should bear the entire costs of the Committee and the Centre but to leave each Party to meet its own costs of representation.\n\n**XI. Dispositif**\n------------------\n\n392.\n\nFor the reasons set forth in the foregoing paragraphs of this Decision, the Committee unanimously decides:-\n\n(1) to dismiss in its entirety the Application for Annulment of the Award of 11 June 2012 submitted by the Argentine Republic;\n\n(2) that the Argentine Republic shall bear the costs of the proceedings, comprising the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee, and the costs of the Centre; and\n\n(3) that each Party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses."}]}
