I consider it important to append this opinion of my dissenting views, not to denigrate or undermine the reasoning and logic of the Award, but only to point out the key differences between my views and those of the majority. The precedential significance of this Award for future proceedings under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) cannot be underestimated. In addition, the Award will be an important guidance to future potential NAFTA claimants. It is for this purpose that as complete an understanding as possible be expressed of the legal issues involved.\n\n1.\n\nRespondent has claimed that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction because of an asserted failure on the part of Waste Management to have complied with the formal requirements of NAFTA\u2019s Article 1121\u2014either because (i) it did not supply the correct waiver required by that article at the beginning of the arbitration; or because (ii) the waiver that it supplied was subsequently shown to have been inoperative, nonexistent, or disavowed by reason of a subsequent course of conduct of Waste Management. The existence and delivery of this waiver is asserted to be a condition precedent to jurisdiction of the Tribunal under NAFTA. It is claimed that if the waiver had not been given, or had subsequently been disavowed, disqualified or effectively withdrawn, the consent of the United Mexican States to the arbitral process could no longer be presumed.\n\n1. Must the waiver be express?\n------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe first question raised by Mexico\u2019s objection is whether Article 11211 requires that the waiver be *in expresses verbis.* It does not appear so. This NAFTA provision does not require the submission of a waiver in any particular form. It does not specify that any proceedings be withdrawn or suspended. Nor does it require that such proceedings not be initiated. It requires the delivery of evidence of a waiver of the right to initiate or continue them. The waiver requirement expressed in Article 1121, paragraph 1 is general, not specific.\n\nThe text of Article 1121, paragraph 1 specifies that  \n \"A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1116 to arbi tration only if:\n\n(a) the investor consents to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and\n\n(b) the investor... waives[s]... [its] right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the disputing Party.\"\n\n3.\n\nParagraph 3 of Article 1121 A specific. It provides that: \"A consent and waiver required by this Article shall be in writing, shall be delivered to the disputing Party and shall be included in the submission of a claim to arbitration.\" To indicate that it \"shall be in writing\"\u2014without specifying the form of words to be used\u2014implies without question that the form of words may vary as long as the waiver itself is the \"waiver\" required by Article 1121. In addition, Article 1121, paragraph 3 of the English version of the NAFTA says that \" *[a]* consent and waiver required by this Article shall be in writing,\" not that *\"* *the* consent and waiver required by this Article shall be in writing.\" It thus reinforces the implication that NAFTA claimants have leeway in formulating the language that is to express \"a waiver.\"\n\n2. Did Claimant\u2019s conditional language nullify the waiver?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nIn the present case there has been a variety of conditions, limitations, reservations, or understandings attached to the waiver offered by Waste Management. By the time of Claimant\u2019s letter of September 23, 1998 (Award, \u00a7 4, p. 4), and certainly a few days later at the time of its resubmission of the notice of institution of arbitration proceedings to ICSID (September 29, 1998) (Award \u00a7 5, p. 5), what might have initially appeared to have been a reservation, qualification, or condition to the waiver had been transformed into an \"understanding.\" The history of the various exchanges is set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 4 through 6 of the Award.\n\n5.\n\nThe question presented is whether Claimant\u2019s \"understanding,\" or conditional language, nullified the waiver. Article 1121 makes no mention of any condition or understanding that may, or may not, be appended to the \"writing\" embodying a waiver. Keeping in mind \"the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose,\"2 it stands to reason that a reservation or condition in the written waiver that does not have a negative effect on its substance would be of no moment, but one that does have a negative or diluting effect on its substance would invalidate it.\n\nThe general rule of interpretation in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties is now universally accepted as general international law. It is the rule of interpretation that must be applied by this Tribunal to the provisions of the NAFTA treaty:\n\n\"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\" The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 31 (\"General Rule of Interpretation\"), paragraph 1.\n\n6.\n\nClaimant\u2019s \"understanding\" in this case was also subjected to the express introductory condition: \"*[w]ithout derogating from* the waiver required by NAFTA Article 1121\".3 This would appear to have eliminated any potential negative effect on the waiver requirement of Article 1121. The test is one of substance: does the understanding have a substantive effect that would be contrary to the substantive requirements of the waiver, or does it not? If it is stated to be \"without derogation\" from the waiver, it is hard to see how it could have such an effect.\n\n*\"Without derogating from the waiver required by NAFTA Article 1121, Claimants here set forth their understanding that* the above waiver does not apply to any dispute settlement proceedings involving allegations that Respondent has violated duties imposed by sources of law other than Chapter Eleven of NAFTA, including the municipal law of Mexico.\" (Italics added.)\n\n7.\n\nYet even if the \"without derogation\" language had not been included, the understanding that Waste Management attached to its waiver was not inconsistent with the requirements of Article 1121. The correspondence to and from ICSID4 introduced, applied, and accepted the \"substance\" test: that a waiver would be acceptable if it applies to \"dispute proceedings in Mexico involving allegations of breaches of any obligations, imposed by other sources of law, that are *not different in substance from* the obligations of a NAFTA State Party under Chapter Eleven of NAFTA.\"5 Waste Management\u2019s conception\u2014although expressed in such a manner as may not, with hindsight, have turned out to \"have been the better practice\"6\u2014was in fact right, for the reason that claims relating to Mexican7 remedies for Mexican wrongs are not the same as claims for NAFTA remedies for NAFTA wrongs.\n\nAward \u00a7 5, p. 6.\n\nLetter of November 13, 1998 to ICSID.\n\nIn the language of the *Ethyl* decision, cited in footnote 48 below.\n\n\"Mexican\" and \"Mexico\" are to be understood for these purposes as meaning the United States of Mexico, including its agencies, instrumentalities, subordinate entities and components, such as Banobras, the Municipality of Acapulco, the State of Guerrero, and so forth.\n\n8.\n\nThere must be, and is, a distinction to be drawn in juridical terms between the legal obligations of Mexico under Mexican law and the legal obligations of Mexico under its international treaty obligations imposed by NAFTA. If this were not true, arbitrations could be commenced under NAFTA for remedies under national law such as actions for payments for money had and received, goods sold and delivered, actions for breach of contract, actions for breach of warranty, lawsuits requesting zoning modifications, litigation concerning unauthorized strikes, lawsuits about collective bargaining, cases on sexual harassment in the workplace, and so forth. It is inconceivable that any of these complaints had been intended, by the NAFTA States Party, to be resolved in NAFTA arbitrations. Proceedings relating to them could never have been \"proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be\" a \"breach referred to in Article 1116,\" within the meaning of Article 1121. They were beyond the scope of the waiver, and would not have been intended to be part of it.\n\n9.\n\nThis is also consistent with the normal rule of burden of proof and persuasion in matters such as this. Jurisdiction is never to be presumed; once a respondent has raised a *prima facie* credible claim that jurisdiction does not exist, the normal rule is that the burden shifts to the claimant.8 If the claimant then adduces sufficient evidence and argument so that jurisdiction may be perceived to exist by a reasonable preponderance of the evidence, the tribunal must then find that jurisdiction in the matter does exist.9 In addition, the present situation cries out for application of the prudential principle, which warns tribunals to tread carefully in respect of legal undertakings of this nature and not to arrive precipitously at \"the drastically preclusive effect\"10 of a denial of jurisdiction in a situation where\u2014although procedural complications might have been avoided by the \"better practice\"11 of dispensing with \"understandings\" and other conditions\u2014jurisdiction still survives as a legal matter.\n\nThis is not the *onus probandi* but the *onus proponendi.*\n\nThis is supported by the language of the ICSID arbitral decision on jurisdiction (No. 2) of 14 April 1988 in *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited [SPP(ME)] v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (Case No. ARB/84/3) submitted to the Tribunal by Mexico in the present case. (\"Materials in Support of Respondent\u2019s Oral Submission,\" Tab 1.) The Tribunal in that case stated that:\n\n\"...jurisdictional instruments are to be interpreted neither restrictively nor expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith, and jurisdiction will be found to exist if\u2014but only if\u2014 *the force of the arguments militating in favor of it is preponderant.\" (5* ICSID REPORTS at 131, 144, para. 63 (italics added).)\n\n*Ibid*\n\nQuoting the *Ethyl* decision cited in footnote 48 below.\n\n3. What does the waiver mean?\n-----------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe preceding paragraphs have dealt with the issue of whether an additional \"understanding\" could be appended to Claimant\u2019s Article 1121 waiver without disqualifying it. They did not deal with the interpretation of what that waiver really means.\n\n(a) \"Measure\"\n-------------\n\n11.\n\nWhat is a \"measure\"? Article 201 of the English text of NAFTA (\"General Definitions\") states that: *\"measure* includes any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice.\" The French text states that: *\"mesure* s\u2019entend de toute l\u00e9gislation, r\u00e9glementation, proc\u00e9dure, prescription ou pratique.\" The Spanish text states that *\"medida* incluye cualquier ley, reglamento, procedimiento, requisito o pr\u00e1ctica.\"\n\n12.\n\nCanada argued extensively in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction* case12 in the International Court of Justice that a \"measure\" was virtually any action or act undertaken by a State on an official level.13 In response, the Court in its judgment stated that \"in its ordinary sense the word [\"measure\"] is wide enough to cover any act, step or proceeding, and imposes no particular limit on their material content or on the aim pursued thereby.\" The question however remains whether individual actions of, *e.g.,* Banobras, or the Municipality of Acapulco, or Guerrero, would be considered as being the right *kind* of measure: *i.e.* a \"measure... *that is alleged to be a breach\"* of NAFTA obligations, within the meaning of Article 1121.\n\n*Fisheries Jurisdiction* case (Spain v. Canada), *Jurisdiction of the* Court, Judgment of 4 December 1998, *I.C.J. Reports 1998,* p. 432; para. 65.\n\n\"Canada... stresses the very wide meaning of the word \u2018measure\u2019. It takes the view that this is a \u2018generic term\u2019, which is used in international conventions to encompass statutes, regulations and administrative action.\" *Ibid.*\n\n13.\n\nThe \"Article 1121 \u2018measure\u2019\" is a particular and limited kind of action or concept. Although actions such as denial of payment under a letter of credit, or cancellation of a concession contract, can each be viewed as a \"measure,\" they would not be the type of \"measure\" that Article 1121 refers to. The reference in Article 1121 is to a State act that is itself a breach of international obligations under NAFTA. Article 1121 cannot be read as applying to local components of such an act which are not themselves breaches of international obligations at the international treaty level and which would not be actionable under NAFTA. The failure to pay on a financial guarantee or letter of credit may be a component of a measure that constitutes nationalization, but it is not itself such a measure unless it is joined with other elements that are also components of the ultimate measure of expropriation. It is therefore not the kind of \"measure\" contemplated by Article 1121.\n\n14.\n\nOf course, a measure of nationalization may be expected to include a law or regulation or nationalization decree by which the property in question is confiscated. If the nationalization is of the \"creeping\" variety, it will fall within the meaning of paragraph 1 of NAFTA Article 1110 (\"a measure *tantamount to* nationalization or expropriation of such an investment\"), but will still require some additional act to be taken beyond the bald denial of payment or cancellation of the contract\u2014an act such as, *e.g.,* a review by a local court or tribunal and denial of the claim on inadequate grounds, refusal to permit access to judicial review, some other form of denial of justice in international law, or a governmental conspiracy to take over the concession.14\n\nThe *ELSI* case decided by a Chamber of the International Court in 1989 is illustrative of this point. *(Elettronica Sicula S.p.A.* (United States v. Italy), Decision of 20 July 1989, *1989 I.C.J. Reports,* p. 15.) In that case the factual background included a variety of governmental \"measures\" undertaken at the local, municipal, state and national level. In addition, the relationship of one \"measure\" to another formed a central part of the case; a major question presented was whether the United States was bound to prove the existence of a connection between those measures so as to establish a conspiracy, on the one hand, or a pattern of actions sufficient to constitute a nationalization or expropriation, on the other. The pleadings in that case clearly demonstrate that one single act or measure cannot an expropriation make, unless that act or measure is itself the promulgation of a law accomplishing the deed. An act of expropriation may be a single act of a State, but the single act of a State is not necessarily an act of expropriation. Unfortunately for present purposes, the Chamber did not have to resolve this issue, as it had determined that the financial condition of the Elettronica Sicula company had been the primary cause of its failure. *Id.,* p. 71, para. 19.\n\n(b) \"Breach\"\n------------\n\n15.\n\nWhat is meant by the word \"breach\"? Nowhere in Chapter Eleven, Section A, can we find a provision requiring payment of commercial debts, or preventing the cancellation of contracts other than in accordance with their terms. These legal obligations arise under the respective domestic laws of the Parties to NAFTA. They are precisely the type of legal obligations as to which recourse was sought by Acaverde in the proceedings against Banobras and in the arbitration proceeding against Acapulco. Those proceedings set forth causes of actions or complaints that related to non-payment and non-performance, all of which were governed by provisions of the Civil and Commercial Codes of Mexico and none of which was governed by NAFTA.\n\n16.\n\nAn examination of Chapter Eleven, Section A, confirms this.15 Article 1105, as to which Waste Management has asserted a claim in this arbitration, contains the requirement for each Party to \"accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security;\" neither the Banobras lawsuits nor the Acapulco arbitration appear to have asserted a claim for denial of treatment in accordance with international law.16 Article 1110 concerns \"expropriation and compensation,\"17 and is\u2014together with Article 1105\u2014at the heart of Claimant\u2019s case.\n\nArticle 1102 requires \"national treatment\" for investors of another Party; neither the Banobras lawsuits nor the Acapulco arbitration would appear to have asserted a claim for denial of \"national treatment.\" Article 1103 requires \"most-favored-nation treatment\" for investors of another Party; neither the Banobras lawsuits nor the Acapulco arbitration would appear to have asserted a claim for denial of \"most-favored-nation treatment.\" Article 1104 requires a Party to accord to investors and investments of investors of another Party the better of the treatment required by Articles 1102 and 1103\u2014not a cause of action alleged in either the Banobras lawsuits or the Acapulco arbitration.\n\nArticles 1106 through 1109 do not appear to be germane to the issues in the present case. Article 1106 relates to \"performance requirements,\" which appear to be irrelevant to the claims made in the present arbitration. Article 1107 contains a proscription concerning requirements for composition of \"senior management and boards of directors\" that is likewise inapplicable. Article 1108 relates to \"reservations and exceptions.\" Article 1109 concerns the freedom to make transfers, which does not appear to be at issue in the present case.\n\nIt provides that: \"1. No Party may directly or indirectly nationalize or expropriate an investment of an investor of another Party in its territory or take a measure tantamount to nationalization or expropriation of such an investment (\"expropriation\") except:\n\n(a) for a public purpose;  \n (b) on a non-discriminatory basis;  \n (c) in accordance with due process of law and Article 1105(1); and  \n (d) on payment of compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2 through 6.\"\n\nArticle 1105(1) as referred to in subparagraph 1(c) of course states that:\n\n\"Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\"\n\n17.\n\nFrom the record before the Tribunal, the claims advanced by Waste Management here differ from the claims asserted against Banobras and Acapulco in the local Mexican actions.18 Claimant\u2019s claims under Articles 1110 and 1105 of NAFTA19 are broader than\u2014and proceed on a plane different from\u2014the claims advanced in either the Banobras lawsuits or the Acapulco arbitration. Not only did they involve numerous additional elements; they also proceed on a distinct and separate juridical plane, since a \"creeping expropriation\" is comprised of a number of elements, none of which can\u2014separately\u2014constitute the international wrong. These constituent elements include non-payment, non-reimbursement, cancellation, denial of judicial access, actual practice to exclude, non-conforming treatment, inconsistent legal blocks, and so forth. The \"measure\" at issue is the expropriation itself; it is not merely a sub-component part of expropriation.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial described the three domestic proceedings commenced by Acaverde in Mexico, and stated that \"[i]n neither the lawsuits against Banobras nor in the domestic arbitration against Acapulco did Acaverde allege any violations of NAFTA or international law, and specifically it did not assert any legal theories based on \u2018expropriation\u2019 or violations of the minimum standard of treatment required under international law.\" Claimant\u2019s Memorial further described the claims as follows:\n\n\"The two lawsuits against Banobras were filed in Mexico City district court on January 27, 1997 and July 31, 1998 and were based on Banobras\u2019breach of the Line of Credit Agreement. The first suit was for the 1996 unpaid invoices and the second suit was for the 1997 invoices.\" *(Id.,* p. 6, para. 4.14.)\n\nAt the date of the Memorial (September 29, 1999) Claimant stated that:\n\n\"Only an *amparo* proceeding remains pending with respect to the first suit against Banobras, and the trial court dismissed the second suit based on an argument submitted by Acapulco. Acapulco appeared at the request of the court and argued that Acaverde\u2019s claims related to unpaid invoices should be settled under the arbitration clause in the Concession.\"\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial of September 29, 1999 (p. 2, para. 4) set forth \"at least two violations of NAFTA Chapter Eleven, Section A\"\u2014specified as breaches of NAFTA Article 1110 and 1105. It characterized them as follows:\n\n\"By revoking Waste Management\u2019s concession without compensation, Mexico effectively expropriated the fair market value of Waste Management\u2019s investment.\" (Article 1110 claim; *id.,* p. 2, para. 1.4.)  \n \"Mexico\u2019s arbitrary refusal to perform its obligations under the Concession and its affirmative acts to thwart it violate recognized rules of international law, especially those related to long-term economic development.\" (Article 1105 claim; *id.,* p. 2, para.1.5.)\n\n18.\n\nA nationalization or expropriation\u2014in particular a \"creeping expropriation\" comprised of numerous components\u2014must logically be more than the mere sum of its parts: see, for example, the assertion made in the Memorial that \"When Acaverde sought payment from Banobras under the guarantee, the City [of Acapulco] *conspired with Banobras,* another State organ, *to deny payment to Acaverde* under Banobras\u2019 guarantee.\"20\n\nMemorial, p. 46, para. 5.22. (Italics added.)\n\n19.\n\nHere reference may be made to the recent award in the *Azinian* case referred to by Respondent.21 The *Azinian* Tribunal stated that:\n\n\"...a foreign investor entitled in principle to protection under NAFTA may enter into contractual relations with a public authority, and may suffer a breach by that authority, and *still not be in a position to state a claim under NAFTA. \"22*\n\nThe award continued:\n\n\"The problem is that the Claimants\u2019 fundamental complaint is that they are the victims of a breach of the Concession Contract. *NAFTA does not, however, allow investors to seek international arbitration for mere contractual breaches.* Indeed, NAFTA cannot possibly be read to create such a regime, which would have elevated a multitude of ordinary transactions with public authorities into potential international disputes.\"23\n\nThus the *Azinian* decision is consistent with a conclusion that Acaverde\u2019s claims against Banobras or Acapulco were not *ipso facto* and by themselves claims under Chapter Eleven and, consequently, that the Article 1121 waiver submitted by Claimant would not have been inconsistent with the maintenance of those claims in the Mexican courts.\n\n*Azinian et al. v. United Mexican States,* Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, award dispatched on November 1, 1999 (typescript), p. 27, para. 97 (italics in original).\n\n*Azinian,* p. 23, para. 83 (italics in original).\n\n*Id.,* p. 25, para. 87 (italics added).\n\n20.\n\nRespondent cited *Azinian* with approval. Indeed, in its Counter-Memorial Respondent indicated that\n\n\"The Respondent wishes the Claimant to be on notice that, if the Claimant persists in seeking compensation under Chapter Eleven, *the Respondent will rely in part on the defense that a claim for breach of contract is not actionable under the NAFTA\u2014* especially when the Claimant has had access to judicial process under the domestic legal system, and there is no indication that the domestic judicial proceedings were themselves inconsistent with international law.\"24\n\nCounter-Memorial, p. 25, para. 113 (italics added).\n\n21.\n\nBy this statement, Mexico ironically placed Claimant and the Tribunal on notice that its own defense on the merits in these proceedings will be precisely congruent with the *ratio decidendi* of *Azinian.* That legal position however is directly opposite to Respondent\u2019s position in the present jurisdictional phase of these proceedings\u2014a legal position that rests on the inarticulate major premise that the local Mexican claims and the NAFTA claims are in substance the same. By its statement, Respondent in effect conceded that Claimant\u2019s waiver could not have been expected to be applicable to the domestic Mexican litigations.\n\n22.\n\nThe waiver referred to one thing, and the Mexican litigations concerned another. As *Azinian* cogently points out, and as Respondent has accepted in a different context, litigations concerning mere contract claims alone cannot constitute \"proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116\" within the meaning of Article 1121. How then could the waiver offered by Claimants have been defective\u2014 either on a formal basis or as a result of Claimant\u2019s contemporaneous and subsequent conduct?\n\n(c) \"With respect to\"\n---------------------\n\n23.\n\nMoreover, are the proceedings in this case *\"proceedings with respect to* [the] measure... that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116?\" This question is the other side of the coin of examining whether the measure contested in domestic proceedings is a \"measure\" actionable under NAFTA; instead, this question asks whether the proceedings themselves are actually addressed to such a measure.\n\n24.\n\nThe natural and ordinary meaning of the phrase \"with respect to\" is specific, narrow, and precise. It means that the proceeding in question must be a proceeding \"with respect to\" a given measure of the disputing Party; as a legal matter, this means that the proceeding must primarily concern, or be addressed to, that measure. (The French and Spanish texts of NAFTA are in agreement; the result is the same in the plain and ordinary reading of all three languages.25)\n\nThe French text of Article 1121.1(b) is:\n\n\"...renoncent \u00e0 leur droit d\u2019engager ou de poursuivre, devant un tribunal judiciaire ou administratif aux termes de la l\u00e9gislation d\u2019une Partie ou d\u2019une autre proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des diff\u00e9rends, *des proc\u00e9dures se rapportant \u00e0 la mesure de la Partie contestante pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e constituer un manquement vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 1116.\"* (Italics added.)\n\nA \"proc\u00e9dure *se rapportant \u00e0* la mesure de la Partie contestante\" is a procedure that addresses or relates to that measure directly; it is not merely *\"en relation avec\"* that measure.  \n The Spanish text is:\n\n\"...renuncia a su derecho a iniciar o continuar cualquier procedimiento ante un tribunal administrativo o judicial conforme al derecho de cualquiera de las Partes *u otros procedimientos de soluci\u00f3n de controversias respecto a la medida presuntamente violatoria de las disposiciones a las que se refiere el Art\u00edculo 1116.\"* (Italics added.)\n\nA \"procedimiento *respecto a* la medida\" is, again, a procedure that addresses or relates to that measure directly, and is not merely *\"en relaci\u00f3n con\"* that measure.\n\n25.\n\nThis precise meaning\u2014that a proceeding be brought that directly concerns or attacks a specific measure\u2014is quite different from the natural and ordinary meaning of a different phrase, such as \"relating to\" or \"concerning.\" Many proceedings may \"relate to\" or \"concern\" a measure without being proceedings \"with respect to\" that measure. For example: a sexual harassment case may \"relate to\" or \"concern\" the protection of worker\u2019s rights in the workplace, but is not itself a proceeding \"with respect to\" such protection; a proceeding \"with respect to\" the protection of workers\u2019 rights would have to be one that is brought as a matter of labor law, in a wholly different context.\n\n26.\n\nThus a claim for theft of office equipment from an alien may \"relate to\" or \"concern\" a claim for State responsibility under a treaty (in the sense that the host State may not have provided the requisite minimum protection for the alien), but that claim is not a claim \"with respect to\" such State responsibility. That would have to be a claim directly addressing that issue. It would have to involve other elements, such as a refusal to prosecute, denial of access to the courts\u2014in short, a \"denial of justice\" under international law for which the State would bear responsibility under the treaty or customary international law.\n\n4. Did Claimant\u2019s conduct render the waiver ineffective?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe majority of the Tribunal considers the substantive conduct of Claimant in maintaining and appealing the Mexican actions to be determinative of its lack of jurisdiction in this matter inasmuch as it is viewed as disqualifying or rendering null and void any formal waiver provided at the outset of the NAFTA arbitration. The heart of the Award rests on this reasoning and this conclusion.26 However, if the existence of the Mexican litigations in this case was not incompatible with the terms of the Article 1121 waiver, the conduct of Claimant in maintaining or appealing those litigations could not have been incompatible with it.\n\nAward, \u00a7\u00a7 24-29, pp. 16-19.\n\n28.\n\nIf the Article 1121 waiver had been intended to cover any and all concurrent legal activity, then clearly Claimant\u2019s course of conduct in Mexico would be inconsistent with it and would vitiate the waiver [given at the institution of arbitral proceedings under NAFTA for failure to satisfy the condition precedent stipulated by Article 1121.1(b)]. This would be so even if the waiver had been formally sufficient on its face at the time it was given. But, if the Article 1121 waiver had been intended only to relate to certain types of concurrent legal activity, then Claimant\u2019s course of conduct in Mexico could only be inconsistent with the waiver if the course of conduct related precisely to that legal activity. The causes of action are different: focal commercial claims in the Mexican tribunals, and international treaty claims before this Tribunal.\n\n5. Other considerations\n-----------------------\n\n(a) Relationship to the merits\n------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Award\u2019s analysis rests squarely on the premise that the municipal Mexican proceedings fall within the waiver of NAFTA Article 1121, insofar as *\"se refieren a medidas que tambi\u00e9n son invocadas en el presente procedimiento arbitral* como violatorias de disposiciones del TLCAN.\"27 Similarly, the Award characterizes the Mexican proceedings as being \"con identidad de sujetos a los efectos del art\u00edculo 1121 del TLCAN ya que, de acuerdo con este Tratado, el Gobierno Mexicano habr\u00eda de ser responsable por las acciones indebidas de BANOBRAS y ACAPULCO.\"28\n\nAward, \u00a7 27, p. 19 (italics added).\n\nAward, \u00a7 29, p. 20. Likewise: \"El hecho... de que *el objeto de los procedimientos \u00edni-ciados en contra de BANOBRAS y ACAPULCO se refiriera a una de las medidas presuntamente violatorias de las disposiciones del TLCAN* es prueba suficiente, a tenor de lo dispuesto por el propio art\u00edculo 1121 del TLCAN, para encuadrarlo dentro las conductas que proh\u00edbe la renuncia a la que se refiere este art\u00edculo.\" Award, \u00a7 27, p. 19 (italics added). However, as seen above, what Article 1121 refers to is not just that the \"objeto de los procedimientos... se *refiriera* a una de las medidas presuntamente violatorias de las disposiciones del TLCAN,\" but that the proceedings themselves (not just their object) be *\"with respect to* the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116.\" What is required is more than a mere reference: it is a direct relationship to the NAFTA measure.\n\n30.\n\nIt is important to address the question whether a tribunal may decide a jurisdictional objection on the basis of an *a priori* legal analysis alone, or whether further factual examination of the background of the case is required to support the conclusions to be reached. In the present case, it might well appear that the inquiry would require examination of the terms of the complaints filed in the two Banobras litigations as well as the Acapulco arbitration. To the extent that the Tribunal for these purposes needs to assume a factual record outside the immediate record submitted in connection with the current dispute on jurisdiction, its analysis invades the merits of the dispute between the Parties. The Tribunal should then have deferred its final decision to the merits phase of the arbitration under Article 40, paragraph 4 of the Additional Facility Rules (which would seem to have been tailor-made for just such a situation).\n\n31.\n\nMoreover, an inquiry into whether the local claims are the same as the NAFTA claims could readily be assisted by comparing the damages sought in this NAFTA arbitration with the damages sought in the Mexican cases. Such an inquiry could have been dispositive of the question of the non-identity of the Mexican cases with the NAFTA claim.29 The Mexican litigations in 1998 and 1999 could therefore not have been, on their face, *\"proceedings with respect to the measure\"* of expropriation or nationalization complained of by Claimant, since the amount sought in damages in Mexico was more than eight million dollars less than the amount sought in the present proceedings. Although an analysis of this nature could have resolved the matter in Claimant\u2019s favor, it quintessentially enters into the merits of the dispute and should have been deferred to that stage.\n\nFor example, it is only necessary to consult the document submitted by Mexico at the hearing on January 31st, which has not been disputed by Claimant, in order to see this. (\"Materials in Support of Respondent\u2019s Oral Submission\" at Tabs 2 \"Legal Proceedings Chronology\" and 3 \"Extracts from the Pleadings of WMI and Acaverde in Different Fora\"). In particular, the last document, \"Extracts from the Pleadings of WMI and Acaverde in Different Fora,\" demonstrates clearly and succinctly how the Mexican proceedings were not the same as the present NAFTA arbitration. In a rough calculation in United States dollars, and excluding all costs, it is easy to see that the amounts actually claimed by Acaverde in Mexico were \u00b1 U.S. $28,339,343 and that the amounts claimed in the present NAFTA arbitration are $36,630,000\u2014a difference of some U.S. $8,290,657, or approximately 23%.\n\n(b) Waiver and withdrawal\n-------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe key element in the majority\u2019s reasoning in this case is the premise that the formal, jurisdictional, requirement of the Article 1121 waiver depends not merely on the compliance of a claimant with the technical prerequisites of Article 1121, Paragraph 3,30 but also upon the conduct of a claimant subsequent to the writing, delivery, and inclusion required by that paragraph.31 Thus, the majority has read into the text of Article 1121 the additional requirement that litigations subject to the waiver be affirmatively withdrawn, that no further litigation be instituted, and that no appeals be conducted.\n\n\"A consent and waiver required by this Article shall be in writing, shall be delivered to the disputing Party and shall be included in the submission of a claim to arbitration.\"\n\nAward, \u00a7 24, p. 16. Thus, the Award states: \"este Tribunal deber\u00e1 comprobar que WASTE MANAGEMENT ha presentado la renuncia de acuerdo con las formalidades previstas en el TLCAN y que ha respetado los t\u00e9rminos de la misma a trav\u00e9s del acto material de desistir o no iniciar procedimientos paralelos ante otros tribunales.\" (Award, \u00a7 20, p. 14.) The Award reasons that:\n\n\"Se hace necesaria pues una valoraci\u00f3n del comportamiento del sujeto que renuncia as\u00ed como de la responsabilidad que deber\u00e1 asumir si se produce una divergencia entre lo manifestado y el comportamiento efectivamente realizado ya que \u00e9l y solo \u00e9l responde de la eficacia de tal declaraci\u00f3n en virtud del llamado principio de la autorresponsabilidad.\" (Award, \u00a7 24, p. 16)\n\nAnd the majority continues, to find that:\n\n\"A tenor de lo hasta ahora expuesto, es claro que la renuncia exigida en virtud del art\u00edculo 1121 del TLCAN requiere una manifestaci\u00f3n de voluntad por parte de quien la emite en cuanto a la renuncia a iniciar o continuar cualesquiera procedimientos ante otros foros respecto a la medida presuntamente violatoria de las disposiciones a las que se refiere el TLCAN.\" *(Ibid)*\n\nIts conclusion follows:\n\n\"Asimismo, esta dejaci\u00f3n de derechos debi\u00f3 hacerse efectiva a partir de la fecha de la presentatci\u00f3n de la renuncia, esto es, el 29 de septiembre de 1998. *La referida declaraci\u00f3n de voluntad tambi\u00e9n exige un determinado comportamiento de la declarante,* WASTE MANAGEMENT, exteriorizador del compromiso adquirido en virtud de la citada renuncia.\" *{Ibid.,* italics added.)\n\n33.\n\nIn its written pleadings and oral presentation, Claimant insisted on the position that, once the waiver had been prepared and delivered in accordance with Article 1121, paragraph 3, it was up to Respondent to use it as it saw fit. It is hard to find fault with such reasoning. This is precisely the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 1121, paragraph 3, when read in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of this provision of NAFTA, which (as stressed by Canada in its written submission to the Tribunal) were clearly to avoid a multiplicity of causes of action, duplication of proceedings, and forum-shopping:\u2014all with respect however to the *same* claims or causes of action.\n\n34.\n\nHowever, if Chapter Eleven had affirmatively contemplated the termination of litigation in national courts by claimants, why didn\u2019t it say so? The NAFTA Parties were fully competent to agree on language to that effect. Instead, they agreed on the formal requirements of Article 1121, paragraph 3, specifying only that a waiver should be in writing and delivered to the respondent. To require submission of a written waiver at the outset of a NAFTA arbitration, and then to require (as the majority of this Tribunal does) that the pending local litigations be discontinued or terminated by the claimant\u2014not by the respondent\u2014suggests that there was no purpose for the written waiver to begin with. There surely would have been no benefit or result from its \"delivery\" to the respondent in writing; the claimant would have been expected to do\u2014and should already have done\u2014all the work.\n\n35.\n\nThis conclusion is confirmed when it is recognized that there is no evidence that Respondent did anything whatever to use or exercise the waiver in these proceedings. It is mystifying how this could have been the case when the content of the waiver had been, from 1998 through the fall of 1999, subject to intensive scrutiny and argumentation. Respondent in the present proceedings could not have been ignorant of the existence of the two Banobras litigations or of the arbitration brought by Acaverde against Acapulco; yet there is no evidence that steps were taken to introduce that written waiver into any of those proceedings.\n\n36.\n\nMoreover, the reasoning of the majority in this Award does not take into account the issue of the date at which Claimant\u2019s conduct must be viewed as conforming with Article 1121. Is it on the same day, or the day after? Must it be one month after the institution of proceedings? No answer is suggested, perhaps for the simple reason that it would seem absurd to suggest a cut-off\u2014and in particular when a compliant written waiver has already been executed by Claimant and delivered to Respondent. To read Article 1121 as requiring an active discontinuance of proceedings (either simultaneously or subsequently) as well as active delivery of the waiver is, in fact, to dilute the credibility or efficacy of the written waiver and is inconsistent with requiring its delivery in the first place.\n\n(c) Relevance of Annex 1120.1\n-----------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe conclusions just drawn should also be tested against the relevant Mexican Annex (1120.1) to NAFTA. This provision was appended to NAFTA at the insistence of Mexico. It was intended to deal with the problem presented by Mexican constitutional law; in the Mexican system, provisions of treaty law such as NAFTA automatically become provisions of domestic Mexican law and are enforceable as such.\n\n38.\n\nIn its English version, Annex 1120.1 reads that:\n\n\"An investor of another Party may not allege that Mexico has breached an obligation under [Chapter Eleven]... both in arbitration under this [NAFTA] and in proceedings before a Mexican court or administrative tribunal.\"32\n\nThe meaning of this provision is quite clear. It closes the door, literally and figuratively, on the possibility of any legal action being maintained in the Mexican courts by a foreign investor while at the same time NAFTA proceedings are being conducted. It was a duplication of the same kind of protection that was contemplated by the waiver requirement of Article 1121, but, since NAFTA is automatically incorporated by Mexican constitutional law into Mexican domestic law, Annex 1120.1 to NAFTA would be even more secure than the Article 1121 waiver since it would automatically form part of Mexican law. Annex 1120.1 could then, as a matter of Mexican law, have been asserted in any Mexican court (or in an arbitral tribunal applying Mexican law) as a flat bar against the continuation of any proceeding pending in such a court or tribunal that constituted an allegation that Mexico has breached an obligation under Chapter Eleven.\n\nAnnex 1120.1 in its French version reads as follows: \"En ce qui concerne la soumission d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 l\u2019arbitrage: (a) un investisseur d\u2019une autre Partie ne pourra all\u00e9guer que le Mexique a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une obligation au termes (i) de la section A ou du paragraphe 1503(2) (Entreprises d\u2019Etat), ou (ii) de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1502(3)a) (Monopoles et entreprises d\u2019Etat), lorsque le monopole a agi de fa\u00e7on incompatible avec les obligations de la Partie aux termes de la section A, dans le cadre d\u2019un arbitrage aux termes de la pr\u00e9sente section et d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure soumise \u00e0 un tribunal judiciaire ou administratif mexicain....\" There is no substantive difference in this text from the meaning to be given to the English version. In its Spanish version, Annex 1120.1 reads as follows: \"Respecto al sometimiento de la reclamaci\u00f3n al arbitraje: (a) un inversionista de otra Parte no podr\u00e1 alegar que M\u00e9xico ha violado una obligaci\u00f3n establecida en: (i) la Secci\u00f3n A o en el Art\u00edculo 1503(2), \"Empresas del Estado\"; o (ii) el Art\u00edculo 1502(3)(a), \"Monopolios y empresas del Estado\", cuando el monopolio ha actuado de manera incompatible con las obligaciones de la Parte de conformidad con la Secci\u00f3n A, tanto en un procedimiento arbitral conforme a esta secci\u00f3n, como en procedimientos ante un tribunal judicial o administrativo mexicano....\" There is no substantive difference in this text from the meaning to be given to the English version.\n\n39.\n\nHowever, the only \"obligation\" under Chapter Eleven that could have been blocked by Annex 1120.1 in respect of Banobras would have been not to engage in creeping expropriation or other treatment inconsistent with international law. Breaches of obligations such as these were not alleged in the Banobras lawsuits or the arbitration. The fact that Mexico never saw fit to invoke this provision (either in Mexico after July or September of 1998, or in the present proceedings) further supports the conclusion that the obligations now sought to be enforced in the NAFTA claim are distinct from those in the local Mexican proceedings. The latter could not have involved a breach of obligations under NAFTA since they would then have been blocked by the Annex as a matter of Mexican law. If they were not blocked by the Annex they could not have been proceedings as to which the waiver would have applied. If they were not proceedings as to which the waiver would have applied, then Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection must fail.\n\n6. What is the policy behind Article 1121?\n------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Views of other NAFTA members\n--------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nCanada presented a written submission to the Tribunal on December 17, 1999. The United States made no statement or submission. In its submission, Canada stated that:\n\n\"The same measure... cannot be the subject of both a Chapter 11 arbitration and domestic court proceedings. The investor has a clear choice and can choose one or the other\u2014but not both.\"33\n\n\"Submission of the Government of Canada\" dated December 17, 1999, para. 5.\n\n41.\n\nThe question is however \"begged,\" as it is a *petitio principii* to conclude that the \"measures\" concerned in the Mexican litigations and the \"measures\" concerned in the present arbitration are necessarily the same. This must be decided on the specific facts of each case. The test to be applied is whether, for example, a non-payment under a guarantee is in fact a \"measure\" of expropriation or nationalization referred to in Chapter Eleven, or whether it is merely part of such a measure.\n\n42.\n\nThis analysis is however not inconsistent with Canada\u2019s submission. Canada\u2019s concern that \"no domestic proceeding has been initiated or continued with respect to the measure alleged to be in breach of Chapter 11\" is fully justified: a claimant should not be able to litigate expropriation or nationalization in domestic courts and in a NAFTA tribunal at the same time. A determination by one tribunal might conflict with the determination by the other; a classic case of \"forum-shopping\" would have been presented. Such a risk is not raised, however, by collateral domestic proceedings that only relate to a portion of the factual background underlying or supporting the NAFTA claim.34\n\nFor example, in the present situation since both Banobras litigations\u2014as they did\u2014went against Claimant, would they not be dispositive of the issue of liability *pro tanto* on the guarantee for payment of the unpaid invoices?\n\n43.\n\nIt is wholly reasonable to assume that Canada, Mexico and the United States could not have desired to have parallel or overlapping litigations in their national courts asserting claims under Chapter Eleven of NAFTA: *i.e.* seeking judgment that such-and-such a State action was violative of an obligation arising under NAFTA. None of the NAFTA Parties would have wished to contemplate parallel actions in their own judicial systems that would raise NAFTA claims, or interpret the provisions of NAFTA, or seek remedies for the alleged breach of obligations imposed by NAFTA. But that is not the same at all as barring local remedies for commercial claims which\u2014if denied\u2014would or could form a component of a subsequent NAFTA proceeding (such as the present case).\n\n44.\n\nIndeed, it would be an extreme price to pay in order to engage in NAFTA arbitration for a NAFTA claimant to be forced to abandon all local remedies relating to commercial law recoveries that could have some bearing on its NAFTA claim\u2014but which nonetheless were not themselves NAFTA claims. This could not have been the reasonable intent of the NAFTA Parties.35 It would have been a far more credible objective for the NAFTA Parties\u2014consistent with the observations of Canada\u2014to have sought to eliminate forum-shopping only as to NAFTA claims, since this is where the conflict could arise.\n\nThe record before the Tribunal is unfortunately bare of useful evidence of *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of NAFTA in this regard\n\n45.\n\nWhen could a NAFTA tribunal be placed in the position of \"reversing\" a decision of, *e.g.,* the Mexican courts? The NAFTA tribunal would of course have no jurisdiction to do so. What would have to be alleged in respect of those decisions would not be a disguised appeal of these decisions. It would have to be a NAFTA claim, such as for a substantial denial of justice in respect of those proceedings, and that\u2014again\u2014is a separate matter from conducting appeals under local law, but not asserting the protection of the treaty itself.\n\n46.\n\nThe **Azinian** case is significant in this context.36 In that award, the Tribunal stated most precisely that \"A governmental authority surely cannot be faulted for acting in a manner validated by its courts *unless the courts themselves are disavowed at the international level.\"37* The **Azinian** award then devoted considerable attention to the issue of examining the decision of municipal courts,38 but the majority of this Tribunal did not reach that stage of the analysis.\n\nSee footnote 21 *supra.*\n\n*Azinian,* p. 27, para. 97 (italics in original).\n\n*Id.,* pp. 27-30, paras. 98-105 *et seq.*\n\n47.\n\nA jurisdictional objection on the grounds advanced by Respondent in the present phase of this arbitration should, for the reasons given, never succeed. This does not violate the principle of effectiveness as to Article 1121, since the Article 1121 waiver could effectively and immediately block (as could also Annex 1120.1) a local Mexican litigation complaining of a nationalization, or of discriminatory conduct actionable under NAFTA. Moreover, Mexico is doubly protected. It is the anomalous nature of Mexico\u2019s jurisdictional objection in the present case that should therefore guarantee its lack of success. It would only be where a lawsuit had been commenced in domestic courts *that essentially alleged the equivalent of a violation of Chapter Eleven* that there would be a clear preemption (either by the Article 1121 waiver or the Annex 1120.1 bar). Such a case or cases would have to allege nationalization, expropriation, taking\u2014direct or indirect\u2014and other action inconsistent with international obligations of the Respondent.\n\n48.\n\nIn the case of Mexico, at least, those international obligations could be actionable under domestic municipal law and so the risk of collateral and duplicative proceedings is not fanciful. There however the waiver could have immediately been used, and the provisions of Article 1121 would have had genuine meaning. In that instance, both the formal sufficiency of the waiver and its congruence with the Claimant\u2019s conduct could have been examined merely on the face of the pleadings involved. Nor would the Tribunal have been required to trespass on the merits of the dispute.\n\n49.\n\nThe concern expressed by the Government of Canada in its submission, that \" [t]he same measure... cannot be the subject of both a Chapter 11 arbitration and domestic court proceedings,\"39 would therefore have been addressed and resolved. The Canadian concerns would never apply to partial, incomplete, and subordinate legal activity unrelated to the measure that is itself susceptible of complaint under NAFTA. The focal actions and the NAFTA \"measures\" occupy different planes: the contractual and the tortious, the municipal and the international. However, if Claimant herein had brought a Chapter Eleven nationalization claim before the Mexican courts (a claim that would necessarily have included, but which went beyond, the component of non-payment by Banobras of its guarantees of the payment by Acapulco to Acaverde) the Canadian submission would then apply.\n\nSubmission of the Government of Canada, para. 5.\n\n50.\n\nMoreover, if a  NAFTA claimant does wish to take its chances with pursuing focal remedies for constituent elements or component parts of a larger treaty claim, why does this necessarily create conflict between national courts and international arbitration? If, for example, Acaverde\u2019s first claim against Banobras had been decided favorably to Acaverde by the Mexican courts, but its second claim unfavorably, what would this Tribunal have had to deal with on the merits? A nationalization claim, to be sure, would still exist, but it would be reduced *pro tanto* by the amount of the recovery by Acaverde in the successful action for a component of that nationalization claim; Mexico would have been relieved of State responsibility under the NAFTA claim to the extent of those focal damages already recovered. \"The investor,\" wrote Canada, \"has a clear choice and can choose one [proceeding] or another\u2014but not both,\"40 and that is correct.\n\nCanadian submission, para. 5.\n\n51.\n\nThus, if a NAFTA claimant should choose to litigate one or more focal components of a NAFTA claim in focal courts, no harm is done. If it prevails, then its NAFTA claim is reduced *pro tanto* unless, of course, some additional (and new) elements such as denial of justice or proper judicial access is asserted. It is difficult to see how there could be such an additional element if the NAFTA claimant has been successful in its recourse to focal remedies. On the other hand, to the extent that the focal remedies were unavailing, as in the present case, the NAFTA claimant\u2019s basis of claim against the contesting government would again be reduced by application of the *res judicata* of the unfavorable local result unless, and to the extent that, such unfavorable local result were to be considered itself as an international denial of justice.\n\n52.\n\nFor example, in *Azinian* the claimants had initiated the NAFTA proceedings two years after the termination of their local appeals in the Mexican court system. What substantive difference, however, is there between that situation and the present one, where the local appeals had been terminated after the initiation of the NAFTA proceedings, but still before the arguments on jurisdiction in January? Even if the Acapulco arbitration may be viewed as merely dormant, Claimant has definitively indicated that it was not proceeding, and would not proceed, with any further recourse to local remedies in the present case,41 and even went so far as to request guidance from the Tribunal as to what\u2014if any\u2014further steps it could take to eliminate any question concerning the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\nThis was done unequivocally in its oral written submission to this Tribunal and less directly in its written pleadings; see Claimant\u2019s Memorial of September 29, 1999; pp. 36-37, paras. 4.16 and 4.17. At the hearing of January 31, 2000, Claimant was explicit in stating that it would thenceforth not pursue any local remedies in Mexico.\n\n53.\n\nThus, even if the substance of the Article 1121 waiver had been\u2014as the majority of the Tribunal believes\u2014eviscerated in 1998 or 1999, why was that substance not restored in later in 1999 or in January 2000? Unless the Tribunal can conclude that the Article 1121 waiver was defective upon delivery in 1998 *and could never have been restored,* the conclusion must be that the damage done by Claimant\u2019s conduct was always subject to remediation and that such conduct could have been brought into line with the waiver before the hearing in the case. But by tacking back the effects of the conduct *nunc pro tunc,* the Tribunal has conflated the ideas of a formal jurisdictional defect in the waiver in September 1998 with a subsequent disqualification of the waiver in 1998 or 1999.\n\n54.\n\nThat conflation should have only a retrospective and not a prospective effect. Yet if subsequent conduct can disqualify the waiver, the conduct must either be assessed at the moment (a *scintilla juris)* after the delivery of the waiver, or at some other time. Since it would be absurd to require all NAFTA claimants to withdraw all litigation pursuing local remedies simultaneously with the delivery of the waiver\u2014the waiver\u2019s delivery would then not have served any common-sense objective\u2014there must be a grace period within which claimants may bring themselves into compliance. Why then can a claimant not avail itself of a similar grace period within which, after the termination of all local remedies, the waiver (on this tortuous analysis) can be seen as becoming rehabilitated or revitalized, and once more in full force and effect?\n\n55.\n\nThe correct conclusion must be that NAFTA claimants can be considered as failing to satisfy the jurisdictional waiver requirements of Article 1121 only as long as and to the extent that inconsistent recourse to local remedies is maintained in the local national courts. The *status quo ante* must be considered as susceptible of restoration once such an inconsistent recourse is terminated or abandoned, and not otherwise resumed.42 An elementary application of the principle of effectiveness in the interpretation of international undertakings *(ut magis res valeat quam pereat)* therefore makes it impossible to hold that a defective waiver can never be remedied.\n\nThe foregoing discussion must again be premised on the understanding that the only truly conflicting local remedies would, in fact, be local remedies sought \"with respect to\" the same measure complained of as the actual NAFTA breach.\n\n(b) Jurisdiction and admissibility\n----------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe question also arises whether this case is one of jurisdiction or one of admissibility. The only way in which these proceedings can be viewed as relating to jurisdiction is to add a requirement of consonant subsequent conduct to the jurisdictional requirement of Article 1121. However this is affirmative action not mentioned in Article 1121, paragraph 3, and is actually inconsistent with its ordinary meaning and its object and purpose. By finding that Claimant\u2019s conduct subsequent to 29 September 199843 lacked the necessary \"manifestaci\u00f3n de voluntad por parte de quien... emite [la renuncia],\" the majority of the Tribunal has transformed what should, if anything, have been a question of admissibility into a question of jurisdiction. The result of this transformation is that the Award is able to dismiss Claimant\u2019s case *in limine* on jurisdictional grounds, rather than having to determine whether any portions of that case should subsequently be barred or blocked on grounds of inadmissibility.\n\nSee Award, \u00a7 24, p. 16, last paragraph.\n\n57.\n\nInternational decisions are replete with fine distinctions between jurisdiction and admissibility. For the purpose of the present proceedings it will suffice to observe that lack of jurisdiction refers to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and inadmissibility refers to the admissibility of the case.44\n\nThe former is established (or not) at the outset of the proceedings, and the tribunal for these purposes exercises the *\"comp\u00e9tence de la comp\u00e9tence\"* in order to make this determination. The latter can only be determined if the tribunal has jurisdiction to determine it\u2014not the *comp\u00e9tence de la comp\u00e9tence* relating to jurisdictional matters, but genuine jurisdiction to adjudicate the case.\n\n58.\n\nJurisdiction is the power of the tribunal to hear the case; admissibility is whether the case itself is defective\u2014whether it is appropriate for the tribunal to hear it. If there is no title of jurisdiction, then the tribunal cannot act.45 Such would be the case here if the waiver under Article 1121 had never been given, or were defective. Moreover, a claim of lack of jurisdiction ought normally be decided without trenching upon the merits of the case at all; in some instances, however, this will not be possible.46 Likewise, a tribunal may be able to determine a challenge to the admissibility of a claim without invading the merits of the case, but it is more likely that such an examination will have to be postponed and joined to the merits.47\n\nIf the Claimant\u2019s case is inadmissible, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear it, but should decline it on grounds relating to the case itself\u2014not relating to the role or powers of the Tribunal. An example of this might be where a claimant\u2019s nationality is questionable or double, but where the Tribunal otherwise has jurisdiction. Another example might be if the claim is time-barred or where there is a similar substantive defect on the face of the complaint which does not, however, invalidate or depreciate the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction as such.\n\nArticle 79 of the Rules of the International Court of Justice contemplates instances where a jurisdictional (or admissibility) objection may not \"possess, in the circumstances of the case, an exclusively preliminary character,\" and should therefore be considered together with the merits of the case.\n\nFor this purpose, see the recent decision of the International Court of Justice in the *Land and Maritime Boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria, Preliminary Objections, Judgment of 11 June 1998, I.C.J. Reports 1998,* p. 275; and also *South West Africa, Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1966,* p. 6 at p. 19, para. 7.\n\n59.\n\nIn the present case it is quite evident that the Award has dealt with a matter of admissibility of the claim rather than the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The insufficiency of the waiver itself is the only element that could legally affect jurisdiction under Article 1121. Once that waiver has been delivered, jurisdiction exists and the proceedings under NAFTA could be started. If conduct inconsistent with that waiver requirement subsequently shows that the waiver is hollow or frustrates its object and purpose, this would be a matter of admissibility: it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to adjudicate the case, insofar as the waiver originally validly submitted in connection with it had in effect been repudiated by the Claimant\u2019s subsequent conduct.\n\n60.\n\nIn the recent NAFTA case of *Ethyl v. Canada,48* the Tribunal considered the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility. It said that it \"has little trouble deciding that Claimant\u2019s unexpected delay in complying with Article 1121 is not of significance for jurisdiction in this case,\" and added:\n\n\"While Article 1121\u2019s title characterizes its requirements as \u2018Conditions Precedent,\u2019 it does not say to what they are precedent. Canada\u2019s contention that they are a precondition to jurisdiction, as opposed to a prerequisite to admissibility, is not borne out by the text of Article 1121, which must govern.\"49\n\nThe Tribunal in *Ethyl* however awarded to Canada its own costs and the costs of the Tribunal \"attributable to the proceedings insofar as they have related to issues under NAFTA Articles 1119, 1120 and 1121.\"50\n\n*Ethyl Corporation v. The Government of Canada (Award on Jurisdiction),* June 24, 1998; 38 I.L.M. 1999 at 708. In that case the issue presented was whether jurisdiction should fail because the written waivers by Claimants \"were provided only with the Statement of Claim... and not with the Notice of Arbitration... which according to Article 1137(l)(c), is when the \u2018claim [was] submitted to arbitration\u2019 under Section B. The sufficiency of the consent and waivers thus provided is not otherwise questioned.\" *Id.* at p. 729, para. 89. *{See also* case note by Alan C. Swan in 94 Am. J. Int\u2019l L. (January 2000) 159, at p. 162.)\n\nThe Tribunal continued, to say: \"Article 1121(3), instead of saying \u2018shall be included in the submission of a claim to arbitration\u2019\u2014in itself a broadly encompassing concept\u2014, could have said \u2018shall be included with the Notice of Arbitration\u2019 *if the drastically preclusive effect for which Canada argues truly was intended.* The Tribunal therefore concludes that jurisdiction here is not absent due to Claimant\u2019s having provided the consent and waivers necessary under Article 1121 with its Statement of Claim rather than with its Notice of Arbitration.\" (Italics added.)\n\nSee *id.* at 730, para. 92:... the Tribunal deems it appropriate that claimant be responsible for the costs of the jurisdictional proceedings insofar as they have related to the issues arising in connection with Article 1121. No reason appears why the consent and waivers were not furnished with the Notice of Arbitration, *which would have been the better practice.* Had they been, a certain part of these proceedings would have been obviated.\" (Italics added.) *(See also* para. 3 of the *dispositif.* para. 96.3, *ibid.)*\n\n61.\n\nThe matter of admissibility is also related to the question of severability. If only one relatively minor conflicting lawsuit had been brought by Acaverde in the district court of Mexico, relating to one particular payment of, *e.g.,* one million pesos, and if such a case had been decided against Acaverde and were now being appealed, should the *entire* nationalization claim under NAFTA Articles 1110 and 1105 (for amounts more than the equivalent of three hundred million pesos) be disallowed on jurisdictional grounds merely because of the pendency of that appeal? This would be the result if the invalidity of the waiver by conduct were held to result in a lack of jurisdiction *a priori.* However, if the matter were considered to be one of admissibility rather than jurisdiction, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction would not have been ousted by the one million peso lawsuit. Only a portion of the claim before the Tribunal would have been inadmissible and thus affected. The rest of the claim, for hundreds of millions of pesos, would still have been admissible, and the Tribunal would have been able to exercise jurisdiction to adjudicate it.\n\n62.\n\nIt is this latter point that detained the arbitral tribunal in *Ethyl.*51 In *Ethyl* the Tribunal also engaged in a discussion of the \"Distinction Between Jurisdictional Provisions and Procedural Rules.\" It stated that:\n\n\"It is important to distinguish between jurisdictional provisions, *i.e.* the limits set to the authority of this Tribunal to act at all on the merits of the dispute, and procedural rules that must be satisfied by Claimant, but the failure to satisfy which results not in an absence of jurisdiction *ab initio,* but rather in a possible delay of proceedings, followed ultimately, should such non-compliance persist, by dismissal of the claim. \"52\n\nIn *Ethyl* the proceedings had been instituted under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, not the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. See *ibid.,* para. 59: \"The sole basis of jurisdiction under NAFTA Chapter 11 in an arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules is the consent of the Parties. Unlike ICSID and its Additional Facility Rules, there exist under the UNCITRAL Rules no other jurisdictional criteria....\" The Tribunal found that it \"is clear that Ethyl has consented to this arbitration by the very act of commencing it\" *(ibid.),* and that \" [t]he fundamental jurisdictional issue... therefore, is whether Canada has consented to this arbitration. It has two aspects, as the jurisdictional proceedings have underscored. One is of scope: Is Ethyl\u2019s claim within the types of claims that Canada has consent in Chapter 11 to arbitrate? The other aspect is that of conditions to consent: To what extent, if any, is Canada\u2019s consent to arbitration in Chapter 11 conditioned absolutely on the fulfillment of specified procedural requirements at a given time?\" *(Ibid.,* para. 60.) (In a footnote, the Tribunal drew attention to the discussion of ICSID\u2019s objective criteria in *Vacuum Salt Products Limited v. The Government of the Republic of Ghana,* ICSID Case No. ARB/92/1 (Award of 16 Feb. 1994), *reprinted in* 9 ICSID Rev.\u2014F.I.L.J. 72 (1994).)\n\n*Id.,* p. 724, para. 58.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal in this case has failed to acknowledge this important distinction and has heaved the baby, enthusiastically, out with the bath-water: the entire NAFTA claim has been undone. Such a harsh consequence can hardly be presumed to have been the intention of the NAFTA Parties when they executed the Treaty.\n\n(c) Additional considerations\n-----------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe foregoing analysis is consistent with the policy implications of Mexican Annex 1120.1.53 If the Annex were applicable to the domestic Mexican claims\u2014which it is not\u2014it would have avoided the absurd result just described. What was the original purpose of Annex 1120.1? Doubtless the inclusion of Annex 1120.154 was sought by Mexico simply because its constitutional framework could have made it possible for claimants to bring complaints under the NAFTA provisions themselves in the appropriate Mexican courts. This was a risk as to which Mexico naturally did not wish to have double exposure. In consequence, Mexico sought, and obtained, double protection.\n\nSee discussion above, in paragraphs 37-39 and 47-48.\n\nSee Article 31, para. 2(b) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: \"(2) The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, *including its preambles and annexes'.*... (b) any instrument which was made by one or more *parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\"* (Italics added.)\n\n65.\n\nHowever, the Annex was also self-limiting. On the example just given in paragraph 61, the automatic bar that it would present would have extended to the \"obligation\" of one million pesos, but not one centavo more; it would not have applied to the entire alleged obligation of Mexico, in the amount of more than three hundred million pesos, but only to the small portion concerned in the lawsuit.\n\n66.\n\nIt is not known why Mexico did not assert the automatic bar of Annex 1120.1 in this proceeding, except for the reason that it could not have been considered to be applicable. The necessary implication must be that Mexico did not consider that the Annex applied to the contractual disputes before Mexican courts.55 A further inference that can be drawn is that Mexico wished to preserve its right to have this arbitration thrown out on jurisdictional grounds and was therefore reluctant to test the waiver in case the waiver worked. Although the local Mexican actions would have been barred, Respondent would have then lost the opportunity of challenging the entire NAFTA arbitration proceedings on the ground that the waiver was defective or rendered defective.\n\nAs discussed above, to this extent it may also be inferred that Mexico has tacitly conceded that the Article 1121 waiver would not apply to those disputes.\n\n67.\n\nYet, if the waiver did *not* work, it would in all likelihood have been because the Mexican court or tribunal seeking to apply it would have perceived that the waiver applied to NAFTA breaches and not to breaches of the Civil or Commercial Codes of Mexico. In that event Respondent would again have been disappointed\u2014albeit for a different reason\u2014since the waiver would not have succeeded to block the local Mexican actions and, at the same time, Respondent would have lost its ability to successfully challenge the jurisdiction of this Tribunal. By using neither the waiver nor the provision of Annex 1120.1, Respondent has now successfully challenged jurisdiction.\n\n68.\n\nIt seems moreover artificial for this Tribunal to have concerned itself in painstaking detail with the interpretation and examination of a provision in an instrument that had been made available to Respondent by Claimant for more than a year and half, but which had not once been sought to be tested or applied by the Respondent in these proceedings. The only logical inference to be drawn from this course of conduct is that Respondent had reasons relating to the present arbitration for not seeking to have the waiver so applied or tested. The necessary logic of those reasons reinforces the legal analysis adopted by this dissenting opinion. It appears to support only one conclusion: that the waiver (and Annex 1120.1) did not apply to the local Mexican remedies that had been sought by Acaverde.\n\n69.\n\nThe conclusion so reached is in fact confirmed by the conclusion urged upon this Tribunal by *Mexico* when it placed Claimant \"on notice\" that Mexico would later rely on the defense that a local contract claim is not a NAFTA claim.56 Mexico thereby accepted the legal distinction between national claims and international remedies; reflected a point of view exactly consistent with the analysis conducted by the NAFTA Tribunal in the *Azinian* case; and confirmed the analysis set forth above in this dissenting opinion. To that extent, therefore, Mexico itself has expressed a position that does not support, and that neatly contradicts, the opinion of the majority constituting the decision contained in the present Award.\n\nSee the language quoted *supra* in paragraph 20."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn September 29, 1998, WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC., formerly known as USA Waste Services, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as WASTE MANAGEMENT or the Claimant), acting on its own behalf and on behalf of ACAVERDE S.A. de C.V. (hereinafter referred to as ACAVERDE), requested from the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), approval of access to the Additional Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of ICSID (hereinafter referred to as Additional Facility) and, jointly, filed a notice for the institution of arbitration proceedings against the Government of the UNITED MEXICAN STATES (hereinafter referred to as the Government of Mexico), in accordance with Article 2 of the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules (Schedule C).\n\nThe request for arbitration seeks compensation by way of damages for an alleged breach on the part of the state-owned entities, BANCO NACIONAL DE OBRAS Y SERVICIOS PUBLICOS, S. N.C. (hereinafter referred to as BANOBRAS), the MEXICAN STATE OF GUERRERO (hereinafter referred to as GUERRERO), and the CITY COUNCIL OF ACAPULCO DE JU\u00c1REZ (hereinafter referred to as ACAPULCO) of the obligations laid down by Articles 1105 and 1110 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (hereinafter referred to as NAFTA).\n\nThe rules applicable to these arbitration proceedings shall be those contained in the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, save to the extent that they may be amended by NAFTA Chapter XI, Section B, which establishes a dispute settlement procedure in investment-related matters.\n\nIn this regard, NAFTA Article 1120 lays down that, provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim, said claim may be submitted to arbitration by a disputing investor under the Additional Facility Rules.\n\n2.\n\nUpon receipt of the request for approval of access and of the notice of institution of arbitration proceedings by the Secretary-General of ICSID, copies thereof and of the accompanying documentation were dispatched to the Respondent. On 18 November 1998, the Secretary-General notified the parties of his approval of the request for access to the Additional Facility and registered the Notice, thereby initiating these arbitration proceedings.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal was constituted on 3 June 1999 and was composed of Mr. Julio Trevi\u00f1o Azcu\u00e9 (appointed by the Government of Mexico), Mr. Keith Highet (appointed by WASTE MANAGEMENT) and Mr. Bernardo M. Cremades (appointed as President of the Tribunal by agreement of the parties). At the first session of the Arbitral Tribunal, which took place at The Hague, Holland, on July 16, 1999, the Parties acknowledged that the Tribunal had been properly constituted.\n\nOn December 3, 1999, Mr. Julio C. Trevi\u00f1o Azcu\u00e9 tendered his resignation as arbitrator for health reasons. Pursuant to the provisions established in Article 15 the of Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, on 9 December 1999, the Arbitral Tribunal accepted the resignation submitted by Mr. Trevi\u00f1o, and duly advised the ICSID Secretary-General of the same. Accordingly, on 4 January 2000 the Government of Mexico appointed Mr. Eduardo Siqueiros T. as the new arbitrator, who thereupon accepted his appointment, in accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules.\n\nIn this arbitration, WASTE MANAGEMENT is represented by Counsel, Mr. Peter A. Moir of Baker & Botts, L.L.P., a Washington, D.C. based law firm. The Government of Mexico is represented by Mr. Hugo Perezcano Diaz, Legal Counsel serving with the Directorate-General of the Negotiations Legal Advisory Board, Subsecretariat for International Trade Negotiations, Ministry of Commerce and Industrial Development (*Secretaria de Comercio y Fomento Industrial\u2014* SECOFI).\n\n3.\n\nAt its first session, the Arbitral Tribunal decided that the Claimant would file its memorial of claim, containing all points of fact and law relating to jurisdiction and the substance of its claims, against the Respondent, by no later than 29 September 1999. Similarly, the Respondent was to file a counter-memorial, in which it would contend all arguments of fact and law relating to jurisdiction, by no later than 29 October 1999, said deadline being extended at the Respondent\u2019s request to November 5, 1999. Subsequently, on 9 November 1999, the Claimant filed pleadings addressing the question of jurisdiction as raised by the Respondent. In view of these submissions, the Respondent then petitioned for leave to file a rejoinder dealing with the matter of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, a petition to which this Arbitral Tribunal acceded, 16 November 1999 being set as the maximum time limit for the filing thereof. Finally, on 19 November 1999, the Arbitral Tribunal decided to resolve the question of jurisdiction prior to examining the issue in dispute, and to convoke a hearing for this purpose on 6 December 1999. Said hearing had to be postponed until 31 January 2000, owing to the arbitration proceedings being suspended by reason of the above-mentioned resignation of the arbitrator, Mr. Julio Trevi\u00f1o.\n\nOn 31 January 2000, the above indicated hearing took place in Washington, D.C., and was, moreover, marked by the presence of the Canadian Government and the Government of the United States of America represented by Ms. Sylvie Tabet and Ms. Andrea Menaker, respectively. The Government of Canada submitted to the Tribunal, on 17 December 1999, a written presentation in regard to the interpretation of NAFTA Article 1121. During the course of the hearing the representative of Canada declined the President of the Tribunal\u2019s invitation to address the Tribunal, referring to the said presentation. The representative of the United States of America also declined the President of the Tribunal\u2019s invitation to address the Tribunal. During the course of the hearing, all parties presented their respective arguments concerning this Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\nAfter the hearing, the Arbitral Tribunal met and concluded as follows:\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 22 July 1998, Baker & Botts, L.L.P., acting for and on behalf of WASTE MANAGEMENT and ACAVERDE, filed with the Secretary-General of ICSID a notice of institution of arbitration proceedings pursuant to Article 2 of the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules. One of the heads of the above request dealt with the so-called Conditions Precedent laid down by NAFTA Article 1121 for the submission of a claim to arbitration. These conditions entail consent by the Claimant to the submission of the claim to arbitration and waiver of its right to initiate or continue before any other courts or tribunals, dispute settlement proceedings with respect to the measures of the Respondent that are alleged to be a breach of NAFTA. Said waiver was submitted by the Claimant, couched in the following terms:\n\n*\"Additionally, Claimants hereby waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any NAFTA Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measures taken by Respondent that are alleged to be a breach of NAFTA Chapter Eleven and applicable rules of international law, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory, or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages. **This waiver does not apply, however, to any dispute settlement proceedings involving allegations that Respondent has violated duties imposed by other sources of law, including the municipal law of Mexico\"*** (emphasis is not from the original).\n\nIn view of the waiver tendered, on 29 July 1998 ICSID, acting through its Counsel, Mr. Alejandro A. Escobar, requested WASTE MANAGEMENT to confirm that the additional statement (shown in bold type above) issued by WASTE MANAGEMENT did not stray from the waiver required by NAFTA Article 1121. In reply to this request, on 23 September 1998 WASTE MANAGEMENT sent a letter to ICSID to the following effect:\n\n*\"In the Notice of Institution submitted to ICSID on July 22, Claimants effected this waiver, echoing the language in NAFTA Article 1121. Claimants also set forth their understanding of the scope of that required waiver. By setting forth this understanding, however, **Claimants did not intend to derogate from the waiver required by NAFTA Article 1121**.\"* (emphasis is not from original).\n\nIn any event, due to one of the procedural requirements to be met by the Claimant, namely, mandatory notice of intent to submit the claim to arbitration under NAFTA Article 1119 having been filed on 6 February 1998 with a body other than that designated by the Government of Mexico pursuant to the provisions of NAFTA Article 1137(2), ICSID, by letter dated 25 August 1998, duly advised the Claimant of the impossibility of continuing proceedings if said notice were not filed with the pertinent body for such purpose, namely the SECOFI Directorate-General for Foreign Investment.\n\n5.\n\nOn 29 September 1999, once the formal defect referred to above had been remedied by notice of intent to submit a claim to arbitration being forwarded to the body designated by the Government of Mexico and being duly registered on 30 June 1999, WASTE MANAGEMENT again proceeded to lodge notice of request for arbitration with the Secretary-General of ICSID, thereby complying with the waiting period established under NAFTA Article 1119, which requires 90 days to elapse between service of notice on the disputing party of intent to submit a claim to arbitration and filing of the notice of request for arbitration with ICSID Secretary-General. This latter notice was submitted in the following terms insofar as it pertained to the NAFTA Article 1121 waiver:\n\n*\"Additionally, Claimants hereby waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or* *court under the law of any NAFTA Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measures taken by Respondent that are alleged to be in breach of NAFTA Chapter Eleven and applicable rules of international law, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages. **Without derogating from the waiver required by NAFTA Article 1121, Claimants here set forth their understanding that the above waiver does not apply to any dispute settlement proceedings involving allegations that Respondent has violated duties imposed by sources of law other than Chapter Eleven of NAFTA, including the municipal law of Mexico.**\"* (emphasis is not from the original).\n\nIn view of the terms in which this last-mentioned waiver was expressed, on 3 November 1998 ICSID, acting through its Legal Adviser, Mr. Antonio A. Parra, sent a letter to WASTE MANAGEMENT seeking confirmation that the waiver tendered was applicable to any such dispute settlement proceedings in Mexico as might involve allegations of breaches of any obligations, imposed by other sources of law, which in substance were not different from those of a Party State under NAFTA Chapter XI, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages.\n\nIn answer to this request, WASTE MANAGEMENT sent a letter dated 3 November 1999, expressed in the following terms:\n\n*\"With respect to the inclusion in the Notice of Institution, of the waiver required by NAFTA Article 1121 and USA Waste\u2019s understanding of the scope of that required waiver,* *USA Waste hereby **confirms that the waiver contained in the Notice of Institution applies to dispute settlement proceedings in Mexico involving allegations of breaches of any obligations, imposed by other sources of law, that are not different in substance from the obligations of a NAFTA State Party under Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory, or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of*** ***damages. With respect to USA Waste\u2019s efforts to resolve its dispute with Mexico outside of the remedies offered by NAFTA,** there are no pending legal proceedings related to that dispute in which the Government of the United Mexican States is a named a party.\"* (emphasis is not from the original).\n\n6.\n\nParallel to these events, the Government of Mexico issued a series of letters and repeatedly voiced its disagreement\u2014as to both form and content\u2014with the terms of the waiver submitted by WASTE MANAGEMENT, contending that the Claimant had not issued said waiver in the terms laid down by NAFTA Article 1121, and alleging as proof thereof, the existence of legal proceedings pending resolution that had been initiated by ACAVERDE in internal fora, namely, two suits brought against BANOBRAS and one arbitration proceedings against ACAPULCO.\n\nLikewise, the Government of Mexico asserted that said proceedings dealt with measures which had, moreover, been cited by WASTE MANAGEMENT as breaches of the NAFTA. Specifically, these were ACAPULCO\u2019s alleged refusal to pay the invoices submitted by ACAVERDE under the Concession Agreement entered into by both parties and BANOBRAS\u2019 alleged refusal to pay such invoices, as guarantor for ACAPULCO under a line of credit agreement entered into by both parties.\n\nIn its Memorial of Claim dated 29 September 1999, WASTE MANAGEMENT, insisting once again in the meaning ascribed to the waiver as issued, made the following statement:\n\n*\"While WASTE MANAGEMENT did indeed express its* *\"understanding\" of the scope of the waiver, WASTE* *MANAGEMENT has affirmed since it first provided the waiver that, whatever the waiver means under NAFTA,* *WASTE MANAGEMENT intended to give and has given it.\"*\n\nLikewise, on the matter of the internal proceedings initiated by ACAVERDE, the Claimant contended that, in this regard, the former had alleged no NAFTA-related breach of international law in said proceedings. Accordingly, none of these proceedings could be held to have either caused prejudice to Mexico or forced it to defend duplicate allegations of NAFTA breaches simultaneously.\n\nFor its part, on 5 November 1999, the Government of Mexico filed a counter-memorial concerning the issue of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, stressing the formal and material defects of the waiver as submitted by the Claimant and the continuance of the actions instituted by ACAVERDE before other courts or tribunals in breach of the provisions of NAFTA Article 1121.\n\nIn reply, WASTE MANAGEMENT then sent written pleadings to this Arbitral Tribunal on 9 November 1999, addressing the question of jurisdiction, in which the waiver as tendered was referred to anew in the following terms:\n\n*\"As recounted in its Memorial, Claimant has provided that waiver on several occasions, and on several occasions has affirmed that the waiver is effective to the full extent of the scope intended by NAFTA.\"*\n\nThe Government of Mexico submitted a rejoinder, dated 16 November 1999, on the question of jurisdiction, principally underscoring the duplication of relief sought by the Claimant in the internal proceedings and the claim brought before this Arbitral Tribunal, since in both cases these dealt with identical matters and had been initiated against state-run organisations and political subdivisions for whose actions the Mexican Government was liable.\n\nFinally, on 17 January 2000, WASTE MANAGEMENT presented its observations to the above-mentioned presentation made by the Government of Canada on December 17, 1999, attaching a copy of the Decision on Jurisdiction issued by the Arbitral Tribunal in the case of *Ethyl Corporation v. The Government of Canada* on 24 June 1998.\n\nIN CONCLUSION:\n\n7.\n\nThe question of this Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction arises from the point in time when the Claimant deemed that, in the terms submitted, the waiver conformed in all respects to the provisions of NAFTA Article 1121, and the Mexican Government, on the contrary, deemed that said waiver had not been couched in the form required by said Article nor had the Claimant\u2019s subsequent conduct been consistent with the terms of such waiver.\n\n**III. FINDINGS OF LAW**\n------------------------\n\n**A. LEGISLATION APPLICABLE TO THE FACTS OF THE CASE**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nPrior to setting forth the grounds on which this decision is based, this Tribunal deems it necessary that the issue raised be examined afresh and reduced to its essentials, something which, for the purposes hereof, translates as this Tribunal\u2019s duty to analyse the validity of the waiver issued by the Claimant under NAFTA Article 1121 paragraph one, subsection (b), the provisions of which reads as follows:\n\n*\"A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1116 to arbitration only if:*\n\n*b) the investor and, where the claim is for loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, the enterprise, waive their right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceedings with respect to the measure of the disputing Party that is alleged to be a breach referred to in Article 1116, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages, before an administrative tribunal or court under the law of the disputing Party. \"*\n\nWith regard to the interpretation of this rule, NAFTA Article 1131 states that:\n\n*\"A Tribunal established under this Section shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law. \"*\n\n9.\n\nThe thrust of this Article permits this Arbitral Tribunal to be guided, in matters of interpretation, by the rules laid down by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties signed on 23 May 1969, which establishes the general rule of interpretation of treaties at Article 31:\n\n*\"1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"*\n\n**B. NAFTA CHAPTER XI DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURE**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nChapter XI of the NAFTA establishes a mechanism for the settlement of investment disputes, which seeks to assure both equal treatment among investors of the Parties in accordance with the principle of international reciprocity, and due process before an impartial tribunal (NAFTA Article 1115).\n\n11.\n\nHence, an investor of one of the Parties who maintains that a host Government has breached its obligations relating to the investment, as envisaged under Chapter XI, shall be entitled to submit its claim to arbitration on giving prior notice of its intent to the disputing party at least 90 days before said claim is formally submitted to the Secretary-General of ICSID, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1119.\n\nThe above-mentioned NAFTA Article 1119 establishes the mandatory nature of giving notice of intent to submit a claim to arbitration to the disputing Party. Said notice, in the present case, was served by WASTE MANAGEMENT on its own behalf and on behalf of ACAVERDE, in accordance with the provisions of NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117.\n\nSpecifically, NAFTA Article 1117, paragraph 1, allows for submission of a claim to arbitration on behalf of an enterprise coming within the jurisdiction of the other Party, in cases where the investor controls said enterprise directly or indirectly. For such purposes, WASTE MANAGEMENT has, in the exhibits filed along with its Memorial of Claim, provided evidence of its status as \"investor of a Party, on behalf of an enterprise,\" ACAVERDE S.A.\n\nThe notice referred to in NAFTA Article 1119 was registered by the Directorate-General for Foreign Investment (the body designated by the Mexican Government to this end) on 30 June 1998, as is evident from the content of the letter dated 5 July 1998, sent by the Directorate-General for Foreign Investment to Baker & Botts, L.L.P.\n\n12.\n\nOnce this formality has been duly completed, NAFTA Article 1120 provides that the disputing investor may then formally submit its claim to one of a number of arbitration mechanisms, including ICSID Additional Facility, the procedure chosen for the present dispute.\n\nFor the purposes thereof, the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, in Article 2, paragraph 1, provide that:\n\n*\"Any State or national of a State wishing to institute arbitration proceedings (hereinafter called the \"Claimant\") shall send a notice to that effect in writing to the Secretariat at the seat of the Centre. It shall be drawn up in an official language of the Centre, shall be dated and shall be signed by the party sending it.\"*\n\nActing in accordance with this Article, the Claimant submitted its notice of arbitration to the Secretary-General of ICSID on 29 September 1998, which was duly registered on 18 November of said year.\n\n13.\n\nFinally, NAFTA Chapter XI, Section B, Article 1121 lays down a series of conditions precedent to submission of a claim to arbitration proceedings, namely, the placing on record of the Claimant\u2019s consent, as well as a waiver of its right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court any proceedings with respect to the measure that is alleged to be a breach of Article 1117 of the NAFTA, except for proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages.\n\nPrior to embarking upon an analysis of the waiver submitted by the Claimant, this Tribunal deems it necessary to establish the purpose of the so-called conditions precedent to the submission of a claim to arbitration, conditions which are contained in NAFTA Article 1121 and include the mandatory obligation to present said waiver.\n\n**C. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO SUBMISSION OF A CLAIM TO ARBITRATION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nUnder NAFTA Article 1121 a disputing investor may submit to arbitration proceedings, to quote literally, *\"Only if\u2019\u2019* certain prerequisites are met, comprising, in general terms, consent to and waiver of determined rights.\n\nIn the light of this Article, it is fulfilment of NAFTA Article 1121 conditions precedent by an aggrieved investor that entitles this Tribunal to take cognisance of any claim forming the subject of arbitration held in accordance with the dispute settlement procedure established under Chapter XI of said legal text. Accordingly, it thus falls to this Tribunal: to monitor the production, both of the consent and of the waiver, in the terms laid down by NAFTA Article 1121; and, in addition, when it comes to ascertaining the existence of a genuine show of intent in line with the terms required in the waiver, to evaluate the conduct of the waiving party vis-\u00e0-vis effective compliance therewith.\n\n15.\n\nHowever, this Tribunal is unable to agree with the assertions put forth by the Mexican Government to the effect that the purported function of the Arbitral Tribunal, in view of Article 1121, is to ensure that the disputing investors will make their waiver effective before every tribunal or in any judicial or administrative proceeding, in order to comply with the procedure established under NAFTA Chapter XI Section B, and, in this manner, validate or perfect the consent to said Treaty. This Tribunal cannot but reject such an interpretation, since it lacks the necessary authority to bar the Claimant from initiating other proceedings in fora other than the present one.\n\nIn this case, it would legitimately fall to the Mexican Government to plead the waiver before other courts or tribunals.\n\na. Consent to arbitration by the Parties to the dispute\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe essential constituent elements which constitute the institution of arbitration are the existence of a conflict of interests, and an agreement expressing the will of the parties or a legal mandate, on which the constitution of an Arbitral Tribunal is founded. This assertion serves to confirm the importance of the autonomy of the will of the parties, which is evinced by their consent to submit any given dispute to arbitration proceedings. Hence, it is upon that very consent to arbitration given by the parties that the entire effectiveness of this institution depends.\n\nIn light of this affirmation, this Tribunal deems it necessary to analyse, albeit only briefly, the treatment that NAFTA Chapter XI accords to consent of the parties, when it comes to submitting a claim to arbitration under the dispute settlement procedure established therein.\n\nNAFTA Article 1122, paragraph one, reads as follows:\n\n*\"Each Party consents to the submission of a claim to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement.\"*\n\nFrom the literal tenor of this Article, it is understood, for those effects of interest to us at present, that fulfilment, *inter alia,* of the prerequisites laid down in Article 1121, would translate as consent by NAFTA signatory parties to the dispute settlement procedure established under NAFTA Chapter XI, Section B.\n\n17.\n\nOn the basis of the above, it is the understanding of this Tribunal that any analysis of the fulfilment of the prerequisites established as conditions precedent to submission of a claim to arbitration under NAFTA Article 1121 calls for the utmost attention, since fulfilment thereof opens the way, *ipso facto,* to an arbitration procedure in accordance with the commitment acquired by the parties as signatories to said international treaty.\n\nAccordingly, this Arbitral Tribunal proposes to undertake a detailed analysis of the scope and content of the waiver required under NAFTA Article 1121.\n\n**b. Waiver required under NAFTA Article 1121**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Concept and scope of the waiver**\n---------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nThe act of waiver *per se* is a unilateral act, since its effect in terms of extinguishment is occasioned solely by the intent underlying same. The requirement of a waiver in any context implies a voluntary abdication of rights, inasmuch as this act generally leads to a substantial modification of the pre-existing legal situation, namely, the forfeiting or extinguishment of the right. Waiver thus entails exercise of the power of disposal by the holder thereof in order to bring about this legal effect.\n\nWhatever the case, any waiver must be clear, explicit and categorical, it being improper to deduce same from expressions the meaning of which is at all dubious.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, any waiver submitted pursuant to the provisions of NAFTA Article 1121(2)(b) must, depending upon the petition or request fded, be clear in all its terms with regard to abdication of given rights by the party proposing to make said waiver.\n\n**(ii) Time at which the waiver comes into force**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nNAFTA Article 1121, paragraph three, provides that the waiver shall be included in the submission of a claim to arbitration.\n\nIn this regard, NAFTA Article 1137(1)(b) states:\n\n*\"1. A claim is submitted to arbitration under this Section when:*\n\n*b) the notice of arbitration under Article 2 of Schedule C of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules has been received by the Secretary-General;\"*\n\nIn light of these rules, it is evident that submission of the waiver must take place in conjunction with that of the notice mandated by Article 2 of the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, and that from this date it will come into full force and effect with regard to the commitment acquired by the waiving party to comply with all the terms thereof.\n\nIn the case in point, and for the purposes hereof, WASTE MANAGEMENT submitted notice of request for arbitration to the Secretary-General of ICSID on 29 September 1998, so that it was from this date onwards that the Claimant was thus obliged, in accordance with the waiver tendered, to abstain from initiating or continuing any proceedings before other courts or tribunals with respect to those measures pleaded as constituting a breach of the provisions of the NAFTA.\n\n(iii) Formal requirements of the waiver submitted by WASTE MANAGEMENT\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nAny waiver, and by extension, that one which is now the subject of debate, implies a formal and material act on the part of the person tendering same. To this end, this Tribunal will therefore have to ascertain whether WASTE MANAGEMENT did indeed submit the waiver in accordance with the formalities envisaged under NAFTA and whether it has respected the terms of same through the material act of either dropping or desisting from initiating parallel proceedings before other courts or tribunals.\n\n21.\n\nThe word \"form\" must be deemed a natural element of any legal act, since any declaration of intent must be voiced, must be made known to others. In a life of interrelationships, it is its form that renders an act recognisable to others. Hence, there is no legal transaction, dealing or act that is bereft of some given form, however simple.\n\nIn a more technical and precise sense, the concept of form refers to a given, specific medium that is demanded by the legal system or the will of the individual for the purpose of voicing intent. The effectiveness of legal acts is thus rendered dependent upon the observance of certain forms, which are the only ones permitted as vehicles for expressing such intent.\n\nThus, *a priori,* formalism seeks to achieve certain practical ends, which can substantially be summed up as the attainment of clarity with regard to the circumstances of the document issued, the content matter thereof and assurance of proof of its existence.\n\n22.\n\nA distinction has traditionally been drawn between so-called *ad substantiam* or *ad solemnitatem* and *ad probationem* formalities. The former are those that require a class of legal act in order to exist or come into being. In their case, form is substance, in that the transactions, dealings or acts do not exist as such, unless they are executed in the legally regulated form.\n\nThe *ad probationem* form is only required as evidence of legal transactions, dealings or acts. It in no way conditions the effectiveness of legal acts, other than in the sense of being thoroughly \"legitimated\", whereby it is established that it may only be proved by means of the legally prescribed form. However, the actual existence and validity of the dealing or act is unimpaired by the lack of its observance.\n\nThe subsumption of the above considerations into the terms of NAFTA Article 1121 translates as the need for any waiver submitted by an aggrieved investor to comply with certain formal or *ad substantiam* requisites clearly set out in paragraph three:\n\n*\"A consent and waiver required by this Article shall be in writing, shall be delivered to the disputing Party and shall be included in the submission of a claim to arbitration.\"*\n\n23.\n\nThis Article is clear when it comes to establishing the formalities for said waiver: presentation of the waiver in writing, delivery to the disputing party and inclusion in the submission of the claim to arbitration. All these requisites were duly complied with by the Claimant, as is evident from the written text that was dispatched by same to the disputing Party and registered on 30 June 1998, and subsequently included in the notice of request for arbitration dated 29 September of that same year.\n\nThis Tribunal accordingly finds that the waiver as tendered by the Claimant is free of the formal defects attributed to it by the Respondent with regard to the alleged need for legalisation or notarisation for possible/potential use in pleadings before other fora, since, provided that the waiver has been submitted in the terms laid down by the NAFTA, that is to say, in writing and in duplicate to both the ICSID and the disputing Party, any appraisal thereof by other courts, tribunals or parties does not fall within the purview of this Tribunal.\n\n**(iv) Material requirements of the waiver submitted by W****ASTE MANAGEMENT.**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nAs has been pointed out by this Arbitral Tribunal, the act of waiver involves a declaration of intent by the issuing party, which logically entails a certain conduct in line with the statement issued.\n\nIndeed, such a declaration of intent must assume concrete form in the intention or resolve whereby something is said or done (conduct of the deponent). Hence, in order for said intent to assume legal significance, it is not suffice for it to exist internally. Instead, it must be voiced or made manifest, in the case in point by means of a written text and specific conduct on the part of the waiving party in line with the declaration made.\n\nIt thus becomes necessary to assess both the conduct of the party making the waiver, as well as the liability that said party must assume should there be a divergence between the sentiments manifested and the conduct actually engaged in, the reason being that said party, and only said party, is liable for the effectiveness of such declaration, due to the so-called principle of self-responsibility.\n\nIn light of the above, it is clear that the waiver required under NAFTA Article 1121 calls for a show of intent by the issuing party vis-\u00e0-vis its waiver of the right to initiate or continue any proceedings whatsoever before other courts or tribunals with respect to the measure allegedly in breach of the NAFTA provisions. Moreover, such an abdication of rights ought to have been made effective as from the date of submission of the waiver, namely, September 29, 1998. The above declaration of intent also calls for a certain type of conduct on the part of the issuing party, WASTE MANAGEMENT, the party making public the commitment acquired by virtue of the above-mentioned waiver.\n\n25.\n\nHence, by subjecting the Claimant\u2019s conduct to scrutiny, this Arbitral Tribunal will hereupon proceed to verify the public manifestation of the declaration of intent that said Claimant expressed in the waiver referred to in NAFTA Article 1121.\n\nIn the following order of consideration and by means of an analysis of the statements and documentation furnished by the Parties, this Arbitral Tribunal deems the following points of fact proven with respect to internal proceedings initiated by ACAVERDE prior and/or subsequent to the tendering of the NAFTA Article 1121 waiver:\n\n1. With reference to the first suit filed by ACAVERDE against BANOBRAS, it has been shown that on 31 January 1997, ACAVERDE initiated a mercantile action against BANOBRAS, involving a claim for a monetary sum plus damages for non-payment of invoices, arising out of a breach by BANOBRAS of a credit line agreement, under which it stood as guarantor for the City Council of ACAPULCO in the event that the latter should fail to fulfil its payment obligations under the Concession Agreement. Said action was decided in favour of BANOBRAS on 7 January 1999, leave for appeal being granted on 18 January 1999. On 11 March 1999, the Second Court of the First Circuit *(Segundo Tribunal Unitario del Primer Circuito)* upheld the decision at the first instance.\n\nContesting this decision, ACAVERDE filed an appeal for relief on 7 April 1999, which was dismissed on 6 October 1999 by the Sixth Collegiate Tribunal on Civil Matters of the First Circuit *(Sexto Tribunal Colegiado en Materia Civil del Primer Circuito),* thus rendering the judgement as handed down, final and binding.\n\n2. Similarly, on 11 August 1998 ACAVERDE brought a second suit against BANOBRAS for breach of payment of certain invoices under the credit line agreement. On 12 January 1999, the Second District Court on Civil Matters of Mexico City *(Juez Segundo de Distrito en Materia Civil de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico)* dismissed said action. ACAVERDE appealed against this decision on 20 January 1999, which appeal was dismissed on 18 February of the same year by the First Court of the First Circuit *(Primer Tribunal Unitario del Primer Circuito),* on procedural grounds. On 24 February 1999, ACAVERDE filed a plea of annulment or reversal with the aim of reviving the appeal, a petition that was rejected by the relevant Court on the following day. Finally, ACAVERDE filed an appeal for relief on 9 March 1999, which was decided in favour of BANOBRAS on 20 May of the same year, thereby definitively confirming the decisions handed down by the previous Courts.\n\n3. Lastly, on 27 October 1998, ACAVERDE filed a suit in arbitration against the City Council of ACAPULCO under the auspices of the City of Mexico Chamber of Commerce Permanent Arbitration Committee, claiming damages for non-payment of services and breach of a series of obligations under the Concession Agreement, which proceedings it then subsequently abandoned on 7 July 1999.\n\n**(v) Conduct prohibited by waiver of Article 1121 of the NAFTA**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nFinally, and given the Claimant\u2019s interpretation concerning actions that it may bring before other courts or tribunals without violating the content of the waiver established in Article 1121 of the NAFTA, this Arbitral Tribunal deems it necessary to define the conduct proscribed by that Article, even though its wording is clear and should not lead to any confusion or deviation.\n\n27.\n\nAs revealed in the factual background, WASTE MANAGEMENT has expressed its interpretation of the waiver in various written communications, which are quoted below:\n\nNotice of institution of arbitration proceedings dated 22 July 1998:\n\n*\"This waiver does not apply, however, to any dispute settlement proceedings involving allegations that Respondent has violated duties imposed by other sources of law, including the municipal law of Mexico.\"*\n\nNotice of institution of arbitration proceedings dated 29 September 1999:\n\n*\" Without derogating from the waiver required by NAFTA Article 1121, Claimants here set forth their understanding that the above waiver does not apply to any dispute settlement proceedings involving allegations that Respondent has violated duties imposed by sources of law other than Chapter Eleven of NAFTA, including the municipal law of Mexico.\"*\n\nAccording to the interpretation of the waiver maintained by the Claimant, said waiver would refer exclusively to proceedings that expressly invoke failure to comply with obligations of international law set forth in Chapter XI of NAFTA.\n\nFollowing this line of reasoning, the Claimant would have acted in accordance with the terms of its waiver since, in fact, ACAVERDE did not expressly invoke those provisions of NAFTA that it considered breached before other courts or tribunals, but instead, making use of the domestic instruments available to it under Mexican legislation, instituted several claims for monetary compensation in respect of unpaid invoices and non-compliance with various obligations under a line of credit agreement and a Concession Agreement, considering such conduct \"permissible\" in light of its own interpretation of said waiver. This justification of its conduct is unsustainable for the following reasons:\n\na) It is clear that one and the same measure may give rise to different types of claims in different courts or tribunals. Therefore, something that under Mexican legislation would constitute a series of breaches of contract expressed as non-payment of certain invoices, violation of exclusivity clauses in a concession agreement, etc., could, under the NAFTA, be interpreted as a lack of fair and equitable treatment of a foreign investment by a government (Article 1105 of NAFTA) or as measures constituting \"expropriation\" under Article 1110 of the NAFTA. In any case, it is not the mission of the Tribunal, at this stage of the proceedings, to make an in-depth analysis of alleged breaches of the NAFTA invoked by the Claimant, since that task, should it become necessary, belongs to an analysis of the merits of the question.\n\nb) For purposes of considering a waiver valid when that waiver is a condition precedent to the submission of a claim to arbitration, it is not imperative to know the merits of the question submitted for arbitration, but to have proof that the actions brought before domestic courts or tribunals directly affect the arbitration in that their object consists of measures also alleged in the present arbitral proceedings to be breaches of the NAFTA. The term \"alleged\" (\"presuntamente\" in the Spanish version) appearing in Article 1121 is clearly indicative of the framework within which we have to operate at this very early stage of the arbitration proceedings, which means that the elements of comparison to be used at the time of verifying compliance with the waiver are the presumed or supposed violations of NAFTA invoked by the Claimant and the actions effectively in progress before other courts or tribunals at that time. All of this without prejudice to the possibility, following an examination of the merits, of the Arbitral Tribunal verifying compliance or non-compliance as asserted by the Claimant.\n\nIn effect, it is possible to consider that proceedings instituted in a national forum may exist which do not relate to those measures alleged to be in violation of the NAFTA by a member state of the NAFTA, in which case it would be feasible that such proceedings could coexist simultaneously with an arbitration proceeding under the NAFTA. However, when both legal actions have a legal basis derived from the same measures, they can no longer continue simultaneously in light of the imminent risk that the Claimant may obtain the double benefit in its claim for damages. This is precisely what NAFTA Article 1121 seeks to avoid.\n\nIn the present hypothesis, this Tribunal understands that the domestic proceedings initiated by ACAVERDE fall within the prohibition of NAFTA Article 1121 in that they refer to measures that are also invoked in the present arbitral proceedings as breaches of NAFTA provisions, namely non-compliance with the obligations of guarantor assumed under a line of credit agreement requiring BANOBRAS to defray invoices not paid by ACAPULCO city council, and non-compliance by ACAPULCO city council through its failure to pay said invoices.\n\nThis point was recognised by the Claimant in its written presentations concerning the question of jurisdiction of 9 November 1999, which stated the following:\n\n*\"Claimant\u2019s allegations against Mexico in this NAFTA arbitration are based on five separate \"measures\" constituting violations of NAFTA, only one of which relates to non-payment under contract.\"*\n\nThe fact, expressly admitted by the Claimant, that the object of the proceedings initiated against BANOBRAS and ACAPULCO referred to one of the measures allegedly breaching NAFTA provisions is sufficient proof, in the spirit of NAFTA Article 1121, to include it within the framework of conduct that the waiver should cover, as referred to in said Article and as proscribed for obtaining access to an arbitration proceeding as contemplated under NAFTA.\n\nIt remains clear that at no time did WASTE MANAGEMENT intend to abandon the domestic proceedings, rather, on the contrary, its manifest intention was to continue legal proceedings against BANOBRAS and ACAPULCO, as revealed by the communication sent by the Claimant\u2019s representative to the Mexican Government\u2019s representative on 10 February 1999, in which it is established that:\n\n*\"... Regarding your request about the ongoing arbitration proceeding in Mexico, we do not believe that our client is required to suspend any proceedings in Mexico that it is otherwise entitled to institute...\"*\n\n28.\n\nIn conclusion, an interpretation such as the one proposed by the Claimant and which, as seen by the documentation provided, has been used, conflicts with the purpose of the waiver established in NAFTA Article 1121, the wording of which clearly sets forth the spirit and intent of said waiver, which expressly proscribes the initiation or continuation of proceedings under the law of either party with respect to a measure allegedly breaching the provisions referred to in Article 1116 of NAFTA. It is clear that the provisions referred to in the NAFTA constitute obligations of international law for NAFTA signatory States, but violation of the content of those obligations may well constitute actions proscribed by Mexican legislation in this case, the denunciation of which before several courts or tribunals would constitute a duplication of proceedings.\n\nThe Claimant has been perfectly aware of the situation here described since it reserved the right to bring action in domestic courts or tribunals and, subsequently, in light of the vicissitudes of those actions and also of the arbitral proceedings initiated under the NAFTA, when it forced an *a posteriori* interpretation of its waiver, asserting that in the actions before other courts or tribunals NAFTA provisions had not been invoked, although there is no doubt that they directly affected the international obligations assumed by the Mexican Government, given that they had their origin in the same measures invoked by the Claimant.\n\nIf the Claimant, upon formulating its waiver, had clearly adopted the interpretation it now maintains, it would not have conditioned its waiver with the terms as it did, because under said interpretation, it would have been able to take parallel action in domestic courts or tribunals without expressly invoking NAFTA provisions and without thereby affecting these arbitral proceedings.\n\n29.\n\nAlso, we are facing proceedings with identical subjects for purposes of NAFTA Article 1121 since, pursuant to such treaty, the Mexican Government would have to be liable for those actions attributable to BANOBRAS and ACAPULCO. This point has been give sufficient credit through the Respondent\u2019s written pleadings concerning the issue of jurisdiction.\n\n30.\n\nBased on the foregoing, it is clear that the Claimant issued a statement of intent different from that required in a waiver pursuant to NAFTA Article 1121, since it continued with the proceedings initiated against BANOBRAS after the date of submission of the waiver, 29 September 1998, until all avenues of recourse had been exhausted. Likewise, it has also been shown that subsequent to submission of this claim for arbitration, ACAVERDE initiated arbitral proceedings against ACAPULCO, which are still ongoing today, although ACAVERDE requested the return of documents based on its action of 7 July 1999, as revealed by the documentation accompanying its memorial, despite the fact that the pertinent forum, i.e. the Arbitral Tribunal, had not declared the arbitral proceeding closed.\n\nc. Validity of the waiver submitted by WASTE MANAGEMENT\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nIn view of the above, this Tribunal has arrived at the following conclusions regarding the validity of the waiver tendered:\n\n1. With respect to the content of the text of the NAFTA Article 1121 waiver, it is obvious that the Claimant did not limit itself to a full transcription of the content of this Article, which in itself is sufficiently complete and clearly reflects the scope of the waiver, but instead additionally introduced a series of statements that reflected its own understanding of the waiver submitted, as is evident from the findings of fact outlined in this arbitral award now issued hereunder.\n\nThis Tribunal cannot concur with the Claimant\u2019s earlier assertions regarding its intention to present the waiver in accordance with the scope of Article 1121, given that it has been established that for more than 14 months, it systematically failed to comply with the actual agreement that the waiver of NAFTA Article 1121 requires from those parties seeking to submit a claim to arbitration in accordance with the dispute settlement procedure set forth in Chapter XI of the NAFTA. The fact is that the Claimant did not have the intention of presenting the waiver within the terms prescribed in NAFTA Article 1121, rather, it had the intention to present it in accordance with its own interests.\n\n2. With respect to clarifications made by WASTE MANAGEMENT in its Memorial of Claim of 29 September 1999 and written submission of pleadings of 9 November 1999, it is true that, at the date on which the latter was tendered, WASTE MANAGEMENT had instituted no proceedings before any other courts or tribunals. Yet this fact cannot remedy the breach by WASTE MANAGEMENT of one of the NAFTA Article 1121 requirements, namely, delivery of a waiver in accordance with the terms laid down by Article 1121 to the disputing party, and inclusion thereof in the submission of the claim to arbitration. In view of WASTE MANAGEMENT\u2019S conduct and the text of its declaration of intent, neither the waiver submitted on 29 September 1998 nor the subsequent attempts to clarify the content thereof correspond to the terms prescribed for these purposes under NAFTA Article 1121, which requires the waiving party to abstain from initiating or continuing legal proceedings in any administrative or judicial tribunal or other dispute settlement procedures (save for petitions for injunctive, declaratory or other extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages).\n\nAccordingly, this Tribunal cannot deem as valid the waiver tendered by the Claimant in its submission of the claim to arbitration, in view of its having been drawn up with additional interpretations, which have failed to translate as the effective abdication of rights mandated by the waiver.\n\nIn the light of the foregoing, the claims of the Respondent must necessarily be allowed, along with the ensuing order against the Claimant for costs. Nevertheless, on there being no evidence of recklessness or bad faith on the Claimant\u2019s part, this Tribunal is of the opinion that it would be improper to make an award for such legal costs as the Respondent may have incurred in the defence of its interests in this arbitration.\n\n**IV. ARBITRAL AWARD**\n----------------------\n\n[32].\n\nOn weighing up all that has been set forth hereinabove, the documentary exhibits and pleadings drawn up by the parties, this Arbitral Tribunal is compelled to hold that it lacks jurisdiction to judge the issue in dispute now brought before it, owing to breach by the Claimant of one of the requisites laid down by NAFTA Article 1121(2)(b) and deemed essential in order to proceed with submission of a claim to arbitration, namely, waiver of the right to initiate or continue before any tribunal or court, dispute settlement proceedings with respect to the measures taken by the Respondent that are allegedly in breach of the NAFTA, the aforesaid being in overall accordance with the provisions of said legal text and the ICSID Additional Facility.\n\nThis Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay the costs of the present arbitration proceedings, and each of the disputing parties to defray the respective costs occasioned by its own defence.\n\nThe present arbitral award has been adopted by a majority of the Arbitral Tribunal"}]}
