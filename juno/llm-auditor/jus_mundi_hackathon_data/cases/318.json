INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis challenge arises in an arbitration between Claimants CC/Devas (Mauritius) Ltd., Devas Employees Mauritius Private Limited and Telcom Devas Mauritius Limited and Respondent the Republic of India under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law 1976 (the \"1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules\") pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Mauritius and the Government of the Republic of India for the Promotion and the Protection of Investments entering into force June 20, 2000 (the \"Treaty\"). According to Article 8(2)(d)(i) of the Treaty, the appointing authority shall be the President, the Vice-President or the next senior Judge of the International Court of Justice, who is not a national of either Contracting Party.\n\n2.\n\nIn this arbitration, the Claimants allege that the Respondent violated the Treaty by taking measures affecting the Claimants\u2019 investments in an Indian company, Devas Multimedia Private Limited (\"Devas\"), which in 2005 entered into a contract with an Indian state entity under the control of the Indian Space Research Organization, Antrix Corporation Limited (\"Antrix\").1 According to the Claimants, pursuant to this agreement, Antrix agreed to lease capacity in the S-Band, part of the electromagnetic spectrum, to Devas which would launch two satellites to provide multimedia services to mobile users across India. The Claimants contend that the Respondent endeavored to cancel the agreement in breach of its international obligations under the Treaty.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 1; Claimants\u2019 Response, p. 4.\n\n3.\n\nThis decision resolves a challenge brought by the Respondent to the appointment of the Presiding Arbitrator, the Hon. Marc Lalonde, and the appointment of the arbitrator appointed by the Claimants, Professor Francisco Orrego Vicuna, on the ground that the arbitrators served together on two tribunals which took a position on a legal issue (the \"essential security interests\" clause) expected to arise in the present proceedings. The Respondent finds further grounds for challenging Professor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s appointment in his participation on a third tribunal that also took up the same issue and in an article authored by Professor Orrego Vicuna in which he discussed his view on the issue. The Respondent emphasizes that all three arbitral decisions were later annulled or annulled in part.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimants appointed Professor Orrego Vicuna as co-arbitrator on July 3, 2012 and notified the Respondent of his appointment in their Notice of Arbitration dated July 4, 2012.\n\n5.\n\nOn December 26, 2012, the Respondent appointed the Hon, Shri Justice Anil Dev Singh as coarbitrator,\n\n6.\n\nThe two party-appointed arbitrators chose the Hon. Marc Lalonde, P.C., O.C., Q.C., to serve as the third, presiding arbitrator pursuant to Article 7(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Presiding Arbitrator notified the Parties by letter dated February 4, 2013, of his acceptance of the appointment.\n\n7.\n\nBy e-mail dated May 11, 2013, the Respondent notified the Claimants and the Tribunal of its intention to challenge the appointments of Professor Orrego Vicuna and the Hon. Marc Lalonde.\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent raised its challenge to the two members of the Tribunal at the First Procedural Meeting held in The Hague on May 15, 2013.2\n\nSee Transcript of the First Procedural Meeting, pp. 5-40.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated May 20, 2013, the Respondent requested that I decide its challenge in my role as appointing authority (\"Respondent\u2019s Request\").\n\n10.\n\nBy e-mail dated May 21, 2013, the Claimants indicated that they would provide comments on the Respondent\u2019s Request by May 31, 2013.\n\n11.\n\nBy letter dated May 23, 2013,I invited comments from the Presiding Arbitrator and Professor Orrego Vicuna.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated May 31, 2013, the Claimants submitted their Response to the Respondent\u2019s Request.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated June 3, 2013, I informed the Parties as follows, seeking their comments, if any, by June 10, 2013:\n\n1. In June 2010, I was appointed by the Government of India as arbitrator to the seven-member Court of Arbitration under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty in the proceedings instituted by the Government of Pakistan. The Partial Award in the case was rendered on February 18, 2013 (the text is available on the PCA website).\n\n2. The International Court of Justice is at present deliberating in the *Maritime Dispute* case (Peru v. Chile) in which Professor Orrego Vicuna has been chosen by Chile as Judge *ad hoc.*\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated June 4, 2013, the Respondent commented on the Claimants\u2019 May 31 Response (\"Respondent\u2019s Reply\"). By e-mail of the same date, the Respondent indicated it would not raise any issue with respect to the June 3 disclosure.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter dated June 5, 2013, the Claimants commented on the Respondent\u2019s comments of the previous day (\"Claimants\u2019 Rebuttal\"). By a second letter of the same date, the Claimants indicated they would raise no issue on the June 3 disclosure.\n\n16.\n\nBy letters also dated June 5, 2013, Professor Orrego Vicuna and the Hon. Marc Lalonde submitted comments on the challenge to their respective appointments.\n\n**III. THE CHALLENGE TO THE HON. MARC LALONDE & PROF. ORREGO VICUNA**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Respondent\u2019s Comments*\n-----------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent challenges the appointments of the Hon. Marc Lalonde and Prof. Orrego Vicuna on the basis of a \"lack of the requisite impartiality under Article 10(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules due to an \u2018issue conflict.\u2019\"3 The Respondent believes that \"strongly held and articulated positions by two of three arbitrators in this case on a controversial legal standard of relevance here \u2018give rise to justifiable doubts\u2019 as to their impartiality and constitute a valid reason for concern on the part of the Government of India\".4\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, p. 1.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, p. 5.\n\n18.\n\nThe controversial legal standard to which the Respondent refers is that of \"essential security interests\" as found in Article 11(3) of the Treaty.5 In this arbitration, the Respondent intends to argue that the governmental decisions the Claimants allege to be breaches of the Treaty were made for reasons related to the State\u2019s \"essential security interests\". The Respondent\u2019s challenge is based on the fact that Professor Orrego Vicuna and the Hon. Marc Lalonde participated in two cases together in which the legal interpretation of an essential security interests provision arose.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, pp. 1-2. Article 11(3) states, in part: \u2018The provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way limit the right of either Contracting Party to apply prohibitions or restrictions of any kind or take any other action which is directed to the protection of its essential security interests\".\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent identifies three International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") arbitrations chaired by Professor Orrego Vicuna in which the tribunals decided that the essential security interests provision of the U.S.-Argentina bilateral investment treaty incorporated the \"state of necessity\" defense under customary international law as reflected in Article 25 of the International Law Commission Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.6 The Hon. Marc Lalonde served as a co-arbitrator in two of those cases: *Sempra v. Argentina* and *CMS v. Argentina.* The Respondent further notes that annulment committees were constituted to review the three arbitral awards rendered by the tribunals in those cases. According to the Respondent, the annulment committees in the two cases in which the arbitrators served together both concluded that the ruling on this legal point by the original tribunals constituted manifest error, while the third award was annulled because the original tribunal erred in its interpretation of the state of necessity defense.7\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, p. 2. *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8); *Sempra Energy International,* v. *Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16); *Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, p. 2.\n\n20.\n\nIn light of the two arbitrators\u2019 prior, shared rulings, the Respondent maintains that its challenge should be upheld in the \"interests of fundamental fairness\" and to avoid that **the** Respondent is placed at an \"unfair disadvantage\".8 The Respondent refers to an article stating that \"to preserve the appearance of impartiality, [an arbitrator\u2019s having taken a clear position in a concurring or dissenting opinion] should suffice to disqualify the arbitrator\".9\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, pp, 3, 5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, p. 5, citing C. Mouawad, *Issue Conflicts in Investment Treaty Arbitration,* 5(4) Transnational Dispute Management (July 2008), pp. 12-13.\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that its argument concerns \"the legal standard to be applied\" as opposed to any relationship with the facts of the aforementioned cases in which the arbitrators previously served.10 That legal standard, Respondent claims, is fundamental to other treaties and has broad implications on which the two challenged arbitrators have already established their views.11\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, p. 5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, p. 7.\n\n22.\n\nIn respect of its challenge to Professor Orrego Vicuna, the Respondent further argues that his \"strong public declarations on the subject have included at least one clear writing in addition to the three decisions in the aforementioned cases, a chapter in a book published in 2011 in which he strongly defended his position\".12 In the Respondent\u2019s view, Professor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s chapter demonstrates his sympathy toward a legal issue in this arbitration that would call into question the fundamental fairness of the proceedings.13\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, p. 3, referring to the article *Softening Necessity,* published in Looking to the Future: Essays on International Law in Honor of W. Michael Reisman (M. Arsanjani *et al.,* Martinus Nijhoff, Leiden, Boston 2011), pp, 741-751.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, p. 3.\n\n23.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s position that its challenge is timely, despite the Claimants\u2019 view that the fifteen-day limitation under Article 11(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules expired by the fifteenth day after each arbitrator\u2019s appointment. The Respondent argues that the fifteen-day limitation applies from the day on which the circumstances underlying the challenge became known to the challenging party, emphasizing that actual knowledge is required.14 The Respondent asserts that it \"only became aware of the basis for the challenge... on May 11, 2013\" three days after having retained new counsel.15\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, p. 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, p. 7.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent relies on a commentary on the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules stating that Article 11(1) \"requires that a party send notice of challenge within 15 days after the circumstances underlying the challenge \u2018became known to that party\u2019\".16 The Respondent also quotes from the commentary that \"[t]he provision could have but notably does not include, the phrase \u2018should have known\u2019 or \u2018ought to have known\u2019\".17 In support of its interpretation of Article 11, the Respondent refers to a discussion in the Working Group charged with the revision of the 1976 Rules. The Working Group considered the addition of a provision that would grant the appointing authority discretion to dismiss a challenge if the challenging party \"ought reasonably to have known the grounds for challenge at an earlier stage of the procedure\". According to the Working Group\u2019s Report, that language was rejected in part because it was considered that it would create a standard of \"imputed knowledge that would be a novelty in the Rules\".18\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, p. 6, quoting from David D. Caron & Lee M. Caplan, THE Uncitral Arbitration Rules: A COMMENTARY (Oxford University Press 2013), p. 245.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* at footnote 260, p. 245.\n\n25.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 argument that \"ignorance of the law\" does not help a party evade the fifteen-day time limit is irrelevant here. The Respondent further contends that one of the cases on which the Claimants rely, *AWG v. Argentina,* supports not Claimants\u2019 position, but rather Respondent\u2019s, because in that case the time period was said to have begun from the date that the respondent knew of the arbitrator\u2019s prior ruling.19\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, p. 4.\n\n26.\n\nFinally, the Respondent maintains that the challenge is not untimely because the first memorial had not yet been filed at the time the challenge was made and there would be little disruption to the proceedings as a result.20\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, p. 5.\n\n27.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s position that its challenge carries additional weight, and is unprecedented, on the basis that it involves two arbitrators implicated in the same way.21\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, p. 9.\n\n*Claimants\u2019 Comments*\n---------------------\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants ask the appointing authority to reject the Respondent\u2019s challenge in light of its untimeliness, lack of merit, and unprecedented foundation.\n\n29.\n\nTurning first to the question of timeliness, the Claimants maintain that Article 11(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules \"does not excuse a party from the fifteen-day deadline by claiming ignorance\" of the legal issues at stake here and the decisions of prior tribunals on those issues.22 The Claimants argue that to allow the challenge at this stage would inappropriately reward a party that does not retain counsel until the eleventh hour.23 The Claimants stress that the \"security decision\" at issue was known to be relevant since December 12, 2011\u2014the date of a letter from the Claimants to the Respondent concerning the dispute.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 2.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 11.\n\n30.\n\nOn the merits of the challenge, the Claimants assert that the Respondent has not cited and cannot cite any decision in which an arbitrator was removed on the basis of an issue conflict; all challenge decisions addressing the question have rejected the issue conflict premise. In the Claimants\u2019 view, \"the mere fact that an arbitrator has decided a particular legal issue in a past case involving a different treaty and different parties, is simply not a proper basis for challenging that arbitrator\u2019s impartiality\".24\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 16.\n\n31.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, to accept such a basis for a challenge would prove untenable for the investor-state system.25 It cites a decision on a challenge in *Universal Compression International Holdings, S.L.U. v. Venezuela,* in which the World Bank President, as Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID, described how \"the international investment arbitration framework would cease to be viable if an arbitrator was disqualified simply for having faced similar factual or legal issues in other arbitrations\".26 Moreover, it creates a slippery slope for counsel attempting to evade a deadline for bringing a challenge by not advising one\u2019s client of an appointed arbitrator\u2019s previous decisions until convenient to the party\u2019s legal strategy, as a stall tactic.27\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rebuttal, pp. 1-2.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 4, citing *Universal Compression Int'l Holdings, S.L.U.* V. *Venezuela,* Decision on Proposal to Disqualify, (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5), para. 84 [hereinafter *Universal Compression].*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rebuttal, p. 3.\n\n32.\n\nReferring to certain arbitral challenge decisions, the Claimants further argue that having rendered an opinion on an issue is not a basis for challenging impartiality as impartiality must entail bias toward a party which the Respondent has not raised here.28 The Claimants distinguish the Respondent\u2019s cited commentary and assert to the contrary that the International Bar Association Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration expressly provide that no conflict or bias is created when an arbitrator has previously published a general opinion concerning an issue arising in the arbitration.29 In the Claimants\u2019 view, the Respondent\u2019s theory would only support \"tactical challenges to duly appointed arbitrators\".30\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, pp. 12-13, citing *AWG Group v. Argentina/Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. v. Argentina,* Decision on the Proposal for Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal, para. 21; *Tidewater Inc.* v. *Venezuela,* Decision on Proposal to Disqualify, (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15), paras. 65-66; *Urbaser S.A.* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Proposal to Disqualify, (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26), para, 45; and, *Universal Compression,* para. 83.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 14.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 15.\n\n*Professor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s Comments*\n------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nProfessor Orrego Vicuna rejects the Respondent\u2019s basis for its challenge. He stresses that the questions involved in the cases to which the Respondent refers are unrelated to the provisions of the Treaty in this case and that he remains unaware of the arguments on which the Respondent intends to rely. Thus, in Professor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s view, there is no possible conflict of interest.\n\n34.\n\nFurther, Professor Orrego Vicuna maintains that the composition of a tribunal cannot be made dependent on the views that a party may or may not make in the future.31 The fact that the Respondent announces it is \"likely\" that \"the question of state of necessity\" may be raised is \"not specific enough to justify a challenge\".32 He stresses that \"the question concerning state of necessity in the Argentina-United States Bilateral Investment Treaty... [is] unrelated to the provision of the India-Mauritius Bilateral Investment Treaty\".33 Likewise, in his view, there is no resemblance between the factual situation as argued in the Argentinean cases and the economic situation of India, as far as he is able to ascertain.\n\nProfessor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s Comments, p. 1.\n\nProfessor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s Comments, p. 2.\n\nProfessor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s Comments, p. 2.\n\n35.\n\nProfessor Orrego Vicuna reiterates his impartiality and denies that he has made any \"strong public declarations\" on any relevant topic as the Respondent claims.34 Nothing in his 2011 book chapter could be construed as a strong public declaration. In Professor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s view, it is for counsel to convince a tribunal as to an appropriate interpretation of treaty language in each case.\n\nProfessor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s Comments, p. 2.\n\n*The Hon. Marc Lalonde\u2019s Comments*\n----------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Hon. Marc Lalonde makes three observations in respect of his view that the arguments presented by the Respondent do not justify his withdrawal from the case. He notes, first, that the Treaty as well as the facts at issue in the current case differ from those involved in the cases to which the Respondent refers.\n\n37.\n\nSecond, Mr. Lalonde highlights that the decisions in the two Argentinean cases in which he was involved were rendered \"well before the decisions of the annulment committees\" in those cases or in the third case to which the Respondent refers; the decisions in the latter cases were rendered in 2005 and 2007 respectively. On that point, he adds that the interpretation of the state of necessity defense in relation to the U.S.-Argentina bilateral investment treaty has been the subject of intense debate.35\n\nThe Hon. Marc Lalonde\u2019s Comments, p. 1,\n\n38.\n\nThird, should a question of essential security interests arise in this case, Mr. Lalonde maintains that his intention is to \"approach the matter with an open mind and to give it full consideration\". He declares: \"I would certainly not feel bound by the CMS or the Sempra Awards which... referred to a different treaty and different facts\".\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**A. Rules relevant to the challenge**\n--------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that Articles 10 and 11 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules set out the relevant provisions for the resolution of the Respondent\u2019s challenge.\n\n40.\n\nArticle 10(1) provides:\n\nAny arbitrator may be challenged if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator\u2019s impartiality or independence.\n\n41.\n\nArticle 11(1) restricts the timing of any challenge under Article 10, stating:\n\nA party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall send notice of his challenge within fifteen days after the appointment has been notified to the challenging party or within fifteen days after the circumstances mentioned in articles 9 and 10 became known to that party.\n\n**B. Timeliness of the challenge**\n----------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the date on which the limited fifteen-day period provided in Article 11(1) began here. The Parties\u2019 disagreement turns on their respective definitions of which facts constitute \"circumstances... that give rise to justifiable doubts\" as stated in Article 10(1) and referenced in Article 11.\n\n43.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the fifteen-day period expired on July 20, 2012 in reference to any challenge to Professor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s appointment on the ground raised by the Respondent because, in the Claimants\u2019 view, all the facts forming the basis for the challenge were known to the Respondent by July 4, 2012, the date of notification of Professor Onego Vicuna\u2019s appointment.36 In the Claimants\u2019 view, the relevant facts are those relating to the nature of the issues in the case (including the potential for an \"essential security\" issue to arise) and the identity of the arbitrator.37 Likewise, the fifteen-day period began on February 4, 2013 and expired February 20, 2013 in reference to the present challenge to the appointment of the Hon. Marc Lalonde for the same reason.38\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, pp. 2, 11.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, p. 10.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response, pp. 2, 11.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, argues that the fifteen-day period began no earlier than May 11, 2013: the date on which it claims it first learned of the facts giving rise to the challenge, which are, in the Respondent\u2019s view, the arbitrators\u2019 past decisions and Professor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s 2011 book chapter. The Respondent notified the Tribunal and the Claimants the same day of its intention to raise the challenge.\n\n45.\n\nI agree with the Respondent that the pertinent circumstances constituting the basis for its challenge as argued in the materials presented to me and triggering the fifteen-day period of Article 11(1) are the facts that the two arbitrators served together on the *CMS* and *Sempra* tribunals, that Professor Orrego Vicuna additionally chaired the *Enron* tribunal, and that all three tribunals took a position on \"essential security interest\" in their awards (which were subsequently annulled). Further, Professor Orrego Vicuna wrote an article in 2011, defending the approach of these three tribunals.\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimants do not contest the Respondent\u2019s assertion that it learned of the arbitrators\u2019 coparticipation in *CMS* and *Sempra,* Professor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s chairmanship in *Enron,* and Professor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s later book chapter on May 11, 2013 - just three days after the Respondent retained new co-counsel. Rather, the Claimants stress that the Respondent could have known these facts at the time of the appointments of Professor Orrego Vicuna and the Hon. Marc Lalonde and that the Respondent should not be rewarded for having retained an experienced counsel at the eleventh hour.\n\n47.\n\nIn my view, the text of Article 11(1) is clear enough when it speaks of \"the circumstances... became known to the party\". According to one leading commentary on the UNCITRAL Rules, Article 11 requires actual knowledge of the fact(s) invoked as a basis for the challenge. Thus, the Parties agree that these facts, which I have found to be those relevant to the timeliness evaluation, became known to the Respondent on May 11, 2013, at which point the Respondent informed the Claimants about its forthcoming challenge, which was then formally raised at the First Procedural Meeting of the Tribunal on May 15, 2013. The Respondent\u2019s Request is therefore timely pursuant to Article 11 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants maintain, nevertheless, that the Respondent\u2019s \"actual knowledge\" interpretation of Article 11 creates an unworkable and risky standard. Under the Respondent\u2019s interpretation, counsel could wait to inform his or her client of circumstances giving rise to justifiable doubt at any stage in the proceeding, permitting a party to present a challenge without regard to the egregiousness of counsel\u2019s strategic maneuver.39\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rebuttal, p. 3.\n\n49.\n\nIn my view, the Respondent has not raised a frivolous challenge intended to subvert the object and purpose of the fifteen-day limit. Moreover, the Claimants suffer no prejudice by my entertaining the challenge at this stage nor would it pose any serious interruption to the proceedings.\n\n50.\n\nHaving dismissed the Claimants\u2019 objection to the timeliness of the challenge, I turn now to the merits of the Respondent\u2019s Request.\n\n**C. Merits of the challenge**\n------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Respondent claims that circumstances give rise to justifiable doubts as to the impartiality, and not the independence, of the Presiding Arbitrator and Professor Orrego Vicuna, stating that its \"challenge is not based on a lack of independence or inappropriate action by either Professor Orrego Vicuna or Mr. Lalonde, both of whom it holds in high esteem\".40\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, p. 5 (footnote omitted).\n\n52.\n\nThe basis for the Respondent\u2019s doubts as to the arbitrators\u2019 impartiality is what the Respondent calls an \"issue conflict\".41 By \"issue conflict\", the Respondent refers to a pre-existing view held by the arbitrators regarding an issue in dispute between the Parties. The Respondent considers that previous statements attributable to the arbitrators reflect their pre-determined view and that the arbitrators might have a \"professional interest\" in a particular result to avoid contradicting their earlier decisions.42\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, p. 1.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, pp. 1-2.\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s concern is that the two arbitrators \"strongly held and articulated positions\"43 on the interpretation of the \"essential security interests\" provision together in two cases *(CMS* and *Sempra)* and that Professor Orrego Vicuna again repeated that position in *Enron* and defended it in a 2011 book chapter he authored. Of relevance in the three cases was Article XI of the U.S.-Argentina bilateral investment treaty which provides:\n\n*This Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for* the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or *the protection of its own essential security interests.* (emphasis added)\n\nThe *CMS, Sempra,* and *Enron* tribunals analyzed the legal concept of \"essential security interests\" in reference to customary international law on the state of necessity and were later criticized, as the Respondent highlights, in respect of those analyses by subsequently appointed annulment committees.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, pp, 1-2.\n\n54.\n\nThe full text of Article 11(3) of the present Treaty (between India and Mauritius) states:\n\n*The provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way limit the right of either Contracting Party to apply prohibitions or restrictions of any kind or take any other action which is directed to the protection of its essential security interests,* or to the protection of public health or the prevention of diseases in pests and animals or plants, (emphasis added)\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that its concern is not related to the substance of the arbitrators\u2019 previously stated views, but rather to the totality of the circumstances, including their service together on two occasions, as well as the additional decision and chapter by Professor Orrego Vicuna, from which it believes its doubts as to both arbitrators\u2019 open-mindedness on the standard for the application of an \"essential security interests\" provision are justifiable.\n\n56.\n\nIn response, the Claimants contend: first, that these circumstances do not give rise to justifiable doubts within the meaning of Article 10 of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as the arbitrators\u2019 prior decisions do not demonstrate impartiality toward either Party; second, that a prior decision of law or other opinion on a legal issue cannot serve as a basis for a challenge either under the Rules or in the context of the international investment arbitration framework taken as a whole; and third, that granting the Respondent\u2019s Request would be an unprecedented outcome disqualifying an arbitrator for having rendered a decision on a point of law in an unrelated arbitration with different facts, different parties, and a different treaty.\n\n57.\n\nBefore turning to my analysis in respect of each arbitrator, I note that the intention of the Respondent to rely on the \"essential security interests\" provision in Article 11(3) of the Treaty seems credible, not just a pretext to mount the present challenge. According to the Notice of Arbitration, the Additional Solicitor-General of India recommended that the Government of India could make a \"policy\" decision to reserve the S-Band to itself for national and military purposes. Such decision, he opined, then could serve as basis for Antrix to terminate the contract with Devas, the company in which the Claimants maintain to have made their investment.44 It is certain that the justification provided for the termination of the contract will be one of the legal issues to be considered by the Tribunal should it reach the merits of the dispute, including whether the Respondent can successfully rely on Article 11(3) of the Treaty.\n\nSee Notice of Arbitration, pp. 3-4. See also Claimants\u2019 Response, pp. 4-5 and Claimants\u2019 letter of December 12, 2011, addressed to the Prime Minister of India, inviting the Government to settle the dispute pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty (the letter was copied, among others, to the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister of India).\n\n58.\n\nI also note that the basis for the alleged conflict of interest in a challenge invoking an \"issue conflict\" is a narrow one as it does not involve a typical situation of bias directly for or against one of the parties. The conflict is based on a concern that an arbitrator will not approach an issue impartially, but rather with a desire to conform to his or her own previously expressed view. In this respect, as discussed by the Parties, some challenge decisions and commentators have concluded that knowledge of the law or views expressed about the law are not *per se* sources of conflict that require removal of an arbitrator; likewise, a prior decision in a common area of law does not automatically support a view that an arbitrator may lack impartiality.45 Thus, to sustain any challenge brought on such a basis requires more than simply having expressed any prior view; rather, I must find, on the basis of the prior view and any other relevant circumstances, that there is an appearance of pre-judgment of an issue likely to be relevant to the dispute on which the parties have a reasonable expectation of an open mind.\n\nSee *supra* note 26 and accompanying text.\n\n59.\n\nThe fact that Professor Orrego Vicuna in all three cases and the Hon. Marc Lalonde in two cases adopted a consistent view on the concept of \"essential security interests\" is not surprising, as those tribunals applied the same provision to similar facts, prior to the issuance of the first of the three annulment decisions.46 Both arbitrators claim that they will approach the issue in the pending case with an open mind.\n\nThe award in *CMS* was dispatched to the parties in that case on May 12, 2005, the award in *Enron* on May 22, 2007 and the one in *Sempra* on September 28, 2007. The first annulment decision, the one in *CMS,* was issued on September 25, 2007. It could not have been taken into account by any of the three tribunals as the last one of them, in *Sempra,* completed its work just a few days prior to its issuance. In fact, the arbitrators in *Sempra* signed the award between September 9 and 18, 2007. The two other annulment decisions were issued in 2010: in *Sempra* on June 29, and in *Enron* on July 30.\n\n*(1) The challenge to the appointment of Professor Orrego Vicuna*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nProfessor Orrego Vicuna observes that each party bears the burden of convincing a tribunal of the appropriate interpretation of a treaty and asserts that he has not made any pre-determination as to the meaning of any provision in the present Treaty.\n\n61.\n\nThere is no doubt that the facts in the present case and the Argentinean cases are different. The Respondent\u2019s point is that \"the issue giving rise to this challenge is neither treaty-specific nor fact-specific\".47 The Respondent accepts that every case is fact-specific and does not contend that the facts at issue in the Argentinean cases are relevant to this arbitration.48 Rather, it contends that as to the interpretation of \"essential security interests\", Professor Orrego Vicuna has a closed view.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply quoted in Claimants\u2019 Rebuttal at p. 2, para. 2.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request, p. 5, point 2.\n\n62.\n\nI agree with Professor Orrego Vicuna that the Parties bear the burden of convincing the Tribunal of an appropriate interpretation to be applied. It is not disputed that, should it reach the merits of the Parties\u2019 arguments, the Tribunal will face the issue of essential security interests. In interpreting this legal concept, Professor Orrego Vicuna has assumed a consistent position in three decisions. On a fourth occasion, he further affirmed that position in an academic article in which he wrote:\n\nWhile the interlinking of treaty and customary law requirements in respect of necessity has been held to be a manifest error of law in the context of a particular case [referring to the decision of the CMS annulment committee], one may respectfully wonder whether the error of law might not lie with the approach suggesting that a rather vague clause of a treaty might be able to simply do away with the obligations established under the same treaty.\n\n[...]\n\nIn this light the discussion about whether the availability of the defense should first be examined under the treaty and, only if unsuccessful, examined next under customary international law, appears to be somewhat circular. If the treaty precludes the defense there is no second shot at it under customary law. If it provides for an exception and this is not defined, its examination under customary international law will be the first and only shot supplementing the treaty vacuum. It is the two shots that would appear to run counter to the strictness of the requirements of international law.\n\n63.\n\nMoreover, in his comments on the challenge in the present case, he still refers to \"the questions concerning state of necessity in the Argentina-United States Bilateral Investment treaty which were before several tribunals in which [he] sat as President\".49\n\nProfessor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s Comments, p. 1.\n\n64.\n\nThe standard to be applied here evaluates the objective reasonableness of the challenging party\u2019s concern.50 In my view, being confronted with the same legal concept in this case arising from the same language on which he has already pronounced on the four aforementioned occasions could raise doubts for an objective observer as to Professor Orrego Vicuna\u2019s ability to approach the question with an open mind. The later article in particular suggests that, despite having reviewed the analyses of three different annulment committees, his view remained unchanged. Would a reasonable observer believe that the Respondent has a chance to convince him to change his mind on the same legal concept?51 Professor Orrego Vicuna is certainly entitled to his views, including to his academic freedom. But equally the Respondent is entitled to have its arguments heard and ruled upon by arbitrators with an open mind. Here, the right of the latter has to prevail. For this reason, I agree with the Respondent that Professor Orrego Vicuna should withdraw from this arbitration.\n\nDavid D. Caron and Lee M. Caplan, The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary (Oxford University Press 2013), p. 210.\n\nProfessor Orrego Vicuna states in his Comments on the challenge that \"if counsel for the Respondent convinces the Tribunal of given arguments on [\"essential security interest\"] or any other matter this will be given due weight in the decision reached\" (p. 2).\n\n65.\n\nHaving considered all the relevant factors, I sustain the Respondent\u2019s Request to disqualify Professor Orrego Vicuna from serving as an arbitrator in these proceedings.\n\n*(2) The challenge to the appointment of the Hon. Marc Lalonde*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe circumstances presented by the Respondent as giving rise to justifiable doubts about the Presiding Arbitrator\u2019s impartiality are more limited. The Respondent argues that Mr. Lalonde\u2019s participation on the two panels with Professor Orrego Vicuna, both of which discussed the \"essential security interests\" provision in their decisions, is sufficient to disqualify him from participating on this Tribunal. I, however, find that Mr. Lalonde\u2019s more limited pronouncements on the relevant text are not sufficient to give rise to justifiable doubts regarding his impartiality. Mr. Lalonde has not taken a position on the legal concept in issue subsequent to the decisions of the three annulment committees and thus I can accept his statement that \"[his] intention is to approach the matter with an open mind and to give it full consideration\" and that \"[he] would certainly not feel bound by the *CMS* or the *Sempra* awards\". In my view, there is no appearance of his prejudgment on the issue of \"essential security interests\" which will have to be considered by the Tribunal in the ongoing arbitration.\n\n67.\n\nTherefore, I cannot sustain the Respondent\u2019s Request to disqualify the Hon, Marc Lalonde from serving as the Presiding Arbitrator in these proceedings.\n\n*The remainder of this page is left intentionally blank.*\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n**NOW THEREFORE,** having considered the submissions of the Parties and **the** comments of the challenged arbitrators, I\n\n**HEREBY SUSTAIN** the challenge brought against the appointment of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicuna by the Respondent in its Request of May 20, 2013, and\n\n**HEREBY DENY** the challenge brought against the appointment of the Hon.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nAlthough I concur with many of the findings and determinations in the Award, I have reluctantly concluded that I must register my dissenting opinion with respect to the determinations made by the majority on the \"essential security\" defence submitted under Article 11(3) of the Agreement between the Republic of India and the Republic of Mauritius for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, (the **Treaty). I** propose to explain my divergent views and, in particular, to develop in some detail the relevant factual findings which, in my opinion, must be considered in order to make a proper determination of the possible applicability of Article 11 (3) in this case.\n\n2.\n\nI will, therefore, turn firstly to a review of what I consider to be the material events that preceded the decision to terminate the agreement between Devas Multimedia Private Limited **(Devas),** an Indian company, and Antrix Corporation Limited **(Antrix),** an Indian state-owned company. That agreement was entered into by the parties on January 28, 2005 (the **Devas Agreement).** On February 17, 2011, a decision taken by the Cabinet Committee on Security **(CCS)** was announced by the state Press Information Bureau under the heading, \"CCS Decides to Annul Antrix-Deal\".\n\n**B. FACTUAL MATRIX**\n---------------------\n\n3.\n\nWhat I consider to be material events are those which lead Ultimately to the action taken by the CCS. In my opinion, for an adequate analysis of the objects or purposes of the CCS decision, this background must be well understood. My colleagues appear to agree with the position of the Respondent that,\n\n..[a]n arbitral tribunal may not sit in judgement on national security matters as on any other factual dispute arising between an investor and a state. National security issues relate to the existential core of a State. An investor who wishes to challenge a State decision in that respect faces a heavy burden of proof, such as bad faith, absence of authority or application to measures that do not relate to essential security interests. [Award, \u00b6 245],\n\nThis presumed deference for state decision making in relation to national security cannot, in my view, over-ride our duty as arbitrators to decide the issues on the whole of the evidence in this case. Although there may be instances in which a state's measures are *ipso facto* essential security matters and no further inquiry would be required to understand them, this case is not one of those instances. The narrative I will outline shows, strongly in my opinion, that the decision of the CCS was not directed to the protection of India's essential security interests, but simply removed the S-band spectrum from Antrix for commercial use and ordered that the Devas Agreement be annulled forthwith. Annulling the Devas Agreement was momentous, but the CCS did not, at the same time, assign the \"precious S-Band\" to the Indian military. The decision making as to who would get to use the soon-to-be-available S-Band spectrum was left to other bodies, namely the Insat Co-ordination Committee (ICC) and the Technical Advisory Group **(TAG)** which was a subcommittee of it (Tr. 1008). I now turn to a recitation of the events pertinent to understanding the object of the February.17, 2011 announcement.\n\n4.\n\nAt the end of October, 2009, Dr. Radhakrishnan assumed his responsibilities as Secretary for the Department of Space **(DOS),** Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation **(ISRO),** Chair of the Space Commission and, not incidentally, Chairman of Antrix. His simultaneous occupying of all four positions was consistent with the conduct of his predecessors, Dr. Kasturirangan (from April 1, 1994 to August 2003) and Dr. Madhavan Nair (August 2003 to October 2009).\n\n5.\n\nA little over a month later, on December 8, 2009, Dr. Radhakrishnan, in his capacity as Chairman, ISRO and Secretary, DOS, constituted a one-man committee composed of a former member of the Space Commission to conduct a comprehensive review of all aspects of the Devas Agreement1. This inquiry was not publically announced nor was Devas aware of it until after the fact. Dr. Radhakrishnan commissioned Dr. B.N Suresh, who was then the Director of the Indian Institute of Space and Technology, assisted by Mr. SK Jha, the Director of DOS, Mr. S. Sayeenathan, Deputy Director FMO, and Mr. Parameshwara, Director of Business Development (the Suresh Committee), to\n\nreview and examine the legal, commercial, procedural and technical aspects related to licensing of spectrum/frequency and leasing of transponders with reference to Devas Multimedia Contract. [Joint Chronological Core Hearing Bundle **(JCB)** 133].\n\nDr. Radhakrishnan initially directed the committee to submit its report to him by December 31, 2009, \"relating to the compliance or otherwise of the issues referred to above and remedial measures required, if any.\"\n\nMr. A. Vijay Anand, Joint Secretary, Department of Space, stated in his direct testimony that, \"Separately, in November 2009, shortly after I had been appointed Joint Secretary, and prior to the time that I had become aware of the details regarding defence and security needs for S-band capacity, I was informed of certain claimed irregularities in connection with the Devas Contract.\" [Anand Witness Statement Para. 8]. Following an internal investigation within the department, he asserted, \"It was the disclosure of the allegation regarding irregularities and disturbing information resulting from the Department of Space's preliminary investigation that led to my recommendation and the decision of the Department of Space to ask a former member of the Space Commission, Dr. B.N. Suresh, to undertake a review of the Devas Contract.\" [Anand WS Para. 12]. Based on these assertions, there does not appear to be any basis to think the military's requirements for S-band spectrum, however described at that stage, would be addressed by Dr. Suresh in his report. As I later note, *c.f.* paragraph 17 *infra,* Mr. Anand not only never discussed military requirements with Dr. Suresh, he was not even aware of such requirements until after receipt of Dr. Suresh's report. [Anand Tr. p.p. 882-883].\n\n6.\n\nAlthough dated May, 2010, the Suresh Committee Report was not in fact delivered to Dr. Radhakrishnan until June 7, 2010 (Suresh Committee Report, JCB 146). In the meantime, several potentially related events had occurred. On January 25, 2010, confidential minutes were issued in respect of a meeting held on December 15, 2009 between Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff **(HQ IDS),** Ministry of Defence **(MOD),** the Directorate of Integrated Space Cell (ISC) and ISRO (JCB 134). Paragraph 7., labeled \"S Band\", stated various requirements in these terms:\n\n(i) To cater for requirements up to 2012 - 120 Carriers, 17.5 MHz. Out of which 50 Carriers are being used by the Armed Forces;\n\n(ii) Additional in 12th Plan - 40 MHz;\n\n(iii) Additional in 13th Plan - 50 MHz.\n\n7.\n\nOn March 26, 2010, ISRO wrote to the Director of Satellite Communication and Navigation Programmes (SCNP) and to the Managing Director of Antrix, enclosing an application received from a journalist with The Hindu Business Line, in Bangalore, seeking information under the Right to Information Act, 2005 (RTI Act) (JCB 138). The recipients were requested to forward the appropriate inputs before April 5, 2010. The application outlined several questions directed to the subject matter of the Devas Agreement.\n\n8.\n\nOn April 23, 2010, the Joint Director for Joint Communications Electronics Staff for the HQ IDS and MOD wrote to ISRO, enclosing a description of Satellite Bandwidth requirements for Army, Navy and Air Force up to 2022. The letter requested that the \"Satellite Bandwidth requirements be factored while allocating/building capacity on existing Satellite/future Satellites.\" The attached description of these requirements included bandwidth for S-Band, C-Band, Ku Band, Ka Band and UHF.\n\n9.\n\nOn May 30, 2010, The Hindu Business Line published an article under the headline, \"Devas gets preferential allocation of ISRO's spectrum.\" (JOB 142). The sub-headline stated, \"Bangalore firm had signed lease pact with space agency's commercial arm Antrix in 2005\". The author wrote, among other things, that while ISRO had responded to various queries, \"It, however, did not say how much spectrum has been given in the coveted S-band segment; nor how much Devas would pay for it.\" The article also mentioned,\n\nAnother question dogging telecom circles is whether Devas Multimedia Ltd. is using the ISRO platform to get a backdoor entry into the telecom space. Devas has only an Internet service provider's (ISP) licence. Its portfolio of services includes streaming video, audio and data as well as Web access, infotainment and social applications.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 1, 2010, The Hindu Business Line published a further article, in the form of an editorial, headlined, \"Another spectrum sold on the quiet.\" (JOB 143). It began with the comment, \"It is time the Government realised that a transparent mechanism is needed to supervise the sale of scarce assets.\" Directly addressing the Devas Agreement, the editorial stated,\n\nOne wonders how the MPs and the Government will respond now, although there really isn't much to think about: the 2005 agreement should be annulled and the ISRO quota should be auctioned so that the Government can raise some more much-needed money.\n\n11.\n\nOn June 4, 2010, Dr. Ashok Chandra from the Ministry of Communications & DOT wrote to Shri G. Balachandran, the Additional Secretary of ISRO, enclosing copies of the May 30, 2010 news report and the June 1, 2010 editorial published by The Hindu Business Line (JOB 144). The Additional Secretary was requested \"to kindly provide your comments on the news reports immediately.\" For further emphasis, the letter stated, \"Kindly look into the matter personally.\"\n\n12.\n\nOn June 7, 2010, Dr. Suresh transmitted the Suresh Committee Report to Dr. Radhakrishnan. In that correspondence, Dr. Suresh said that his report on GSAT-6 addressed \"all aspects of the agreement like legal, commercial, procedural and technical...\" (JOB 145). The face of the transmittal letter bears some handwritten notes from Dr. Radhakrishnan to Additional Secretary DOS, Balachandran, instructing him to examine the Report in consultation with the Director of SCNP, the Scientific Secretary and the Joint Secretary, DOS, Mr. A. Vijay Anand, who later testified before our tribunal (Tr. 892). In addition, Dr. Radhakrishnan directed, \"We need to place this matter to the Space Commission in its Agenda of 117th meeting to be scheduled for the first week of July 2010\".\n\n13.\n\nThe Suresh Committee Report acknowledges that there had been a review by Dr. Radhakrishnan in December 2009 \"and also during different phases of discussion\". (Suresh Committee Report \u00b6 12.0). At the conclusion of the Report, Dr. Suresh wrote,\n\nOverall review of GSAT-6, which is a state of the art satellite, in conjunction with the ground segment which is in the process of development, by the service provider reveals a significant step for bringing a new satellite based service to India. (Suresh Committee Report \u00b6 15).\n\nAmong the six recommendations in the Report, Dr. Suresh mentions,\n\nThe utilization of the S-band frequency spectrum allotted for satellite based services to ISRO/DOS for satellite communications is extremely important. Therefore this aspect has to be critically examined considering all usages including GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A by a competent technical team on high priority. The strategic and other essential needs of the country should also be considered. (Suresh Committee Report \u00b6 15.(i)).\n\nOne other recommendation should also be noted. It states,\n\nConsidering the fact ISRO/DOS has developed GSAAT 6 Satellite with complex technologies to start a new service in the national interest it is important that the agreement includes appropriate clauses to give explicit preference to ISRO in case of a demand for use of this service under emergent conditions for strategic or any other essential applications. As on today 47 months have elapsed from the payment date of first installment i.e. June 2006. As per the agreement a delay of 12 months in delivery attracts a penalty of US$ 5 million. This clause looks severe considering the fact that the satellite demands development of a few complex technologies for the first time. In view of these factors, the agreement needs to be re-visited taking Into account all issues like ICC guidelines, importance of preserving the spectrum for essential national needs, international standards, and also due weightage for the upfront payment made by Devas. (Suresh Committee Report \u00b6 15.(iv)).\n\nAlthough the Report refers a few times to \"strategic and other essential needs\", there is no specific mention of national security or military requirements. I should also note that the Suresh Committee Report appears to uphold the legality of the Devas Agreement and the parties' compliance with existing Indian government policies and regulatory requirements (see \u00b6\u00b6s 6. \"Approvals for GSAT 6 and GSAT-A\", 7. \"SATCOM Policy and use of INSAT Capacity by private service providers\" and 8. \"Procedure followed by Antrix during the finalisation of Devas Contract\", JCB 146).\n\n14.\n\nOn June 14, 2010, Dr. Radhakrishnan received a letter from Mr. P.J. Thomas, Secretary for the Ministry of Communications & Information Technology and Department of Telecommunications **(DOT)** (JCB 149). Referring to the same two press reports from The Hindu Business Line, and quoting their headlines, \"Another spectrum sold on the quiet\" and \"Devas gets preferential allocation of ISRO's spectrum\", as well as attaching copies of them, P.J. Thomas then refers to the earlier letter from his department to the Additional Secretary, ISRO, G. Balachandran, requesting the comments of ISRO on these reports, noting that his comments were still awaited. A copy of that letter is also enclosed. P.J. Thomas concluded his letter, \"In view of the above, you are requested to kindly look into the matter personally and expedite your comments.\"\n\n15.\n\nOn June 14, 2010, G. Balachandran sent a short letter to the managing director of Antrix, Shri KR Sridhara Murthy, asking that he kindly send immediately six copies of the Contract that had been entered between Antrix and Devas. (JCB 150). On that same day, six copies of the Devas Agreement were sent to Shri Balachandran. (JCB 151).\n\n16.\n\nTwo days later, Dr. Radhakrishnan, as Secretary of DOS sent two practically identical memoranda, one to the Secretary of DOT and the other to Shri T.K. Viswanathan, Advisor to the Law Minister (JCB 153 and JCB 154). The memoranda attached copies of the Devas Agreement and, among other things, posed two issues:\n\n(i) With these two satellites blocking a significant portion of our S-band satellite spectrum, we do face crunch for accommodating our strategic needs that has emerged subsequently after signing of ANTRIX-Devas contract.\n\n(ii) The satellite based Devas Multimedia services also call for terrestrial supplementation (enclosure 2) wherever there are high rising buildings (that means all major urban areas). Whether this would deny a level playing ground for other service providers using terrestrial spectrum.\n\nEach memorandum asked the recipient almost the identical question. In the memorandum directed to the Advisor to the Law Minister, Dr. Radhakrishnan asked,\n\nIn the above context, we seek your legal opinion on whether ANTRIX-Devas contract need be annulled invoking any of the provisions of the contract in order to (i) to preserve the precious S band spectrum for the strategic requirements of the nation and, (ii) to ensure a level playing field for the other service providers using terrestrial spectrum.\n\n17.\n\nDuring his testimony before the tribunal, A. Vijay Anand, Joint Secretary of the DOS confirmed that although he had met with and consulted Dr. Suresh in relation to the Suresh Committee Report, they had never discussed any military needs for the S-Band satellites that were to be leased to Devas (Tr. 883). In fact, he said he had no knowledge of any military needs for an S-Band satellite at any point prior to early June 2010 (Tr. 882). He also volunteered during his cross-examination that sometime either on June 16 or thereabouts (later he said sometime between June 7 and June 10 - Tr. 912), he had participated in a discussion with Dr. Radhakrishnan, G. Balachandran, V.V. Bhat, Member Finance, SK Das, advisor to Dr. Radhakrishnan (Tr. 912) along with Mrs. Geeta Varadhan, Director Special Projects (Tr. 913), about the memoranda that Dr. Radhakrishnan was sending to the Secretary, DOT, and to the legal advisor. He said that they also discussed how to meet the needs of the military and that this contract would come in the way of providing full services to the Armed Forces. (Tr. 901-904). There is no mention of this conversation in his witness statement. When reminded of that omission, Mr. Anand said that the meeting was not minuted (Tr. 902). He further confirmed that he had never mentioned this conversation to his lawyers, even while preparing his witness statement (Tr. 916) nor, he said, had he mentioned this conversation to Mrs. Geeta Varadhan, with whom he met while preparing his witness statement (Tr. 918, lines 1-6). He then seemed to change this testimony to say that he did mention this conversation with Mrs. Geeta Varadhan (Tr. 918, lines 7-21) and then again, that this precise meeting was not in his mind (Tr. 918, lines 22-25). He further recalled that during the conversation with his colleagues, Mrs. Varadhan was asked to look into the military's requirements and submit whatever discussions or papers there were and that she brought forward a lot of minutes in the following few days (Tr. 914915). Despite all these details, he had to confirm that there was not a shred of documentary evidence to support what he recalled about either the initial discussions or the gathering of documents and their delivery by Mrs. Geeta Varadhan (Tr. 920).\n\n18.\n\nOn June 18, 2010, T.K. Viswanathan, the advisor to the Minister for Law & Justice, sent a 4 page memorandum to Dr. Radhakrishnan (JCB 156). The second paragraph confirms that Dr. Radhakrishnan personally discussed the matter in Mr. Viswanathan's chambers on June 16, 2010. At the beginning of the memorandum, Mr. Viswanathan wrote:\n\n1. Secretary Department of Space is seeking legal opinion on whether ANTRIX-Devas contract need be annulled invoking any of the provisions of the contract in order to (i) preserve the precious S band spectrum for the strategic requirements of the nation and, (ii) to ensure a level playing field for the other service providers using terrestrial spectrum.\n\n19.\n\nParagraph 4 of the legal advisor's opinion refers to the meeting with Dr. Radhakrishnan and states:\n\n4. During the discussion, it was told to us that after the signing of aforesaid agreement, new strategic needs have been emerged which require accommodation in our S Band spectrum. Department have to provide sufficient space/accommodation in the satellite to meet the demand for strategic needs of BSF, CISF, RPF and CRPF.\n\nThese initials stood for the Border Security Force (BSF), the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), the Railway Police Force (RPF) and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). There is no mention of the Army, Navy or Air Force in the legal advisor's opinion (JCB 156). In paragraph 11, for example, when addressing this question again, the legal advisor says, \"The Central government under its sovereign functions is duty bound to take care of its strategic needs in respect of various forces like BSF, CISF, CRPF, RPF etc.\" Once again, there is no reference to the any branches of the military.\n\n20.\n\nIn the legal advisor's opinion, Article 7(c) of the Devas Agreement could afford a way in which to terminate the agreement. That provision sets out termination for convenience by Antrix in the event that it is \"unable to obtain the necessary frequency and orbital slot coordination...\" (JCB 156, \u00b6 8). He further referred to the force majeure clause in Article 11 of the Devas Agreement, noting that the satellites referred to in the agreement were the property of the government and that the government and ISRO were not,\n\n...duty bound to provide orbit slot to ANTRIX for commercial activities, especially when there is strategic requirements.\n\nThe legal advisor added,\n\nWhen the Central Government/ISRO deny the orbit slot to ANTRIX in exercise of its sovereign power and function, such event may fall under the category of Force Measure (sic) as contemplated in Article 11. (JCB 156, \u00b6 11).\n\n21.\n\nWith these factors in mind, the legal advisor offered his opinion:\n\n12. Therefore, the Central Government (Department of space) in exercise of its sovereign power and function, if so desire and feel appropriate, may take a policy decision to the effect that due to the needs of strategic requirements, the Central Govt/ISRO would not be able to provide orbit slot in S band for operating PS1 to the ANTRIX for commercial activities. In that event, ANTRIX in terms of Article 7(c) read with Article 11, of the agreement may terminate the agreement and inform M/s DEVAS accordingly. (JCB 156, \u00b6 12).\n\n22.\n\nAlmost as an afterthought, the legal advisor added,\n\nAs far as the second issue relating to terrestrial supplementation and level playing field since the Department of Telecom is administratively concerned that Department may also be consulted. (JCB 156, \u00b6 13).\n\n23.\n\nFor the Impending 117th meeting of the Space Commission on July 2, 2010, the Additional Secretary, DOS, G. Balachandran, with the assistance of others in DOS, prepared a NOTE TO SPACE COMMISSION dated both June 30, 2010 and July 2, 2010 (JCB 160, page 1 and page 19). Certain items in this 19 page document should be highlighted:\n\n(a) The stated purpose of the document:\n\n1. The purpose of this Note Is to (i) apprise Space Commission on certain concerns that have arisen over a contract signed between ANTRIX Corporation, a public sector unit and the commercial arm of DOS with M/s DEVAS Multimedia Pvt Limited on January 28, 2005 for lifetime lease of 90% capacity of S-band Transponders on two Satellites built by ISRO (GSAT-6 and 6A); (ii) to further apprise on the imperative demand for S-band transponders for strategic and societal applications that have emerged since signing of the above contract; (iii) to seek guidance on the prudent utilization of the S-band spectrum of 150 MHz allocated to ISRO; and (iv) further course of actions to be followed by the Department. (JCB 160, \u00b6 1).\n\nMr. Anand, the Joint Secretary of DOS testified that the reference to \"societal applications\" included tele-medicine, tele-education, disaster management and the list could go on down to the village level to include agriculture, crop forecasting information, and fisheries information. He added that the list is actually endless. (Tr. 952 and 1000).\n\n(b) Under the heading, \"Requirements of Strategic Users and Societal Services for S-Band Transponders\", the Note describes:\n\n(8.1)...the GSAT-7 Satellite and the GSAT-7S satellite, both related to the needs of the Armed Forces.\n\n(8.2)...the same MOD minutes referred to earlier in this narrative concerning a meeting held on December 15, 2009 (JCB 134).\n\n(8.3) There are also demands for S-band transponders from Internal Security Agencies viz. BSF, CISF, Coast Guard and Police, and further, there are requirements projected by Indian Railways for train-tracking.\n\n(8.4) From societal services point of view, currently the GSAT-2 (MSS) and INSAT-3C (BSS and MSS) have S-band Transponders. There are other national societal requirements for emergency communication dissemination of disaster warnings, tele-education, tele-health and rural communication.\n\n(c) DOS's assessment of the Devas Agreement:\n\nThe Note refers to the Suresh Committee Report, implying that \"the present contract had not gone through due diligence of financial and legal vetting\" (JCB \u00b6 13.1). It further states,\n\nAlso there are existence on record of a few anomalies that suggest that full information has not been provided to Cabinet and Space Commission; also reasonable surmises are rendered possible that Cabinet and Space Commission have been given incorrect/incomplete information also. Details follow. (JCB 160 \u00b6 13.2).\n\nWhat follows are a number of allegations of incomplete notes during the time of the original review and approval of the Devas Agreement, a suggestion that \"proper legal vetting and proper financial due diligence are wanting\" and, finally, a note that Devas\n\nwhich has a large foreign equity, can assign or sell or sub-license any and all of its rights under this agreement without any approvals from ANTRIX, the security implications that can arise as a consequence, would need serious consideration.\n\n(d) Paragraph 14.1 provided,\n\nConsidering all these facts, it was decided in the Department of Space that:\n\n(i) in order to give priority to the demand for fulfillment of strategic requirements,\n\n(ii) due to the opaqueness being seen in the preliminary examination of the Devas Agreement which would suggest that the nonexclusiveness to be ensured while allotting S-Band to private players was not observed; and\n\n(ill) considering the fact that DOT had not been consulted over a service that includes terrestrial connectivity and the implications thereon including denial of a level playing field.\n\nIt was decided to request Ministry of Law and Justice to give Its opinion as to how to annul the contract.\n\nThe Note records and attaches the legal advisor's opinion of June 18, 2010, describing it as \"their opinion as to how to annul this contract and take further follow up action to face issues that will arise out of annulment of the contract\" (JCB 160 \u00b614.2). With respect to these points, Mr. Anand was asked to agree that \"...a reader of this document would form a view that there were at least three reasons being given for taking a decision to annul the contract?\" He said, \"That's correct.\" (Anand TR. 975 and 976).\n\n(e) The Note confirmed that although the DOT'S advice had also been sought, it had not yet replied. Mr. Anand agreed that DOT had not responded by the time DOS had taken a decision to move forward and get advice as to how to annul the contract nor had DOT responded by the time of the Note to Space Commission. (Anand Tr. 975) As I will later show, DOT replied only after the Space Commission Meeting on July 2, 2010.\n\n(f) Beside the heading, \"Further courses of Action and Implications\", the Note in paragraph 15.1 stated:\n\n15.1 **Annulling the Contract:** Considering the need (i) to preserve S-band spectrum for national requirements in strategic sector and for societal applications, (ii) certain concerns on technical, managerial, financial and contractual aspects of ANTRIX-DEVAS contract, and (iii) issues involved in DEVAS obtaining the Spectrum License for the proposed services...it would be inevitable to annul the ANTRIX-DEVAS contract. (JCB 160 \u00b6 15.1).\n\nAfter referring again to the legal advice from the Law Ministry, the Note added,\n\n\"The Department will evolve a revised utilization plan for GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A.\"\n\n(g) The Note further added that the ICC (constituted in 1977) \"will be reconstituted and made to function effectively. So also the TAG.\" (JCB 160 \u00b6 15.2).\n\n(h) Finally, the mode of operation of Antrix would be revisited and \"appropriate corrections, as called for, will be implemented. (JCB 160 \u00b6 15.3).\n\n24.\n\nThe Space  commission was at this time made up of several significant figures in the Indian government. As mentioned earlier, Dr. Radhakrishnan was the Chairman. He was joined by Shri Prithviraj Chavan, who was Minister of State for the Prime Minister\u2019s office, Shri K.M Chandrasekar who was Cabinet Secretary and reported directly to the Prime Minister, as well as Shri T.K.A Nair, Dr. Radhakrishnan's predecessor, Shri Shivshankar Menon, the National Security Adviser, together with a number of others.\n\n25.\n\nAgenda item 4 from the minutes of the 117th Meeting of the Space Commission (JCB 161) discloses a thorough canvassing of the Notes which had previously been prepared for the members in relation to the Devas Agreement. The minutes show that in addition to referring to the same December 15, 2009 meeting of the MOD (JCB 134), the members were cognizant that,\n\nThere are further demands for S band transponders from internal security agencies viz., BSF, CISF, Coast Guard and Police for meeting their secured communication needs. Indian Railways have also projected S band requirements for train-tracking. (JCB161 \u00b6 117.6.3).\n\nThis minute is followed by this observation:\n\n117.6.4 Commission noted that, In view of these emerging requirements, there is an imminent need to preserve the S band spectrum for vital strategic and societal applications. Besides this, there were also certain concerns on the technical, commercial, managerial and financial aspects of the Antrix-Devas contract such as, severe penalty clauses for fallure/service interruptions, violation of the INSAT Coordination Committee's (ICC) guideline of 'non-exclusiveness' in leasing the capacity, the contract enabling Devas to sub-lease the capacity without any approvals - which could even give rise to security concerns, etc. (JCB 161 \u00b6 117.6.4).\n\n26.\n\nParagraph 117.6.6 of the minutes, records:\n\n117.6.6. Expressing specifically that the Commission is being apprised on this contractual arrangement for the first time, and further that the proposals from Department for approval of GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A also did not reflect the conclusion of such an arrangement in January 2005 itself, Commission discussed the various dimensions of the issue in detail. It was noted that Space spectrum is a vital national resource and it is of utmost importance to preserve it for emerging national applications for Strategic uses and societal applications. Given the limited availability of S band spectrum, meeting the strategic and societal needs is of higher priority than commercial/entertainment sectors. (JCB 161 \u00b6 117.6.6).\n\n27.\n\nAfter \"detailed deliberation\", the Space Commission gave the following directions:\n\n(a) Department, in view of priority to be given to the nation's strategic requirements including societal ones may take actions necessary and instruct Antrix to annul the Antrix-Devas contract.\n\n(b) Department may revive the ICC mechanism.\n\n(c) Department may evolve a revised utilization plan for GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A satellites, taking Into account the strategic and societal imperatives of the country.\n\n(d) Department may also review the working of Antrix and restructure it appropriately....\n\n(e) Department shall take necessary Internal actions on the report to be submitted by AS DOS on Suresh Committee Report and issues arising from therein... (JCB 161 \u00b6\u00b6 117.6.12 (a) to (e) and JCB 162).\n\n28.\n\nOn July 6, 2010, after the Space Commission meeting and its decisions had been taken, Mr. P.J. Thomas, Secretary DOT wrote to Dr. Radhakrishnan in reference to his earlier memorandum dated June 16, 2010. (JCB 163). Secretary Thomas made a number of observations, including: (i) the spectrum planned by DOS for strategic use is not to be shared with commercial applications (such as M/s Devas Multimedia); (iii) to date, only FM radio has been privatized by the Ministry of I & B (Information and Broadcasting).\n\nAs such views of Ministry of I & B in this regard is required to be obtained in order to maintain the level playing field. Further, if the wireless terrestrial/satellite service is to be provided under any service licence, a separate Wireless Operating Licence is required to be obtained from WPC (Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing of the DOT);\n\n(iv) compatibility in the adjacent band with other services is required to be ensured before implementing the proposed service; (v) recently, auction of BWA (Broadband Wireless Access) spectrum In the frequency band 2300-2400 MHz\n\nfetched Rs 12847.77 for 20 MHz spectrum on pan India basis. Therefore commensurate amount must be levied as spectrum charges for providing any commercial services including digital multimedia.;\n\n(vi) TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) had also recommended that spectrum other than 800, 900 and 1900 \"should be auctioned\"; and, finally,\n\n...it is proposed that the issue may be discussed in the TAG meeting where representatives from DOS, DOT, WPC, Ministry of I & B and IMD are the members. It will be appropriate if a representative from Ministry of Defence is also invited to deliberate on strategic requirement. In case the matter requires decision of ICC the same may be brought before ICC. As regards the regulatory issues such as level playing field, spectrum charges and permission from Ministry of I & B for providing broadcast service by private entity may be discussed separately under the aegis of TRAI. (JCB 163).\n\n29.\n\nTwo days later, Dr. Radhakrishnan once again sought legal advice, this time from the Additional Solicitor General of India, Shri Mohan Parasaran. (JCB 164). In his correspondence to the Additional Solicitor General, Dr. Radhakrishnan attached copies of the Devas Agreement, the Suresh Committee Report, his memorandum of June 16, 2010 to the Ministry of Law and Justice, the legal opinion of the legal advisor of June 18, 2010, the Note to the Space Commission, the minutes from the 117th Meeting of the Space Commission together with two draft letters. He stated that DOS had been advised by the Space Commission to get these letters vetted by a legal expert. One draft letter was to be written by DOS to Antrix intimating that the required S band spectrum would not be available due to the nation's requirements to utilise it for strategic and societal areas. The second draft letter from Antrix to Devas was to inform them that Antrix was not able to get the relevant clearance from the government for release of spectrum and hence the agreement was terminated. (JCB 164, Flags VII and VIII).\n\n30.\n\nThe language chosen for the two draft letters is, I believe, revealing about the state of mind of Dr. Radhakrishnan. Both draft letters reference \"Termination of Agreement dated 28.01.2005...\". The first letter, drafted to go from himself to the managing director of Antrix, says, in part:\n\nWHEREAS Government is obliged to fulfill the national requirements in strategic and societal needs of the country when utilising such S Band, Government has decided that the S band capacity made available to the Department of Space shall not be handed over to ANTRIX,\n\nANTRIX may accordingly inform Devas in terms of Article 7(c)(i) read with Article 11 of the said contract that the said contract is terminated. (JCB 164, Flag VII).\n\n31.\n\nThe second draft letter, which was intended to go from Antrix to Devas, says:\n\nGovernment of India in the Department of Space have intimated that the S band spectrum available with the Department of Space is not being made available to Antrix for commercial purpose, hence Antrix hereby intimates Devas that in terms of Article 7(c) read with Article 11 of the Agreement signed on 28.01.2005 between Antrix and Devas is hereby terminated. (JCB 164 Flag Vlll).\n\n32.\n\nOn July 12, 2010, the Additional Solicitor General of India rendered a memorandum of opinion to DOS through its Secretary, Dr. Radhakrishnan. (JCB 165). In the introductory portion of that memorandum, the author tracks the by-now familiar recitation of factual context:\n\nHowever, after the signing of the said agreement, it has been realized by the Government of India that the Antrix-Devas lease agreement on GSAT-6 and 6-A would take away most of the total S band spectrum available. The S band is crucial for several strategic and societal services. The Integrated Space Cell of IDS, Ministry of Defence have projected a need for 17.5 MHz in S band for meeting the immediate requirements of Armed Forces, another 40 MHz during the 12th plan period and an additional 50 MHz during the 13th plan period. Armed Forces have also projected the need to build S bank (sic) satellite capacity through GSAT-7S, for national security related mobile communications. There are further demands for S bank (sic) transponders from international security agencies viz. BSF, CISF, CRPF, Coast Guard and Police for meeting their secured communication needs. Indian Railways have also projected S band requirements for train tracking.\n\nIn view of these emerging requirements, there is an imminent need to preserve the S band spectrum for vital strategic and societal applications. Besides this, there were also certain concerns on the technical, commercial, managerial and financial aspects of Antrix-Devas contract (sic) such as severe penalty clauses for delayed delivery of the spacecraft and for performance failure/service interruptions, violation of ICC guideline of 'non-exclusiveness' in leasing the capacity, the contract enabling Devas to sub-lease the capacity without any approvals which could even given rise to security concerns etc.\n\n33.\n\nThe Additional Solicitor General wrote,\n\nOpinion has been sought from me as to whether Antrix-Devas contract can be annulled by invoking any of the provisions of the contract in order to (i) preserve precious S band spectrum for strategic requirements of the nation and (ii) to ensure a level playing field for other service providers using terrestrial spectrum.\n\nHe added,\n\nThe core issue which arises for consideration is as to whether there are justifiable or legal grounds existing for termination of Antrix-Devas contract.\n\nIn response to these questions and after adverting to Article 7 of the Devas Agreement, Mr. Parasaran says,\n\nThe modus of termination has been specified in the agreement in clause 7. But I am afraid that the conditions stipulated in this clause cannot be invoked at this stage for the purpose of terminating the contract. The only other relevant provision for seeking recourse to terminate the contract under the given factual scenario viz., national needs and change in government policies, would be Article 11 of the contract, relating to 'Force Majeure'.\n\nHe then carefully reviews the force majeure provisions of the Devas Agreement. Mr. Parasaran again recites the \"vastly different\" circumstances now compared with those in 2005 when the contract was entered into and states,\n\nThere can be no dispute whatsoever that the Government of India Is the owner of satellite spectrum space and any policy taken by the Government of India with regard to allocation and use of S bandwidth, including those which are subject matter of contractual obligations, would fall within the doctrine of force majeure, as envisaged in the very agreement between Antrix and Devas. (JCB 165).\n\n34.\n\nThe Additional Solicitor General, however, adds a note of caution to his opinion:\n\nIt is always advisable that in the present case, instead of the Department of Space taking a decision to terminate, It would be more prudent that a decision is taken by the Government of India, as a matter of policy, in exercise of its executive power or in other words, a policy decision having the seal and approval of the Cabinet and duly gazetted as per the Business Rules of the Government of India. That would give a greater legal sanctity to the decision to terminate the contract in as much as the contractual provisions expressly stipulate that for the force majeure event, to disable one of the parties to perform its obligations under the contract, the act must be an act by the governmental authority acting in its sovereign capacity. Several reasons exist to resort to this sovereign power for preserving national interest. In my view, instead of the Department of Space directing Antrix to terminate the contract, it will be advisable from a legal perspective that the direction comes from the Department of Space on the basis of a governmental policy decision, as indicated above. I have nothing further to add. (JCB 165).\n\n35.\n\nIn a letter dated July 2010, the Deputy Secretary of DOS wrote to the managing director of Antrix to say that after a response to the earlier request for information under the Right to Information Act, 2005, Smt. Madhumathi D.S., Special Correspondent, The Hindu Business Line, Bangalore had now appealed, on June 16, 2010, \"...seeking information that had not been given/or given incompletely...\" A copy of the appeal was attached and \"urgent action\" from Antrix was requested on or before July 23, 2010. Among the questions raised by the appellant journalist was a request for a copy of the Devas Agreement, as well as other inquiries about how much spectrum ISRO had allocated to Devas, how long the term of the contract was, and whether Devas had a licence to operate its commercial services. Clearly, this journalist's curiosity was not simply going to go away.\n\n36.\n\nOn July 28, 2010, Dr. Radhakrishnan received a further missive from one Dr. Ashok Chandra, identified as a Wireless Advisor at the DOT. (JCB 169). In this short memorandum, Dr. Chandra reported current information about the TRAI guidelines for allocation and pricing of spectrum, as well as some recent auctions of spectrum, resulting in the government receiving more than \"1 Lakh crores\" (lakh = 100,000 and crore = 10 million). DOT was letting DOS know that, in its view, \"...all future allocations are to be made through auction.\" Noted on the face of this memorandum, in handwriting similar to that of Additional Secretary, Balachandran, is a notation, \"May kindly see for info. If approved, this may be appropriately mentioned in the Cabinet Note to be put up.\"\n\n37.\n\nOn August 1, 2010, India Telecom published a short article under the heading, \"Law Ministry says ISRO's 60MHz spectrum-leasing deal with a private firm is illegal.\" (JCB 170). A brief report stated that,\n\nThe Indian Law Ministry has told the DoS (Department of Space) that it can repeal a deal wherein 60MHz spectrum was rented to a private firm approximately five years ago. The DoS had sought the government's legal division\u2019s opinion...The Law Ministry said that the contract is not legal, adding that the government must get back the airwaves. Following the spectrum allotment, the firm\u2014owned by an ex-ISRO executive\u2014sold its holding to overseas investors such as Deutsche Telekom.\n\n38.\n\nOn August 10, 2010, the Financial Times published a similar article under the heading,\n\nISRO IN MESS OVER 'ILLEGAL' SPECTRUM SALE TO DEVAS (MINISTRY OF LAW DESCRIBES THE CONTRACT AS ILLEGAL, SAYS GOVERNMENT OF INDIA SHOULD TAKE BACK THE SPECTRUM IN NATIONAL INTEREST).\n\nAlthough there were some apparent inaccuracies in this reporting, it was evident that considerable adverse attention was being directed to the Devas Agreement.\n\n39.\n\nIn the meantime, Devas was endeavoring, unsuccessfully, to meet with Dr. Radhakrishnan to determine what would be the expected date for vehicle launch. (JCB 174 - Correspondence from Devas to Dr. Radhakrishnan, August 20, 2010). On August 25, 2010, Dr. Radhakrishnan's private secretary replied that he was \"pre-occupied\" and suggested that Devas meet with the managing director of Antrix. (JCB 175).\n\n40.\n\nBy correspondence dated September 2, 2010, from Devas to Shri T.K. Alex, the director of ISRO and a member of the Space Commission, Devas among other things, dealt with these recent press reports (JCB 177). It stated:\n\nIn the recent past we have seen several press reports that make incorrect speculations in respect of the Agreement including concerns on preferential treatment, back door entry, and improper approvals among others. These reports are grossly inaccurate and baseless. We are deeply disappointed by these ill-informed and misleading press reports, which don't acknowledge the history and facts of the matter.\n\nIn addition, it has been reported that the Government was reviewing the Devas-Antrix/ISRO/DOS agreement and allegedly considering its annulment. We are surprised by the same, given that the Agreement has all necessary approvals and long standing collaboration with the Government in the project. We have written to Antrix and DOS/TSRO (sic), to discuss and address this and other concerns.\n\n41.\n\nIn a further letter dated October 29, 2010, from Devas to Shri T.K. Alex, and copied to the Chairman (Dr. Radhakrishnan) and other members of the Space Commission, Devas outlined a number of recent events and features of its programme. In particular, Devas offered a fairly detailed set of \"Clarifications\" which were obviously directed toward rebutting the recent press reports concerning the background to Devas itself, how it had obtained the contract with Antrix, its technical features, the various governmental approvals that had been sought and secured for the programme, the partnership with Deutsche Telekom and other issues surrounding S-band spectrum (JCB 184).\n\n42.\n\nOther contacts with Indian governmental officials were pursued by Devas between October, 2010 and the end of January, 2011, including meeting with Mr. Prithviraj Chavan, the Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office and a member of the Space Commission (Witness Statement of Ramachandran Viswanathan dated June 29, 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 183-184), Dr. Ashok Chandra, the Wireless Adviser with DOT (JCB JCB 185), Dr. Kasturirangan, former Secretary of DOS, head of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) Programme Review, V.V. Bhat, Secretary and Member Finance, DOS and Member of the Space Commission, and Dr. P.S. Goel, Member of the Space Commission. (Viswanathan, *id,* \u00b6\u00b6 185-188). There were, in addition, contacts with the new executive director of Antrix, but there was no response from Dr. Radhakrishnan. (Viswanathan, *id,* \u00b6\u00b6 188-189).\n\n43.\n\nIt will be recalled that upon receiving the Suresh Committee Report on June 7, 2010, Dr. Radhakrishnan had directed Additional Secretary Balachandran to report, with assistance from several others, on the Suresh Committee Report. Additional Secretary Balachandran submitted his report on January 9, 2011 (JCB 194). The Additional Secretary noted in his Introduction that \"immediately after\" receiving instructions to make this report, he had also been asked to initiate a note to the Space Commission and,\n\nthereafter, the draft Note to Cabinet Committee on Security regarding the same on the basis of the decision taken by the space Commission in its 117th meeting held on July 02, 2010.\n\nHe continued:\n\n1.3 The draft Cabinet Note was submitted to Secretary on Aug.26. Thereafter, drafts modified as Instructed by Secretary were submitted on Sept.25, Oct.2 and finally on [Oct.09]. The secretariat is awaiting clearance of the draft note by Secretary so that follow-up action on same viz. sending the draft Note for comments of departments of Law, Telecommunications, Finance (Expenditure). Defence may be initiated.\n\n44.\n\nAdditional Secretary Balachandran's report appears to be fairly critical of the Suresh Committee Report, noting numerous times that certain points \"...could have been examined in greater detail\" along with several other alleged deficiencies (JCB 194, \u00a7 3.1, \u00a7 3.2 and \u00a7 5). He further outlined a number of what he characterized as acts of commission and omission, referring extensively to a failure to observe financial due diligence in relation to the signing of the contract with Devas, serious deficiencies in procedural aspects, a lack of minutes or other forms of proof of compliance by officials in ISRO/DOS with required procedures, a deficient legal opinion, a failure to intercept the financial penalty clauses and other serious lapses. He recommended that a vigilance committee undertake a full review of all relevant papers to determine who had authored any incorrect statements, particularly in relation to draft Notes for Cabinet. The report concludes with a recommendation that termination of the ANTRIX-DEVAS contract \"as ordered by Space Commission in its 117th meeting need be expedited...\"\n\n45.\n\nDevas sent another letter to Dr. Radhakrishnan on January 24, 2011, reciting recent ' developments and seeking an appointment. (JCB 197). This letter was not answered. (Viswanathan, *id,* \u00b6 188). Devas sent one last letter to the Space Commission on February 4, 2011, seeking to procure a launch of the long-delayed GSAT-6. (Viswanathan, *id,* \u00b6 189 and JCB 204).\n\n46.\n\nIn the meantime, as background to all these events, the government of India was dealing with a growing scandal in relation to serious allegations concerning the conduct of the Minister of Telecommunications, A. Raja. These allegations arose from the granting of 2G Spectrum licenses in September 2008, without the benefit of any auction. Thereafter, the issuing of these Spectrum licenses became the subject of a probe by the Central Vigilence Committee in November 2008. By October 2009, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case to investigate which was followed by searches of the Department of Telecommunications and, finally, in November 2010, the resignation of Minister Raja. There was a parliamentary uproar over these events. In December, the former minister, Raja, was questioned by the CBI and again in January, 2011. On February 2, 2011, Mr. Raja along with the former Telecommunications Secretary, Siddartha Behura, as well as Mr. Raja's former personal secretary, R.K. Chandolia, were arrested by the CBI in connection with what had become known as the 2G Spectrum case. (JCB 200, JCB 201, JCB 202, JCB 201 and JCB 203).\n\n47.\n\nFour days later, on February 8, 2011, Dr. Radhakrishnan spoke at a press conference. A verbatim transcript of his remarks was taken from the CNN report (JCB 206). Although his comments are lengthy, given their pertinence to the issues in this arbitration proceeding, I propose to quote them relatively fully. Dr. Radhakrishnan made the following opening statement:\n\n**Dr. Radhakrishnan:** Thank you very much and good evening to all friends from the media. We have with us Dr. Kasturirangan, Member Science, Planning Commission and former Chairman ISRO, Secretary, DOS. We consider it appropriate and timely to convey to you certain facts about the Antrix-Devas contract that is currently under discussion. You would recall that yesterday the Department of Space had put out a press note which essentially sets and clarifies that the agreement entered into by Antrix, the commercial arm of ISRO and Messrs Devas on January 20, 2005 is already under review by the Department of Space and the government will take whatever steps are necessary to safeguard public interest and a decision on the matter is likely to be taken soon.\n\nThis morning, you would have also seen a statement issued by the spokesperson of the Prime Minister's Office. It also clarifies that no decision has been taken by the government to allocate space segment using S-band spectrum to Antrix or Devas. Hence, the question of revenue loss does not arise and any such reports are without basis in the facts.\n\nNow, let me spend a few minutes to just briefly describe the contract and the kind of review that the Department of Space instituted since December 2009. What was the decision of the Space Commission in July 2010 and subsequently what we have been doing to get the necessary formalities, consultations with the concerned agencies?\n\nBasically, the contract between Antrix and Devas Multimedia is for a new and novel service called digital broadcast audio service using the S-band spectrum. In India, we have been using the S-band spectrum for the INSAT satellites from the early 80s and at some point of time for those broadcasting services, we migrated from S-band to KU band.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe second part of it is the S-band spectrum has several advantages and there was an emerging strategic requirement for the S-band spectrum in the country, which became very evident in 2009 and there was specific requirements for the country's national agencies. So, in the year 2009 itself, specifically on December 8, 2009, the Department of Space decided to have a comprehensive review on the Antrix-Devas contract and also on how to meet the emerging strategic requirements of the country taking note of the fact that ISRO had been allocated a bandwidth 150 MHz in the S-band from three orbital locations.\n\nThis review process was then carried out and we took up the matter to the Space Commission, which in July 2010 made a few decisions. One of the decisions was there is a high priority for the country's strategic requirements and the societal applications which have to be met using the S-band spectrum that is in the possession of ISRO and we also decided to take actions to annul the contract that we had entered, that Antrix had entered with Messrs Devas Multimedia and also to ensure that the GSAT and GSAT 6A satellites are made and then used to meet the strategic requirements. This was a proactive action taken by the Department of Space as part of our internal review process and the action started in December 2009.\n\nSubsequent to the decisions taken by the Space Commission, of which the Secretary Space is the Chairman and we have very senior members in the commission, we started necessary actions for terminating the contract which required extensive consultations with the concerned agencies in the government. Department of Telecommunications, Department of Law and Justice, all included. The idea is to ensure that a contract that has been entered into has to be now terminated without causing much of embarrassment and damage and financial loss to the government. We had to go through that process and we have been going through that process and soon we expect to complete that process. So, I thought I should bring out this part of it.\n\n48.\n\nFollowing this opening statement, Dr. Kasturirangan made a short statement and the two gentlemen then responded to questions from the journalists present at this press conference. I will reproduce only a few of Dr. Radhakrishnan's answers to questions from the press:\n\nDr. Radhakrishnan: No, in December 2009, specifically on 8th December 2009, I instituted a committee with a former member of the Space Commission to have a comprehensive review of all aspects of it.\n\nBhupendra Chaubey: And what was the conclusion of that committee?\n\nDr. Radhakrishnan: Conclusion was the reason for taking up the subject\u2019 to the Space Commission.\n\nBhupendra Chaubey: And was this conclusion conveyed to the Prime Minister. The point that I am getting at is just this. Was the Prime Minister aware of what was really happening with this contract sir?\n\nDr. Radhakrishnan: See, the contract is finalized by the Antrix Board and that stops here. I took up the matter to the Space Commission and subsequently I required decisions from the government for which I have approached the Prime Minister who is our Minister recently after the consultative process that I had to go through within the government and that is how the Prime Minister's Office, they have conveyed today that this process is on.\n\nIn response to another question, Dr. Radhakrishnan said:\n\nBut, when you have to terminate a contract, it is very complex and that is the process that we are going through. What are the provisions available in the contract for such a termination, what are the reasons that have to put there, what are the kind of implications of such a termination, all this have to be understood and there are two parties involved and we have to ensure that the government finally does not incur damages in this.\n\nSo, this is the process that we have taken up subsequent to. So, when you talk about this a few months, seven months, it is not dilly-dallying, it is application of our minds, applications of the concerned institutions, agencies in the government. This is the first part of it.\n\nLater, Dr. Radhakrishnan said,\n\nAs on date as of now, the contract is not terminated, the process for termination is on. The decision to terminate by the Space Commission was taken in July 2010 and we are going through the process of consultations required for this process.\n\nIn part of another answer to a press question,\n\nDr. Radhakrishnan: In any contract, there will be penalty clauses from both sides. And there are damages, there are prohibitions for termination of an agreement from both sides actually. Hence there are force majeure clauses. These are part of any clauses and once you sign a contract you ensure all these things are in place and when you decide to terminate also you have to ensure that you use the right application of mind about this clause.\n\nPallava Bagla: But force majeure....\n\nDr. Kasturirangan: No, I don't think there is finality of how we want to do this. This is under study. What is the best option....\n\nFurther on, Dr. Radhakrishnan said:\n\nThe 2010 review by the Space Commission and the internal review process that went through between December 2009 and July 2010 indicated as you put it, that there is a large national requirement for strategic applications and societal services and we need to give obviously priority for such services.\n\n49.\n\nAs its lead into the press conference by Dr. Radhakrishnan, the report by CNN stated:\n\nThe top story we are tracking this hour. The government latest spectrum controversy. The Prime Minister's Office has dismissed reports that it incurred losses in the allocation of S-band spectrum by the ISRO to a private firm. But in an internal audit report of the Department of Space exclusively assessed by CNN-IBN contradicts that claim. The PMO says there has been no decision that was taken to allocate S-band spectrum to Devas Multimedia and since there was no allocation, therefore there is no question of a revenue loss to the government as well. (JCB 206).\n\n50.\n\nA Times of India article on February 8, 2011 (JCB 207), stated:\n\nAnother spectrum scam has hit the UPA government which is already reeling from the fallout of allegations of corruption in the underpricing of 2G airwaves sold to telecom operators. On Monday, the government scrambled to cancel what appeared to be an improper deal where a private company would have got 70 MHz of spectrum for just 1,000 crore.\n\nLater in the report, the author claimed, \"With the deal under attack, ISRO indicated it could be revoked shortly.\" In a statement, the department of space said,\n\nThe agreement entered into by Antrix with Devas is already under review by the department of space and the government will take whatever steps are necessary to safeguard public interest. A decision on the matter is likely to be taken soon.\n\n51.\n\nOn February 10, 2011, Dr. Radhakrishnan, in his capacity as Secretary, DOS, signed an Order constituting a High Powered Review Committee. (JCB 211) Copies of the Order were sent to Members of the Space Commission and to the PMO. The Committee Members were Shri B.K. Chaturvedi, Member, Planning Commission and former Cabinet. Secretary, and Professor Roddam Narasimha, Member, Space Commission. Their mandate was to review the technical, commercial, procedural and financial aspects of the Devas Agreement, \"taking into account the report of internal review conducted by the Department of Space.\" More particularly, the Committee was to suggest corrective measures and to fix responsibility for lapses, if any. The Order also directed that the High Powered Committee would be \"serviced by\" DOS and \"shall submit its recommendations to the Prime Minister, as Minister-in-charge, within one month.\" (JCB 211, \u00a74).\n\n52.\n\nAlso on February 10, 2011, Devas wrote to the Prime Minister to express \"deep concern and anguish over the recent press reports\" about the Devas Agreement and to rebut any suggestion of impropriety. (JCB 210). Among the points raised in this letter, Devas stated that until Dr. Radhakrishnan's remarks at the press conference on February 8, 2011, it had not been informed that the Devas Agreement was under review.\n\nOn the contrary Devas was repeatedly assured that the delays in delivery of the satellite capacity were only on account of technical issues. (JCB 210, page 4 of 5).\n\nThe next day, Devas had its legal advocates contact Dr. Radhakrishnan (JCB 212). After reciting a litany of prior events, the letter demanded payment of US$5 million (in INR terms) for delayed Delivery under the Devas Agreement. Devas also wrote directly to Dr. Radhakrishnan that same day, February 11, 2011 to give notice that his reported remarks during his press conference breached their agreement. Other allegations of being misled and falsely induced to forebear were also expressed.\n\n53.\n\nOn February 11, 2011, The Hindu published a relatively full account of the legal opinion of the Additional Solicitor-General on \"the Antrix-Devas deal.\" (JCB 213). The news report contained several full paragraph quotations from the opinion that had originally been provided to Dr. Radhakrishnan on July 12, 2010 (JCB 165). In introducing the quoted part of the opinion, The Hindu stated:\n\nThe core of the legal advice is to invoke force majeure to terminate the agreement, with the direction coming from the Department of Space on the basis of a decision 'taken by the Government of India, as a matter of policy, in exercise of its executive power or in other words, a policy decision having the seal and approval of the Cabinet and duly gazetted as per the Business Rules of the government of India\u2019.\n\n54.\n\nA further demand letter was sent by Devas on February 14, 2011 to Dr. Radhakrishnan, in his capacity as Chairman of Antrix. (JCB 216). The letter, copied to Members of the Space Commission, required a written assurance, within one week that Antrix would observe and perform the Devas Agreement.\n\n55.\n\nOn February 16, 2011, The Hindu published an account of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's interaction in New Delhi with Editors of the Electronic Media. (JCB 218). This publication appears in the form of a transcript, including the Prime Minister's opening remarks as well as his responses to questions put to him by journalists. Most of the subject matter seems to be related to the recent arrest of the former Minister of Telecommunications, Mr. A. Raja, as well as a couple of his officials and the 2G spectrum case. In one of the questions, he was asked about the Devas deal, delayed action and possible backroom talks in the PMO. The Prime Minister's answer was quite lengthy. I will quote most, but not all of it, as follows:\n\nThere have been no backroom talks. I think I have not met anybody myself and the decision of the Space Commission to annul the deal was taken on 2nd July 2010. Space Commission took a number of decision of which annulment of the contract was one of them. The Dept of Space was asked to take action on all the five decision points that emerged from the Space Commission meeting. The issue of how to annul the contract required consideration by legal experts and the Law Ministry was consulted. A decision had to be taken on whether to annul the contract using article 7(c) or Article 11 or both read together. Eventually it has been decided that the Government should take a sovereign policy decision regarding the utilization of Space Band capacity which uses S Band spectrum having regard to the country's strategic requirements.\n\nI would like to mention that although the Space commission took a decision to annul the contract in July 2010, the actual Cabinet note was received from the Dept of Space in the PMO only in November 2010. And then there was a number of consultations to polish it up. At the most you can say that between November and now the Prime Minister's Office has got this note ready for the Cabinet. Decision has been taken now but it requires consultations. (Intervention) - After the receipt of the note, for the Cabinet from the Dept of Space for preparation of the Cabinet note a number of ministries were consulted and the Dept of Space itself took six revisions of the note before finally submitting it for approval.\n\nIt is certainly true that a number of letters were received by members of Space Commission including officials in the PMO from Devas after August 2010 including as late as a few days ago. Letters were also received in the PMO from the US Chamber of Commerce but no action was taken on any of these letters which were merely filed. At no stage was Dept of Space asked by the PMO to comment on the points made in the letters. They have no impact whatsoever on the processing of the case. On the contrary, the PMO followed up its verbal reminders to Dept of Space by sending a letter to the Dept of Space in October 2010 seeking a status of follow up of the decision taken by the Space Commission in its July 2010 meeting.\n\nAfter describing a meeting with the German Minister of Foreign Affairs and certain meetings between Devas and the Department of Space, ISRO and Antrix, the Prime Minister continued:\n\nThe fact is the contract was not operational in any practical sense and there was no question of diluting in any way the recommendations of the Space Commission. All the consultations are now almost complete. The Ministries concerned have all had the opportunity to express their views as is required before having policy decisions taken by the Government at the level of the Cabinet, and also because this Issue concerns many other Ministries apart from the Dept. of Space. These Include Dept of Telecommunication, Defence, Home, Finance, and Law. The matter Is expected to be put before the Cabinet Committee on Security for Its final decision. That's the state of the affairs. There have been no effort in the Prime Minister's office to dilute, In any way the decision taken by the Space Commission in July 2010. On that I would like to assure you and through you I would like to assure the country.\n\n56.\n\nOn February 16, 2011, the same day as the Prime Minister's interaction with the editors of the electronic media, the \"NOTE FOR THE CABINET COMMITTEE ON SECURITY\" was delivered. (JCB 219). The subject line referred to\n\nAnnulling the Agreement for the LEASE OF SPACE SEGMENT CAPACITY ON ISRO/ANTRIX S-Band SPACECRAFT BY DEVAS MULTIMEDIA PVT Ltd.\n\nThe purpose of the Note was expressed in this way:\n\nThe purpose of this note is to seek approval of Cabinet Committee on Security for Annulling the \"AGREEMENT FOR THE LEASE OF SPACE SEGMENT CAPACITY ON ISRO/ANTRIX S-Band SPACECRAFT BY DEVAS MULTIMEDIA PVT Ltd\"...In view of priority to be given to nation's strategic requirements including societal ones.\n\n57.\n\nWhat follows this introduction is a 24 page document with some 13 Annexes. Under the heading, \"S-BAND SPECTRUM FOR STRATEGIC AND SOCIETAL SERVICES\", the Note sets out a description, as follows:\n\n19) The GSAT-7 Satellite being built by ISRO for Indian Navy with launch targeted in mid-2011 has S-band transponders for MSS applications with 15 MHz band width each for up-linking and downlinking. Further, Armed Forces and ISRO are finalising configuration of a S-band multibeam Satellite GSAT-7S, for national security related mobile communications..\n\n20) The integrated Space cell of Integrated Defence Staff, Ministry of Defence have projected, In December 2009, need for a bandwidth of 17.5 MHz in S-band for meeting the immediate requirements of Armed Forces; another 40 MHz during the 12th plan period; and an additional 50 MHz during the 13th plan period.\n\n21) There are further demands for S-band transponders from Internal security agencies viz. Border Security Force, Central Industrial Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Coast Guard and Police for meeting their secured communication needs.\n\n22) Indian Railways have also projected S band requirements for train-tracking. In view of these emerging requirements, there Is an Imminent need to preserve the S band spectrum for vital strategic and societal applications.\n\n58.\n\nThe Note sets forth in considerable detail the whole history of events beginning with the constitution of the Suresh Committee in December 2009, the consultation with the Department of Law and Justice in June, 2010, the Note for the Space Commission and the substance of the 117th Meeting of the Space Commission on July 2, 2010. The decision of the Space Commission in relation to annulling the Antrix-Devas Agreement is set out verbatim. The Note then reviewed the opinion of the Additional Solicitor-General, the recent constitution of the High Powered Committee and turned, finally, to what are called, \"INTER-MINISTERIAL CONSULTATIONS\". These notes reflect the views of various ministries on the draft note to the CCS which had previously been circulated. Two of these ministerial notes are especially relevant to the issues in this arbitration. One is from the Ministry of Defence and the other is from the Ministry of Telecommunications. I propose to review each of them.\n\n59.\n\nThe response of the Ministry of Defence is recorded in paragraph 44.2 of the Note, followed by \"Comments of DOS\". I reproduce those here:\n\n44.2) **Ministry of Defence:** The Ministry has not raised any objection to the proposals contained in the draft Note.\n\nThe Ministry has indicated that there is a requirement of S Band capacity for strategic uses which is already addressed in this Note. It has also been stated that the Defence Services have extensive existing as well as planned usages in the S-Band. The barest minimum requirement of Services is projected as 120 MHz. Further, they have also suggested that any planned release of S Band capacity may be done in consultation with Ministry of Defence/Services. A copy of the communication received from the Ministry is placed at **Annexure-8 (Page 128).**\n\n**Comments of DOS:** The comments/suggestions in respect of allocation of S Band capacity are noted and would be placed before the INSAT CoOrdination Committee and the Technical Advisory Group, which are empowered to take decisions in the matter.\n\n60.\n\nThe response of the Ministry of Telecommunications is recorded in paragraph 44.3 of the Note, followed by \"Comments of DOS\". I reproduce those here:\n\n44.3) **Ministry of Telecommunications:** The Ministry has not raised any objection to the proposals contained in the draft Note.\n\nHowever, they have made a number of suggestions in respect of the usage of the S Band and recommended that the present and future strategic requirements for national security related mobile communications and societal applications may be discussed in the meetings of the INSAT Co-ordination Committee (ICC) where representatives of Department of Space, Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ministry of Finance, Department of Science and Technology and even Ministry of Defence could be invited to attend. A copy of the communication received from the Ministry is placed at **Annexure-9 (Page 129-131).**\n\n**Comments of DOS:** The comments/suggestions in respect of allocation of S Band capacity are noted and would be placed before the INSAT Coordination Committee and the Technical Advisory Group, which are empowered to take decisions in the matter.\n\n61.\n\nAnnexure 9 to the Note contains a letter to Dr. Radhakrishnan dated February 11, 2011, signed by R. Chandrasekhar, Secretary DOT, as well as comments from DOT on the draft note for the CCS. From the letter, it appears that the draft Note for the CCS was sent only on February 9, 2011. DOT responded:\n\nThe Draft Cabinet Note has been examined and DoT is of the view that utilization of S-band shall be considered by ICC and Technical Advisory Group (TAG) as per the provisions of Radio Regulations of ITU and National Frequency Allocation Plan (NFAP).\n\nFurther detailed views were attached to this letter in the form of an Annex. I reproduce two of those views from DOT:\n\nPara. 18. (This paragraph In the Note sets out a detailed description of the S-Band spectrum held by ISRO) DOT says:\n\nIt is true that 80 MHz in the frequency band 2555-2635 MHz for BSS and 70 MHz in the frequency bands 2500-2535/2655-2690 MHz for MSS have been coordinated with ITU. However, WPC Wing does not have any information on strategic requirements of Defence Services, Indian Railways and Safety services as stated in the para. Therefore, the usage of this band (150 MHz) needs to be discussed and decided in INSAT Coordination Committee (ICC).\n\nIt should be noted that the WPC Wing is the body that is in charge of frequency management in India. (Anand Tr. 1013).\n\nPara. 19-22 (These paragraphs in the Note set out supposed. requirements for S band, including defence and other societal ones). DOT says:\n\nThe present and future strategic requirement for national security related mobile communications, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Police and Societal applications are required to be discussed in ICC meetings where representatives from DOS, Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of I & B, Ministry of Finance, Department of Science & Technology. In this case Ministry of Defence could also be invited to participate in the meeting.\n\n62.\n\nAt the end of the Note for the CCS, Dr. Radhakrishnan set out the \"APPROVAL SOUGHT FROM THE CABINET COMMITTEE ON SECURITY\" in the following terms:\n\n45.1) Taking note of the fact that government policies with regard to allocation of spectrum have undergone a change in the last few years and there has been a increased demand for the allocation of spectrum for national needs, including for the needs of defence, para-military forces, railways and other public utility services as well as for societal needs, and having regard to the needs of the country's strategic requirements, the Government will not be able to provided orbit slot in S band to Antrix for commercial activities including for those which are the subject matter of existing contractual obligations for S Band.\n\n45.2) In the light of this policy not providing orbit slot in S Band to Antric for commercial activities, the \"Agreement for the lease of space segment capacity on ISRO/Antrix S-Band spacecraft by Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd.\" entered into between Antrix Corporation and Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd. on 28th January, 2005 shall be annulled forthwith.\n\n46) Further, Department of Space may take action to implement the decisions of the Space Commission referred to in paragraph 42 of the Note.\n\n63.\n\nAs noted at the beginning of my dissent, the CCS did decide to annul the Devas Agreement in exactly the terms proposed in the Note to the CCS. On February 17, 2011, the Press Information Bureau for the Government of India issued a release, (JCB 220), as follows:\n\n**CCS Decides to Annul Antrix-Devas Deal**\n\nCabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has decided to annul the Antrix-Devas deal. Following is the statement made by the Law Minister, Shri M. Veerappa Moily on the decision taken by the CCS which met in New Delhi today:\n\nTaking note of the fact that Government policies with regard to allocation of spectrum have undergone a change in the last few years and there has been an increased demand for allocation of spectrum for national needs, including for the needs of defence, para-military forces, railways and other public utility services as well as for societal needs, and having regard to the needs of the country's strategic requirements, the Government will not be able to provide orbit slot In S band to Antrix for commercial activities, including for those which are the subject matter of existing contractual obligations for S band.\n\nIn light of this policy of not providing orbit slot in S Band to Antrix for commercial activities, the \"Agreement for the lease of space segment capacity on ISRO/Antrix S-Band spacecraft by Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd.\" entered into between Antrix Corporation and Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd. on 28th January, 2005 shall be annulled forthwith.\n\n64.\n\nOn February 23, 2011, the Deputy Secretary of DOS wrote to the Executive Director of Antrix, (JCB 221) as follows:\n\nI am directed to convey that, on account of increased demand for allocation of spectrum for national needs, such as Defence, para-military forces, Railways and the country's strategic requirements, the Government will be unable to provide orbit slot in S-Band to Antrix for commercial activities including those which are the subject matter of existing agreements. Consequently, Antrix would be unable to lease any transponders in the S-Band.\n\nIn the light of the above, the \"Agreement for the lease of space segment capacity on ISRO/Antrix S-Band spacecraft by Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd.\" executed by Antrix Corporation and Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd. on 28th January, 2005 shall be annulled forthwith.\n\nYou are hereby directed to take necessary actions immediately and report compliance.\n\n65.\n\nAccordingly, on February 25, 2011, the Executive Director of Antrix duly wrote to Devas (JCB 223) to say:\n\nThe Central Government has communicated that it has taken a policy decision not to provide orbital slot in S-Band to our Company for commercial activities including those which are the subject matter of the existing agreements.\n\nIn accordance with Article 7(c) of the Agreement, it is declared that Antrix is unable to obtain the necessary frequency and orbital slot coordination as stipulated in the Agreement.\n\nWithout prejudice to the inability expressed under Article 7(c), notice of force majeure as defined in Article 11, is expressed. The policy decision of the Central Government acting in its sovereign capacity is the event of force majeure which has occurred on 23rd February 23, 2011. The force majeure commenced on 23rd February 2011. The scope and duration of the said decision cannot be anticipated. It is likely to be indefinite. It is not possible for Antrix to take any effective step to resume the obligations under the Agreement. The event of force majeure is beyond the reasonable control of Antrix and is clearly covered by Article 11(b) of the Agreement and, in particular, 11(b)(v) \"...act of governmental authority in its sovereign capacity...\". Any possibility of resumption of obligations by Antrix under the Agreement stands excluded. The subject Agreement,...therefore, is terminated with immediate effect.\n\n66.\n\nFollowing the decision of the CCS, on February 17, 2011, there were a number of further letters between Devas and Antrix which do not seem particularly pertinent to our issues. There were also a number of other events, however, which did reflect what had and what had not been decided by the CCS.\n\n67.\n\nIn March 2011, the GEOSAT Programme Management Office had prepared an agenda item described as \"GSAT-6 Potential Usage\". (JCB 225). From that material, it is evident that GSAT-6 could be considered for any number of possible uses, including \"Army/Navy/Air force/BSF/Police\" as well as Coast Guards and Railways.\n\n68.\n\nOn April 12, 2011, K.M Chandrasekhar, Cabinet Secretary as well as Member of the Space Commission, rendered a written report to the Prime Minister. (JCB 229). Secretary Chandrasekhar had been asked to review the report of the High Powered Review Committee composed of B.K. Chaturvedi, a former Cabinet Secretary, and Professor Roddam Narasimha, a member of the Space Commission, which had reported on March 12, 2011 (JCB 227). Mr. Chandrasekhar noted that the \"ICC met 78 times between 1978-2004; it has not met since.\" (JCB 229, \u00a73). Having regard for the various criticisms directed to the process by which the Devas Agreement had been approved and entered into, Mr. Chandrasekhar said,\n\n[t]he responsibility for approving an agreement with major financial and commercial weaknesses lies with Secretary, DOS and Member (Finance), Space Commission, who have the responsibility to oversee financial matters. (JCB 229, \u00a7 11 iv).\n\nHe noted the High Powered Review Committee's recommendation that,\n\nSince the launch of GSAT 6/6A is likely to be delayed, the orbital slot earmarked for these satellites, which expires in May 2011, should be renewed so that it is not lost forever.\n\nAnd further noted their recommendation that,\n\nAn expert group should be set up (either under Chairman, TRAI or Secretary, DoS) to develop strategies for long term efficient use of orbit-spectrum resources, including for mobile multimedia services. (JCB 229, \u00a712).,\n\n69.\n\nAmong his conclusions, Mr. Chandrasekhar noted several concerns, including that the agreement\n\nwas used by Devas (which had no other assets or IPR) to sell its shares at huge premium and collect a sum of 578 crore as premia as against a modest share capital of 18 lakhs.\n\nHe continued,\n\nOn the other hand, since the agreement has now had to be cancelled on account of reasons related to non-transparence and one-sided skew in risk sharing arrangements, ISRO/DOS are left with a satellite (on which a sum of nearly 250 crore has been invested till date) which has no immediate commercial application. Moreover, there is also the impending danger of a lawsuit by Devas and its promoters, where damages up to US $ 10 million can be claimed for non-delivery of the satellite. (JCB 229, \u00a7 36 vii and viii).\n\n70.\n\nMr. Chandrasekhar proposed that the Cabinet Secretariat would issue a notification reconstituting the ICC, composed of various Departments, to be represented at the level of Secretaries. These would include DOS, Department of Expenditure and Economic Affairs, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, DOT, Planning Commission, MOD, and, Department of Science and Technology. Chairman of TRAI could be asked to nominate a suitable representative of requisite seniority on the ICC. And finally, concerned Additional Secretaries/Joint Secretaries in the Prime Minister's Office and Cabinet Secretary could also be included. (JCB 229, \u00a7 45). He recommended that,\n\nThe re-constituted ICC may be asked to urgently consider the various uses of the \"S\" band currently available with the DoS and recommend strategies for suitable utilization thereof. (JCB 229, \u00a7 46).\n\nSecretary Chandrasekhar's report concluded:\n\nThe aforesaid recommendations are being submitted for the kind consideration and further directions of the Prime Minister.\n\nThe Prime Minister's mark is noted following the signature of the author, indicating that he had received this report.\n\n71.\n\nDuring his cross-examination, Joint Secretary, DOS, A. Vijay Anand confirmed that the Prime Minister must have received this document. (Tr. Anand 1057-1058). He further confirmed that the ICC was in fact reconstituted and, at the date of the hearing in September 2014, continued to debate the use of the S-band. (Tr. Anand 1059). In his re-examination, Mr. Anand was briefly shown a Report of INSAT Coordination Committee (ICC) Sub-Committee on S-band Utilization Plan (JCB 269). This report confirms:\n\n1. Introduction\n\nICC-72 during Its meeting held on July 27, 2012 constituted the ICC SubCommittee to prepare S-band Utilization Plan (2500 MHz - 2690 MHz) with the members from Department of Space (DOS), Department of Telecommunications (DOT), Ministry of Defense (MOD) and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).\n\nThe committee had three meetings (Nov 16, 2012, Jan 18, 2013 and March 08, 2013) to discuss and finalise the task assigned. Members participating in the meetings are attached in Annexure - 1.\n\n2. Deliberations\n\nMembers of the committee deliberated current and future usage of S-band (2500 MHz - 2690 MHz) in the country. After the first meeting, attempts were made to prepare a draft report. However consensus could not be reached and members provided separate inputs to the Subcommittee.\n\n(a) DOS/ISRO (enclosed In Annexure - 2)\n\n(b) WPC/DOT (enclosed in Annexure - 3)\n\n(c) MOD (enclosed in Annexure - 4)\n\n(d) TRAI (enclosed in Annexure -5)\n\nWhile DOS and MOD Is in favor of using 80 MHz of S-BSS and 70 MHZ of S-BSS for satellite based services, WPC/DOT and TRAI is not in agreement with the approach. The committee could not converge on the final recommendation with regard to the utilization plan and use of S-band by terrestrial and satellite services.\n\n3. Conclusions\n\nOpinion of each Department/Ministry is attached as an Annexure and is submitted for the consideration of ICC for further directives.\n\n72.\n\nMr. Anand was also shown a copy of a Note to the Space Commission prepared on March 28, 2014 in contemplation of a meeting of that body on April 12, 2014. (JCB 287). The purpose of that note was to seek the approval of the Space Commission for revised costs estimates for GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A and revised utilization plans for GSAT6/6A for \"strategic/societal applications\". In \u00b6 4.1, the author states:\n\nSpace Commission had deliberated on the requirement of S-band satellite based services for strategic and societal purposes including Defense, Para military Forces and Indian Railways during its 117th meeting held on 2nd July 2010. (para 117.6.3 in Appendix-A) and accordingly directed the Department to evolve a Revised utilization Plan for GSAT-6 and 6A satellites. (JCB 287).\n\n73.\n\nOn May 16, 2014, in his capacity as Secretary to the Commission, Mr. Anand wrote to the members of the Space Commission with the minutes of the 128th Meeting held on April 12, 2014. (JCB 288). In his introductory remarks to that meeting, the Chairman, Dr. Radhakrishnan, reported that,\n\n...there is an issue of spectrum (BSS) for GSAT-6/6A. DoT wants ISRO to vacate the spectrum and auction it. The subject matter was discussed in EGoM (Empowered Group of Ministers) and ISRO was asked to provide S-BSS usage to DoT. S-BSS utilization plan Is being addressed by a ICC Sub-Committee.\n\nLater comments reported in those minutes reflect that DOS would be proposing a different revised plan, utilising\n\n...the space segment capacity of GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A to meet the communication needs (Broadcast and Mobile Applications) of strategic sector Including Defense, Paramilitary forces and societal sector Including Disaster Management Support and Indian Railways. (JCB 288, \u00b6 128.6.1).\n\n74.\n\nIn his Supplemental Direct Testimony, dated June 30, 2014, Mr. K. Sethuraman, Associate Director, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), described the differences between DOS and DOT with respect to the potential use of the S-band capacity that was now available after nullification of the Devas Agreement. After referring to the impasse between those two ministries, in particular, he stated, in part,\n\nSince ultimate decisions In India are reached by consensus where possible, and since the concerned agencies In this case have been unable to reach a consensus, the resolution of the question of whether the S-band will be used for satellite services or terrestrial services will be finally decided in due course by action at a higher level within Government. (Sethuraman, 2nd, \u00b6 11).\n\n75.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal was made aware of other on-going developments in relation to the debate within India as to how the S-Band capacity formerly committed to the Devas Agreement might be assigned and used, I do not consider those developments to be relevant in any way to the determination of what was decided by the CCS on February 16, 2011. The events I have described that followed that date are relevant, in my opinion, only to the extent that they cast light upon what was and what was not decided by the CCS on that occasion. The ultimate outcome of that debate, particularly the ongoing disagreement between DOS and DOT, does not afford us any additional insight into the nature of the CCS decision. At best, such information would tell us who putatively won the debate, an event that would be completely separate from and, in my view, unrelated to the CCS action, itself.\n\n**C. THE \"ESSENTIAL SECURITY INTERESTS\" PROVISION**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent's Statement of Defence says, in part,\n\nThe record shows that, notwithstanding Claimant's allegations, there have been competing demands for S-band capacity from the military and other security agencies since even before the Devas Contract was entered into. Those demands continued to escalate until they were crystallised in December 2009, after extensive discussions among all governmental departments concerned demonstrating that, given the limited S-band spectrum available to India, there was no way of satisfying the national security needs of the nation if the Devas Contract were to proceed. (Statement of Defence, \u00b6 7).\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent says that by virtue of Article 11 (3) of the Treaty,\n\n...the host State is entitled to take measures directed to the protection of its essential security interests without incurring responsibility under any substantive provision of the Mauritius Treaty otherwise providing protection to investors. (Statement of Defence, \u00b6 76).\n\n78.\n\nArticle 11(3) of the Treaty provides:\n\n(3) The provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way limit the right of either Contracting Party to apply prohibitions or restrictions of any kind or take any other action which is directed to the protection of its essential security interests, or to the protection of public health or the prevention of diseases in pests and animals.\n\n79.\n\nI concur with what appears to be the opinion of my colleagues that this provision is not self-judging. (Award, \u00b6 242). In my view, to preclude a determination by the Tribunal on whether the defence pleaded has been proven, Article 11(3) would have to contain express language to that effect. It plainly does not do so. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that a treaty\n\nshall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\nIn the absence of any wording indicating that the propriety or legality of invoking Article 11(3) is for the state alone to decide, I would hold that this clause is not self-judging.\n\n80.\n\nMoreover, Article 8 of the Treaty allows an investor to submit \"any dispute\" to arbitration. In this case, the possible applicability of Article 11(3) is disputed. Accordingly, **I** would find that it is for this Tribunal to decide, on a proper evaluation of the evidence in this case, whether the actions of the CCS on February 17, 2011, annulling the Devas Agreement, were \"directed to the protection of India's \"essential security interests...\".\n\n81.\n\nMy colleagues have concluded that upon examining the announced decision of the CCS in the form of a press release and statement by the Law Minister on February 17, 2011, (JCB 220) they can discern \"a mix of objectives\" (Award \u00b6 354). The majority continue with their determination by stating that,\n\n...the Tribunal has no difficulty concluding that the reservation of spectrum for the needs of defence and para-military forces can be classified as 'directed to the protection of Its essential security interest', coming under the exclusion covered in Article *11(3) of the Treaty;* however, the same cannot be said when it comes to taking over the spectrum allocated to the Claimants for 'railways and other public utility services as well as for societal needs, and having regard to the country's strategic requirements,' as stated in the CCS decision. (Award \u00b6 354).\n\n82.\n\nWith great respect, I must disagree with this conclusion. Firstly, even *prima facie,* the press release announcing the CCS decision shows that what that body decided was that it would not be able to provide an orbital slot in S band to Antrix for commercial activities and, accordingly, the Devas Agreement \"shall be annulled forthwith.\" What was not decided was how to allocate the now about-to-be available S-band. While I accept, for the sake of argument, my colleagues' view that defence and possibly para-military forces would ordinarily be the sorts of interests to which concerns for a state's essential security could be directed, in this case the CCS stopped short of reserving the S-band for any of the various potential users, including specifically defence or para-military forces. Thus, the wording of the announcement of the CCS decision is plain that the CCS did not decide to reserve the S-band for the military or para-military forces. That body did not reserve the S-band for anyone, but instead referred the determination of that issue to the soon-to-be revived ICC and TAG.\n\n83.\n\nConfirmation of what the CCS was focussing its attention on can be found in the NOTE FOR THE CABINET COMMITTEE ON SECURITY (JCB 219). The subject line of that Note says, plainly:\n\nSubject: Annulling the \"AGREEMENT FOR THE LEASE OF SPACE SEGMENT CAPACITY ON ISRO/ANTRIX S-Band SPACECRAFT BY DEVAS MULTIMEDIA PVT Ltd.\"\n\nThe Note itself states that its purpose \"is to seek approval of Cabinet Committee on Security for Annulling...\" the Devas Agreement \"in view **of** priority to be given to nation's strategic requirements including societal ones.\" (JCB 219, \u00b6 1).\n\n84.\n\nLikewise, the approval sought from the CCS at the end of the Note, which is ultimately reflected almost verbatim in the Law Minister's subsequent press release, purports to recite a variety of broad grounds for the change in policy by which orbital slot in S band can no longer be given to Antrix for \"commercial activities\". (JCB 219 \u00b6 45.1). Based on no longer \"providing that orbital slot in S band to Antri\"x, the CCS is asked to direct that the Devas Agreement \"shall be annulled forthwith\". It is quite clear that the CCS did what the drafters of the Note asked it to do, that is, to decide as a matter of policy, that the S-band spectrum would no longer be available to Antrix for commercial applications and that the contract with Devas was to be annulled forthwith.\n\n85.\n\nBeyond the formulaic public announcement of the CCS decision, I have grave doubts about relying solely upon the wording of such a press release accurately reflecting the substance of the decision of the CCS, It is Important to keep in mind the broader context of these events. As the Prime Minister had noted the day before the CCS decision was announced, DOS, presumably Dr. Radhakrishnan and his Additional Secretary, G. Balachandran, had made \"six revisions of the note before finally submitting it for approval.\" (JCB 218). This statement is corroborated by what G. Balachandran stated in his earlier report, on January 9, 2011, to the effect that the draft note for the Cabinet\n\nwas submitted to Secretary on Aug. 26. Thereafter, drafts modified as instructed by Secretary were submitted on Sept. 25, Oct. 2 and finally on [Oct. 09].\n\n86.\n\nThroughout the period from mid-June, 2010 to mid-February, 2011, Dr. Radhakrishnan is the person who over-saw and directed the pursuit of either terminating or annulling the Devas Agreement. While he was consistent in that objective, there was no such consistency in the reasons being advanced to support such an action. Those reasons are expressed in a multitude of ways, identifying, among other things, concerns with the manner in which that contract was obtained, procedural lapses by DOS and Antrix, as well as many other general references to various potential national uses.\n\n87.\n\nIn my opinion, Dr. Radhakrishnan was at all relevant times endeavoring to ensure that he faithfully followed the legal advice he had previously received, particularly the advice from the Additional Solicitor-General. In his pursuit of his objective of ending the Devas Agreement, it was no doubt considered necessary to refer to broad public purposes, but in the end none of those purposes was specifically served by the CCS decision. My conclusion is reinforced in light of the remarks made by Dr. Radhakrishnan during his press conference on February 8, 2011. He acknowledged that, after deciding to take action to annul the contract,\n\nThe idea is to ensure that a contract that has been entered into has to be now terminated without causing much of embarrassment and damage and financial loss to the government (JCB 206).\n\nA few days later, on February 16, 2011, the Prime Minister, who was also the Minister responsible for DOS, spoke to the Editors of the Electronic Media. He said,\n\nThe issue of how to annul the contract required consideration by legal experts and the Law Ministry was consulted. A decision had to be taken on whether to annul the contract using article 7(c) or Article 11 or both read together.\n\n88.\n\nDr. Radhakrishnan and the Prime Minister were simply adhering to the advice of the Additional Solicitor General to make a decision of the Government\"in its sovereign capacity\" so that Antrix could be instructed to terminate the Devas Agreement pursuant to Articles 7(c) and 11, together, thereby invoking the termination and force majeure provisions of that contract. Having regard for their public acknowledgements and for what our record shows about the background events preceding February 16, 2011, it is important not to be misled by what was a contrived effort to annul the Devas Agreement so as to either avoid or minimise damages payable to Devas. Instead, in order to understand the CCS decision, we are obliged to look at the full picture of the events culminating in the CCS decision.\n\n89.\n\nWithin the Note to the CCS, the section entitled INTER-MINISTERIAL CONSULTATIONS describes the positions of both the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Telecommunications as of mid-February, 2011 (JCB 219). While MOD continued to express its requirements for S-band, as reflected in Annexure 8 to the Note, DOS commented,\n\n**The comments/suggestions in respect of allocation of S Band capacity are noted and would be placed before the INSAT Coordination Committee and the Technical Advisory Group, which are empowered to take decisions in the matter,** (emphasis added). (JCB \u00b6 42.2)\n\nThe position of DOT is even more pointed, saying, in part,\n\nHowever, they have made a number of suggestions in respect of the usage of the S Band and recommended that the present and future strategic requirements for national security related mobile communications and societal applications may be discussed in the meetings of the INSAT Co-ordination Committee (ICC) where representatives of Department of Space, Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ministry of Finance, Department of Science and Technology and even Ministry of Defence could be invited to attend. (JCB \u00b6 42.3).\n\nThis view is reinforced in the correspondence from DOT attached at Annexure 9. The Secretary of DOT wrote,\n\nThe Draft Cabinet Note has been examined and DoT is of the view that utilization of S-band shall be considered and decided by ICC and Technical Advisory Group (TAG) as per the provisions of Radio Regulations of ITU and National Frequency Allocation Plan (NFAP). (JCB 219, Annexure 9).\n\nDOS under Dr. Radhakrishnan apparently agreed, because DOS commented on the position of DOT in exactly the same terms as it had in response to the MOD position,\n\nThe comments/suggestions in respect of allocation of S-Band capacity are noted and would be placed before the INSAT Coordination Committee and the Technical Advisory Group, which are empowered to take decisions in the matter.\n\n90.\n\nIn his report on April 12, 2011, Cabinet Secretary K.M Chandrasekhar recommended to the Prime Minister that the reconstituted ICC should be asked\n\nto urgently consider the various uses of the 'S' band currently available with the DoS and recommend strategies for suitable utilization thereof. (JCB 229, \u00b6 46).\n\nMr. Chandrasekhar attended the 117th Space Commission meeting in July, 2010 as \u00e0 Member (JCB 161). In his capacity as Cabinet Secretary, he also reported directly to the Prime Minister who, as already noted, also served as Minister responsible for DOS.. Mr. Anand confirmed at our hearing that following the CCS decision, the ICC had indeed been reconstituted and was still deliberating about the possible assignment of S-band spectrum even in September 2014. (Anand Tr. 1059). Mr. Anand agreed that the Cabinet Secretary, based on his report to the Prime Minister, \"didn't believe that the contract had been cancelled for military use.\" (Anand Tr. 1056).\n\n91.\n\nThe Report of the INSAT Coordination Committee (ICC) Sub-committee on S-band Utilization Plan (JCB 269) helpfully tells us that in July 2012, the ICC constituted the ICC Sub-Committee\n\nto prepare S-band Utilization Plan (2500 MHz - 2690 MHz) with the members from the Department of Space (DOS), Department of Telecommunications (DOT), Ministry of Defense (MOD) and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).\n\nThe Report added,\n\nThe committee had three meetings (Nov 16, 2012, Jan 18, 2013 and march 08, 2013) to discuss and finalise the task assigned.\n\nFinally, the Report stated,\n\nMembers of the committee deliberated current and future usage of S-band (2500 MHz - MHz) in the country. After the first meeting, attempts were made to prepare a draft report. However, consensus could not be reached and members provided separate inputs to the Sub-Committee.\n\n92.\n\nIt should be recalled that the S-band spectrum described in this report, 2500 MHz -2690 MHz, was the exact spectrum that had been the subject matter of the lease by Antrix to Devas. Thus, for at least three and a half years after the CCS made its decision to withdraw this spectrum from Antrix and to annul the Devas Agreement, there was still no decision on who would get to use that spectrum. What was obviously occurring was a contest between two groups. DOS and MOD were seeking one set of uses, including strategic and societal applications. DOT and TRAI were seeking another form of uses, principally involving the potential auction of spectrum.\n\n93.\n\nMy colleagues have determined that,,\n\n...the fact that the CCS did not make a specific allocation of the spectrum cannot be considered as a deciding element in considering whether the CCS decision was taken for the protection of the Respondent's essential security interests. (Award \u00b6 335).\n\nTheir reasoning is that\n\n...such function came under the authority of the ICC. This fact does not restrict the power of the CCS to decide that any particular activity be \"directed to the protection of (the) essential security interests\" of the State. In the present case, if such a decision was taken, there was nothing inappropriate in leaving it to the proper administrative authorities to decide how the spectrum would be allocated between the various interested parties. (Award \u00b6 335).\n\n94.\n\nI have a number of difficulties with this reasoning. Firstly, as I have earlier noted, Article 11(3) is not self-judging, so it is not for the CCS to decide that any particular activity is directed to the protection of the essential interests of the state. Rather, it is for this Tribunal to make such a determination on a proper weighing of the whole of the evidence in this case.\n\n95.\n\nSecondly, the CCS obviously did not make a decision as to who would get to use the S-band spectrum that they were going to take back from Antrix and Devas. Instead, that spectrum allocation was left to be decided by a reconstituted ICC. As already noted, that body then referred the issue to a sub-committee which included the very military that was supposedly the beneficiary of the CCS decision. It is equally clear that that subcommittee had become stalemated. Neither the DOS/MOD side nor the DOT/TRAI side of the debate had prevailed. As the Report of the Sub-Committee stated,\n\nWhile DOS and MOD is in favor of using 80 MHz of S-BSS and 70 MHz of S-BSS for satellite based services, WPC/DOT and TRAI is not in agreement with the approach. The committee could not converge on the final recommendation with regard to the utilization plan and use of S-band by terrestrial and satellite services. (JCB 269).\n\n96.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is impossible to say that the decision of the CCS was directed towards the \"essential security interests\" of India. The question of S-band spectrum allocation remained open in February 2011 and the debate as to where that S-band spectrum could have gone could just as readily have favoured DOT'S preference for public auction by terrestrial users as it could have gone to DOS and or MOD to be used for military purposes or disaster management or railway tracking. As long as these various potential uses remained under consideration and subject to debate, there was no identified purpose for the CCS decision. There were only possible uses and until it was determined, there was no action directed at the protection of essential security interests or the military interests no matter what the MOD or its several different arms may have requested or wished for.\n\n97.\n\nThe potential allocation of the S-band remained a moot point for years after the CCS decision. Since no decision was made at that time as to what to do with the \"precious S-band\", we must find that all that was decided was to take the S-band spectrum away from commercial use by Antrix and, as a result, Devas. That finding simply places us back into considering the application of Article 6 of the Treaty (Expropriation) which, in my respectful opinion is where we ought to be in relation to the taking of the S-band spectrum.\n\n98.\n\nThe term, \"essential security interests\" itself requires us to determine whether the objective of the CCS decision was directed to protecting an *essential security interests* these words are defined by numerous English language dictionaries, we are required to determine whether what was decided was \"absolutely necessary\", \"indispensably requisite\", or \"unavoidable\" (Award \u00b6 243). In mid-February 2011, the eventual purpose for taking the S-band spectrum was either undetermined or, alternatively, it was for any number of various, potential national uses. Given these facts, we cannot find that the CCS decision was directed at something absolutely necessary at that time.\n\n99.\n\nMerely asserting that the MOD or military armed forces had identified their requirements in various meetings simply does not achieve the purpose of the exemption in Article 11(3). I acknowledge, of course, that there were some clearly expressed objectives for military needs as the military groups saw them. But those expressed requirements were not identified by the CCS on anything other than a purely differential basis. In DOT'S response to DOS in February, 2011, it noted that the Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing of DOT (WPC), the body in charge of frequency management in India, (Anand Tr. 1013), had commented that\n\nWPC Wing does not have any information on strategic requirements of Defence Services, Indian Railways and Safety services as stated... (JCB 219, Annexure 9, para. 18).\n\nIn my view, the broad references to strategic interests or even references to certain defence needs were nothing more than another competing departmental demand which would, as we have seen, have to be considered by the ICC.\n\n100.\n\nThe highly crafted language developed by Dr. Radhakrishnan and his Additional Secretary, Balachandran, from mid-June, 2010 on through to mid-February 2011, seldom strayed beyond vague references to such things as\n\n...spectrum for national needs, including the needs of defence, paramilitary forces, railways and other public utility services as well as societal needs and having regard to the needs of the country\u2019s strategic requirements.\n\nEven on its face, such language falls far short of what is required to successfully invoke the \"essential security interests\" provision. In a list such as this, \"needs of defence and para-military forces\" are not distinguishable from the rest of the listed items. The *ejusdem generis* rule compels us to find that all items in the list are of a piece with one another and rest on the same common ground, namely, they are just possible eventual uses and no more than that.\n\n101.\n\nWhen the whole provenance of the Note for the CCS, is examined, it is apparent that there is a welter of phrases used to describe the objective for terminating the Devas Agreement. In his notes to the legal advisor at the Ministry of Law and Justice and to DOT, Dr. Radhakrishnan said he was seeking their opinions on whether the contract needed to be annulled in order to preserve the \"precious S band spectrum for the strategic requirements of the nation\" and to ensure \"a level playing field for the other service providers using terrestrial spectrum.\" (JCB 153 and JCB 154). These descriptions are fed back to Dr. Radhakrishnan in the legal advisor's opinion as well as his adding in a description of \"strategic needs\". He said,\n\nnew strategic needs have been emerged which require accommodation in our S-Band spectrum. Department have to provide sufficient space/accommodation in the satellite to meet the demand for strategic need of BSF, CISF, RPF and CRPF. (JCB 156) \u00b6 4).\n\nNotably, there is no reference to military or defence needs at that time.\n\n102.\n\nBy the time Additional Secretary Balachandran completed drafting the Note for the 117th Space Commission meeting in early July, 2010, he had identified several \"Requirements\" for S-band usage, including MOD, internal Security Agencies, viz. BSF, CISF, CRPF, Coast Guard, Police and Indian Railways for train-tracking as well as\n\nother national societal requirements for emergency communication, dissemination of disaster warnings, tele-education, tele-health and rural communication. (JCB160,\u00b6\u00b6 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4).\n\n103.\n\nThe decision of the Space Commission explicitly directed that in addition to reviving the ICC, DOS should \"evolve a revised utilization plan For GSAT-6 and GSAT 6-A.\" (JCB 162). The Prime Minister assured the Editors of the Electronic Media that there had been no effort \"...in the Prime Minister's office to dilute, in any way the decision taken by the Space Commission in July 2010. On that I would like to assure you and through you I would like to assure the country.\" (JCB 218, page 8).\n\n104.\n\nDr. Radhakrishnan's letter to the Additional Solicitor General in mid-July, 2010, simply stated,\n\n...the Government has received a lot of demands from various wings of the Government for allocation of S band spectrum to them to meet up the strategic and societal requirements of the nation. (JCB 164).\n\n105.\n\nAfter Dr. Radhakrishnan and Additional Secretary Balachandran had finished re-drafting the Note to the CCS, some six different times, they had refined their description of the objective that is reflected in the press release on February 17, 2011. (JCB 220). Even then, the wording is relatively broad and open-ended. It refers to\n\n...an increased demand for allocation of spectrum for national needs, including for the needs of defence, para-military forces, railways and other public utility services as well as for societal needs, and having regard for the country's strategic requirements, the Government will not be able to provide orbit slot In S band to Antrix for commercial activities... (JCB 220).\n\n106.\n\nHaving regard for these myriad ways of describing the objective for taking the S-band spectrum away from Antrix and Devas, I would find that the only settled objective was to see that the Devas Agreement would be annulled or terminated with as little cost to the government as possible. The ultimate use for the S-band that would be re-acquired from that action would be for whatever the ICC would eventually decide it would be used for. This broad, open-ended pattern shows conclusively that the CCS decision was taken with no particular purpose or \"essential interest\" in mind, but rather simply the general objective of removing the S-band spectrum from commercial use and placing it back into the government's control. The actual use remained to be determined. In these circumstances, there simply cannot be a determination that the state directed its decision towards protecting an essential security interest. Nothing of the sort occurred.\n\n107.\n\nI am compelled to note, as well, that the surrounding political climate concerning the G2 spectrum sales, the charges brought against the former minister for DOT and his colleagues in February 2011, along with the public statements made by Dr. Radhakrishnan and the Prime Minister just before the CCS decision was taken, all contribute to my impression that there were other motives behind their actions. I do not ascribe any bad faith to them, but I cannot avoid the conclusion that the prevailing political conditions required them to deflect any suggestion that the government would allow commercial use of the S-band spectrum. As for who would be the eventual user of that spectrum, that question was left to be determined another day. In fact, it was left for several years.\n\n108.\n\nAs I had earlier noted, the direction found in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, requires us to interpret a treaty not only in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context, but also in light of the object and purpose of the treaty. Here, the recitals at the beginning of the Treaty state that the parties, India and Mauritius, desired to create \"favourable conditions for greater flow of investments made by investors\" and recognising\n\nthat the promotion and protection of such investments will lend greater stimulation to the development of business initiatives and will increase prosperity in the territories of both Contracting Parties.\n\nIt is inimicable to these objectives for there to be easy or simply convenient ways for the state to avoid the solemn promises of protection and security which investors may legitimately expect from that state under a Treaty such as this. In order to invoke the exemption from responsibility for actions taken in the name of protecting essential security interests, India was required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the CCS decision was directed fundamentally and absolutely to protecting such an interest. No such case, in my opinion, has been demonstrated in this arbitration.\n\n109.\n\nFinally, my colleagues have made a determination that\n\n...a reasonable allocation of spectrum directed to the protection of the Respondent's essential security interests would not exceed 60% of the S-band spectrum, the remaining 40% being allocated for other public interest purposes and being subject to the expropriation conditions under Article 6 of the Treaty. (Award \u00b6 373).\n\nI disagree with this determination. For all the reasons I have already described, above, there was no \"allocation of spectrum\" in 2011, nor for many years afterwards. Regardless of what interests the CCS may have broadly alluded to In the press release language adopted from the Note prepared by Dr. Radhakrishnan and Mr. Balachandran, the CCS made no determination whatsoever concerning the S-band spectrum, other than to take it away from Devas and Antrix, thereby creating the legal conditions to invoke the termination and force majeure provisions of the Devas Agreement. **I** do not accept that there was any purported allocation of the S-band spectrum, as my colleagues seek to do, whether 60% or any other percentage. There is simply no legal basis for such a finding and certainly no evidence to support any such conclusion. Moreover, I am compelled to add that the parties have not addressed us on any such apportionment in their submissions.\n\n**D. CONCLUSIONS**\n------------------\n\n110.\n\nFor the reasons I have expressed and based on a fair reading of both the Treaty provision and the evidence in our case, I would find that the defence pleaded by the Respondent pursuant to Article 11(3) has not been made out. On February 17, 2011, the CCS made a decision directed toward a change in policy by withdrawing S-band spectrum previously leased by Antrix to Devas from commercial use by Antrix. The CCS further directed that the Devas Agreement was to be annulled. The whole purpose of that agreement was to enjoy and exploit that spectrum and it was removed by this decision. The manner chosen to achieve this result was directed at either avoiding altogether or mitigating as much as possible any damages that might flow from this action.\n\n111.\n\nThe CCS did not make any decision as to how to allocate the spectrum that it had taken and which was now about-to-be available for India's use. The decision on that allocation was left for the reconstituted ICC and, later, its sub-committee. In these circumstances, the taking of the S-band spectrum was simply an expropriation for a public purpose, which should be evaluated under Article 6 of the Treaty. That would require India to pay \"fair and equitable compensation\" to the investors in this case for the whole of what was taken and not some other unsupportable percentage.\n\n112.\n\nWith great respect, I disagree with my colleagues' determination by which they have assessed and apportioned percentages to reflect what they say are \"reasonable\" allocations of spectrum directed to \"essential security interests\" and \"other public interest purposes\". (Award \u00b6 373). I most respectfully disagree with their conclusion. In my opinion, there is no evidentiary or legal basis for such a determination in this case."}], "Content": "Award on Jurisdiction and Merits\n--------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **LIST OF DEFINED TERMS** | |\n| **Antrix** | Antrix Corporation Ltd, an Indian corporation wholly owned by the Government of India that is under the administrative control of DOS and purports to operate as the commercial marketing arm of ISRO and DOS.

(\"CC/Devas\"), Devas Employees Mauritius Private Limited (\"DEMPL\") and Telcom Devas Mauritius Limited (\"Telcom Devas\"), three companies incorporated in Mauritius. The Claimants bring their claims under the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Mauritius and the Government of the Republic of India for the Promotion and Protection of Investments entering into force June 20, 2000 (the \"Mauritius-India BIT\" or \"Treaty\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are represented in this arbitration by Mr. John L.

THE DISPUTE**\n------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe dispute concerns the annulment of a contract, entitled Agreement for the Lease of Space Segment Capacity on ISRO/ANTRIX S-Band Spacecraft (the \"Devas Agreement\" or the \"Agreement\"),1 concluded on January 28, 2005 between Devas Multimedia Private Limited (\"Devas\"), an Indian company, and Antrix Corporation Limited (\"Antrix\"), an Indian State-owned company. The annulment of the Devas Agreement followed a policy decision taken by the Government of India to reserve a part of the electromagnetic spectrum known as the S-band \"for national needs, including for the needs of defence, para-military forces, railways and other public utility services as well as for societal needs, and having regard to the needs of the country's strategic requirements.\"2 Part of that spectrum had originally had been leased to Devas under the Devas Agreement for the purpose of offering broadband wireless access and audio-video services throughout India.\n\nAgreement for the Lease of Space Segment Capacity on ISRO/ANTRIX S-Band Spacecraft between Antrix Corp. Ltd. and Devas Multimedia Private Ltd. (Agreement No. ANTX/203/DEVAS/2005), January 28, 2005 (the \"**Devas Agreement**\") (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\nPress Information Bureau, Government of India, Cabinet *, CCS Decides to Annul Antrix-Devas Deal*, February 17, 2011 (Ex.

R-36/JCB-218).\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimants, who are shareholders of Devas, maintain that this policy decision taken by the Government of India amounted to an expropriation of the Claimants' investments in India and was not accompanied by payment of fair and equitable compensation, in breach of the Treaty. They also allege other breaches under Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty.\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent argues that its policy decision was intended to satisfy the national security needs of the nation; that Devas had no right to proceed with the Devas Agreement uninterrupted by any governmental action; and that the Claimants have no claim under the Treaty.\n\n**CHAPTER II PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A.

THE NEW DOCUMENTS PRODUCED BY THE RESPONDENT ON DECEMBER 20, 2014**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nOn September 22, 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would not be necessary for them to produce post-hearing briefs on the questions raised by the Tribunal during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability. The Tribunal also stated that, if it wished \"to obtain additional information, it [would] communicate with the Parties in due course.\"\n\n47.\n\nOn December 20, 2014, the Respondent submitted two additional exhibits that had been referred to in a related ICC arbitration: (i) the \"Norms, Guidelines and Procedures for Implementation of the Policy Frame-work for Satellite Communications in India\" (the \"Norms, Guidelines and Procedures\"); and (ii) the Technical Statement from the Joint Wireless Advisor posted on the official website of the Wireless Planning & Coordination Wing of the Department of Telecommunications (the \"JWA Technical Statement\", and, together, the \"**New Documents**\").\n\n48.\n\nOn December 23, 2014, the Claimants argued, inter alia, that the Respondent's December 20, 2014 submission was unsolicited and thus contravened the Tribunal's September 22, 2014 directive. It further submitted that it would be procedurally unfair to allow the record to be added to.\n\n49.\n\nOn December 26, 2014, the Respondent submitted a response to the Claimants' objection on the Additional Documents.\n\n50.\n\nOn January 6, 2015, the Claimants submitted a further response to the Respondent's December 26, 2014 communication.\n\n51.\n\nOn January 7, 2015, the Respondent submitted some brief comments to the Claimants January 6, 2015 communication.\n\n52.\n\nOn January 28, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, Concerning the Respondent's Documents Submitted on December 20, 2014. The Tribunal admitted the Norms, Guidelines and Procedures into the record, while the JWA Technical Statement was admitted into the record by a majority, with reservations. The Tribunal also invited the Claimants to submit a written statement with their views on the New Documents, and granted the Respondent an opportunity to provide responsive comments.\n\n53.\n\nOn March 2, 2015, the Claimants submitted a written statement as directed by Procedural Orders No. 1 and 4.\n\n54.\n\nOn March 28, 2015, the Respondent submitted a response to the Claimants' March 2, 2015 written statement pursuant to Procedural Order No. 4.\n\n**I. THE LAUNCHING OF GSAT-6**\n------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nOn August 31, 2015, the Respondent submitted six news articles and a video by public service broadcaster *Doordarshan* reporting the launch of a satellite named \"GSAT-6\" on August 27, 2015.\n\n56.\n\nOn September 21, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5. In that Order, the Tribunal conditionally accepted the Respondent's submission of August 31, 2015 without ruling on the significance or probative value of the Respondent's submission. The Tribunal also invited the Respondent to explain, within two weeks from the Order, the relevance and probative value of its submission and invited the Claimants to submit, within two weeks of the receipt of the Respondent's explanation, any comment they may wished to make.\n\n57.\n\nThe Respondent, on October 5, 2015, submitted a further article published by the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses entitled \"GSAT-6: India's Second Military Satellite Launched\" in Annex A, \"which reviewed the launch and its significance for the military.\" In its letter, the Respondent stated *inter alia* that \"the video of the event and accompanying press reports attest to the event's significance and leave no doubt that what Respondent told this Tribunal about the reconfiguration of the satellite for military use and the reservation of the S-band capacity for noncommercial, strategic use was completely accurate.\"\n\n58.\n\nOn October 19, 2015, the Claimants submitted to the Tribunal their comments on the documents newly submitted by India relating to satellite launch. The Claimants argued that the Tribunal should focus on contemporaneous evidence to the events of February 2011 and that the new materials do not provide evidence that in 2011 a policy decision was made to reserve the S-band for military needs.\n\n**J. THE ICC FINAL AWARD IN** ***DEVAS MULTIMEDIA PRIVATE LIMITED V. ANTRIX****CORPORATION LIMITED***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nOn June 29, 2011, Devas had commenced an arbitration under the ICC rules pursuant to Article 20 of the Devas Agreement, captioned *Devas Multimedia (Private) Limited v. Antrix Corp. Ltd.* (No. 18051/CYK) (\"**the ICC arbitration**\"), in which Devas had sought both specific performance of the Devas Agreement and/or damages.3\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras 7, 51-55; Statement of Claim, para. 146; Statement of Defence, para. 61.\n\n60.\n\nOn September 14, 2015, the ICC tribunal issued its award, ordering Antrix to pay USD 562.5 million to Devas Multimedia Private Limited for damages caused by Antrix's wrongful repudiation of the Devas Agreement, plus interest.\n\n61.\n\nOn October 1, 2015, the Claimants, with the consent of the Respondent, informed the Tribunal that it wished to provide the *ICC* Final Award to the members of the present Tribunal and that the Parties would make simultaneous submissions concerning the impact on this arbitration of the Final Award on October 9, 2015 and reply submissions on October 19, 2015.\n\n62.\n\nOn October 2, 2015, the Tribunal approved the approach agreed between the Parties. The ICC Final Award was communicated to the Tribunal on the same day.\n\n63.\n\nOn October 9, 2015, the Parties made submissions pursuant to the agreed approach, and on October 19, 2015, the Parties made reply submissions pursuant to the agreed approach. The content of the Parties' submissions is briefly discussed below.\n\n**CHAPTER III FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe following summary draws on the Parties' submissions to provide context to the alleged violations of the Treaty by the Respondent in respect of the Claimants' investments in India that are at issue in this arbitration.

At all relevant times, the Prime Minister was also the Minister of Space and a member of the Cabinet Committee on Security. From 2004 to May 25, 2014, the office of Prime Minister was held by Dr. Manmohan Singh, member of the Congress Party and leader of the then government (of which the Congress Party was the senior coalition partner). Following an election in 2014, Shri Narendra Damodaras Modi became Prime Minister on May 26, 2014;\n\n(b) The Office of the Prime Minister of India (\"**PMO**\"), which includes the Prime Minister's staff;\n\n(c) The Union Cabinet, or the Union Council of Ministers, a core decision-making body of the Government of India;\n\n(d) The Indian Cabinet Committee on Security (\"**CCS**\"), a select Cabinet committee that, among other matters, \"deal[s] with all Defence related issues,\" \"issues relating to law and order, and internal security\" and \"economic and political issues impinging on national security.\"6 It comprises the Prime Minister, the Minister of Home Affairs, the Minister of External Affairs, the Minister of Finance, and the Minister of Defence;7\n\n(e) The Indian Space Commission (the \"**Space Commission**\"), which \"formulates the policies and oversees the implementation of the Indian space programme to promote the development and application of space science and technology for the socioeconomic benefit of the country.\"8 The Space Commission comprises appointees from across the Government of India, including the Minister of State, the National Security Advisor (who reports to the Prime Minister), the Cabinet Secretary, the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, the Secretary for Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, the Secretary Department of Expenditure, Secretary to the Government of India, and senior directors of ISRO centres;\n\n(f) The Department of Space (\"**DOS**\"), the government department responsible for the development of India's space policy and the implementation of the decisions of the Space Commission. Since its establishment in 1972 under Prime Minister Indira Ghandi, DOS has formed part of the Prime Minister's portfolio and has reported to the PMO;9\n\n(g) The Indian Space Research Organization (\"**ISRO**\"), a body of the Government of India under the direction of DOS and the Space Commission that engages in research and testing in order to encourage the \"rapid development of activities connected with space science, space technology and space applications\" with \"responsibility in the entire field of science and technology of outer space.\"10 ISRO builds, launches, operates and leases satellites for various uses, including telecommunications, television and radio broadcasting;11\n\n(h) Antrix, a corporation wholly owned by the Government of India12 that is under the administrative control of DOS and that purports to operate as the commercial marketing arm of ISRO and DOS. Antrix was created to promote the commercial exploitation of India's space program. Antrix is expected to seek out \"[v]enture capital funding\" from private partners and to promote the transfer of technology from such commercial entities to ISR O13 in order to develop India's space-related, industrial capabilities.14 Among other things, Antrix leases transponder capacity on satellites to companies that provide satellite communications and broadcasting services. Antrix was Devas' counterparty in the Devas Agreement; and\n\n(i) The Additional Solicitor-General (the \"**ASG**\"), one of the law officers of the Republic of India who represents the Government of India in the Supreme Court and provides it with legal advice. The highest legal officer in India is the Attorney General, who holds a constitutional post. By statute, the Attorney General is assisted by the Solicitor-General of India (the second highest law officer in India), who in turn is assisted by the Additional Solicitor-General.\n\nComposition and Functions of the Cabinet Committees, August 30, 2011 (Ex.

Specifically, Dr. K. Kasturirangan served in these positions until August 2003. He was succeeded by Dr. G. Madhavan Nair, who served in these positions from September 2003 to October 2009; and thereafter from November 2009 until around July 2011, Dr. K.R. Radhakrishnan held these positions.16 The Claimants characterize Dr. Radhakrishnan as the \"central actor in these proceedings...\"17\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 30.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 51:10-11.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent denies this allegation and maintains that Antrix remained distinct from the other entities at all times.18\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 8.\n\n**B. BACKGROUND TO THE DEVAS PROJECT**\n--------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Devas Agreement forms the contractual framework to enable and facilitate the Devas project, which proposed to utilize part of the S-band capacity previously allocated to India by the International Telecommunications Union (\"**ITU**\").19\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 3; Statement of Reply, para. 21. India was allocated a total of 190 MHz of capacity in the portion of the S-band encompassing frequencies between 2500 MHz and 2690 MHz.\n\n***1. The S-band and Its Allocation within India***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe S-band is a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum found at 2500-2690 MHz (the \"S-band\").20 The S-band is a scarce and highly desirable spectrum due to its specific characteristics\u2014 its frequencies have low attenuation (i.e. the signal does not fade) and the signal can be sent and received by small units, such as mobile phones and laptop computers, without requiring the antenna on such units to be pointed directly at the satellite.21\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 3, 41; Statement of Defence, para. 32.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 33.\n\n73.\n\nOf the capacity allocated to India, further allocations were made internally by India pursuant to its national planning, for example, to enable mobile satellite services (\"**MSS**\")22 and broadcast satellite services (\"**BSS**\").23\n\nThe portion of the S-band allocated for mobile satellite services, amounting to 110 MHz, is referred to as \"**S-MSS**\" (*see* Witness Statement of Mr. A. Vijay Anand, dated December 2, 2013, para. 2 (\"**Anand I**\")).\n\nThe portion of the S-band allocated for broadcast satellite services, amounting to 80 MHz, is referred to as \"**S-BSS**\" (*see* Anand I, para. 2). *See* Transcript, Day 1, 18:1-7.\n\n74.\n\nThe Parties disagree with regard to the allocation and utilization of S-band capacity in India. According to the Respondent, both the S-MSS and the S-BSS frequencies, from the outset of India's space program until the early part of the last decade, were utilized solely for non-commercial, national strategic and societal purposes at all relevant times.24 It adds that, in the early 2000s, 40MGz of S-MSS capacity were assigned to the Department of Telecommunications for use in the terrestrial communications industry, leaving the Department of Space with 80MGz of S-BSS and 70MGz capacity. The Claimants, however, contend that in 2001, the DOS was left with that latter capacity, which was not utilized at the time and that it needed to find ways of making commercial use of its allocated S-band spectrum in order to retain that allocation which would otherwise, under the ITU regulations, expire by September 2010 if it remained unused.25\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 32; Witness Statement of Mr. K Sethuraman, dated December 2, 2013, para. 6 (\"**Sethuraman I**\").\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 32; Statement of Reply, paras 21-24; Witness Statement of Ramachandran Viswanathan, dated June 29, 2013, paras 26-27 (\"**Viswanathan I**\"); Transcript, Day 1, 20:19-21:18.\n\n***2. The Proposed Devas Satellite-Terrestrial Communications System***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nEarly discussions concerning the proposed Devas project took place in 2003 between Antrix and Forge Advisors LLC (\"**Forge Advisors**\"), a U.S. company headed by Mr. Ramachandran Viswanathan,26 which led to a signed Memorandum of Understanding \"to explore mutually beneficial opportunities in the area of digital multimedia services.\"27\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 55.\n\nMemorandum of Understanding between Forge Advisors and Antrix, July 28, 2003 (Ex. C-6/JCB-14).\n\n76.\n\nThe Devas project envisaged the establishment of a hybrid satellite-terrestrial communications system involving both satellite and terrestrial transmission28 due to certain perceived advantages over a satellite-only communications system.29 This system would enable Devas to offer two main services to customers in India: broadband wireless access (\"BWA\") and audio-video (\"AV\") services, to facilitate the delivery of video, multimedia and information services across India to mobile users (together, \"Devas Services\").30\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 37, 38.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 37, noting that one key advantage is that satellite-only systems require the 'end-user' on the surface of the earth to have a direct line of sight to the satellite in order to send and receive radio signals.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 31; Statement of Claim, paras 4, 37.\n\n77.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, this hybrid communications system required the construction of a network of Complementary Ground Components (\"CGC\"), often referred to as 'towers' or 'repeaters', on the surface of the earth that use the same frequency as a satellite.31 Satellite transmission would be augmented by terrestrial transmission to enable the reuse of satellite signals seamlessly.32\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 38-41.\n\n*Id*., para. 38; *Report on GSAT-6*, Submitted by Dr. B.N. Suresh, Director, Indian Institute of Space and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, Submitted to: Chairman, ISRO/Secretary, Department of Space, delivered June 7, 2010, para. 5 (\"**Suresh Report**\") (Ex. C-94/JCB-146); Witness Statement of Dr. Rajendra Singh, dated June 26, 2013, para. 16 (\"**Singh I**\").\n\n78.\n\nIt was proposed that ISRO would be responsible for developing the satellite segment by building, launching and operating two satellites and leasing transponder capacity on these satellites to Devas.33 In turn, Devas would be responsible for the terrestrial segment by, among other things, building the CGC elements of the network,34 notwithstanding the fact that the Devas Agreement did not address this latter aspect.35\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 44; Statement of Defence, para. 16.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 37; Statement of Defence, paras 8, 35-36.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 8.\n\n79.\n\nThe following is a diagrammatic representation of how the Devas System would provide services, which was prepared for a presentation by Devas to Columbia Capital LLC and Telcom Ventures LLC in 2005:36\n\nPresentation by Devas to Columbia Capital & Telcom Ventures, December 9, 2005 (Ex. C-20/JCB-45).\n\n80.\n\nOne critical component of the hybrid communications system was sufficient S-band capacity, since the S-band signal could be received and sent from units in motion using compact omnidirectional antennae.37 As a practical matter, any S-band capacity allocated for Devas' use could not be simultaneously used by another operator as this could cause significant interference with the system or the total unavailability of the service.38\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 34.\n\nStatement of Claim para. 41; *see also* Statement of Claim, para. 102.\n\n***3. Negotiations Leading to the Devas Agreement***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nIn May 2004, at the direction of the chairman of ISRO, a High Power Committee was constituted to review the \"technical feasibility, risk mitigation, time schedule, financial and organizational aspects\" of the Devas project. This committee was chaired by Dr. K.N. Shankara (the \"**Shankara Committee**\").39\n\n*Id*., para. 55.\n\n82.\n\nThe Shankara Committee concluded that the contemplated system of \"satellite transmission [...] augmented by terrestrial transmission so as to reuse the signals seamlessly in Indian environment\" was \"technically sound and reliable\" as well as \"quite attractive.\" After further discussions, the Antrix Board \"approved the draft agreement negotiated with Devas [and recommended by the Shankara Committee].\"40\n\n*Id*., paras 55-56.\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent attaches significance to a \"definitive binding Term Sheet\" proposed by Devas on September 20, 2004 (the \"**Term Sheet**\"),41 particularly with respect to the grounds for termination and its consequences, which will be addressed in greater detail below. The Claimants, however, emphasize that the provisions of the Devas Agreement have superseded these negotiations, and consider them irrelevant as a matter of law.42\n\n*See* E-mail from Mr. R. Viswanathan, Forge Advisors, to Mr. K.R. Sridhara Murthi, Antrix Corporation Ltd., and Dr. A. Bhaskaranarayana, ISRO, with Attachment, September 20, 2004 (Ex. R-12/JCB-23); Draft of \"Binding Term Sheet\" presented on or about September 12, 2004 (Ex. R-13/JCB-20). The Respondent notes that the Claimants submitted a witness statement of Mr. Viswanathan that references the proposed \"binding term sheet\" without introducing it. *See* Viswanathan I, paras 48-49; Statement of Defence, para. 22.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 33:23-34:1.\n\n**C. THE DEVAS AGREEMENT**\n--------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe operative version of the Devas Agreement between Devas and Antrix was concluded on January 28, 2005.43\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 27; Statement of Claim, para. 58; Statement of Defence, para. 43; *see* Devas Agreement (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\n85.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Claimants emphasize that this is not a case based on a breach of contract, but rather a treaty claim.44 Accordingly, the Claimants focus on the rights ensuing to Devas from the Agreement. The Respondent also closely examines the nature of Devas' rights but place additional significance on Antrix's corresponding obligations\u2014arguing that they are limited in nature. The Parties discuss at length the following aspects of the Devas Agreement:\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 91:1-12.\n\n***1. Leased Capacity***\n------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Devas Agreement provided for the lease of transponder capacity on a first satellite (identified as \"PS1\" or \"GSAT-6\") and it also gave Devas the option to lease transponders on a second satellite (\"PS2\" or \"GSAT-6A\"), which it exercised.45\n\n*See* Notice of Arbitration, para. 27; Statement of Claim, paras 44, 46; Statement of Defence, para. 16.\n\n87.\n\nIn essence, the Devas Agreement provided for the lease of 75% of India's S-BSS allocation (30 MHz for each satellite, for a total of 60 MHz of India's total of 80 MHz of S-BSS) and 10 MHz of the S-MSS allocated for use by DOS.46 Overall, it was agreed that 90% of the total bandwidth of the satellites was allocated to Devas, and the other 10% was allocated to DOS.47\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 36.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 45.\n\n88.\n\nThe Claimants stress that the Devas Agreement provided that the Leased Capacity would be a \"Non-Preemptible service, except as specifically provided for in Article 7,\"48 which gave Devas the exclusive right to the Leased Capacity.49 The Claimants also highlight that, under the Devas Agreement, Devas could assign the Leased Capacity at its sole discretion upon sixty days' advance notice to Antrix,50 which enabled Devas to undertake a range of transactions with investors.51\n\nDevas Agreement, Article 2 (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 48.\n\nDevas Agreement, Article 17 (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 50.\n\n***2. Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees***\n------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nUnder the Devas Agreement, Devas was required to pay Antrix an upfront capacity reservation fee of the INR equivalent of USD 20 million, to be paid in three equal instalments, in order to reserve transponder capacity on the first satellite.52 The first such instalment was due upon notice from Antrix that it had received all necessary approvals for the capacity lease service for the satellite.53\n\n*Id.*, para. 46; Statement of Defence, para. 19.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 19; Devas Agreement, Exhibit B, Article 2.1.1 (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\n90.\n\nWithin 30 months of payment of the first installment of that fee (with a 6-month grace period), ISRO was required to deliver a fully operational and ready PS1.54 Devas had to pay an upfront capacity reservation fee of the INR equivalent of USD 20 million to reserve transponder capacity on the second satellite as well.55 In addition to these upfront fees, Devas was also required to pay Antrix an ongoing annual lease fee for the transponders of the INR equivalent of USD 9 million, rising to the INR equivalent of USD 11.25 million once Devas became cash flow positive.56\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 46; Devas Agreement, Articles 2 and 3(b) (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\n*Id*.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 46; Devas Agreement, Articles 4 and 5, Exhibit B (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\n***3. Regulatory Approvals***\n-----------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe activities contemplated by the Devas Agreement were subject to a number of approvals and licenses to be obtained in part by Devas and in part by Antrix. Under the Devas Agreement, Antrix was obligated to acquire \"all necessary Governmental and Regulatory Approvals relating to orbital slot and frequency clearances, and funding for the satellite to facilitate DEVAS services.\"57 Antrix also undertook \"through ISRO/DOS\" to obtain clearances of all relevant international and national agencies\"58 and to \"provide appropriate technical assistance to Devas on a best effort basis for obtaining required operating licenses and Regulatory Approvals.\"59\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 47; Devas Agreement, Articles 2 and 3(c) (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 47; Devas Agreement, Articles 9 and 12(a)(ii) (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 47; Devas Agreement, Articles 2 and 3(c) (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\n92.\n\nWhat is significant in the Respondent's view is that no governmental body of India was party to the Devas Agreement or gave any commitment to grant the necessary approvals to Devas.60 The role of the Government of India in connection with the Devas Agreement was limited to that of a regulator,61 and, accordingly, the Devas Agreement contained a comprehensive set of provisions allocating risks and responsibilities in the event that the governmental approvals required for full implementation of the project were not obtained.62\n\nThe Respondent submits that this is an undisputed material fact in this case; *See* Transcript, Day 1, 123:15 124:4; Day 5, 1277:19-1278:15.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras 8, 17. The Respondent submits that this is an undisputed material fact in this case; *See* Transcript, Day 1, 112:21-114:22; 1274:16-1275:13.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 20. The Respondent emphasizes that the implementation of the project was subject to government approvals, and submits that this is an undisputed material fact in this case. *See* Transcript, Day 1, 114:23-118:13; Day 5, 1273:5-13.\n\n***4. Delay Damages***\n----------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Devas Agreement provided for \"Delay Damages\" of USD 416,666 per month (for a cap of USD 5 million after 12 months' delay) if Antrix failed to deliver PS1 within three years of the first upfront capacity reservation payment.63 It also provided that the failure to deliver PS1 within four years from the first payment would be a material breach of the agreement.64\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 52; Devas Agreement, Articles 2 and 3(c) (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 52; Devas Agreement, Exhibit B, paras 2.1., 2.2 (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\n***5. Termination***\n--------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent places special emphasis on Article 7 of the Devas Agreement, setting forth the rights and obligations of the parties upon termination, which could be triggered by either party to the Agreement on a series of grounds:65\n\nArticle 7. Termination\n\na. Termination for convenience by DEVAS\n\nDEVAS may terminate this Agreement in the event DEVAS is unable to get and retain the Regulatory Approvals required to provide the Devas Services on or before the completion of the Pre Shipment Review of PS1. In the event of such termination, DEVAS shall forfeit the Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees made to ANTRIX and any service or other taxes paid by DEVAS and those outstanding to be paid to ANTRIX till such date. Upon such termination, neither Party shall have any further obligation to the other Party under this Agreement.\n\nb. Termination by DEVAS for fault of ANTRIX\n\nDEVAS may terminate this Agreement at any time if ANTRIX is in material breach of any provisions of this Agreement and ANTRIX has failed to cure the breach within three months after receiving notice from DEVAS setting out the nature of breach and reasons for considering the same as material breach. In such event, ANTRIX shall immediately reimburse DEVAS all the Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees and corresponding taxes if applicable, received by ANTRIX till that date. Upon such termination, neither Party shall have any further obligation to the other Party under this Agreement nor be liable to pay any sum as compensation or damages (by whatever name called).\n\nc. Termination for convenience by ANTRIX\n\nANTRIX may terminate this Agreement in the event ANTRIX is unable to obtain the necessary frequency and orbital slot coordination required for operating PS1 on or before the completion of the Pre Shipment Review of the PS1. In the event of such termination, ANTRIX shall immediately reimburse DEVAS all the Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees and corresponding service taxes received by ANTRIX till that date. Upon such termination, neither Party shall have any further obligation to the other Party under this Agreement nor be liable to pay any sum as compensation or damages (by whatever name called).\n\nd. Termination by ANTRIX for fault of DEVAS ANTRIX may terminate this Agreement at any time if:\n\ni. DEVAS is in material breach of any provisions of this Agreement and DEVAS has failed to cure the breach within three months after receiving notice from ANTRIX regarding such breach or,\n\nii. Non payment of (a) the Lease Fees and other charges (such as spectrum monitoring charges) by DEVAS for a continued period of twelve (12) months, or if such accumulated delays from recurrent non payments exceed 60 (sixty) months, whichever occurs earlier or,\n\n(b) Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees, already due\n\niii. In the event that:\n\na. A liquidator trustee or a bankruptcy receiver or the like is appointed by a competent court and such appointment remains un-stayed or un-vacated for a period of 90 (ninety) days after the date of such order by a competent court in respect of DEVAS, or\n\nb. If a receiver or manager is appointed by a competent court in respect of all or a substantial part of the assets of DEVAS and such appointment remains un-stayed or unvacated for a period of 90 (ninety) days after the date of such appointment, or\n\nc. If all or a substantial part of the assets of DEVAS have been finally confiscated by action of any Governmental Authority, against which no appeal or judicial redress lies.\n\nIt is expressly agreed that ANTRIX shall have no right to terminate this Agreement if DEVAS enters into any scheme or arrangement with its creditors, a corporate re-organization or restructuring of its debt and liabilities as long as DEVAS continues to make the Annual Lease Payments to ANTRIX.\n\nIn the event of such termination, DEVAS shall forfeit the Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees made to ANTRIX and DEVAS shall be liable to pay any outstanding dues to be paid to ANTRIX by DEVAS. Upon such termination, neither Party shall have any further obligation to the other Party under this Agreement nor be liable to pay any sum as compensation or damages (by whatever name called).\n\n*See* Statement of Defence, paras 20, 21; Devas Agreement, Article 7 (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\n95.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that, under these provisions, the only consequence arising from the termination of the Devas Agreement is either the retention or the refund of the upfront capacity reservation fees paid by Devas to Antrix.66\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 21\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the termination provisions of the Devas Agreement were heavily negotiated.67 The Respondent relies on the Term Sheet,68 which contains a set of termination provisions that are, in the Respondent's view, substantially different from those agreed by the parties in Article 7 of the Devas Agreement.69 The Term Sheet provided (i) that Antrix would \"not be entitled to terminate [the agreement] except for non-payment of fees by DEVAS;\"70 and (ii) that Antrix would have to pay liquidated damages, in addition to refunding amounts that may have been paid by Devas to Antrix, in case of termination for any reason other than Devas' nonpayment of fees.71\n\n*Id*., paras 22-28.\n\n*See* E-mail from Mr. R. Viswanathan, Forge Advisors, to Mr. K.R. Sridhara Murthi, Antrix Corporation Ltd., and Dr. A. Bhaskaranarayana, ISRO, with Attachment, September 20, 2004 (Ex. R-12/JCB-23); Draft of \"Binding Term Sheet\" presented on or about September 12, 2004 (Ex. R-13/JCB-20). The Respondent notes that the Claimants submitted a witness statement of Mr. Viswanathan that references the proposed \"binding term sheet\" without introducing it; *See* Viswanathan I, paras 48-49; Statement of Defence, para. 22.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 22.\n\n*Id*., para. 23; E-mail from Mr. R. Viswanathan, Forge Advisors, to Mr. K.R. Sridhara Murthi, Antrix Corporation Ltd., and Dr. A. Bhaskaranarayana, ISRO, with Attachment, September 20, 2004, para. 2.7.1 (Ex. R-12/JCB-23).\n\nStatement of Defence, paras 23-24; E-mail from Mr. R. Viswanathan, Forge Advisors, to Mr. K.R. Sridhara Murthi, Antrix Corporation Ltd., and Dr. A. Bhaskaranarayana, ISRO, with Attachment, September 20, 2004, paras 2.7.2-2.7.5 (Ex. R-12/JCB-23), which provides:  \n 2. In the event that ANTRIX terminates the Definitive Agreement for any other reason following signature of Definitive Agreements and prior to DEVAS raising its institutional financing, ANTRIX shall refund to DEVAS all the amounts paid by DEVAS to ANTRIX for any reason whatsoever, plus liquidated damages of INR 460 million for investment in the business and related losses including but not limited to investments, capital raising costs, lost business opportunities, reputation loss, penalties, development costs, mobile receiver and terrestrial repeater development, infrastructure costs, severances, and vendor and dealer negotiation costs[\u2026]  \n 3. In the event that ANTRIX terminates the Definitive Agreement for any other reason following signature of Definitive Agreements and after DEVAS has raised its first institutional round of funding, ANTRIX shall refund to DEVAS all the amounts paid by DEVAS to ANTRIX for any reason whatsoever, plus liquidated damages of INR 6.9 billion for investment in the business and related losses including but not limited to investments, capital raising costs[,] lost business opportunities, reputation loss, penalties, development costs, mobile receiver and terrestrial repeater development, infrastructure costs, severances, and vendor and dealer negotiation costs[\u2026]  \n 5. DEVAS may terminate this binding Term Sheet or Definitive Agreements for cause, which shall include failure of ANTRIX to meet its obligations, or breach of Agreement, or withdrawal of approvals and licenses controlled by ANTRIX. In the event of such termination, DEVAS shall be entitled to a refund of all the amounts paid by DEVAS to ANTRIX for any reason whatsoever plus liquidated damages of INR 6.9 billion for investment in the business and related losses, including but not limited to investments, capital raising costs, lost business opportunities, reputation loss, penalties, development costs, mobile receiver and terrestrial repeater development, infrastructure costs, severances, and vendor and dealer negotiation costs.\"\n\n97.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent points out that there was nothing in Devas' proposed binding term sheet that provided for liquidated damages running from Devas to Antrix in the event that Devas were to terminate the agreement for its convenience, or in the event of breach by Devas.72\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 25.\n\n98.\n\nUltimately, the Term Sheet was never executed, and Article 7 of the Devas Agreement, which provides for a single remedy in the event of termination for any reason, was agreed instead.73\n\n*Id*., para. 26.\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent argues that this difference between the termination provisions proposed by Devas and those agreed to by the parties in Article 7 of the Devas Agreement is significant. As a result of the negotiations, the parties' mutual intention and agreement at the time of entry into the Devas Agreement was to limit liability in the event of a termination. The maximum liability was either the retention (or refund, as the case may be) by Antrix of the upfront capacity reservation fees paid to date.74\n\n*Id*., para. 22.\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Antrix never properly invoked the termination regime in Article 7 of the Devas Agreement. Moreover, it argues, even if those provisions operated to shield Antrix from damages for its unlawful renunciation and/or repudiation of the Agreement (which is denied), Article 7 still would not provide a 'safe harbor' for India in this proceeding.75\n\nStatement of Reply, paras 15, 129-37.\n\n***6. Force Majeure***\n----------------------\n\n101.\n\nArticle 11 of the Devas Agreement provided that neither Devas nor Antrix was \"liable for any failure or delay in performance of its obligations\" in the event of a *force majeure* as defined in this Article.76\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 53; Statement of Defence, para. 29; Devas Agreement, Article 11 (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\n102.\n\nA *force majeure* event was limited to matters \"beyond reasonable control of the party affected\" which prevented performance \"despite all efforts of the Affected Party to prevent it or mitigate its effects.\"77 In the Claimants' view, this notion of *force majeure* cannot be reconciled with Antrix's eventual declaration of *force majeure*, which was premised upon a Union Cabinet policy decision and was purposefully procured by Antrix/ISRO/DOS in an effort to extricate Antrix from the Devas Agreement.78\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 53; Devas Agreement, Articles 8-9, 11(b) (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 53, 178-84.\n\n103.\n\nIn turn, the Respondent highlights that Article 11 of the Devas Agreement defined \"Force Majeure event\" to include \"acts of or failure to act by any governmental authority acting in its sovereign capacity.\"79 It is obvious, in the Respondent's view, that the Government of India had the power to take action to prevent the performance by either or both parties to the Devas Agreement.80\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 29; Devas Agreement, Article 11(a) (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 29. The Respondent submits that this is an undisputed material fact in this case. *See* Transcript, Day 1, 118:14-119:6; Day 5, 1273:14-1274:15.\n\n**D. THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE DEVAS PROJECT**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n***1.

THE PARALLEL REVIEW PROCESS OF THE DEVAS AGREEMENT AND ITS SUBSEQUENT ANNULMENT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nBoth Parties acknowledge that several Indian authorities undertook a unilateral review of the terms of the Devas Agreement in parallel with the initial performance of its provisions, ultimately culminating in its annulment. What follows is a summary of key events that were unbeknownst to the Claimants at the time, but occurred in parallel to the initial performance of the Devas Agreement, from 2005 to February 2011.\n\n***1. India's Internal Discussions on Security Needs for S-band Capacity***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nIn 2005, India's military and paramilitary agencies started expressing a demand for S-band capacity for non-commercial purposes.112 In the period 2005-2007, these demands took the form of reviews and projections of future S-bandwidth requirements.113 However, in September 2007, a concern emerged that if S-band spectrum was \"not safeguarded against the bid of commercial operators in India, this spectrum [would] not be available for any future utilization for the military applications...which would \"severely jeopardize the future Defence services plans of providing SATCOM connectivity.\"114\n\nHQ Integrated Defence Staff, Note, October 14, 2005 (App. VA-2/JCB-42).\n\nMinutes of Third Task Force Meeting with DoS Held on February 21, 2006 at HQ IDS New Delhi, March 6, 2006 (App. VA-3/JCB-56); HQ Integrated Defence Staff ops Branch/IW & IT Dte, Note, *Bandwidth Requirements- Satellite Commn*, August 9, 2006 (App. VA-4/JCB-64); Minutes of the Integrated Space Cell Meeting Held on February 19, 2007 at HQ IDS, March 26, 2007 (App. VA-5/JCB-66); HQ Integrated Defence Staff, Convening Order, *Constitution of an Expert Committee on Spectrum and Satellite Uses of Frequency Band 2.5 GHz to 2.69 GHz (S-Band) by Defence Services*, August 30, 2007 (App. VA-6/JCB-73).\n\nReport of the Expert Committee on Spectrum and Satellite Uses of Frequency Band 2.5 to 2.69 GHz (S-band) by Defence Services, September 2007, paras 10-12 (App. VA-7/JCB-92).\n\n119.\n\nThe armed forces' needs for S-band spectrum continued to be reviewed in the following years.115 The Claimants remained unaware of the existence of any needs for S-band spectrum of the Indian military until the Government of India announced that the CCS had decided to annul the Devas Agreement in February 2011. According to Claimants, they were not made aware of \"competing demands for S-band capacity\" until the date of Antrix's termination notice.\"116\n\nMinutes of the Special ISC Meeting Between Reps of ISRO & Reps of Three Services to Address Satellite Based Communication Related Issues, November 25, 2008 (App. VA-8/JCB-92); Office Order of ISRO, May 20, 2009 (App. VA-9/JCB-105); Minutes of Meeting held on December 15, 2009 at ISAC, Bangalore between ISC of HQ IDS, MOD and ISRO, January 25, 2010 (App. VA-10/JCB-134).\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 29; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 114.\n\n***2. The Suresh Report***\n--------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThe Respondent explains that, in November 2009, Mr. A. Vijay Anand, the new Joint Secretary of the Department of Space and Chief Vigilance Officer, learned of possible irregularities relating to the Devas Agreement.117 These irregularities, notably the allegedly unauthorized amendment to the minutes of a January 6, 2009 meeting of a review committee of the Technical Advisory Committee (\"**TAG**\") of the Indian Satellite Coordination Committee (\"**ICC**\"), had the effect of eliminating significant comments that had been made by the representatives of the Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing (the \"**WPC**\"), a body responsible for the issuance of an operating license and frequency allocation.118\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 39.\n\nAccording to the Respondent the statement that was allegedly omitted from the transcript implied, in essence, that Devas would not be permitted to use the S-BSS frequencies for terrestrial transmission under existing policy, yet that is precisely what it wanted to do; *See* Statement of Defence, para. 39; Anand I, paras 8-11.\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the disclosure of potential irregularities and the information obtained at the preliminary stage of this internal investigation led Dr. Radhakrishnan to institute a comprehensive review of the Devas Agreement on December 8, 2009. The review was to be conducted by a committee established through the Department of Telecommunications (\"**DOT**\") and chaired by Dr. B.N.

Therefore this aspect has to be critically examined considering all usages including GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A by a competent technical team on high priority. **The strategic and other essential needs of the country should also be considered**.127\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 42, citing Suresh Report, para. 15.1 (Ex. R-24/JCB-146) (emphasis by the Respondent). The Claimants interpret this remark of the Suresh Report as merely suggesting that \"a competent technical team should take a look at whether the spectrum is being optimized through these systems\"; *See* Transcript, Day 1, 64:25-65:3.\n\n125.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent notes that the Devas Agreement was ultimately cancelled for national security reasons based on the nation's strategic requirements for the spectrum, which had crystallized by the end of 2009.128\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 43.\n\n***3. The Space Commission's Determination to Annul the Devas Agreement***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to why DOS decided to pursue the review of the Devas Agreement after the Suresh Report was issued.\n\n127.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants emphasize that, towards the end of May 2010, the media in India had begun making assertions that DOS had given away valuable S-band spectrum to Devas \"on the quiet\" and calling on the Government of India to annul the Agreement.129 However, according to the Claimants, despite the negative press reports, in the numerous meetings held with various Indian governmental ministries during the summer and autumn of 2010, in particular with the Advisor to the Prime Minister and the National Security Advisor where Devas delivered presentations on its history, accomplishments and progress on collaboration with the Government of India,130 no concerns about the Devas Project or about Devas' allocation in the S-band were raised.131\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 110; Viswanathan I, para. 165; Statement of Reply, para. 36.\n\n*See* Presentation by Devas to Advisor to the Prime Minister of India on Public Information, Infrastructure & Innovations (Pitroda), June 10, 2010 (Ex.

The Respondent further cites the letter from Dr. Suresh to Dr. Radhakrishnan dated June 7, 2010 to prove the delivery of the Suresh Report to the latter on the same date.138\n\n*See* Letter from the Ministry of Defence to ISRO/Department of Space (Redacted), April 23, 2010 (Ex.

Viswanathan, Advisor to Law Minister, Ministry of Law and Justice, June 16, 2010 (Ex. R-26/JCB-154). The Ministry of Law and Justice noted that \"[t]he Central Government (Department of Space)[,] in exercise of its sovereign power and function... may take a policy decision that due to the needs of strategic requirements, the Central Govt/ISRO would not be able to provide orbital slot in S band for operating PS1 to the Antrix for commercial activities,\" whereas DOT stated that \"[t]he spectrum planned by DOS for strategic use is not to be shared with commercial applications as in the case of M/s Devas Multimedia.\"; *See* Note from T.

The Opinion of the Additional Solicitor-General***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nSubsequent to the determination of the Space Commission, DOS sought the opinion of Mr. Mohan Parasaran, the ASG of India, on whether the Devas Agreement could \"be annulled by invoking any of the provisions of the contract in order to (i) preserve precious S-band spectrum for strategic requirements of [India] and (ii) to ensure a level playing field for other service providers using terrestrial spectrum.\"154 The ASG issued his Opinion on July 12, 2010 (the \"**Opinion of the ASG**\").155\n\nOpinion of Mr. Mohan Parasaran, Additional Solicitor General of India, to Secretary, Department of Space, July 12, 2010 (the \"**Opinion of the ASG**\"), p. 3 (Ex. R-30/JCB-165).\n\nOpinion of the ASG (Ex. R-30/JCB-165).\n\n136.\n\nThe Opinion of the ASG revisited the background of the Devas Agreement and India's need of the S-band spectrum \"for strategic and societal applications\" of several Indian agencies, including the armed forces and Indian Railways.156 Thereafter, the Opinion of the ASG reviewed the terms of the Devas Agreement to identify \"justifiable or legal grounds existing for [its] termination,\"157 namely Article 11(b) of the Agreement, containing the *force majeure* clause.\n\n*Id*., pp. 1-2.\n\n*Id*., p. 2.\n\n137.\n\nThe Opinion of the ASG concluded that \"any policy taken by the Government of India with regard to allocation and use of S bandwith [sic] [...] would fall within the doctrine of force majeure, as envisaged in the [Devas Agreement],\" and it considered \"more prudent\" that such decision be taken by means of \"a policy decision having the seal and approval of the Cabinet,\" and not by DOT, since \"to disable one of the parties to perform its obligations under the contract, the act must be an act by the governmental authority acting in its sovereign capacity.\"158\n\n*Id*., p. 5.\n\n138.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the Opinion of the ASG suggests that the Respondent was to concoct a *force majeure* event based on a \"policy\" decision having the \"seal and approval of the Cabinet,\"159 and on India's new alleged needs for national strategic requirements for the S-band spectrum that had been allocated to Devas, even though no such need was ever expressed to Devas in its many meetings with India's government agencies and officials.160\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 95-101; Statement of Reply, paras 37(k)-(m).\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 5; Statement of Claim, para. 101.\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants' characterization of the Opinion of the ASG, maintaining that there is no indication that the security reasons motivating the decision were contrived, concocted, engineered or fabricated or that the Devas Agreement should be terminated for commercial reasons. According to the Respondent, the Opinion of the ASG merely reflects the view that the Government of India had the absolute right to terminate the Devas Agreement for legitimate security grounds.161\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 48.\n\n***5. DOS' Note for the CCS and the CCS' Decision to Annul the Devas Agreement***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent explains that, as mandated by the Space Commission in its decisions taken at its July 2, 2010 meeting, the Additional Secretary of the Department of Space, Mr. G. Balachandhran, was asked to review the Suresh Report and provide his comments so that appropriate internal actions could be taken.162\n\n*Id*., para. 50.\n\n141.\n\nMr. Balachandhran issued his report on January 9, 2011 (the \"Balachandhran Report\").163 According to the Balachandhran Report, the allocation of S-band spectrum to Devas under the Devas Agreement would not \"leave enough spectrum for ISRO/DOS use if required\"164 and expressed views that \"[s]trategic and other essential needs of [India] should be the first priority\"165 in any such allocation. In this regard, the Balachandhran Report noted that Antrix had failed to consult with the ICC regarding the national needs of S-band spectrum prior to the conclusion of the Devas Agreement.166 The Balachandhran Report concluded that the termination of the Devas Agreement ordered by the Space Commission \"need[s to] be expedited.\"167\n\n*Report on Dr. Suresh Committee Report on ANTRIX-DEVAS Agreement & Issues Arising From Therein*, Submitted by Mr. G.

The original proposal, which had envisaged development and innovation by some former ISRO scientists, seem to have been diluted with the entry of major foreign players. While technically this was permitted, the entry of foreign telecom companies with huge premiums indicated that they had used this as an opportunity for entering the telecom market, which had in the meanwhile expanded rapidly in India during 2005-10. This was not an intended purpose of the original agreement.\"\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent submits that two further commissions of enquiry reviewed the Devas Agreement.\n\n150.\n\nFirst, following the issuance of the Chaturvedi Report, Mr. K.M. Chandrasekhar of the Cabinet Secretariat was asked to examine its findings and to submit recommendations to DOS, which took the form of a report issued on April 12, 2011 (the \"**Chandrasekhar Report**\").181\n\nReport by Mr. K.M.

C-133/JCB-216).\n\n154.\n\nOn February 25, 2011, Antrix issued a letter to Devas giving notice of termination of the Devas Agreement.187\n\nLetter from Antrix (Madhusudhan) to Devas, February 25, 2011 (Ex. C-135/JCB-223).\n\n155.\n\nIn response, Devas objected to the validity of the termination notice188 and attempted, unsuccessfully, to hold \"senior management\" consultations in conformity with the pre-dispute procedures in Article 20 of the Devas Agreement.189\n\n*Id.*\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 130; Statement of Defence, para. 60.\n\n156.\n\nOn April 15, 2011, Antrix tendered Devas a check for the INR equivalent of USD 13 million as reimbursement of the upfront capacity reservation fees that Devas had already paid to Antrix pursuant to Article 7(c) of the Devas Agreement.190 In a matter of days, Devas returned Antrix's check, arguing that Antrix had failed to state a proper basis for terminating the Devas Agreement and that the events allegedly giving rise to Antrix's claim of *force majeure* were self-induced.191\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 131; Letter from Antrix (Madhushudhana) to Devas, April 15, 2011 (Ex.

The Satellites***\n-----------------------\n\n158.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, DOS has made alterations to the two satellites to conform them to defence needs,194 and the GSAT-6 satellite was scheduled to be launched at the end of 2014.195 A successful launch was achieved on August 27, 2015.196\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 74; Anand I, para. 24.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 23; Supplemental Witness Statement of Mr. K. Sethuraman, dated June 30, 2014, paras 11-12 (\"**Sethuraman II**\"); Transcript, Day 4, 847:14-848-11.\n\nPress reports submitted by the Respondent on August 31, 2015.\n\n159.\n\nOn August 31, 2015, the Respondent submitted a set of documents in connection with the launch of the GSAT-6 satellite. The documents consist of five newspaper articles and a note from Mr. V.K. Pant, Assistant Wireless Adviser, in DOT. The articles refer to the launch of a military satellite but simultaneously indicate that the satellite is utilized to serve the \"strategic sector\" and \"various government purposes\". The note contains an extract of the document issued by the Cabinet to the Ministry of Defence on March 12, 2015 which reads: \"The band segments (a) 2500-2635 MHz (35MHz) (b) 2555-2535 MHz (80 MHz) and (c) 2655-2690 MHz (35 MHz) will be used for Defence, security and societal applications.\"\n\n160.\n\nThe Respondent further submitted an article published by the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses on October 5, 2015 which, according to the Respondent, \"reviewed the launch and its significance for the military.\"\n\n***3. Related Arbitration Proceedings***\n----------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nAs noted above, on June 29, 2011 Devas commenced an arbitration under the ICC rules pursuant to Article 20 of the Devas Agreement, captioned *Devas Multimedia (Private) Limited v. Antrix Corp. Ltd.* (No. 18051/CYK), in which Devas sought both specific performance of the Devas Agreement and/or damages.197 On 14 September 2015, a final award was issued in this Arbitration, which was communicated, by agreement of the Parties, to the present Tribunal on October 2, 2015. Under that award, Antrix was ordered to pay USD 562.5 million to Devas Multimedia Private Limited for damages caused by Antrix's wrongful repudiation of the Devas Agreement, plus interest.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras 7, 51-55; Statement of Claim, para. 146; Statement of Defence, para. 61.\n\n162.\n\nThe Respondent also notes that DT Asia (Devas' other major shareholder together with the Claimants) has instituted a third arbitration against India arising out of the same facts but under the bilateral investment treaty between Germany and India.198\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 4, fn. 3.\n\n163.\n\nPursuant to mutual agreement, the Parties made simultaneous submissions on October 9 and 19, 2015 as to what significance, if any, the ICC final award might have on the deliberations of this Tribunal. While drawing different conclusions from various parts of the ICC award, both Parties recognized that the two arbitrations involve distinct claims, parties, and remedies.\n\n164.\n\nReference was made by the Claimants to the final award of the ICSID tribunal in *Mobil v. Venezuela*.199 In that instance, one of the claimants, Mobil Cerro Negro, had brought separate ICC proceedings against two State-owned companies, under one of their agreements providing for indemnity in the event of certain alleged discriminatory government measures.\n\n*Venezuela Holdings B.V. et al* (case formerly known as *Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, B.V., Mobil Cerro Negro Holding, Ltd., Mobil Venezolana de Petroles Holdings, Inc., Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd., and Mobil Venezolana de Petroles Inc.*) *v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Award, 2014.\n\n165.\n\nWhen considering the effects of the prior ICC arbitration, the ICSID tribunal observed:\n\nIt is clear that the ICC Award and the present case concern the liability of different parties under different normative regimes. The State was not a party to the ICC arbitration. Neither are PDVSA and PDVSA-CN parties to this case. These proceedings concern the responsibility of the State for breach of the Treaty and international law, a matter that was not (and could not) have been resolved by the ICC tribunal, which jurisdiction was limited to the contractual dispute.200\n\n*Id.*, para. 216\n\n166.\n\nSimilarly, in the present case, there are major differences with the ICC case. First of all, the parties are different; neither Devas Multimedia (Private) Limited (the claimant in the ICC case) nor Antrix (the respondent) are parties to this case. Secondly, the proceedings in this case relate to the responsibility of the State of India for alleged breaches of the Treaty and international law, while the ICC tribunal was strictly concerned with Antrix's contractual liability under the Agreement. It dealt more specifically with the actions of Dr. Radhakrishnan in his capacity as Chairman of Antrix. It also referred to some of his activities in his other functions. In that respect, it considered some of the same facts as those submitted to this Tribunal; in fact, the Tribunal was informed by the Claimants in their response of October 19, 2015 that, during the ICC proceedings, the Respondent had provided the tribunal with the whole transcript of the hearing in this case. However, what this Tribunal is called upon to address is not whether Antrix breached its contractual obligations but whether the State of India, acting in its sovereign capacity and through the appropriate authority, properly invoked the protection of its essential security interests when it decided to annul the Devas Agreement or whether, in doing so, it breached its obligations under the Treaty and international law. This is the issue which this Tribunal will be addressing in the rest of this award. While the Tribunal should \"attempt to avoid inconsistent outcomes whenever possible,\"201 one can readily conceive situations where Antrix's liability would be incurred under the Agreement and some where the Respondent's would be exempt of liability under the Treaty and *vice-versa*.\n\n*Id.*, para. 217\n\n**CHAPTER IV REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Tribunal issue an award:\n\n(a) Declaring that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over all of Claimants' claims;\n\n(b) Declaring that Respondent has unlawfully expropriated Claimants' investments, in breach of Articles 6 and 7 of the Mauritius-India BIT;\n\n(c) Declaring that Respondent has failed to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants' investments, in violation of Article 4(1) of the Mauritius-India BIT;\n\n(d) Declaring that Respondent has engaged in unreasonable and/or discriminatory measures with respect to Claimants' investments, in violation of Article 4(1) of the Mauritius-India BIT;\n\n(e) Declaring that Respondent has failed to provide full legal protection and security with respect to Claimants' investments, in violation of the \"most favored nation\" provisions of Articles 4(2) and 4(3) of the Mauritius-India BIT, which incorporate Article 3(2) of the Serbia-India BIT;\n\n(f) Declaring that Respondent is liable to pay the costs of these proceedings to date; and\n\n(g) Ordering that these proceedings continue for the purposes of determining the reparations due to Claimants, including a determination of the damages owed to Claimants, and the allocation of costs and other matters related to quantum.202\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 229; Statement of Reply, para. 188.\n\n168.\n\nThe Respondent requests that \"all claims raised by [the] Claimants should be dismissed and all costs arising of this proceeding should be assessed against [the] Claimants.\"203\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 173; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 145.\n\n169.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent raises a series of objections to the Tribunal's consideration of the merits of the Parties' dispute. First, the Claimants' alleged investments fail to meet the definition of an investment under the Treaty and constitute \"pre-investment\" activities that are not protected by the Treaty. Secondly, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims in this case by operation of the \"essential security interests\" (\"**ESI**\") provision of the Treaty. The Claimants reject all of these objections and submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over its claims.\n\n**CHAPTER V - THE MEANING OF \"INVESTMENT\" FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE TREATY**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n170.\n\nArticle 1(1)(a) of the Treaty defines an \"investment\" as \"every kind of asset established or acquired under the relevant laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made.\" Moreover, Article 2 of the Treaty restricts the scope of the Treaty to \"investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, accepted as such in accordance with its laws and regulations.\"\n\n***1. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nThe Respondent's primary contention is that this case \"only involves pre-investment activities that are outside the scope of protection afforded by the [Treaty].\"204 In support, the Respondent relies on the \"admission clause model\" adopted in its BITs, which only extends protection to \"assets invested and admitted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host State,\" and not to \"pre-investment activities,\"205 and advances authorities to that effect.206\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 90; *See* generally Transcript, Day 1, 167:15-174:7.

R-60).\n\n172.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Devas Agreement is clear that certain essential governmental licences and approvals were prerequisites to the project, including the orbital slot frequency allocation for the satellites and the WPC License.207 Accordingly, Devas' failure to apply for the WPC License rendered all activities conducted by Devas as being properly characterized as \"pre-investments.\"208\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 98; *See* Devas Agreement, Articles 3(c), 12(b)(vii) (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 98.\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the WPC, the body within DOT from which, it says, Devas would have been required to seek its operating license and frequency allocation (the \"**WPC License**\").209 According to the Respondent, the policy decision of the CCS not only meant that the Devas Agreement would be terminated, but it also left no doubt that no license could be issued to Devas to operate the Devas System and therefore Devas would be unable to obtain the requisite licenses under the Devas Agreement.210\n\n*Id*., para. 39; Anand I, paras 8-11 (*see supra*, para. 120).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 62.\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent focuses on a terrestrial spectrum license to be issued by the WPC.211 In this regard, the Respondent refers to Devas' Statement of Claim in the ICC arbitration, wherein Devas acknowledges that it \"fully expected that it would be granted a [WPC License] once the GSAT-6 satellite had been launched,\" that Devas was preparing a license application to the WPC and that Devas \"was [...] in a position to submit this application just as soon as the satellite launch date and vehicle were identified by ISRO.\"212\n\nThe Respondent submits that this is an undisputed material fact in this case; *See* Transcript, Day 1, 121:7123:14; Day 5, 1276:15-1277:18.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 63, referring to *Devas Multimedia Private Limited v. Antrix Corporation Limited*, ICC Case No. 18051/CYK; Claimant's Statement of Claim, February 20, 2012, paras 93-95 (Ex. R-2).\n\n175.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent argues that any preparatory steps cannot be equated with the grant of a license, which Devas needed, did not have, and had no legal right to obtain, as it was for the Government of India to determine whether a license could be issued.213\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 64; Sethuraman II, para. 22.\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Statement of Claim plainly demonstrates Devas' awareness that it had no right to obtain the WPC License.214 The Respondent claims that Devas was deliberately deferring the submission of its WPC License application until after the satellites were launched in order to place itself in the position of being the only alternative, \"as a practical matter,\" capable of using the S-band spectrum allocated to it.215 Devas would have then been in a position to force the Government of India (i.e. the TRAI) to change its policy216 regarding BSS, which would have been necessary to obtain the specific WPC License for BSS that Devas needed in order to provide Devas Services.217\n\nStatement of Defence, paras 65-66, referring to Statement of Claim, para. 102, which reads: \"Immediately upon launch of PS1, Devas would have been in a position to commence its A/V broadcasting. In addition, Devas (as the only entity with the right to lease transponder capacity on that satellite, or to use the 70 MHz of S-Band spectrum allocated to it in the Devas Agreement) would, immediately upon launch of PS1, have filed for a WPC license. As the sole holder of the Leased Capacity, as a practical matter, Devas was the only operator capable of using the S-band allocated to it, and because Antrix had promised to assist in obtaining any needed governmental license necessary for the Devas System, Devas had every reason to expect to obtain a WPC license promptly, and, indeed, expected to receive such license for a nominal fee.\" (emphasis by the Respondent).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 66.\n\nIn particular, the NFAP of India (*see infra*, fn. 391).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 66, fn. 161; Sethuraman I, paras 4, 6-10, Transcript, Day 5, 1258:18-1265:13.\n\n177.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, other items in the record also demonstrated Devas' knowledge that it had no acquired right to obtain the WPC License.218 First, the negotiating history of the Devas Agreement shows that Antrix went from being required to obtain \"clearances, licenses, and other approvals\" for \"frequency allocation\" (including terrestrial augmentation) in the Term Sheet,219 to providing \"appropriate technical assistance... on a best efforts basis\" in the Devas Agreement.220 Also, Devas itself acknowledged that ISRO's support would be critical in the license application,221 which suggests that obtaining such authorization was not a matter of certainty.222\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras 26-27.\n\nE-mail from Forge Advisors to Antrix and ISRO, September 20, 2004, with attached \"binding term sheet,\" para. 1.3.2 (Ex.

R-4/JCB-271).\n\n179.\n\nAlso, the Respondent alleges that, under a long-standing TRAI policy, new terrestrial services such as those proposed by Devas would have been subjected to review and analysis by the TRAI. Moreover, other stakeholders would have been notified and given an opportunity to comment,225 including the terrestrial operators of telecommunication services who, as conceded by the Claimants, had been clamoring for more spectrum\u2014including the S-band\u2014for the expansion of their services.226\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 28.\n\n*Id*., para. 28.\n\n180.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' argument that, had the satellites been launched, and assuming that the Devas Agreement had not been annulled, terrestrial operators would not have been able to use the S-band frequencies that Devas would have been using for its space-to-earth transmissions because of interference.227 In Mr. Sethuraman's words:\n\nIf Devas was using a 10 MHz segment of S-band, say 2560-2570 MHz, in a particular region for space-to-earth transmissions, a terrestrial operator could certainly use a different 10 MHz segment (as in the CGC of the Devas system), say 2600-2610 MHz, in the same region. So long as there is enough of a separation between the frequencies, interference is not an issue for diverse services. It is only if Devas had been using these two 10 MHz segments in the region, the first for space-to-earth transmissions and the second in its CGC, that terrestrial operators could be \"'boxed-out' of that spectrum,\" as Mr. Parsons claims.228\n\nSethuraman I, para. 10.\n\n*Id*., para. 10, referring to Parsons I, para. 18.\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent denies that Devas could have rolled out any satellite-based service without the WPC License.229 According to the Respondent, Mr. Sethuraman detailed during the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, how, even on the basis of the ISP and IPTV licenses, Devas would still have required additional licenses or additional telecommunications media to provide any kind of service,230 and how, in any event, obtaining the WPC License would have been the last step of a well-structured process that Devas still had to follow.231 For instance, the ISP License makes clear that it could not prevail over national security concerns, and that its effectiveness would be subject to any government regulation on satellite communication policy.232\n\nTranscript, Day 5, 1212:16-24; 1213: 21-25.\n\nTranscript, Day 4, 867:10-869:13.\n\n*Id*., 869:18-870:14; *See also* Transcript, Day 5, 1260:19-1266:6; Letter from Respondent to Claimants, February 3, 2014 (Ex.

The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent misconstrues both Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty and fails to take into account the actual facts concerning the Claimants' investments.236 The Claimants argue that \"the facts show that the investments indeed were admitted in accordance with Indian law.\"237\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 108; *See* generally Transcript, Day 5, 1142:19-1147-24.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 108.\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimants recall that the relevant \"investments\" comprise their respective shareholding interests in Devas; and partial indirect ownership of Devas' business assets.238 In arguing that their shareholding interests qualified as \"investments\" falling within the scope of Articles 1 and 2, the Claimants rely on the general and specific definitions of \"investment\" pursuant to Article 1(a)(1) and the prior approval obtained from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board as evidencing acceptance \"in accordance with [India's] laws and regulations.\"239 On the Claimants' submission, the statement in Article 2 of the Treaty that an investment must be \"accepted as such\" under Indian law means only that the investment must comply with laws governing admission of foreign investments.240\n\nStatement of Claim, para.156; Statement of Reply, para. 109.\n\n*Id*., para. 110.\n\n*Id*., para. 110, fn. 212; *See,* for instance, *Churchill Mining PLC v.

Yemen*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award, 2008, paras 92, 102, 104 (Ex. CL-7)\n\n185.\n\nTurning to the indirect ownership of Devas' assets, the Claimants' assert that the contractual rights under the Devas Agreement and the proprietary Devas System satisfy the general and specific definitions of \"investment\" contained in Article 1(a)(1).241 The Claimants do not dispute the need for a license from the WPC in order for Devas to operate the terrestrial portion of the hybrid Devas System.242 However, the Claimants reject India's attempt to characterize its activities as \"preinvestment\" by reference to the approvals obtained from DOS officials and the Shankara Committee and confirmation by Antrix dated February 2, 2006, that ISRO had the \"necessary approval for building, launching and leasing the capacity of S-band satellite.\"243\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 111; *See*, for instance, *Fedax N.V. v.

C-24/JCB-51).\n\n186.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the record shows that India\u2014including through Antrix, DOS, ISRO and the WPC\u2014had consistently and proactively supported the Devas Agreement and System for approximately six years. Had India continued to deliver on Antrix's commitment, the Claimants consider it inconceivable that the WPC License would not have been granted.244 In this regard, the Claimants point out that Devas started preparing its application for the Licence; however it did not receive any answer.245 Relevantly, the Claimants point to the obligation of DOS/ISRO/Antrix to provide technical assistance under the Devas Agreement, which included jointly approaching the WPC with Devas when applying for this license.246\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 62; Reply Witness Statement of D.

Moreover, the Claimants expected that such license would be issued to Devas for a reasonable fee in line with international norms that had by then been established in other countries.254\n\nParsons I, para. 24.\n\n*Id*., para. 29; *See also* Transcript, Day 2, 420:24- 425:21.\n\n189.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants do not accept that the auction rule applicable to the allocation of terrestrial spectrum would be indiscriminately applied to satellite spectrum that is used terrestrially since the two types of spectrum are not comparable.255 In particular, the potential for interference as a result of uncoordinated spectrum use would not have been completely disregarded. Devas' terrestrial re-use of the allocated S-band satellite spectrum would have \"boxed-out\" any other potential user of terrestrial S-band spectrum.256 In such circumstances, the Claimants submit, the reality is that an auction of S-band terrestrial spectrum would have been moot as Devas would have been the sole bidder and operator capable of using the relevant portion of S-band satellite.257\n\nTranscript, Day 5, 1172:9-24.\n\nParsons I, para. 18; Reply Witness Statement of Gary Parsons, dated March 14, 2014, paras 4-13 (\"**Parsons II**\").\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 421:25-423:12; Day 5, 1172:3-24.\n\n190.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that, even if Devas had not obtained the WPC License, it still had an absolute right to receive the Leased Capacity from the ISRO satellites under the Devas Agreement.258 Upon launching the satellites, Devas would have been in a position to roll out satellite-only services, therefore providing the very societal applications proposed by India.259\n\n*Id*., 1116:21-1117:9.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, Testimony of Mr. Vishwanathan, 307:12-309:2 (referring to Ex.

According to the Claimants, the services that they refer to are satellite-based services which fall under the provision of the ISP license that Devas had already received, including streaming video and audio services.\n\n191.\n\nAll this shows, the Claimants submit, that Devas had secured a binding contract, obtained capital and was established as a company in India at all relevant times from 2005 to 2011.260\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 114.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address this threshold question to determine whether it has jurisdiction over the present dispute between the Parties.\n\n***1. The Devas Agreement***\n----------------------------\n\n193.\n\nThere is no disagreement between the Parties with regard to the fact that the Devas Agreement was concluded on January 25, 2005,261 nor with regards to the fact that, at the Respondent's insistence, the Agreement was signed by Antrix, \"the marketing arm of [the] Department of Space and [...] the entity through which ISRO engages in commercial activities.\"262 Under the Agreement, a number of approvals and licenses had to be obtained in part by Devas and in part by Antrix.\n\nDevas Agreement (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\n*Id*., p. 1.\n\n194.\n\nThe Respondent argues that no governmental body was party to the Agreement or gave any commitment to grant the necessary approvals and licenses required under the Agreement.263 In its view, as long as the WPC License was not obtained, the only recourses that the Claimants might have were the ones against Antrix provided for under the Agreement.264\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 8.\n\n*Id*., para. 98.\n\n195.\n\nThe present case is not a recourse against Antrix but a recourse against the State of India for alleged breaches of the applicable Treaty. It is under the provisions of that Treaty that the Tribunal must determine whether the Claimants qualify as investors.\n\n***2. Investment Under the Treaty***\n------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nThe question that the Tribunal has to address is a double-barreled one. It is whether the Claimants are investors under the Treaty and, if so, whether they have made qualifying investments under it.\n\n197.\n\nThe Respondent does not dispute that the Claimants are \"investors\" as defined under Article 1(1)(b) of the Treaty, being corporations \"incorporated or constituted in accordance with the law of [a] Contracting Party,\" i.e. Mauritius.\n\n198.\n\nThe disagreement between the Parties is whether the dispute is in relation to an investment as defined in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty. This Article, as in many other investment protection treaties, contains a very broad definition of \"investment.\" It covers:\n\nevery kind of assets established or acquired under the relevant laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made, and, in particular, though not exclusively, includes:\n\n(i) movable and immovable property as well as other rights in rem such as mortgages, liens or pledges;\n\n(ii) shares, debentures and other form of participation in a company;\n\n(iii) claims to money, or to any performance under contract having an economic value;\n\n(iv) intellectual property rights, goodwill, technical processes, know-how, copyrights, trademarks, trade-names and patents in accordance with the relevant laws of the respective Contracting Parties;\n\n(v) business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including any concessions to search for, extract or exploit natural resources.\n\n199.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with the Respondent's contention that this case \"only involves preinvestment activities that are outside the scope of protection afforded by [the Treaty].\"\n\n200.\n\nFirst, the Claimants' \"shares, debentures and any other form of participation\" in Devas and their indirect partial ownership of Devas business assets are assets \"established or acquired under the relevant laws and regulations\" of the Respondent. The Claimants received the approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board prior to their share subscriptions.265 Moreover, the Tribunal has received no evidence to the effect that the Claimants' investment was not properly made \"under the relevant laws and regulations.\"\n\n*See* Statement of Claim, para. 36; Amendment No. 5 to FIPB approval No. FC.II. 107(2006)/43(2006), September 29, 2009 (Ex. C-82/JCB-124); FIPB approval No. FC II. 107(2006)/43(2006) from the Department of Economic Affairs, Indian Ministry of Finance to Devas, May 18, 2006 (Ex. C-33); Amendment No. 1 to FIPB approval No. FC.II. 107(2006)/43(2006), May 19, 2008 (Ex. C-49/JCB-85); Amendment No. 2 to FIPB approval No. FC.II. 107(2006)/43(2006), August 7, 2008 (Ex. C-51/JCB-87); Amendment No. 3 to FIPB approval No. FC.II. 107(2006)/43(2006), October 28, 2008 (Ex. C-55); Amendment No. 4 to FIPB approval No. FC.II. 107(2006)/43(2006), December 17, 2009 (Ex. C-78/JCB-114).\n\n201.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal finds deficient the Respondent's argument that the Claimants' activities were \"only pre-investment activities\" because their investment was the alleged right to proceed with the Devas project pursuant to the Devas Agreement and because said project could not proceed without the WPC License, which Devas had no right to receive under the Devas Agreement.266\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 98; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 26.\n\n202.\n\nThe Devas Agreement was a valid contract between Devas and Antrix, a State-owned commercial corporation. It provided that Antrix was leasing to Devas space segment capacity on ISRO/Antrix S-band spacecraft. That leased capacity was on a non-pre-emptible basis, which meant that it could not be \"utilized or repurposed for use by another party during life of the satellite and when this Agreement is effective and when Devas is not in default of its obligations or payments.\"267\n\nDevas Agreement, p. 20 (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\n203.\n\nThe Agreement spelled out, among other provisions, the period of the lease and its terms and conditions, the contributions to be made as well as the circumstances and consequences of termination by each party, including in the case of *force majeure*. It also provided that it would become effective \"on the date that ANTRIX is in receipt of all required approvals and communicates to DEVAS in writing regarding the same.\"268\n\n*Id*., p. 17.\n\n204.\n\nOn February 2, 2006, Antrix informed Devas that \"it has received the necessary approval for building, launching and leasing capacity of S-band satellite, henceforth designated as INSAT-4E,\" adding that it \"is now in a position to go ahead with the building and launch of the INSAT 4-E spacecraft and lease the capacity on the same to Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd, as per Agreement No. Antrix/2003/DEVAS/2005 dated 28 January 2005.\"269 The Agreement thereby became effective on February 2, 2006.\n\nLetter from Antrix (Murthi) to Devas (Viswanathan), February 2, 2006 (Ex. C-24/JCB-51).\n\n205.\n\nUnder the Agreement, the Claimants had to pay Upfront Capacity Reservation fees for the first and the second satellites. They paid the first instalments as per the Agreement on June 21, 2006 for the first satellite (GSAT-6)270 and on June 18, 2007271 for the second satellite (GSAT-6A); these payments represented a total of about USD 13 million.\n\nReceipt for Payment of First Installment of Upfront Capacity Reservation Fee from Devas to Antrix, June 21, 2006 (Ex. C-35/JCB-61).\n\nReceipt for Payment of First Installment of Upfront Capacity Reservation Fee for PS2 from Devas to Antrix, June 18, 2007 (Ex. C-40/JCB-70)\n\n206.\n\nThe Agreement also provided that Antrix was responsible for obtaining certain governmental authorizations272 (which it did) and that Devas was responsible for obtaining others, with best effort support from Antrix273 (which it obtained for two licenses but did not reach the point of obtaining the third). But there is nothing in the Agreement which makes its validity dependent on Devas obtaining such permits, and at no time during the course of the Agreement or at the time of its annulment by Antrix was it argued by Antrix or any governmental authority that it was not in full effect. The non-issuance of a governmental license may pertain to the quantum of damages that may be claimed against the Respondent, if there was a breach of the Treaty, but it does not pertain to the validity of the Agreement or whether an investment was made by the Claimants.\n\nDevas Agreement, Article 12(a)(ii) (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).\n\n*Id*., Article 3(c).\n\n207.\n\nThe lease was binding on both Antrix and Devas and, by itself, it was an investment with significant value as was shown by the additional investment of some US$ 75 million in March 2008.274\n\nShare Subscription Agreement between Devas and DT Asia, March 19, 2008 (Ex. C-45/JCB-81); Viswanathan I, para. 108, Singh I, para. 50.\n\n208.\n\nIt has been established that the Claimants made significant investments in time and money in Devas and that Devas honoured its obligations under the Agreement until its annulment by Antrix, including the payment of Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees of some US$ 13 million.\n\n209.\n\nAs to the Respondent's argument that the Claimants had no acquired right to obtain the WPC License and that they had no guarantee that they would obtain such license, it is a matter that does not go to the definition of investment for jurisdictional purpose but rather to the value of that investment. On the basis of the evidence received by the Tribunal, it is satisfied that, even without a WPC license, Devas could have rolled out satellite-only services. The Tribunal also notes that it has been satisfactorily established that, because of problems of interference, it would not have been possible for competing services to operate in the same spectrum. The lack of a WPC license would be a matter to be considered when deciding on the quantum of damages, if the Respondent is found in breach of the Treaty.\n\n210.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that not only were the Claimants qualified investors under Article 1(1)(b) of the Treaty but that they also made qualifying investments under Article 1(1)(a) of that Treaty.\n\n**CHAPTER VI - THE \"ESSENTIAL SECURITY INTERESTS\" PROVISION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 11(3) OF THE TREATY IN CONTEXT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nArticle 11(3) of the Treaty provides:\n\nThe provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way limit the right of either Contracting Party to apply prohibitions or restrictions of any kind or take any other action which is directed to the protection of its essential security interests, or to the protection of public health or the prevention of diseases in pests or animals or plants.\n\n212.\n\nThe Respondent's defence in this case rests on the \"essential security interests\" of the State, as defined in this Article. The Parties have raised both legal and factual issues in connection with this defence and before analyzing the facts relating to this issue, the Tribunal will first set out its views on the legal interpretation to be given to Article 11(3) of the Treaty and other matters raised by the Claimants relating to Articles 11(1) and 11(4), which can be summarized in the following questions:\n\n(a) What constitutes \"essential security interests\"?\n\n(b) Does Article 11(1) of the Treaty allow for the introduction of customary international law restrictions imposed on a state of necessity defence?\n\n(c) Can the Claimant invoke Article 11(4) of the Treaty?\n\n(d) Does Article 11(3) preclude an entitlement to compensation?\n\n***1. What Constitutes \"Essential Security Interests\"?***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Can \"Essential Security Interests\" Be Construed as a Matter of Selfjudgment by the Respondent?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Respondent's Position\n----------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 11(3) of the Treaty is of \"central importance [...] on the facts of this case\"275 as it entitles India \"to take measures directed to the protection of its essential security interests without incurring responsibility under any substantive provision of the [...] Treaty otherwise providing protection to investors.\"276\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 76.\n\n*Id*., para. 76.\n\n214.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the Tribunal may only examine whether a measure is related to national security matters. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal may not \"sit as a supranational regulatory or policy-making body to review the policy decisions of the Cabinet Committee on Security\" as national authorities \"are uniquely positioned to determine what constitutes a State's essential security interests in any particular circumstance and what measures should be adopted to safeguard those interests.\"277\n\n*See Id*., paras 78-83; Rejoinder, para. 34.\n\n215.\n\nThe Respondent refers to an UNCTAD study on a clause of the Peru-Singapore investment treaty which contains language identical to Article 11(3) of the Mauritius-India BIT. That study considers that this provision \"establishes objective conditions for invoking the (security) exception, (but its) practical effect comes very close to a self-judging clause.\"278\n\nUNCTAD, The Protection of national security in II As, UNCTAD Series on International Investment Policies for Development, 2009, pp. 94-95 (Ex. R-168).\n\nii. The Claimants' Position\n---------------------------\n\n216.\n\nThe Claimants do not accept India's argument, which is premised on a characterization of Article 11(3) of the Treaty as \"self-judging,\"279 by reference to the consistent and emphatic rejection of this notion by the International Court of Justice,280 and universally reaffirmed by arbitral tribunals.281\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 66.\n\nStatement of Reply, paras 67-73. *See, inter alia, Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 392, paras 221-22; *Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1996, p. 803, para. 20; *Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Judgment, I.C.J.

CL-11).\n\n217.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants submit that the language of this provision affords no basis for inferring that its application is self-judging. Such an application, according to the Claimants, requires \"clear and specific language,\"282 which is notably absent in the present case.\n\nStatement of Reply, paras 75-76.\n\niii. The Tribunal's Analysis\n----------------------------\n\n218.\n\nThis first question can be disposed of quickly in this case as the Respondent itself has stated that it is not arguing that \"India (or Peru, or any other State having a treaty with a similar provision [to Article 11(3) of the Treaty]) can dismiss any case simply by saying that it considers the actions forming the basis of the claim to be in its 'essential security interests.'\"283\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 36.\n\n219.\n\nIndeed, it is well established by judgments of the International Court of Justice (the \"**ICJ**\")284 and investment arbitration awards285 that, unless a treaty contains specific wording granting full discretion to the State to determine what it considers necessary for the protection of its security interests,286 national security clauses are not self-judging. Turning to the text of Article 11(3) of the Treaty, it plainly does not contain any explicit language that the Tribunal would regard as granting discretion of that nature to the State.\n\n*Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* (Nicaragua v. United States of America), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1984, p. 392, para. 282; *Oil Platforms* (Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America), Judgment, I.C.J.

CL-11).\n\nSelf-judging \"essential security interests\" provisions are far from being unknown in international law. *See*, for instance, Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947 (\"**GATT**\"): \"Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed: (a) to require any contracting party to furnish any information the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests ; or (b) to prevent any contracting party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.\" (emphasis added); Article 6.12 of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement between the Republic Of India and the Republic of Singapore, signed on June 29, 2005: \"1. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed: (a) to require a Party to furnish any information, the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests ; or (b) to prevent a Party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.\" (emphasis added); Article 18 of the Treaty between The United States of America and The Oriental Republic of Uruguay Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, signed on November 4, 2005: \"Nothing in this Treaty shall be construed: 1. to require a Party to furnish or allow access to any information the disclosure of which it determines to be contrary to its essential security interests; or 2. to preclude a Party from applying measures that it considers necessary for the fulfilment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests\" (emphasis added); Article 18 of the Treaty between The Government of The United States of America and The Government of The Republic of Rwanda Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, signed on February 19, 2008: \"Nothing in this Treaty shall be construed: 1. to require a Party to furnish or allow access to any information the disclosure of whic h it determines to be contrary to its essential security interests ; or 2. to preclude a Party from applying measures that it considers necessary for the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests\" (emphasis added).\n\n220.\n\nHowever, while the Parties agree that the Tribunal may examine whether the preconditions to invoke the essential security clause have been met, they disagree as to the meaning or content of the preconditions laid down in the clause. The Tribunal must therefore address the following question.\n\n**b. What Conditions Must the Respondent Meet to Show that its Measures Were \"Directed to the Protection of its Essential Security Interests\"?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Respondent's Position\n----------------------------\n\n221.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the determinations by national authorities as to what constitutes \"essential security interests\" should be afforded \"a wide measure of deference\"287\u2014a view that it says is supported by commentators and international jurisprudence.288 Essentially, the Respondent cautions against \"second-guessing\" by international tribunals of national security determinations made by national authorities.289 The Respondent refers again, in that respect, to the UNCTAD study on the Peru-Singapore investment and notes that \"only in extreme cases will an arbitral tribunal conclude that the host country measure has no relation whatsoever to the national security interests of a party.\"290\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 78.\n\n*Id*., paras 78-82; *See, inter alia, Recent Cases on \"Automatic\" Reservations to the Optional Clause*, Robert Y.

R-168).\n\n222.\n\nIn the present case, the Respondent contends that the policy decision of the CCS, in its capacity as the highest authority in India for matters of internal and external security and defence, takes into consideration the growing demands of the Indian military for S-band capacity, which undoubtedly form part of the Respondent's essential security interests.291 Furthermore, the Respondent refers to the express terms of the decision of the CCS and the extensive record, which plainly reflect the strategic needs for spectrum capacity.292 Moreover, the fact that the Claimants were not included in the national security deliberations, of which the Claimants complain, is not significant given the sensitive nature of such issues.293\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 84.\n\n*Id*., paras 39-61, 84.\n\n*Id*., para. 85.\n\n223.\n\nThe Respondent criticizes the Claimants' failure to engage directly on this provision and characterizes its only submission as a suggestion that the Tribunal \"disregard all [...] evidence and hold that the entire national security establishment of the Government acted in bad faith and with no motive other than to cause damage to Devas and its shareholders.\"294 Such an argument, the Respondent contends, \"cannot be countenanced under well-established principles of both Indian and international law.\"295\n\n*Id*., paras 86-88.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 38.\n\nii. The Claimants' Position\n---------------------------\n\n224.\n\nGiven that India's claim to essential security is not self-judging, the Claimants submit that an international tribunal has the power to conduct \"an objective inquiry into whether an essential security clause was validly invoked and whether its conditions are satisfied.\"296 The Claimants do not accept that India has made out the requisite elements by reference to the evidentiary record, which has not established that the measures were \"directed at ***any*** security interest\"297 and, in any event, the \"disproportionate and gratuitous nature\" of these measures \"fails to meet the standard of necessity observed by customary international law.\"298\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 80.\n\n*Id*., paras 89-90 (emphasis by the Claimants).\n\n*Id*., paras 91-96; *See* generally Transcript, Day 5, 1188:14-1190:18.\n\n225.\n\nAs to the Claimants, they consider that two objective preconditions need to be fulfilled for the essential security clause to be triggered.\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal must first verify whether a measure was aimed at the protection of the Respondent's security interests. In their view, the measure must be specifically directed at the State's essential security interests.299\n\n\u2022 Additionally, the Claimants construe a requirement of necessity from the words \"essential security interests.\" In other words, the Tribunal must verify that the security interest in question is so \"vital... absolutely necessary; extremely important\" that protection must be warranted, and that such interest is actually under a threat that warranted the asserted measures of protection.300\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 84.\n\n*Id*., para. 85.\n\n226.\n\nThe Claimants engage in a word-by-word analysis of the essential security clause to define the meaning of the objective conditions that are required to invoke the security exception.\n\n227.\n\nFirst, according the Claimants, the use of the words \"directed to\" in the Article 11(3) implies that the Respondent's measures in question must have been \"aimed at the protection of India's security interests.\" Measures that are not actually directed at the protection of such interests do not qualify.301\n\n*Id*., para. 84.\n\n228.\n\nSecond, the use of the word \"essential\" implies that the security interest in question must be so \"vital.absolutely necessary; extremely important\" such that protection is warranted. According to the Claimants, the literal meaning of the term \"essential\" is \"important.absolutely necessary, indispensably requisite.unavoidable;\"302 The Claimants invoke several legal authorities in support of this statement, including the following:\n\n\u2022 In the *Nicaragua* case, it had been claimed that the various actions directed against the Nicaraguan government were justified on \"essential security\" grounds. Rejecting this claim, the ICJ held that:\n\nNo evidence at all is available to show how Nicaraguan policies had in fact become a threat to \"essential security interests\" in May 1985, when those policies had been consistent, and consistently criticized by the United States, for four years previously, the Court is unable to find that the \"embargo\" was necessary to protect those interests.303\n\n\u2022 In a similar vein, the Claimants rely on the *Oil Platforms*304 and the *Total v. Argentina*305 cases to argue that the nature of the security interest to be protected must be \"absolutely necessary, extremely important,\" and that such interest was actually under a \"threat\" that warranted the asserted measures of \"protection.\"306\n\n\u2022 Finally, the Claimants argue that, in any event, the customary standard of necessity appearing in Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility adopted by the International Law Commission (the \"**ILC Articles**\") applies to Article 11(3) of the Treaty by operation of Article 11(1).307 In the Claimants' view, there exists in customary international law a regime governing the same issue dealt with by Article 11(3), i.e. the extent to which a State may respond to the alleged threats to the \"essential interests\" of the State. And, if these customary rules impose a \"stricter\" set of requirements on the host State, then the customary rules also qualify under Article 11(1) because they afford the Claimants treatment more favourable than that provided for by Article 11(3).\n\n*Id*., fn.174, citing, *inter alia,* Oxford English Dictionary (2014).\n\n*Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* (Nicaragua v.

The Tribunal's Analysis\n----------------------------\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal faces two distinct issues. The first issue concerns the interpretation of the terms of Article 11(3) of the Treaty, which vies to determine the exact conditions that are required by this provision to trigger an \"essential security interests\" exception, including in particular, whether Article 11(3) includes a requirement of necessity to display its effects. A separate question concerns whether the standard of necessity under customary international may apply, regardless of the terms of the Treaty, in invoking the \"essential security interests\" clause.\n\n230.\n\nAs to the first issue, the Tribunal is faced with elucidating the meaning of Article 11(3) of the Treaty within the framework of Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"**VCLT**\").\n\n231.\n\nArticle 31 of the VCLT makes clear that any interpretation must rest primarily on the ordinary meaning of the text of the treaty, only to be supplemented by considerations of content, object and purpose if the ordinary meaning of the text is not clear. In performing this exercise of interpretation, the Tribunal must be particularly cautious not to rephrase or otherwise alter the plain meaning of the text, which is considered to reflect the common intention of the Contracting Parties.308 In the words of the *El Paso v. Argentina* tribunal, \"the content of the treaty's provisions is paramount, and what is not there cannot be read into them.\"309\n\n*See* R.K. Gardiner, *Treaty Interpretation* (Oxford University Press 2008), p. 145, citing R.H. Berglin, 'Treaty Interpretation and the Impact of Contractual Choice of Forum Clauses on the Jurisdiction of International Tribunals: the Iranian Forum Clause Decisions of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal' (1986) 21 Texas International Law Journal 39, p. 44.\n\n*El Paso Energy International Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 2011, para. 590 (Ex. CL-11).\n\n232.\n\nAlso, pursuant to Article 32 of the VCLT, the Tribunal may only resort to supplementary means of interpretation if the outcome of an interpretation conducted under Article 31 of the VCLT \"leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, or.leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"\n\n233.\n\nThe first condition laid down in Article 11(3) of the Treaty that the Tribunal must consider concerns the nexus that must exist between the State measures at stake and the essential security interests of the State for the exception to be triggered, which is embodied in the terms \"directed to.\"\n\n234.\n\nIn that respect, the Tribunal is mindful of the broad terms of Article 11(3) of the Treaty. It clearly provides that the Treaty \"shall not in any way limit the right of either Contracting Party to apply prohibitions or restrictions of any kind or to take any action which is directed to the protection of its essential security interests.\" [Tribunal's underlining.]\n\n235.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, while these terms provide the State with considerable freedom as to the action it can take, it is important to note that such action must be directed not to any security interest but only to \"essential security interests.\" Measures that would not actually be directed to the protection of the essential security interests would not qualify.\n\n236.\n\nThis parameter will guide the Tribunal when applying the law to the facts of this case.\n\n237.\n\nHowever, the Parties disagree on the existence of a requirement of necessity in Article 11(3) of the Treaty, such that the \"essential security interests\" exception could only be triggered when the State measures are \"necessary\" for the protection of the State's national security.\n\n238.\n\nIt is worth noting that the word \"necessity\" or any reference thereof is absent in the ESI clause. By contrast, all of the cases on which the Claimants rely to advance a requirement of necessity are based on a Treaty in which the relevant ESI clause expressly contains the word \"necessary\" and therefore included necessity as an objective precondition for provoking the exception. In particular, *CMS*,310*Enron*,311*Sempra*,312*LG&E*,313*Continental Casualty*314 and *El Paso*315 were all brought under the aegis of the 1991 Argentina-U.S. BIT which reads at Article XI: \"(t)his treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary [Tribunal's underlining] for the maintenance of public order, the fulfilment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or the restoration of international peace or security, the protection of its own essential security interests.\"\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, 2005.\n\n*Enron Corp. and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Award, 2007.\n\n*Sempra Energy International v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award, 2007.\n\n*LG&E Energy Corporation v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 2006.\n\n*Continental Casualty Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 2008.\n\n*El Paso Energy International Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 2011.\n\n239.\n\nThe UNCTAD study mentioned above identifies four basic approaches relating to the issue of necessity in international investment agreements (\"IIAs\"): (1) self-judging clauses; (2) necessity as objective precondition; (3) no reference to necessity; and (4) exclusion of judicial review.\n\n240.\n\nThat study clearly brings the Mauritius-India BIT under the third category where there is no mention of the requirement of necessity and it is sufficient that the measures be \"directed to the protection of its essential security interests.\" As an example, it refers specifically to the Hungary-India BIT (2003) which contains a national security clause practically identical with the present one. Article 12 of that BIT reads in part as follows: \"[\u2026] nothing in this Agreement precludes the host Contracting Party from taking action for the protection of its essential security interests or in circumstances of extreme emergency in accordance with its laws normally and reasonably applied on a non-discriminatory basis.\" [Tribunal's underlining.] The Study also mentions the Peru-Singapore BIT (2003) which uses wording similar to the Mauritius-India BIT. Its Article 11 reads as follows: \"The provisions of this Agreement shall not in any away limit the right of either Contracting Party to apply prohibitions or restrictions of any kind or to take any other action which is directed to the protection of its essential security interests, or to the protection of public health or the prevention of diseases and pests in animals or plants.\" [Tribunal's underlining.]\n\n241.\n\nThe UNCTAD study concludes as follows: \"Although the two examples above establish objective conditions for invoking the exception, their practical effect comes very close to a self-judging clause. Only in extreme cases will an arbitral tribunal conclude that the host country measure has no relation whatsoever to the national security interests of a party.\" This would caution against imposing a requirement of necessity in ESI clauses unless it can be clearly inferred from the terms of the clause. In the words of the *El Paso v. Argentina* tribunal: \"... the content of the treaty's provision is paramount, and what is not there cannot be read into them.\"316\n\n*Id.*, Award, 2011, para. 590 (Ex. CL-7).\n\n242.\n\nThe study would appear however to go too far in stating that such clauses are \"very close to self-judging clauses.\" In situations like the one in this case or in those mentioned in the UNCTAD study, a tribunal is called upon to assess whether the measure adopted by the State is not only directed to the protection of its security but that it must also be for the protection of its essential security interests. In the case of self-judging clauses, it suffices for the State to declare, in its discretion, that it considers the adopted measure necessary for the protection of its security interests.317\n\n*See supra*, para. 219 and fn. 286.\n\n243.\n\nWhile, in the present case, the Respondent does not have to demonstrate necessity in the sense that the measure adopted was the only one it could resort to in the circumstances, it still has to establish that the measure related to its essential security interests; it cannot therefore be any security interest but it has to be an \"essential\" one. In that respect, the Tribunal has no difficulty endorsing the definition of that word proposed by the Claimants and taken from the following dictionaries: \"Essential\" definition (meanings 3(b), 4(a)), *Oxford English Dictionary* (2014) (\"important (\u2026) absolutely necessary, indispensably requisite (\u2026) unavoidable\");318 \"Essential\" definition (meaning 1), *The Random House Dictionary of the English Language* (1966) (\"absolutely necessary; indispensable\")319 \"Essential\" definition (meanings 2(a), 2(b)), *Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary* (1976) (\"necessary, indispensable, or unavoidable\").320\n\nOxford English Dictionary (2014) (excerpt) (Ex. CL-61).\n\nThe Random House Dictionary of the English Language (1966) (excerpt) (Ex. CL-62).\n\nWebster's Third New Int'l Dictionary (1976) (excerpt) (Ex. CL-64).\n\n244.\n\nIn performing this analysis, however, the Tribunal has also no difficulty in recognizing the \"wide measure of deference\" mentioned by the Respondent.321\n\n*See supra*, para. 221.\n\n245.\n\nAn arbitral tribunal may not sit in judgment on national security matters as on any other factual dispute arising between an investor and a State. National security issues relate to the existential core of a State. An investor who wishes to challenge a State decision in that respect faces a heavy burden of proof, such as bad faith, absence of authority or application to measures that do not relate to essential security interests.\n\n***2. Does Article 11(1) of the Treaty Allow for the Introduction of Customary International****Law Restrictions Imposed on a State of Necessity Defence?***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nIn addition to invoking a \"necessity\" requirement into Article 11(3) of the Treaty, the Claimants argue that, by virtue of Article 11(1), the Respondent must demonstrate that it meets the conditions of a state of necessity defence under customary international law.\n\nArticle 11(1) of the Treaty reads as follows:\n\nIf the provisions of the law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties, in addition to the present Agreement, contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment more favourable than that provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall, to the extent that they are more favourable, prevail over the present Agreement.\n\n247.\n\nAccording to the Claimants,322 Article 11(1) applies to Article 11(3), thereby allowing them to claim the more restrictive standards imposed upon the Respondent by Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility concerning a state of necessity defence. These Articles are considered as a consolidation of current customary international law.\n\nStatement of Reply, paras 91-96.\n\n248.\n\nArticle 25 reads as follows:\n\n1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:\n\n(a) is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and\n\n(b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.\n\n2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:\n\n(a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or\n\n(b) the State has contributed to the situation of necessity.323\n\nInternational Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts 2001, Yearbook Of The International Law Commission (2001), Vol. II, Part Two, p. 28 (Ex. R-116 and R-117).\n\n249.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, these strict requirements on a host State invoking a state of necessity must be applied in the interpretation of Article 11(1) of the Treaty which allows them to make a claim on the basis that they are entitled to a \"treatment more favorable than that provided for by the present Agreement,\" including Article 11(3). Relying in particular on *EDF International*,324*Suez AWG325* and *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros*,326 they argue that the Respondent must demonstrate that \"the wrongful act was the only way to safeguard (India's) essential interest under Article 25(1).\"327\n\n*EDF International S.A. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Award, 2012, para. 1171.\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A. and Vivendi Universal, S.A. v.

The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Article 11(1) of the Treaty is not a vehicle which allows bringing Article 25 of the ILC Articles into this case. According to it, Article 11(1) is nothing but a \"preservation of rights\" clause\u2014which provides that the Treaty is not designed to take away substantive protections offered by international law\u2014but \"has nothing to do with the state of necessity defence incorporated in Article 25 of the ILC Articles, which does not confer benefits on private investors, but rather outlines a defence available to States under customary international law.\"328\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 55.\n\n251.\n\nMoreover, pointing out the clear and categorical text of Article 11(3) which states that \"(t)he provisions of this Agreement shall not limit in any way the right\" of the State to protect its essential security interests, the Respondent argues that Article 11(1) cannot negate the applicability of Article 11(3).329\n\n*Id*., para. 56.\n\n**c. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that Article 11(1) does not result in a restrictive application of Article 11(3). It is true that, when a State was invoking a \"state of necessity\" defence, the ICJ and a number of arbitral tribunals330 have recognized the right of international investors to challenge such defence under customary international law, on the basis that it was not the only way for a State to safeguard its essential interests or that the State was at least partly responsible for the situation which led a State to invoke a state of necessity situation (These are the only two restrictions mentioned in Article 25 of the Articles that might apply in this case).\n\n*EDF International S.A. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Award, 2012, para. 1176; *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A. and Vivendi Universal, S.A. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, Decision on Liability, 2010, paras 259-260; *Gabcikovo-Nagymiaros Project* (Hungary v. Slovakia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1997, p. 7, paras 49-59; *El Paso Energy International Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 2011, paras 613-620 (Ex. CL-7).\n\n253.\n\nHowever, in face of the very clear and strong wording of Article 11(3), it would be strange to give Article 11(1) preponderance over it. Indeed, Article 11(3) provides that \"(t)he provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way limit the right of either Contracting Party to apply prohibitions or restrictions of any kind or take any other action which is directed to the protection of its essential security interests [\u2026]\" [Tribunal's underlining.]\n\n254.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent is right in pointing out that the \"preservation of rights\" under Article 11(1) of the Treaty has nothing to do with the \"state of necessity\" defence which, under customary international law, is available to a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act which would otherwise be in breach of an international obligation of that State.\n\n255.\n\nFinally, the Respondent in the present case is not invoking a state of necessity defence under customary international law but, instead, the specific provision of Article 11(3) of the Treaty concerning the protection of its essential security interest and it is the analysis of that provision which will guide the Tribunal in determining whether or not the Respondent is in breach of the Treaty.\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the conditions attached to the state of necessity defence under customary international law are not applicable in the present situation. The Tribunal observes that this approach is consistent with that taken by the tribunal in *Continental Casualty v. Argentina*331 and the annulment committee in *CMS v. Argentina.*332\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 2008, para. 167.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v Argentina,* ICSID Case No ARB/01/8, Decision on Application for Annulment, 2007, paras 128-136.\n\n***3. Can the Claimants Invoke Article 11(4) of the Treaty?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nArticle 11(4) of the Treaty provides:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall, however, honour any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.\n\n**a. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nThe Claimants advance two arguments based on Article 11(4) to preclude the Respondent from invoking the \"essential security interests\" provision. First, the Claimants argue that the language of Article 11(4) is intended to restrain the Respondent from acting inconsistently with its own obligations. According to the Claimants, the Respondent owes obligations under the Devas Agreement, which preclude the Respondent from now terminating its contractual commitments.333\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 98.\n\n259.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the policy decision resulting in the annulment of the Devas Agreement is affirmed by the Opinion of the ASG as \"an act by the governmental authority acting in its sovereign capacity.\" In view of this statement, the Claimants do not consider it necessary to reach the issue of whether Antrix' actions are attributable to the State in order to conclude that there has been an expropriation by India.334 Yet, the Claimants advance a notion of agency and rely on the \"inseparability\" of Antrix, DOS and ISRO in practice.335\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 172.\n\n*Id*., para. 214. *See supra*, para. 69.\n\n260.\n\nSecondly, in the Claimants' view, India is also precluded from invoking \"essential security\" to \"excuse situations of its own making\" as evidenced by statements of a rule of general international law to that effect in *El Paso*,336*Continental Casualty*337 and *LG&E.*338 In the present case, the Claimants interpret the factual record as showing that \"the allocation of the S-band to DOS for 'commercial operations\u2014the scenario that led to Devas signing the Devas Agreement\u2014was the result of conscious and deliberate policy-making on its part.'\"339 Having recalled India's assessment of its national priorities from 1999 to 2008340 and its conduct in allowing the Devas Agreement to proceed, the Claimants submit that the Respondent cannot now \"claim that it was 'essential' that these commercial uses be terminated\" because it \"supposedly formed a different assessment of its \"national needs at a later time.\"341\n\n*El Paso Energy International Co. v.

The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants' first argument proceeds on the flawed basis that \"the obligations under the Devas Agreement are the obligations of the Government, not Antrix\" when the factual record establishes that the Government had no such obligations.342\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras 59-62.\n\n262.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Devas knew that the Government of India was not a party to the Devas Agreement and maintained a distinct personality from Antrix for the purposes of the Devas Agreement.343 As to allegations that Antrix and the Government of India are \"inseparable,\"344 the very fact that the Claimants identify Antrix as the entity which entered into and annulled the Devas Agreement upon the instructions of several governmental bodies shows that Antrix and the Government of India are not \"inseparable,\" and Antrix did not enter into the Devas Agreement \"on behalf of the Government.\" Rather, the negotiating history of the Devas Agreement shows that Devas wanted ISRO to be its counterparty in the deal, which was not accepted and Antrix ultimately signed the Agreement.345\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 155.\n\n*Id*., para. 145; *See* Statement of Claim, para. 214.\n\n*See* Transcript, Day 5, 1223:11-1224:22; 1227:15-20; Term Sheet (Ex.

According to the Respondent, the fact that Devas and Antrix (and not ISRO or DOS) were the parties to the Devas Agreement is an undisputed material fact of the case; *See*, *inter alia*, Transcript, Day 5, 1268:20-1269:15.\n\n263.\n\nThe Respondent then refers to what it characterizes as a \"unanimous line of Indian authority\" rejecting conflation of the legal personalities of State-owned companies and the government,346 as well as international authorities following the same trend.347 These authorities suggest that a clear distinction must be drawn between Antrix, a \"private company limited by shares\" within the meaning of the Indian Companies Act,348 and the Government of India. The Respondent notes the Claimants' failure to bring any Indian authority to support their position.349 Moreover, international authorities such as the ILC Articles lend further support to the Respondent's position that the acts of Antrix are not attributable to the State, save in certain circumstances that are inapplicable in the present case.350\n\nStatement of Defence, paras 148-51, citing *Electronics Corporation of India Ltd. and Ors. v.

The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nIn order to invoke Article 11(4), two requirements must be satisfied. First, the obligation mentioned in Article 11(4) has to be one which the Respondent has itself entered into. Second, the Respondent must fail to honour such an obligation.\n\n267.\n\nThe task of the Tribunal will therefore be to determine whether the Agreement constitutes such an obligation and whether the annulment of the Agreement constitutes failure of the Respondent to honour the obligation.\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, although stating that it is not necessary to decide on the attribution of Antrix's actions to the Respondent in order to conclude that there has been an expropriation, the Claimants nonetheless rely on the \"inseparability\" of Antrix, DOS and ISRO in practice. This latter claim is made particularly in connection with a breach of the FET standard, the Claimants arguing that the Respondent cannot evade liability for its various bad faith actions by claiming that they were solely attributable to Antrix.\n\n269.\n\nArticles 4, 5 and 8 of the ILC Articles containing the applicable principles of attribution read as follows:\n\nArticle 4. Conduct of organs of a State\n\n1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\n\n2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.\n\nArticle 5. Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority\n\nThe conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under Article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in the capacity in the particular instance.\n\nArticle 8. Conduct directed or controlled by the State\n\nThe conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct.\n\n270.\n\nArticle 4(2) of the ILC Articles makes clear that the legal personality of a State-owned company is governed by domestic law. The acts of such a company can only be attributed *en bloc* to the State when it is considered a governmental body under domestic law.\n\n271.\n\nThis view was confirmed by the ICJ in the *Ahmadou Sadio Diallo* case. The Court ruled that:\n\nAs the Court recalled in the Barcelona Traction case, \"(t)here is...no need to investigate the many different forms of legal entity provided for by the municipal laws of States (I.C.J. Reports 1970, p.34, para.40). What matters, from the point of view of international law, is to determine whether or not these have a legal personality independent of their members. (\u2026). In determining whether a company possesses independent and distinct legal personality, international law looks to the rules of the relevant domestic law.\"353\n\n*Ahmadou Sadio Diallo* (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2007, p. 582, para. 61.\n\n272.\n\nIn the present instance, the Respondent has provided clear evidence that Antrix cannot be considered an organ of the State under Indian law. Antrix's constituent documents make clear that it is a \"private company limited by shares\" within the meaning of the Indian Companies Act.354\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 147; Indian Companies Act, Section 3(1)(iii) (Ex. R-105).\n\n273.\n\nEven if the determination of the legal status of a State-owned company is a matter governed by domestic law, the actions of such company may still engage the international responsibility of the State. The acts of the company will have to be examined on a case-by-case basis, in light of ILC Articles 5 and 8, to determine whether they constitute a breach of international law that may be attributed to the State.\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimants however hold a different position. They rely on a notion of agency to argue that \"in assessing the Respondent's liability, Antrix's various actions. should be directly attributed to India.\"355 However, most of the authorities relied upon by the Claimants do not support the existence of a notion of agency in international law, such that every act of an agent (including the repeated assurances of Antrix's support for the Devas System, referred to by the Claimants) may be attributed to the State.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 214.\n\n275.\n\nThus, the Claimants rely on the *Wintershall* arbitration, in which the tribunal decided that the State-owned company at stake operated \"as an arm or agent of the Government\" but only \"as a matter of Qatari law,\"356 i.e. agency was found to exist on the basis of domestic law. The ICC case *Deutsche Schachtbau v. United Arab Emirates* was a purely commercial case that concerned the extension of an arbitration clause from a contract signed by a State entity to the State itself through a multiplicity of contracts.357 Moreover, in the *Nykomb* ICSID award, the tribunal decided that, in the circumstances of the case, Latvia had to \"be considered responsible for (the State's entity) actions under the rules of attribution in international law.\"358 Finally, in *Maffezini v. Spain*, the tribunal concluded that, for the exclusive purpose of determining the jurisdiction of ICSID, it is sufficient if the investor is able to make a *prima facie* case that the relevant company/entity is a State-entity acting on behalf of the Respondent State.359 Attribution matters were actually left to be decided for the merits phase.360\n\n*Wintershall et al. v. Government of Qatar,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award on Liability, 1988, 28 International Legal Materials 798 (1989), pp. 812 (Ex *.* CL-39).\n\n*Deutsche Schachtbau- und Tiefbohrgesellschaft v. United Arab Emirates,* ICC Case No. 3572, Final Award, 1982, Yearbook of Commercial Arbitration 111 (1989), para. 23-27.\n\n*Nykomb Synergetics Techonology Holding A.B. v.

Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2000, para. 75.\n\n*Id.*, para. 89.\n\n276.\n\nSuffice it to say that ILC Articles 4, 5 and 8 do not provide general rules of attribution meaning that any act can be attributed to the State if the requirement of structure, function or control is met. The scope of these provisions is, rather, limited to conduct which constitutes a violation of international law, and should not be confused with rules on agency as they exist under private law.361\n\nM. Feit, 'Responsibility of the State under International Law for the Breach of Contract Committed by State-Owned Entity' (2010) 28 Berkeley Journal of International Law 132, p. 154 (Ex. R-114).\n\n277.\n\nThere remains the provision of Article 8 of the ILC Articles concerning the conduct of a person or group of persons directed or controlled by the State. In that circumstance, that conduct \"shall be considered as an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct.\"\n\n278.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that \"a person or group of persons\" includes any corporation legally created. One may wonder why Article 5 of the ILC Articles refers to \"conduct of a person or entity\" while Article 8 mentions instead \"persons or group of persons\" but it is generally recognized in modern legal systems that \"person\" includes not only a natural person but also a legal person, such as a corporation. Moreover, the Mauritius-India BIT itself defines \"investor\" as covering both a natural person362 and a legal person.363\n\nArticle 1(1)(b)(i) of the Treaty.\n\n*Id*.\n\n279.\n\nThe Tribunal notes in this regard that treaties concluded in the area of international investment protection appear generally to include juridical entities, such as corporations, within the definition of a \"person.\" To cite only two conspicuous examples, pursuant to Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention a \"national of another Contracting State\" is defined to include \"any natural person\" and \"any juridical person.\"364 Similarly, Article 13 of the MIGA Convention includes \"any natural person\" and \"any juridical person\" within the ambit of \"eligible investors.\"365\n\nConvention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, March 18, 1965.\n\nConvention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, October 11, 1985.\n\n280.\n\nFinally, it would make no sense to impose a restrictive interpretation that would allow a State to circumvent the rules of attribution by sending its direction or instruction to a corporate entity rather than a physical person or group of physical persons. Even when addressed to a corporation, the direction or instruction has to be received and acted upon by a person or a group of persons, be they the chairman, the president or the board of directors of that corporation.\n\n281.\n\nIn the present case, having regard to the circumstances leading to the Devas Agreement as they emerge from the pleadings of the Parties, the Tribunal concludes that, when entering into the Agreement, Antrix was not acting as an organ of the Respondent, whether under the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of the ILC Articles. The Agreement itself does not constitute an obligation the Respondent has entered into within the meaning of Article 11(4).\n\n282.\n\nA question arises however as to whether, when Antrix served the Claimants with a notice of *force majeure*, Antrix was acting \"on the instructions of, or under the direction or control\" of the Respondent,366 as described in Article 8 of the ILC Articles.\n\nThe Claimants specifically raised this issue in the Statement of Claim (para. 214), where they argue that \"Antrix purportedly also undertook to terminate the Devas Agreement upon the instructions of the Space Commission and under the direction of the Department of Space.\" *See* Letter from B.S. Anantharamu, Deputy-Secretary, Department of Space to Executive Director, M/s. Antrix Corporation, Ltd., 23 February 2011 (Ex. R-37/JCB-221).\n\n283.\n\nIt is important to note that Article 2 of the ILC Articles states that two conditions must be met for the attribution to a State of an internationally wrongful act: (i) the act must be attributable to the State under international law; and (ii) it must constitute a breach of an international obligation of the State. The answer to these questions has nothing to do with the liability of Antrix for breach of its contractual obligations under Indian law, a matter which has been dealt with by the ICC tribunal referred to in the present award.\n\n284.\n\nAs stated by James Crawford and Simon Olleson:\n\nIt is important that international law, and in particular the law of State responsibility, should not be made to do too much. In particular, international law should not be applied to decide issues to which it is not properly applicable and a fortiori, should not be applied to decide issues which, on analysis, are properly governed by a particular system of domestic law. As will be seen, this is a particular danger with the rules of attribution, which are often prayed in aid in relation to issues which in reality have nothing to do with questions of State responsibility.367\n\nJ. Crawford and S. Olleson, 'The Application of the Rules of State Responsibility', in M. Bungenberg, J. Griebel, S. Hobe and A. Reinisch (eds), *International Investment Law* (Nomos 2015), p. 414-415.\n\n285.\n\nA similar line of thought was expressed by Michael Feit when he observed:\n\nThe basic difference between the principle of \"piercing the corporate veil\" and the rules of attribution as reflected in the ILC Articles is that under the former, the contract itself is attributed to the state, while under the latter, only the act which constitutes the breach of international law is attributed for the purpose of state responsibility.368\n\nM. Feit, 'Responsibility of the State under International Law for the Breach of Contract Committed by State-Owned Entity' (2010) 28 Berkeley Journal of International Law 132, p. 151 (Ex. R-114).\n\n286.\n\nThe interpretation of Article 8 of the ILC Articles has been the subject of helpful analysis in the recent award and the decision on annulment relating to the *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.V. v. Republic of Turkey* case.369 In that case, the tribunal, by majority, ruled that \"while Emlak (the Turkish joint-venture partner of the claimant) was subject to TOKI's (a State entity) corporate and managerial control, Emlak's conduct with respect to the execution, maintenance and termination of the Contract is not attributable to the State under Article 8 of the ILC Articles due to an absence of proof that the State used its control as a vehicle directed towards achieving a particular result in its sovereign interests.\"370 The tribunal also concluded that purely contractual claims were not covered by the relevant BIT.371 Moreover, it unanimously decided that the challenged actions, including those of TOKI, the Supreme Audit Board, the Prime Ministry and the police, did not constitute violations of the relevant BIT.372\n\n*Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.V. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Award, 2014, paras 301-326 and Decision on Annulment, 2015, paras 186-202.\n\n*Id*., Award, para. 326.\n\n*Id*., para. 361.\n\n*Id*., para. 368-369 and Decision on Annulment, para. 35.\n\n287.\n\nQuoting the award approvingly, the annulment committee had this to say:\n\nRelying thus on Article 8 and its Commentary, the Tribunal stated that:\n\nThe relevant enquiry remains whether Emlak was being directed, instructed or controlled by TOKI with respect to the specific activity of administering the Contract with Tulip JV in the sense of sovereign direction, instruction or control rather than the ordinary control by a majority shareholder in the company's perceived commercial interests.\n\nThe Committee has no doubt that the Tribunal correctly interpreted Article 8 of the ILC Articles and applied the relevant test, that of effective control.\"373\n\n*Id.*, Decision on Annulment, paras.188-189 (emphasis in original).\n\n288.\n\nThe Tribunal endorses the analysis of Article 8 contained in the *Tulip* case; however, based on the factual situation, the end result is quite different. While in the *Tulip* case, the tribunal concluded that there was no evidence supporting attribution of Emlak's acts to the State, there can be no doubt that, in the present case, Antrix, in invoking *force majeure*, was \"acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct,\" to quote Article 8.\n\n289.\n\nThe text of the press release issued by the Government of India on February 17, 2011 confirmed the decision of the CCS to annul the Devas Agreement \"forthwith\"374 and authorized the DOS to \"instruct ANTRIX to annul the ANTRIX-DEVAS contract.\"375 On February 23, 2011, the Deputy Secretary of DOS advised Antrix that it would be unable to lease any transponders in the S-band and that the Agreement \"shall be annulled forthwith.\"376\n\nPress Information Bureau, Government of India, Cabinet, *CCS Decides to Annul Antrix-Devas Deal,* February 17, 2011. (Ex. C-134/JCB-220).\n\nMinutes of 117th Meeting of the Space Commission Held at DOS Branch Secretariat, New Delhi, on July 2, 2010, signed July 21, 2010, para. 117.6.12 (Ex. R-23/JCB-161)\n\nLetter from B.S. Anantharamu, Deputy-Secretary, Department of Space to Executive Director, M/s. Antrix Corporation, LTD. (Ex. R-37/JCB-221).\n\n290.\n\nHaving found that Antrix's notice of annulment is attributable to the Respondent under Article 8 of the ILC Articles, it remains however to be determined whether, in the continuum of activities which led to the annulment of the Devas Agreement, the Respondent breached the provisions of the BIT\u2014a question that the Tribunal will address in Chapters VII, VIII, IX and X of this Award.\n\n***4. Does Article 11(3) Prevent Entitlement to Compensation?***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \"Article 11(3) merely provides that certain sovereign powers are unimpaired; it does not purport to suspend compliance with co-existent obligation of international law (including as stated in Articles 4, 6 and 7) regarding the treatment of investors nor does it override other obligations of international law. Accordingly, even if the annulment of the contract was authorized by Article 11(3),\" the Claimants submit that their right of\u2014and India's corresponding obligation to provide\u2014compensation as a result of measures supposedly authorized by Article 11(3) \"remains fully operative.\"377\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 106; *See* *EDF International S.A. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Award, 2012, para. 1178.\n\n**b. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Respondent, however, argues that there could be no basis for compensation if the \"essential security interests\" provision of Article 11(3) is found to apply in this case. To support its argument, the Respondent refers to the *Continental Casualty* case378 and the *CMS* annulment committee decision,379 which in effect conclude that there is no possibility of compensation when the \"essential security interests\" provisions are invoked.380\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 2008, para.164.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Annulment, 2007, para. 146.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras 69-72. *See* *Continental Casualty Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 2008, para. 164; *CMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Annulment, 2007, para. 146.\n\n**c. The Tribunal's Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal has no doubt that, if a State properly invokes a national security exception under an investment treaty, it cannot be liable for compensation of damages going forward. This is made clear in the *CMS* annulment committee decision when it opines in relation to the Article of the relevant treaty relating to state of necessity: \"Article XI [ *NB:* the security interests clause under the Argentina-United States BIT], if and for so long as it applied, excluded the operation of the substantive provisions of the BIT. That being so, there could be no possibility of compensation being payable during that period.\"381 It added: \"Article XI is a threshold requirement: if it applies, the substantive obligations under the Treaty do not apply.\"382 Similarly, the *Continental v. Argentina* award noted that \"if Art. XI is applicable because the measure at issue was necessary in order to safeguard essential security interest, then the treaty is inapplicable to such measure.\"383 It has to be noted that, in the *CMS* case, Argentina argued that the economic measures adopted by Argentina were to be of a temporary nature and, as such, did not imply a permanent expropriation. However, the fact that in the present case the expropriation was of a permanent nature does not justify a different conclusion.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Annulment, 2007, para.146.\n\n*Id.*, para. 129.\n\n*Continental Casualty Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No ARB/03/9, Award, 2008, fn. 236.\n\n294.\n\nHowever, this does not resolve the question as to what happens if a State has engaged in treaty breaches during the period preceding the invocation of national security. In such a case, a State could not, by invoking national security at a certain moment, simply erase the effect of previous wrongful actions.\n\n295.\n\nIt will therefore be for the Tribunal to decide whether, even if national security interests were properly invoked by the Respondent, the Respondent breached provisions of the Treaty during the period previous to the invocation of Article 11(3) and, if so, whether damages resulted from such action.\n\n**B. APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACTS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nThe Parties fundamentally disagree as to whether there was a real need on the part of the military and security agencies of India to reserve S-band capacity, such that the intended uses could not be reconciled with the terms of the Devas Agreement.\n\n***1. The Parties' Arguments***\n-------------------------------\n\n**a. Historical Analysis of Demands for S-band Spectrum in India**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ni. The Claimants' Position\n--------------------------\n\n297.\n\nThe Claimants first note that at all times prior to Dr. Radhakrishnan's announcement of the annulment of the Devas Agreement on February 8, 2011 they remained unaware of any claim that any governmental user had a need for the S-band spectrum that had been allotted to Devas.384\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 87, 123; Statement of Reply, para. 29.\n\n298.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, it was partly because DOS/ISRO was not making effective use of the allocated S-band spectrum that India caused DOS to give back 40 MHz of S-MSS spectrum to DOT.385 The Claimants contend that in 2003, when Mr. Viswanathan first met Dr. Kasturirangan, the then Chairman of the Space Commission, Secretary of DOS and Chairman of ISRO and Antrix, Dr. Kasturirangan, indicated that DOS/ISRO was looking to explore ways of making commercial use of its allocated S-band spectrum in order to ensure that it retained that spectrum.386\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 21.\n\n*Id*., para. 23, Viswanathan I, paras 36-39. The Claimants also rely on a note from DOS to the Space Commission, which reads: \"ISRO initiated serious discussions in early 2003 for introduction of Satellite-based Digital Multimedia in the country, especially taking note of the fact that the allocation of the S-Band spectrum for ISRO/DOS [...]. would expire by September 2010 unless [DOS/ISRO] placeS-Band Satellites in the orbit and demonstrate that necessary advance actions to build the Satellites have been taken.\" Note to Space Commission dated July 2, 2010 (Ex. C-219/JCB-160) (emphasis by the Claimants).\n\n299.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, India conveniently ignores that by 2008 terrestrial cellular operators had their eyes firmly fixed on the S-band, and were seeking to have DOS vacate the S-band spectrum that had been allocated to it for space services.387 These claims were reviewed by the TRAI, which recommended that \"DOT/WPC should coordinate with [DOS] and ascertain the feasibility of vacation of additional spectrum\" in the S-band.388 Nonetheless, India's policy in this regard remained unchanged, and there was no suggestion that the performance of the Devas Agreement might be interrupted because of alleged competing demands for S-band capacity.389\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 135-37; Statement of Reply, paras 26-28. The Claimants note that, in March 2008, the Cellular Operators Association of India (the \"**COAI**\") has requested DOT that India's National Frequency Allocation Plan (\"**NFAP**\") be revised to reorient the S-band for purely terrestrial cellular operations; *See* COAI's Proposal for Review of Draft NFAP 2008, March 10, 2008, pp. 4-5 (Ex. C-43/JCB-80).\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 28, citing Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, *Recommendations on Allocation and Pricing for 2.3-2.4GHz, 2.5-2.69 GHz & 3.3-3.6 GHz bands*, July 11, 2008, p. 16 (Ex. C-50/JCB-86).\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 29.\n\n300.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that Devas was never informed of competing demands from the Ministry of Defence, the Claimants reject the Respondent's claims that India's military needs for all available S-band capacity started to emerge in 2003390 and had crystallized by December 2009. According to the Claimants, the only evidence of early \"competing demands\" is that DOS/ISRO/Antrix willingly pursued an agreement with Devas with full knowledge of these competing \"demands\", and that Antrix represented to Devas that it could provide 70 MHz of S-band through the satellites on a \"Non-Preemptible\" basis.391\n\n*Id*., para. 52.\n\n*See supra*, Chapter III - BC.\n\n301.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, if the military had genuine demands for the S-band allocated to Devas under the Devas Agreement, then this fact would prominently feature in key documents produced during the review of the Devas Agreement by several Indian governmental agencies and officials.392 Instead, Dr. Radhakrishnan's Note for the CCS does not mention any \"crystallized\" military needs,393 and the policy decision of the CCS merely notes that Antrix was not going to use an orbital slot for commercial purposes. Moreover, it makes no decision regarding spectrum.394 In any event, the Claimants contend that the CCS did not have the power to reserve S-band spectrum for the \"crystallized needs\" of the military, which would have had to be taken up at the ICC.395\n\n*See* Statement of Reply, paras 50, 53 referring to Suresh Report, May 2010, (Ex.

The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, even prior to the conclusion of the Devas Agreement, the need for S-band had already been the subject of discussion within the agencies charged with national security and defence.398 The Respondent recounts a lengthy record of facts to support this contention,399 spanning from 2003 to 2011. What emerges from this record, the Respondent submits, is that the needs and demands arising from military and defence purposes were consistently emphasized by statements of the India Air Force,400 senior military officers,401 the Ministry of Defence,402 and warranted the creation of expert committees of military leaders,403 and a taskforce at the ISRO404 to address these issues.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras 37-38; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras 12-13; *See also* Anand, paras 4-6; *We Need Military Satellite: Air Chief*, The Hindu, June 28, 2003 (Ex.

MSS Demands Versus BSS Demands**\n-------------------------------------\n\ni. The Claimants' Position\n--------------------------\n\n306.\n\nThe Claimants assert that India's defence suffers a fatal lacuna: the military's stated desires all involved MSS frequency, whereas the Devas Agreement pertained to the use of the BSS spectrum.408 In the Claimants' view, this fact disproves the Respondent's contention that there were genuine military or strategic needs for the portion of the S-band spectrum that had been allocated to Devas.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 54.\n\n307.\n\nTo support this contention, the Claimants rely on a \"Note for the Empowered Group of Ministers (\"**EGoM**\")409 on Vacation of Spectrum,\" authored by DOT and dated March 1, 2012 (the \"**Note for the EGoM**\").410 This note and its annexures were all issued more than a year after the Devas Agreement was annulled.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, an EGoM is \"virtually a mini cabinet\" that may decide on issues normally reserved to the Indian Union Cabinet. *See* Transcript, Day 1, 86:15-87:8.\n\nNote for the Empowered Group of Ministers on Vacation of Spectrum March 1, 2012 (the \"**Note for the EGoM**\") (Ex. C-232/JCB-247).\n\n308.\n\nFirst, the Note for the EGoM clarifies that the \"strategic and government\" need of S-band spectrum is for MSS, and that DOS was seeking to convert the existing BSS spectrum (including the 60 MHz of BSS spectrum allocated to Devas) to MSS.411 In the Claimants' view, this demonstrates that there was no existing military need for BSS spectrum.412 The Claimants also note that the EGoM and DOT were aware that this conversion would contravene the ITU's regulations.413\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 56; Note for the EGoM, pp. \"52/59\", \"54/59\" (Ex. C-232/JCB-247).\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 56.\n\n*Id*., para. 57; Note for the EGoM, pp. \"10 of 59\", \"58/59\" (Ex. C-232/JCB-247).\n\n309.\n\nSecondly, the Note for the EGoM and Annexure 10 thereto, as well as a letter dated February 21, 2012 from Mr. Chandrashekhar to Dr. Radhakrishnan,414 state that DOS was requested to vacate part of the 80 MHz of S-BSS spectrum assigned to it if DOS had no plan for BSS applications in this band. The Claimants argue that such a recommendation would not have been made to the EGoM, of which the Minister of Defence is a member, if the crystallized military plans for BSS existed. A similar remark is made with regard to the minutes of the EGoM meeting held on March 5, 2012, which reflect that DOS was asked to apprise the EGoM as to its plans for using BSS spectrum.415\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 57; Note for the EGoM, March 1, 2012, pp. \"10 of 59\", \"58/59\" (Ex. C-232/JCB-247).\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 59.\n\n310.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the documents above disprove Mr. Anand's unsupported statement that the military demanded BSS spectrum \"due to the limitations of the MSS.\"416\n\n*Id*., para. 55, referring to Anand I, fn. 5.\n\nii. The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n311.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes the intensifying discussions within the Government of India over the use of the S-band as the military learned of the limitations of MSS frequency for their data communication.417 These limitations arose from the fact that two-way communications such as MSS cannot support sending large amounts of data to multiple users simultaneously, as opposed to satellite broadcasting, which is the case of BSS.418\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 38.\n\n*Id*., para. 38; *see* Anand I, para. 4; Sethuraman I, paras 6, 17, fn. 37.\n\n312.\n\nThe Respondent characterizes the Claimants' argument that the Note for the EGoM disproves the existence of genuine military needs for the S-band419 as a \"quantum leap\" that suffers a twofold deficiency:\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras 20-23, referring to Statement of Reply, para. 56.\n\n313.\n\nFirst, it is undisputed that the CCS reserved the S-band for non-commercial, strategic use, and such reservation remains in effect.420 This is true notwithstanding any debates taking place before, during or after the policy decision of the CCS, which are legitimate and inherent to the democratic spirit of India.421 The Note for the EGoM proves nothing as to the continued effectiveness of the policy decision of the CCS.422\n\nThe Respondent submits that this is an undisputed material fact in this case. *See* Transcript, Day 1, 119:7121:6; Day 5, 1278:16-1281:1.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 21.\n\n*Id*., para. 22.\n\n314.\n\nSecondly, the Claimants overlook a number of documents produced to them together with the Note for the EGoM, including:\n\ni. A March 1, 2012 letter from Dr. Radhakrishnan, as Secretary of DOS, to the Secretary of DOT,423 referring to the letter dated February 21, 2012 from Mr. Chandrashekhar to Dr. Radhakrishnan,424 which makes clear that the strategic, non-commercial needs for S-band continued to exist and that, in light of those needs, it would not be possible to vacate S-band spectrum for commercial BWA purposes;425 and\n\nii. A Note produced by DOS on March 28, 2014, in preparation for the 128th Space Commission Meeting, regarding the revised cost estimates and revised utilization plan for GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A. This note explains that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (the \"DRDO\"), which works under the Ministry of Defence, is responsible for the development of the ground segment related to the operations of the satellites.426 That segment involves \"a) Design and Development of Hub Station, b) Development and realization of Ground Terminals, c) Design and Development of Scalable Network Management System for Network Resource Management.\"427\n\nLetter from DOS to DOT, March 1, 2012 (Ex.

C-233/JCB-248), which reads, in relevant part: \"Hence, considering the national imperatives for space-based communication systems for strategic applications, it will not be possible or be prudent to vacate this 80 MHz (2555-2635 MHz) of the S-band for BWA applications. The EGOM may kindly be briefed accordingly.\"\n\nDepartment of Space, Note to Space Commission for the 128th Space Commission Meeting, March 28, 2014, paras 4.6 and 4.7 (Ex. KS-15/JCB-287).\n\n*Id.*, paras 4.6 and 4.7.\n\n***2. The Tribunal's Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider whether there was a genuine need on the part of the military and security agencies of India to reserve S-band capacity. The Respondent contends that that is the case. The Claimants, on the other hand, question that the S-band demands expressed by the Indian military between 2003 and 2009 were genuine. They insist that all the references to \"national needs\" featuring in the documents produced during the review of the Devas Agreement are intentionally non-exhaustive and indeterminate, and were merely used as a pretext by India to concoct a *force majeure* event that would enable Antrix to terminate said Agreement on advantageous terms.\n\n316.\n\nThe Tribunal did not have the benefit of testimonies from senior officials who were directly involved in the process leading to the CCS decision of February 17, 2011, such as Dr. K. Radhakrishnan who, since late 2009, was Chairman of the Space Commission, Chairman of ISRO, Secretary of DOS and, until July 2011, Chairman of Antrix, or Mr. G. Balachandran, Additional Secretary of DOS from April 1, 2009 to January 11, 2011, or Mrs. Geeta Varadhan, Director of Special Projects at DOS, who appears to have had long exposure to the needs of the military concerning the S-band and who, according to Mr. Anand, was the person who, at a meeting of senior officials of DOS in June 2010, raised the issue of the needs of the military over the S-band.428 Nor was the Tribunal provided with any testimony from any member of the Department of Defence.\n\nTranscript, Day 4, 913:6-15.\n\n317.\n\nMessrs. Sethuraman and Anand were cooperative and helpful witnesses but a large part of their testimony consisted in presenting their interpretation of many documents in the preparation of which they had no participation whatsoever.\n\n318.\n\nAs far as the Claimants are concerned, they produced a number of witnesses and experts who provided considerable information concerning the negotiation and the implementation of the Agreement as well as expertise on the allocation and management of spectrum. However, in spite of over a dozen meetings with government officials between June 2010 and the end of January 2011, none of the Claimants was informed of the internal government process which led to the CCS decision of February 17, 2011, until Dr. Radhakdrishnan's press conference of February 8, 2011 at which he announced for the first time the Space Commission's decision of 2 July 2010 to annul the Agreement. They therefore were in no position to shed light on the deliberations of governmental authorities during the most relevant period.\n\n319.\n\nThe Tribunal finds itself having to rely very much on the documents submitted by the Parties in reaching its own conclusion as to the Respondent's decision to annul the Agreement and reserve the GSAT-6 and 6A satellites \"having regard to the needs of [India's] strategic requirements.\"429\n\nPress Information Bureau, Government of India, Cabinet *, CCS Decides to Annul Antrix-Devas Deal*, February 17, 2011 (Ex. C-134/JCB-220).\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal has summarized above the events surrounding the decision to annul the Agreement. The Tribunal is faced with the difficult task of assessing whether that decision was based on genuine security needs of the State or whether these alleged needs were a mere pretext to annul a contract which was becoming a political embarrassment and to meet the wishes expressed by other groups in the communications industry providing terrestrial services.\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal is left with no doubt that, inside the Indian administration, during the discussions leading to the request to the CCS for the annulment of the Devas Agreement, a mix of factors was at play.\n\n322.\n\nFirst and foremost, the fear of a political scandal similar to the previous one relating to the attribution of G2 licenses and arising out of the publication of some articles on the subject in Indian media is a likely explanation of the sudden frenzy in June 2010 of the DOS, and of Dr. Radhakrishnan in particular, in agitating for and obtaining from the Space Commission in less than a month the decision to annul the Devas Agreement.\n\n323.\n\nAll this occurred in a context where at no time between the signing of the Agreement in 2006 and the decision to annul it in 2011, and in spite of alleged repeated requests since 2006 by the military for the allocation to it of at least part of the S-band, did the Respondent give any indication to the Claimants that the Agreement might be in jeopardy because of such needs.\n\n324.\n\nAfter the publication of press articles on May 31 and June 1, 2010430 suggesting that there might have been some inappropriate dealings in connection with the Agreement, DOT, by letter of June 4, 2010431 requested the Additional Secretary of ISRO \"to provide your comments [...] immediately;\" this was followed by another letter of June 14, 2010432 to the same effect addressed to Dr. Rhadakrishnan. These letters initiated a flurry of actions by ISRO aimed at annulling the Agreement.\n\nMadhumathi D.S. & Thomas K. Thomas, *Devas gets preferential allocation of ISRO's spectrum*, The Hindu Business Line, May 31, 2010 (Ex. C-208); *Another spectrum sold on the quiet*, The Hindu Business Line June 1, 2010 (Ex.

C-211/JCB-149).\n\n325.\n\nOn the same date, Dr. Rhadakrishnan requested from Antrix six copies of the Agreement which were immediately provided.433 On June 16, 2010 in a letter to DOT, after pointing out that two issues were confronting the Respondent, he sought DOT's \"opinion on whether ANTRIX-Devas contract need be annulled invoking any of the provisions of the contract in order (i) to preserve the precious S band for the strategic requirements of the nation and (ii) to ensure a level playing field for the other service providers using terrestrial spectrum.\"434 On the same date, Dr. Rhadakhrisnan wrote to the Advisor to the Law Minister, raising the same two issues and seeking a legal opinion \"on whether ANTRIX-Devas contract need be annulled invoking any of the provisions of the contract [\u2026].\"435 He also flew from Bangalore to New Delhi to discuss the matter with the Advisor. Two days later, on June 18, 2010 the Advisor produced a note436 stating that \"the Central Government (Department of Space), in exercise of its sovereign power and function, if so desire and feel appropriate, may take a policy decision to the effect that due to the needs of strategic requirements, the Central Govt/ISRO would not be able to provide orbit slot in S-band for operating PS1 to the ANTRIX for commercial activities. In that event, ANTRIX in terms of Article 7(c) read with Article 11, of the agreement may terminate the agreement and inform M/s Devas accordingly.\"437 He added: \"As far as the second issue relating to terrestrial supplementation and level playing field since the Department of Telecom is administratively concerned that Department may also be consulted.\"438\n\nLetter from Antrix (Parameswaran) to DOS (Balachandran), June 14, 2010 (Ex. C-213/JCB-151).\n\nMemo from K. Radhakrishnan, Secretary, Department of Space, to Secretary, Department of Telecommunications, June 16, 2010 (Ex. R-25/JCB-153).\n\nMemo from K. Radhakrishnan, Secretary, Department of Space, to T.K. Viswanathan, Advisor to Law Minister, Ministry of Law and Justice, June 16, 2010 (Ex. R-26/JCB-154).\n\nNote from T.K. Viswanathan, Advisor to the Minister for Law and Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, to the Department of Space, June 18, 2010 (App. VA-18/JCB-156).\n\n*Id*., para. 12.\n\n*Id*., para. 13.\n\n326.\n\nFollowing the submission of an extensive note by DOS to the Space Commission, that Commission decided, among other things, at its meeting of 2 July 2010, that the Department of Space \"in view of priority to be given to nation's strategic requirements including societal ones may take the actions necessary and instruct Antrix to annul the ANTRIX-Devas contract\" and \"may evolve a revised utilization plan for GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A satellites, taking into account the strategic and societal imperatives of the country.\"439\n\nMinutes of 117th Meeting of the Space Commission Held at DOS Branch Secretariat, New Delhi, on July 2, 2010, signed July 21, 2010, para. 117.6.12 (Ex. R-23/JCB-161).\n\n327.\n\nSubsequent to that decision and following a request from DOS, the Additional Solicitor General stated in a letter of 12 July 2010 that his opinion had been sought as to whether the Agreement \"can be annulled by invoking any provisions of the contract in order to (i) preserve precious S band spectrum for strategic requirements of the nation and (ii) to ensure a level playing field for other service providers using terrestrial spectrum.\"440 He advised that, instead of a mere decision by the Department of Space, \"it would be more prudent that a decision is taken by the Government of India, as a matter of policy, in exercise of its executive power or in other words, a policy decision having the seal and approval of the Cabinet and duly gazetted as per the Business Rules of the Government of India.\"441\n\nOpinion of the ASG, p. 2 (Ex. R-30/JCB-165).\n\n*Id*., p. 4.\n\n328.\n\nFinally, in its Note for the Cabinet Committee on Security of February 16, 2011, DOS, after describing the need of \"S-band spectrum for vital and societal applications,\"442 again refers to its concerns about ensuring \"a level-playing field for the other service providers using terrestrial spectrum.\"443\n\nNote for the CCS, para. 19-22 (Ex.C-229/JCB-219).\n\n*Id*., para. 24.\n\n329.\n\nThis, by itself, however cannot be a basis for the Tribunal to conclude that the decision of the Respondent to annul the Agreement was invalid.\n\n330.\n\nFirst, it is a regular phenomenon in public administration that decisions are influenced by a number of factors including, sometimes, purely political ones.\n\n331.\n\nSecond, and more important, while records of deliberations at senior levels of the Respondent's public administration might be helpful to understand the context in which a particular decision was reached, what should guide the Tribunal is the actual decision taken by the highest authority of the Government, i.e. its Cabinet, which had delegated to the Cabinet Committee on Security decisions concerning that subject, a Committee which was presided by the Prime Minister himself, who was also the Minister responsible for the DOS.\n\n332.\n\nThe decision of the CCS concerning the Devas Agreement was communicated in the form of a press release of February 17, 2011 which reads:\n\nCabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has decided to annul the Antrix-Devas Deal. Following is the statement made by the Law Minister, Shri M. Veerappa Moily on the decision taken by the CCS which met in New Delhi today:\n\nTaking note of the fact that the Government policies with regard to the allocation of spectrum has undergone a change in the last few years and there has been an increased demand for allocation of spectrum for national needs, including the needs of defence, para-military forces and other public utility services as well as for societal needs, and having regard to the needs of the country's strategic requirements, the Government will not be able to provide orbit slot in S band to Antrix for commercial activities, including for those which are the subject matter of existing contractual obligations for S band.\n\nIn the light of this policy of not providing orbit slot in S band to Antrix for commercial activities, the \"Agreement for the lease of space segment capacity on ISRO/Antrix S-Band spacecraft by the Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd\" entered into between Antrix Corporation and Devas Multimedia Pavt. Ltd. on 28th January, 2005 shall be annulled forthwith.444\n\nPress Information Bureau, Government of India, Cabinet *, CCS Decides to Annul Antrix-Devas Deal*, February 17, 2011 (Ex. C-134/JCB-220).\n\n333.\n\nIn fact, the decision of the CCS as reported in the statement of the Law Minister replicates word for word the approval sought by the DOS in its Note to the CCS of February 16, 2011.445\n\nNote for the CCS, para. 45(1) and (2) (Ex. C-229/JCB-219).\n\n334.\n\nNothing in that decision implies that it was reached in whole or in part to accommodate the concerns expressed by other service providers using terrestrial spectrum or to deal with the risk of a political scandal in connection with the Antrix-Devas Agreement.446\n\nIn a note of April 12, 2011 to the Prime Minister (Ex.R-44/JCB-229, para.36) concerning the Report of March 11, 2011 by the High Powered Review Committee which was appointed after the CCS decision to study various aspects of the Agreement (Ex.C-137/JCB 227), Mr.Chandrashekhar, the Cabinet Secretary, writes as one of his conclusions that \"seem to emerge from the analysis of the HPRC report and other evidences\" is that \"[...] since the agreement has now had to be cancelled on account of reasons related to non-transparency and one-sided skew in risk sharing arrangements, ISRO/DOS are left with a satellite [\u2026] which has no immediate commercial application.\". However, there is no indication in the HPRC Report that such concerns were a factor in the CCS decision; such concerns do not appear either in the reasons invoked by the CCS in support of its February 17, 2011 decision.\n\n335.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the CCS did not make a specific allocation of the spectrum cannot be considered as a deciding element in considering whether the CCS decision was taken for the protection of the Respondent's essential security interests. As the Claimants themselves have argued, such function came under the authority of the ICC. This fact does not restrict the power of the CCS to decide that any particular activity be \"directed to the protection of (the) essential security interests\" of the State. In the present case, if such a decision was taken, there was nothing inappropriate in leaving it to the proper administrative authorities to decide how the spectrum would be allocated between the various interested parties.\n\n336.\n\nThe Tribunal has received uncontroverted evidence that, starting as early as 2004, officials in the Ministry of Defence were concerned about the needs of the Indian military for S-band capacity.\n\n337.\n\nOn April 5, 2004, the Naval Headquarters wrote to ISRO regarding the requirement of the Navy for a dedicated satellite. In this communication it was stated as follows:\n\nThe importance of reliable, secure, real time and uninterrupted tactical as well as strategic communications, in the Navy can never be over emphasised. Ship shore communications serve command and control functions, need to be global in nature and are therefore termed strategic communications.447\n\nDirectorate of Naval Signals, Draft Naval Staff Qualitative Requirements for Naval Communications Satellite, April 5, 2004, p. 2 (Ex. VA-1/JCB-16).\n\n338.\n\nThe importance of space capabilities for the Defence forces was brought out in a note of the Vice Admiral, Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff dated October 14, 2005. The relevant extract of the note reads:\n\n1. Space Systems are beginning to become an integral component of the total combat potential of many nations. It is but imperative that our Defence Forces do not lack in the exploitation of Space for War fighting. Till 2008 Indian Space capability and programmes have been defined and there is no alternative but to exploit available assets except for minor up gradations where feasible, during this time frame. However, beyond that period our Defence Forces should be able to examine and specify the needs to enable our technologists to support our requirements. Space capabilities are vital tools of the Information Revolution and critical to activities of the Defence Forces. Space is emerging as a centre of gravity for information dependent forces and it is highly probable that continued and assured access to Space will be a major determinant of national power [...].\n\n2. Lack of Policy with respect to exploitation of Space Systems, which are now a universally accepted phenomenon, by the Armed Forces, could lead to a void in Space related research and the Defence Forces, could miss the opportunity for early involvement and influence over Space Programmes. This has possibly occurred till 2008 as a fait accompli and we must plan our strategy for space asset accruels beyond 2008. This document would prima facie address our broad technology requirements based on mission statements of our Defence Forces.\n\n3. [...].\n\n4.

The minutes also point out the inescapable necessity of S-band for the armed forces for interference free communications. The required projection of S-band required for armed forces was mentioned as under:\n\n86MHZ-151 MHZ-208 MHZ for short, medium and long term respectively.449\n\nMinutes of Third Task Force Meeting with DoS held on February 21, 2006 at HQ IDS New Delhi, March 6, 2006 (Ex, VA-3/JCB-56).\n\n341.\n\nHQ Integrated Defence Staff in its note of August 9, 2006, sent to Ms. Geeta Vardan PD(SP) ISRO HQ and three officers of the Defence establishment, referred to the Bandwidth Projections of Service HQs for Satellite communications mentioned in Defence State Vision 2020 (DSV) dated October 14, 2005 and requested that the matter be taken up with the DOT for blocking the bandwidth in the S-band and in some other bands specified therein for satellite communications of the three services as per requirements envisaged in DSV 220 *.*450\n\nHQ Integrated Defence Staff Ops Branch/IW & IT Dte, Note, Bandwidth Requirements - Satellite Commn, August 9, 2006 (Ex.

VA-6/JCB-73).\n\n344.\n\nWhile directing that the Expert Committee be formed, it was recorded that the Defence Services had present and future applications in the band from 2.5 GHz to 2.69 GHz on various satellites launched by the DOS and representatives of the DOS were actively involved in the protection of said bands at various national and international forums.\n\n345.\n\nPursuant to the direction of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, the Expert Committee on Spectrum and Satellite Uses of Frequency Band 2.5 to 2.69 GHz (S-band) was constituted. The following observations of the Expert Committee dated September 7, 2007 need to be noticed:\n\n11. If this spectrum (2.5-2.69 GHz) is lost to commercial operators, it would severely jeopardize the future Defence services plans, of providing mobile SATCOM connectivity.\n\n12. In view of the above, it is strongly recommended that the 'S' band Spectrum be safeguarded from being poached by the commercial operators for meeting the future requirements of the Defence Services. Proposal from the IAF for a dedicated satellite to utilize the 'S' Band spectrum, which is under finalization, would also strengthen the case for retention of spectrum. The non availability of the Spectrum could stymie the future operational plans of the Defence services.453\n\nReport of the Expert Committee on Spectrum and Satellite Uses of Frequency Band 2.5 to 2.69 GHz (S-band) by Defence Services, September 2007 (Ex. VA-7/JCB-74).\n\n346.\n\nOn November 19, 2008 a special meeting was held, which was attended by representatives of the Army, Air Force, Navy and ISRO to address satellite-based communication issues. A representative of ISRO proposed that the HQ Integrated Defence Staff need to consolidate the requirement of S-band for various services to enable an optimal utilisation by way of the dedicated S-band-specific satellite.454\n\nMinutes of the Special ISC Meeting between Reps of ISRO & Reps of Three Services to Address Satellite Based Communication Related Issues, November 25, 2008 (Ex. VA-8/JCB-92).\n\n347.\n\nOn December 15, 2009 at a meeting in ISAC, Bangalore, between ISC, HQ Integrated Defence Staff, Ministry of Defence and ISRO, the military presented details concerning the national security requirements for satellite services. At this meeting, the armed forces set forth their requirements for S-band as follows: \"(i) to cater for requirements up to 2012\u2014120 Carriers, 17.5 MHz. out which 50 Carriers are being used by the armed forces;(ii) Additional in 12th Plan\u201440 MHz.; (iii) Additional in 13th Plan\u201450 MHz.\"455\n\nMinutes of Meeting held on December 15, 2009 at ISAC, Bangalore between ISC of HQ IDS, MOD and ISRO, January 25, 2010 (Ex. VA-10/JCB-134).\n\n348.\n\nJoint Communications Electronic Staff of HQ Integrated Defence Staff, by its letter dated April 23, 2010456 informed ISRO of the bandwidth requirements of the Army, Navy and Airforce. As per the Appendix attached to the letter, the requirement of the three wings of the armed forces for S-band were specified:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | *Addl.* | *Total* |\n| *2012* | *17.5* | *120* |\n| *2012 to 2017* | *50* | *52.5* |\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Defence to ISRO/Department of Space, April 23, 2010 (Redacted) (Ex. R-150/ JCB-141).\n\n349.\n\nThe note of the Additional Secretary, Department of Space dated June 30, 2010 referred to the meeting between the Integrated Space Cell and ISRO. The note not only projected the need for S-band by the armed forces but it also referred to the demands of other security agencies such as the BSF, CISF, CRPF and the police for S-band transponders. The requirement for S-band was also projected by the railways for tracking of trains.457\n\nDepartment of Space, Note to Space Commission, Agenda Item No. 4: GSAT-6/6A - Contract between M/s. Antrix Corporation Limited (ACL) and M/s. Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd., signed July 2, 2010, paras 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 of the Note and para. 7 of Annex III (Ex. C-219, exhibited in part as R-29/JCB-160).\n\n350.\n\nThe Tribunal has also received evidence that, subsequently to the CCS decision of February 2011, significant changes have been made to GSAT-6 to accommodate the specific needs of the armed forces458 and that the Defence Research and Development Organization was made responsible for the ground segment development of GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A.459\n\nTestimony of Mr. Sethuraman, Transcript Day 4, pp. 839-840.\n\nDepartment of Space, Note to Space Commission for the 128th Space Commission Meeting, March 28, 2014, paras 4.6 and 4.7 (Ex. KS-15/JCB-287) and Testimony of Mr. Anand, Transcript Day 4, 1082:20-25.\n\n351.\n\nBut this is not the end of the matter. While the events related above provide helpful information concerning the administrative process followed both before and after the CCS decision, what is the determinant factor for the Tribunal is that decision itself and whether it was directed to the protection of the Respondents essential security interests.\n\n352.\n\nThe Tribunal does not question the right of the Respondent to terminate the Agreement and to decide that the S-band would be reserved in the future for non-commercial activities. Two avenues were opened to it; one under Article 6 of the Treaty whereby the Respondent could expropriate for public purposes the rights of the Claimant under the conditions enunciated in that Article and the other one under Article 11(3) when, among other things, the Respondent's decision was \"directed to the protection of the essential security interests\" of the State. Each of these avenues however leads to very different conclusions in terms of liability and compensation.\n\n353.\n\nArticle 11(3) constitutes an important exception to the provisions of the Treaty and, while proper deference must be given to State authority in defining what its essential security interests are, it must be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of the VCLT.\n\n354.\n\nThe problem in the present case is that the decision of the CCS itself contains a mix of objectives. Even though there is nowhere in the CCS decision any specific reference to the Respondent's \"essential security interests,\" the Tribunal, by majority, has no difficulty concluding that the reservation of spectrum for the needs of defence and para-military forces can be classified as \"directed to the protection of its essential security interests\", coming under the exclusion covered in Article 11(3) of the Treaty; however, the same cannot be said when it comes to taking over the spectrum allocated to the Claimants for \"railways and other public utility services as well as for societal needs, and having regard to the needs of the country's strategic requirements,\"460 as stated in the CCS decision.\n\nPress Information Bureau, Government of India, Cabinet *, CCS Decides to Annul Antrix-Devas Deal*, February 17, 2011 (Ex. C-134/JCB-220).\n\n355.\n\nWhile it could quite properly expropriate the Claimants' rights under Article 6 of the Treaty for \"public utility services as well as for societal needs,\" it could not have recourse to Article 11(3) for such purposes and confiscate their rights.\n\n356.\n\nEven the reference to \"the country's strategic requirements,\" unless made specific, such as for the military and para-military needs, would not be restricted to the meaning of the provisions of Article 11(3). That Article does not refer to strategic needs but to essential security interests and the expression \"strategic requirements\" can cover a whole range of government activities; governments all over the world pursue a number of different policies which they describe as strategies essential to the attainment of public interest objectives (economic strategies, public health strategies, energy strategies, etc.) and the situation does not appear to be different in the case of the Respondent. That expression can be found not only in the CCS decision of February 17, 2011, but also in a number of documents produced by the Respondent, such as the Space Commission Note to the CCS of February 16, 2011 and in the Suresh Committee Report and there is no indication in the evidence received by the Tribunal, except the say-so of Messrs. Sethuraman and Anand, that this expression should be interpreted exclusively for \"the protection of essential security interests.\"\n\n357.\n\nMessrs. Sethuraman and Anand, in their oral testimony,461 argued that, in India, \"strategic\" means the armed forces. However, their interpretation appears to be contradicted by the words of the Space Commission itself which, in its direction of July 2, 2010, read: \"Department, in view of priority to be given to nation's strategic requirements including societal ones may take action necessary and instruct ANTRIX to annul the ANTRIX-DEVAS contract.\" Similarly, in its Note to the CCS of February 16, 2011, the Space Commission stated that the purpose of the Note was \"to seek approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security for Annulling\" the Devas Agreement, \"in view of priority to be given to nation's strategic requirements including societal ones.\"462 The same document, in the Approval Sought from the Cabinet Committee on Security, states that due to an \"increased demand for allocation of spectrum for national needs, including for the needs of defence, para-military forces, railways and other public utility services as well as for societal needs, and having regard to the needs of the country's strategic requirements, the Government will not be able to provide orbit slot in S band to Antrix for commercial activities (\u2026).\"463\n\nTestimonies of Mr. Sethuraman (Transcript Day 3, p. 712) and of Mr. Anand (Transcript Day 4, p. 932).\n\nNote for the Cabinet Committee on Security, para. 1 (Ex. C-229/JCB 220).\n\n*Id*., para. 45.1\n\n358.\n\nIt is therefore clear to the Tribunal that the expressions \"strategic needs\" or \"strategic requirements\" covered a range of activities which went far beyond the military or paramilitary sectors or the \"essential security interests\" of the Respondent.\n\n359.\n\nAs to the reference to railways mentioned in the DOS Note to the CCS, the Tribunal was told that it had to do with train tracking (train safety and signaling).464 The Tribunal does not see how such function could come within the ambit of essential security interests.\n\nTestimony of Mr. Anand (Transcript Day 4, p. 959).\n\n360.\n\nAs to \"societal needs,\" the Respondent itself has recognized that these words cover a wide range of government activities which clearly have no relationship with the essential security interests of the State. When asked by the Claimants to describe the meaning of these words, Mr. Anand, appearing on behalf of the Government of India, stated: \"I told you that societal requirements is a pretty wide spectrum. It covers the whole gamut of services which goes under societal tele education, telemedicine, crop forecasting, disaster management, rural communications\u2014there is a huge gamut of activity which goes on the societal applications\".465 The DOS Note to the Space Commission also refers to \"other national societal requirements for emergency communication, dissemination of disaster warnings, tele-education, tele-health and rural communication\".466\n\nTranscript Day 4, p. 1000: 9-15.\n\nDepartment of Space, Note to Space Commission, July 2, 2010, paras. 8.1-8.4 (Ex. R-29/JCB-160).\n\n361.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, the inclusion of \"other public utility services and for societal needs\" covers a lot more than the \"essential security interests\" mentioned in Article 11(3) of the Treaty.\n\n362.\n\nIt is important to note that the CCS, in its February 17, 2011 decision, did not proceed to any allocation of the spectrum but referred the matter to the ICC, a dormant institution which was revived for the purpose. The Tribunal was informed that, by the time of the hearing, that no decision had been taken by the ICC.467 The Tribunal received no information that a decision was taken in that regard even subsequently to the hearing.\n\nTranscript, Day 4, 1014:24-25; 1015:1-7; 1059:8-19.\n\n363.\n\nIt is striking in this respect that the uncertainty in that respect has continued right up to the time of the launch of GSAT-6 on August 27, 2015.\n\n364.\n\nIn a note of March 28, 2014,to the Space Commission for its 128th meeting of April 12, 2014, Mr. Prahlad Rao, Director SCNP, mentions that, following discussions by the Department of Space \"with the user agencies to arrive at a revised utilization plan for GSAT-6/6a,\" it was now proposed to utilize the space segment capacity of GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A spacecrafts for meeting the communication needs (Broadcast and Mobile Applications) of strategic sector including Defence, Paramilitary forces and societal sector including Disaster Management Support and Indian Railways.\"468\n\nNote to Space Commission for the 128th Space Commission Meeting, March 28, 2014, para. 4.2 (App. KS-15/JCB-287).\n\n365.\n\nAt the meeting of the Space Commission on April 12, 2014, the Chairman \"stated that there is an issue of spectrum (BSS) for GSAT-6/6A[\u2026] DOT wants ISRO to vacate the spectrum and auction it. The subject matter was discussed in EGoM and ISRO was asked to provide S-BSS usage to DOT.\"469\n\nMinutes of the 128th Meeting of Space Commission held on April 12, 2014, para. 128.4.1 (App. KS-17/JCB-288).\n\n366.\n\nSubsequently, in a letter to the Tribunal on August 31, 2015, the Respondent submitted a group of documents in connection with the launch of GSAT-6, the submission of which the Tribunal conditionally accepted. Although there are occasional references to the launch of a military satellite in the headlines or the core of some newspaper articles, none of these assertions are based on any reported statement by a public official and the Tribunal cannot consider such references as reliable evidence; in fact, the submitted documents tend to demonstrate that the GSAT-6 satellite continues to be planned for a multiplicity of purposes.\n\n367.\n\nThus, the Chairman of ISRO, Mr. Kiran is quoted as saying that \"(t)he users for this will be the strategic sector as it gives a tremendous opportunity for using very small handheld devices in the remotest places.\"470 The same person is reported by the Times of India to have said on the same day that the satellite would be used for various government purposes.471 The Respondent, who produced these press articles, gave no indication to the effect that the statements attributed to the Chairman of ISRO were not accurate.\n\n*ISRO's Big Launch: Military Communications Satellite GSAT-6,* NDTV, August 27, 2015, available at www ndtv.com (Annex 3 submitted by the Respondent on August 31, 2015).\n\nJanani Sampath, *ISRO's GSLV-D6 with Indigenous Cryo Engines Successfully Places GSAT-6 in Orbit,* The Times of India, August 27, 2015, available at timesofindia.indiatimes.com (Annex 5 submitted by the Respondent on August 31, 2015).\n\n368.\n\nEven more significant is Annex 6 of the documents submitted by the Respondent on August 31, 2015.472 The note from Mr. V.K. Pant, Assistant Wireless Adviser, in DOT, states that \"(b)ased on the decisions of the Cabinet a document on Defence Band and Defence Interest Zone has been issued to Ministry of Defence on 12th March 2015. The relevant extract relating to the S band is enclosed, as desired.\" That extract reads as follows: \"The band segments (a) 2500-2635 MHz (35MHz) (b) 2555-2535 MHz (80 MHz) and (c) 2655-2690 MHz (35 MHz) will be used for Defence, security and societal applications.\" It therefore appears that, right up to the time of the launch of the satellite, GSAT-6 was destined to a mixed application, some of it coming under wording of Article 11 (3) and some of it being clearly for the pursuit of a public purpose under Article 6 of the Treaty.\n\nMemo from V.K. Pant, Department of Telecommunications, to Member (Finance), Department of Space, April 1, 2015 (Annex 6 submitted by the Respondent on August 31, 2015).\n\n369.\n\nThe Respondent has submitted evidence showing substantial requirements by the Department of Defence for S-band spectrum (17.5 MHz up to 2012, an additional 40 MHz up to 2017 and 50MHz up to 2022).473 The evidence submitted to the Tribunal demonstrates that these requests covered both the MSS and the BSS parts of the spectrum. As to the Claimants' argument that, in reallocating a BSS part of the spectrum to MSS spectrum, the Respondent would have contravened the ITU's Radio Regulations474, Mr. John Lewis, an expert retained by the Claimants, has clearly answered in his oral testimony that, once a particular international frequency table has been allocated to a country by the ITU, the decision as to the re-allocation between BSS and MSS applications is a matter of \"national decision, and the ITU has no role to monitor or overview decisions of this nature.\"475 In addition, Mr. Sethuraman testified that the two satellites 6 and 6A would not be sufficient to meet the requirements of the military.476 However, if the Respondent was willing to approve the large allocation requests of the armed forces, it would have simply done so by reserving the S-band to meet its essential security needs. The Tribunal has received no evidence of any specific assignment of spectrum to the military and paramilitary sectors and, as indicated above, there were even debates inside the administration in 2014 as to the possible auctioning of some part of the S-band spectrum to the private sector, notwithstanding the CCS decision of 2011 to exclude commercial activities from that spectrum.\n\n*See supra*, para. 347.\n\nClaimants' Statement of Reply, para. 57,\n\nTestimony of Mr. John Lewis, Transcript Day 3, p. 568:12-14.\n\nTestimony of Mr. Sethuraman, Transcript Day 4, p. 848:15-25.\n\n370.\n\nAlthough the requests of the military for part of the S-band spectrum are large, the Tribunal notes that no specific allocation has been made by the Respondent, and the Tribunal cannot assume that such requests will be approved in full by the Respondent. All around the world, governments are faced every year with very large demands for funds for various projects from their military establishment and, just as regularly, governments grant only a percentage of such requests.\n\n371.\n\nThe Tribunal, by majority, therefore concludes that, although the CCS decision of 2011 appears to have been in part \"directed to the protection of its essential security interests,\" that part remained undefined and several other objectives were included in that decision, which had nothing to do with national security. In the circumstances, the Tribunal rules that, although the Respondent was fully entitled to reassign the S-spectrum to non-commercial use, the part which was not reserved for military or paramilitary purposes would be subject to the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty concerning expropriation.\n\n372.\n\nMoreover, in the present case, the request by the armed forces for the attribution of spectrum is spread over a number of years (up to 2022) and, looking at the past performance of the space program, it is extremely doubtful that the envisaged schedule could be realistic. In fact, the requirement of 17.5 MHZ up to 2012 had not even been allocated by the time of the launch of GSAT-6 in 2015.\n\n373.\n\nOn the basis of the evidence submitted to it as described above and bearing in mind that the Respondent had already reserved to itself 10% of the spectrum in question,477 the Tribunal, by majority, is of the view that a reasonable allocation of spectrum directed to the protection of the Respondent's essential security interests would not exceed 60% of the S-band spectrum allocated to the Claimants, the remaining 40% being allocated for other public interest purposes and being subject to the expropriation conditions under Article 6 of the Treaty. It will be up to the Tribunal, in the next phase of this arbitral process (damages), to establish the compensation due to the Claimants in that respect.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 45; Statement of Defence, para. 42.\n\n374.\n\nThis is independent of any liability Antrix may have incurred for contractual breach of the Devas Agreement.\n\n**CHAPTER VII - EXPROPRIATION**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n375.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, as a result of the measures of India's various governmental agencies leading to the annulment of the Devas Agreement, the Respondent has unlawfully expropriated their investments in India in violation of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty.478\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras 57-61; Statement of Claim, paras 160-98; Statement of Reply, paras 116-41; Transcript, Day 5, 1149:12-1150-17.\n\n376.\n\nThe Respondent's primary contention is that no identifiable right or asset of the Claimants was expropriated,479 but in any event, rejects the Claimants' analysis of this claim.480\n\nStatement of Defence, paras 99-120; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras 91-103.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras 113-15. *See* generally Transcript, Day 1, 174:4-180:7; Day 5, 1298:181299:24.\n\n377.\n\nArticle 6 of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\n(1) Investments of investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effects equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation except for public purposes under due process of law, on a non-discriminatory basis and against fair and equitable compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at a fair and equitable rate until the date of payment, shall be made without unreasonable delay and shall be effectively realizable and be freely transferable.\n\n(2) The investor affected by the expropriation shall have the right, under the law of the Contracting Party making the expropriation, to review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, of his or its case and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles set out in this paragraph.\n\n(3) Where a Contracting Party expropriates, nationalises or takes measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation against the assets of a company which is incorporated or constituted under the laws in force in any part of its own territory, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party owns shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to ensure fair and equitable compensation as specified therein to such investors of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.\n\n378.\n\nArticle 7, which deals with transfer of investment capital and returns, provides that \"(a)ll transfers shall be effected without reasonable delay in any freely convertible currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on the date of transfer.\"\n\n***1. The Existence of an Expropriation***\n------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, whether or not there is an expropriation for the purpose of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty turns on whether an investment is \"subjected to measures having effects equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation.\"481 In this context, the Claimants argue that \"expropriation\" includes \"covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or economic benefit of property;\"482 and \"direct or indirect interference with intangible assets including contract rights.\"483\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 163, referring to Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Mauritius and the Government of the Republic of India for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, September 4, 1998, Article 6(2) (Ex. C-1/JCB-8).\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 163, referring to *Metalclad Corp. v. Mexico*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award, 2000, para. 103 (Ex. CL -23). The Claimants note that other arbitral decisions have upheld a similar notion of expropriation, including *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 2001, para. 606 (Ex. CL-5); *Gemplus S.A. v. Mexico; Talsud S.A. v. Mexico*, ICSID Cases Nos. ARB(AF)/04/3 & ARB(AF)/04/4, Award, 2010, paras 8-23 (Ex. CL-15); or *RosInvestCo. UK Ltd. v.

CL-27).\n\n380.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimants' assets and rights, such as its interest in Devas, indirect ownership of the Devas Agreement and indirect ownership of the Devas system and business and pre-emptive right to an allocation of the S-band under the Devas Agreement were capable of being and, in fact were, directly and indirectly expropriated and/or nationalized by the Government of India.484 Such an expropriation, the Claimants submit, is evident from the factual record demonstrating that the coordinated measures adopted by the CCS, DOS, the Space Commission and ISRO/Antrix during the review process of the Devas Agreement,485 which led to the annulment of the Devas Agreement and rights therein, plainly had the deliberate and objective effect of depriving the Claimants of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of their investments in Devas.486\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 165, 173.\n\n*See supra*, Chapter III - E; Statement of Claim, para. 166.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 122, 167; Statement of Reply, paras 117, 125.\n\n**b. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants' expropriation claim is fundamentally flawed in that no identifiable right or asset was expropriated,487 a point which the Respondent says the Claimants do not dispute.488\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 99.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 93.\n\n382.\n\nThe Respondent criticizes the Claimants' failure to identify precisely the scope of the rights or assets at issue, but in any event, argues that the Claimants' claim is deficient as they seek compensation for rights that they never had. Notably, the assets and interests identified by the Claimants as being expropriated are (i) not rights or assets of any kind belonging to the Claimants themselves; and (ii) entirely dependent on Devas acquiring rights under the Devas Agreement that could not be affected by governmental action.489\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 101.\n\n383.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the Claimants' shareholdings in Devas have been expropriated490 and insofar as Claimants' investments derive from the Devas Agreement,491 the Respondent argues that the only right acquired by Devas was the right to a refund of the upfront capacity reservation fees paid prior to the date of termination of the agreement.492\n\n*Id*., para. 102.\n\n*Id*., para. 104.\n\n*Id*., paras 104-05; *Devas Multimedia Pvt.

Lawfulness of the Expropriation***\n----------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Claimants argue that India's expropriation was unlawful because it does not satisfy the four conditions set out in Article 6 of the Treaty.494 In fact, they say, none of those conditions are satisfied, such that India's expropriation was unlawful in every respect.495\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 174; Statement of Reply, para. 139, both referring to Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Mauritius and the Government of the Republic of India for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, September 4, 1998, Article 6(1) (Ex. C-1/JCB-8) (emphasis by the Claimants).\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 174-98.\n\n386.\n\nThe Respondent, by contrast, maintains its primary argument that the Claimants did not possess any \"acquired rights\" such that no expropriation occurred,496 and, in any case, rejects the Claimants' allegation of unlawful expropriation.497\n\nStatement of Defence, paras 99-20; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras 113-14.\n\nStatement of Defence, fn. 258; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras 113-15.\n\n**a. Public Purpose**\n---------------------\n\ni. The Claimants' Position\n--------------------------\n\n387.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the \"public purpose\" condition within the Treaty498 requires the Respondent to demonstrate that (i) its measures were actually for public purposes, and not based on a mere assertion;499 (ii) the expropriation was proportional to the purported public purpose;500 and (iii) the expropriatory measures must not be \"financially motivated,\" either in favor of the State itself or other investors.501\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 176-77; Statement of Reply, paras 139-41.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 176; *ADC Affiliate Ltd. v.

The Claimants explain that Dr. Radhakrishnan consulted with DOT and the Department of Law and Justice, but does not refer to any agencies concerned with \"defence, paramilitary forces, railways or other public utility services,\" whose \"needs\" supposedly animated the policy decision of the CCS.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 177, 182, fn. 236; Statement of Reply, para. 140(a).\n\n389.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants rely on the following to challenge the alleged \"public purposes:\"\n\n(a) the lack of involvement of any agencies that purportedly had \"needs\" of S-band spectrum throughout Dr. Radhakrishnan's process to annul the Devas Agreement;505\n\n(b) the state of disuse of the S-band spectrum for any purpose, including for those purported \"needs\" of any agencies;506\n\n(c) the continuing call for the S-band spectrum to be made available to other commercial operators,507 which first began in 2008 and were evident at the time of Dr. Radhakrishnan's \"review\" of the Devas Agreement;508\n\n(d) the contrast509 between India's covert and *ad hoc* \"policy\" to extricate itself from the Devas Agreement in 2011510 and the careful analysis performed by the Shankara Committee prior to the initial decision to enter into the Devas Agreement in 2004.511\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 178-79, referring to Opinion of the ASG (Ex.

The Claimants' Position\n--------------------------\n\n392.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the concept of \"due process\" in Article 6 of the Treaty requires more than mere compliance with local law; it also incorporates principles of international due process.518 These include: (i) the obligation of the host State to notify the investor of the proposed expropriatory measure and give it the opportunity to be heard and/or mitigate the impact of the threatened measures;519 and (ii) the conduct of the expropriation with \"reasonable advance notice and a fair hearing\" and not \"in a manner that can at best be described as opaque.\" Due process can also be denied substantively, i.e. when a host State ignores and violates its own and/or international law in the conduct of an expropriation.520\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 186; *Kardassopoulos v.

CL-20).\n\n393.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, India's clandestine conduct leading up to the cancellation of the Devas Agreement is a classical denial of due process.521 The whole review process of the Devas Agreement and the decision to cancel it522 were made behind closed doors, and were presented without any prior notice to Devas or Claimants as a *fait accompli*, with no opportunity to present objections to India's decisions523\u2014a fact acknowledged by the Respondent.524 All this is exacerbated by India's public indications of support for the Devas system and Devas' performance of the Devas Agreement, in reliance upon those indications of support.525 As the *Kardassopoulos* tribunal remarked, \"[b]ack-door press reports are the opposite of due process.\"526\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 189-91.\n\n*See supra*, Chapter III - E.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 189.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 140(c).\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 190; *see supra*, Chapter III - D.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 191, referring to *Kardassopoulos v.

CL-20).\n\n394.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants aver that the decision to fabricate a *force majeure* event was carried out in contravention of the contractual requirement that a *force majeure* event must be \"beyond the reasonable control of the party affected\" and have only have occurred \"despite all efforts of the Affected Party to prevent it or mitigate its effects.\"527\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 189, referring to Devas Agreement, Article 11 (Ex. C-16).\n\nii. The Respondent's Position\n-----------------------------\n\n395.\n\nThe Respondent argues unequivocally that due process does not require consultation with the Claimants as to national security matters, and the Claimants simply had no vested right to be consulted on this issue.528\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 85, fn. 258; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 114(4).\n\n***3. Potential Discrimination in the Expropriation***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n396.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, discrimination in the expropriation context occurs when an investment is nationalised \"for reasons unrelated to the host State's legitimate regulatory objectives;\" such that expropriation of a foreign investment solely due to foreign ownership would violate this condition.529\n\nK.J. Vandevelde, *Bilateral Investment Treaties* (OUP 2010), p. 273 (Ex. CL-45); *see also* *ADC Affiliate Ltd. v. Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2006, para. 443 (Ex. CL-1); *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 2001, para. 612 (Ex. CL-5).\n\n397.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the measures in question were discriminatory because they were aimed exclusively at extinguishing the interests of Devas, and were motivated in part by the fact that Devas had foreign ownership interests by the Claimants and DT Asia.530\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 194, citing Chaturvedi Report, March 12, 2011, para. 3.5.9 (App. KS-10), which reads: \"The shareholding in Devas and changes in it subsequently have also been a serious cause of concern.... The original proposal, which had envisaged development and innovation by some former ISRO scientists, seem to have been diluted with the entry of major foreign players. While technically this was permitted, the entry of foreign telecom companies with huge premiums indicated that they had used this as an opportunity for entering the telecom market, which had in the meanwhile expanded rapidly in India during 2005-10. This was not an intended purpose of the original agreement.\" *See also* Statement of Claim, paras 135-37; *see supra*, fn.391.\n\n**b. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n398.\n\nThe Respondent denies that the Government of India's policy decision to reserve the S-band for non-commercial, strategic use was discriminatory in any way, as there was no differentiation in the treatment accorded to the Claimants as compared to other entities or sectors.531 Regarding the Claimants' argument that India's \"attacks\" on the Devas Agreement \"were motivated in part by the fact that the Claimants were non Indian,\" the Respondent points out that the CCS did not reserve S-band for commercial use of Indians; it reserved S-band for non-commercial, strategic use, preventing any private use of S-band by anyone, irrespective of nationality or ownership.532\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 164, fn. 258.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 114(3).\n\n***4. Fair and Equitable Compensation***\n----------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n399.\n\nThe Claimants note that Article 6(1) of the Treaty mandates that \"fair and equitable compensation\" \"made without unreasonable delay\" is a condition of any expropriation.533 The failure to pay \"market value\" compensation alone constitutes a breach of the Treaty, and is no different from a complete failure to make any payment.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 195, referring to Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Mauritius and the Government of the Republic of India for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, September 4, 1998, article 6(1) (Ex. C-1/JCB-8).\n\n400.\n\nIn this instance, the Claimants emphasize that the Respondent has not even attempted to pay the Claimants the fair market value of their lost investment,534 and has in fact repudiated its duty to do so.535 The purported tender by Antrix of a refund of the upfront capacity reservation fee, even assuming that the tender could be attributed to India, manifestly does not correlate to the fair market value of the Devas system and business at the time of the taking.536\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 131-32; *see supra*, para. 89.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 198; Statement of Reply, para. 140(d).\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 140(d). *See supra*, para. 89.\n\n**b. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n401.\n\nThe Respondent argues that India did not offer to pay compensation because the Claimants had no right to compensation.537 Antrix tendered a check to Devas to reimburse the upfront capacity reservation fees paid by Devas prior to the termination of the Devas Agreement, which was rejected by Devas.538 The Respondent characterizes this conduct by the Claimants as an unjustified attempt to claim additional compensation from the State in circumstances where their claim is dependent on and limited by the Devas Agreement.539 In any event, the Respondent submits that the fair market value would be less than the amount tendered to and rejected by Devas.540\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 114(5).\n\n*See supra*, para. 156.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 114(5).\n\n*Id*., para. 114(5); referring to *Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd. v. Antrix Corp. Ltd.*, Expert Report on Valuation, Vladimir Brailovsky & Daniel Flores, November 15, 2013 (Ex. R-4).\n\n***5. The Pendency of a Breach of Contract Claim***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n402.\n\nThe Claimants aver that, regardless of the outcome of the ICC arbitration, the provisions of the Devas Agreement do not preclude a finding of expropriation or obviate the Respondent's obligation to pay damages for such expropriation.541\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 137.\n\n403.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, \"the fact that a breach may give rise to a contract claim does not mean that it cannot also\u2014and separately\u2014give rise to a treaty claim. Even if the two perfectly coincide, they remain analytically distinct, and necessarily require different enquiries.\"542 Accordingly, although \"a mere failure to comply with a contractual obligation [would not] constitute expropriation,\" a violation of a contract \"which was the result of use of sovereign power, such as a decree annulling the contractual rights, may amount to an expropriation.\"543 Therefore, the Respondent cannot escape liability for expropriation by relying on the provisions of the Devas Agreement.544\n\n*Id*., para. 126, citing *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2005, para. 258 (Ex. CL-17). The Claimants note that the Respondent's own authorities recognize this distinction; *See* Statement of Reply, paras 126-27, referring to *Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 2009, para. 444; *AWG Group v. Argentina*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Liability, 2010, para. 184; *Malicorp Ltd. v. Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/081/18, Award 2011, para. 103(c).\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 127, citing M. Feit, 'Responsibility of the State under International Law for the Breach of Contract Committed by State-Owned Entity' (2010) 28 Berkeley Journal of International Law 132, p. 160 (Ex. R-114).\n\nStatement of Reply, paras 128-136.\n\n404.\n\nIn this instance, the Claimants assert that the *force majeure* clause545 of the Devas Agreement cannot justify the expropriation. Notwithstanding the results of the contractual dispute in the ICC arbitration,546 nothing in this agreement or in the Treaty insulates the Respondent from its own State responsibility under the Treaty for the action it took *qua* sovereign to \"annul\" a contract.547\n\nDevas Agreement, Article 11 (Ex. C-16). *See supra*, para. 101.\n\n*See supra*, para. 161.\n\nStatement of Reply, paras 128, 134.\n\n405.\n\nIn the same vein, the Respondent cannot escape liability for expropriation by relying upon Article 7(b) and (c) of the Devas Agreement, governing the termination of this contract.548 To accept the Respondent's position would give \"Antrix *carte blanche* to terminate the contract on any basis it wanted and then cap its contractual liability by refunding Devas the Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees.\"549\n\n*Id*., paras 129-33; *See supra*, para. 94.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 129, referring to Statement of Defence, para. 8. *See supra*, para. 94.\n\n406.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants argue that the Respondent acknowledges that the provisions of Article 7(b) and (c) are not operative.550 The ASG recognized that Article 7(c) was inoperative by July 2010, once the frequency and orbital slot coordination was obtained.551 The Respondent's invocation of Article 7(b) fares no better, as its effects could have only been triggered if Devas had exercised its option to terminate the contract under this Article\u2014and not Antrix, as it actually happened.552\n\nStatement of Reply, paras 129-32.\n\n*Id*., paras 130-31, referring to Opinion of the ASG, p. 3 (Ex. R-30/JCB-165).\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 133.\n\n407.\n\nFinally, even if, as the Respondent asserts,553 Article 7 were construed as limiting Antrix's contractual damages in the event of improper termination, the Claimants submit that this cannot operate to insulate the Respondent from liability for violations of the Treaty, especially in light of the fact that Antrix would have been obliged to perform the contract had the expropriation not occurred.554\n\n*Id*., para. 136, referring to Statement of Defence, fn. 5.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 136 (emphasis by the Claimants).\n\n**b. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants' argument regarding the pendency of a breach of contract claim responds to a non-issue in this arbitration.555 The Respondent agrees that a distinction exists between a breach of contract by a State acting in a commercial capacity and a breach effected through the exercise of sovereign powers.556 Nonetheless, in the Respondent's view, the Claimants' discussion is relevant only to a case where the State has breached its contractual obligations through the exercise of sovereign authority, whereas no claim has been raised that India breached the Devas Agreement.557 Rather, the issue is whether the State exercised its sovereign authority to abrogate any commitment it had to the Claimants, and, on that score, there can be no genuine dispute.558 The Respondent contends that, in a case where the State has no contractual obligation, adopting the Claimants' theory would mean that any exercise of sovereign authority having an adverse impact on a private party would constitute an expropriation, which is untenable.559\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 104.\n\n*Id*., para. 105, referring to Statement of Reply, para. 127.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, paras 105, 108 (emphasis by the Respondent).\n\n*Id*., para. 107.\n\n*Id*., paras 106, 112.\n\n409.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, nothing in the Claimants' discussion on the *force majeure* clause and the termination provisions of the Devas Agreement has any bearing on these basic points.560 The Respondent first denies that it could have ever stated, as the Claimants submit, that \"the expropriation was justified merely because the contract contemplated a 'Force Majeure Event,'\"561 since it has always been the Respondent's position that no expropriation occurred in this case.562 The relevance of the *force majeure* clause, as well as all other provisions of the Devas Agreement reviewed in the Statement of Defence,563 is that they all make clear that Devas did not have an acquired right to proceed with the Devas Agreement uninterrupted by any governmental action, and that implementation of the project required a number of governmental approvals which the Government of India had no commitment whatsoever to issue.564\n\n*Id*., paras 109-11.\n\n*Id*., para. 110, referring to Statement of Reply, para. 128.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 110.\n\n*See supra* Chapter III - C.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras 8-9; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 111.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nThe Tribunal will address seriatim the arguments raised by the Parties. In light of the above conclusion of the Tribunal establishing the Respondent's partial liability, any liability under Article 6 of the Treaty would only apply to the 40% of the value of the Agreement resulting from the application of the CCS decision to matters other than the essential security interests of the State.\n\n***1. The Existence of an Expropriation***\n------------------------------------------\n\n411.\n\nThe Tribunal has already ruled above565 that the Claimants were qualifying both as investors and having made an investment under the Treaty, and that part of the CCS decision opened the door to claims for expropriation under the Treaty. There is no need to repeat here the considerations which led the Tribunal to that conclusion. The Claimants therefore had property which could be the subject of expropriation.\n\n*See supra*, para. 210.\n\n***2. The Lawfulness of the Expropriation***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n412.\n\nThe Tribunal will proceed to analyze the five elements covered by the Parties in that respect.\n\n**a. Public Purpose**\n---------------------\n\n413.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the expropriation by the Respondent was made for a public purpose. Even leaving aside the military and paramilitary needs which the Tribunal has found to come under Article 11(3) of the Treaty, the reference by the Respondent in the CCS decision to \"other public utility services as well as for societal needs\" clearly indicate that the annulment of the Devas Agreement was made for public purposes. Article 6 of the Treaty does not require the Respondent to spell out in detail what these specific public purposes are but, in any event, Mr. Anand, in his testimony referred to above,566 has described the wide spectrum of services which could come under that definition and which are clearly coming under the public purpose condition mentioned in Article 6.\n\n*See supra,* para. 360, fn. 467.\n\n414.\n\nAs to the Claimants' argument that the Respondent's actions were not \"proportional\" to that purpose, the Tribunal recognizes that, as stated in *Deutsche Bank AG v. Sri Lanka*,567 \"(a) number of tribunals, including *Tecmed v. Mexico, Azurix v. Argentina and LG&E v. Argentina* have adopted a proportionality requirement in relation to expropriatory treatment.\" On the basis of the evidence submitted, the Tribunal is of the view that the measure adopted by the CCS was justified by a substantial public interest.\n\n*Deutsche Bank AG v. Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/02, Award, 2012, para. 522\n\n**b. Due Process**\n------------------\n\n415.\n\nThe difficulty in the present case is the dual purpose of the decision of the CCS, which acted in part for reasons of national security under Article 11(3) and for general public purposes covered by Article 6 of the Treaty.\n\n416.\n\nAs to the argument of the Respondent that due process does not require consultation as to national security matters, the Tribunal agrees that such circumstances absolve the Respondent from following the principles of international due process enunciated above by the Claimants.\n\n417.\n\nAs to the non-security purposes of the CCS decision, the Tribunal considers that the principles of international due process mentioned by the Claimants should apply. In that respect, the Respondent breached that condition of Article 6 of the Treaty.\n\n**c. Potential Discrimination in the Expropriation**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nAlthough there is passing reference to foreign parties or foreign investment in the DOS Note for the Cabinet Committee on Security of February 16, 2011, none of these references give any indication that the participation of foreign parties or foreign investment was a factor that played any role in the recommendation of DOS to the CCS. Furthermore, nothing in the decision of the CCS can lead to the conclusion that such factors were taken into account in any way.\n\n419.\n\nThe argument of the Claimants in this respect is therefore rejected.\n\n**d. Fair and Equitable Compensation**\n--------------------------------------\n\n420.\n\nThe Tribunal, by majority, has concluded that the Claimants would be entitled to compensation for the part of the decision of the CCS that does not relate to \"the essential security interests\" of the State.\n\n421.\n\nThe fact that Antrix tendered a check to Devas to reimburse the upfront capacity reservation fees paid by Devas under the Agreement is irrelevant for this matter. As indicated above, the Parties agree that a distinction must be made between the contractual obligations between Devas and Antrix and the obligations of the Respondent under the Treaty.\n\n422.\n\nIn the present instance, it is uncontested that the Respondent paid no compensation whatsoever to the Claimants when it expropriated the Claimants' investment for purposes other than its \"essential security interests.\"\n\n**e. The Pendency of a Breach of Contract Claim**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nThe debate between the Parties on this subject has been in good part been overtaken by events, the ICC tribunal having found that Antrix was in breach of its contractual obligations and that it must pay USD 535 million plus interest to Devas.\n\n424.\n\nIn the present case, there was no contractual obligation between the Claimants and the Respondent and the Tribunal is only called upon to decide whether there has been a breach of obligations under the Treaty.\n\n***3. Conclusion***\n-------------------\n\n425.\n\nOn the basis of the above analysis, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that the Claimants are entitled to claim compensation under Article 6 of the Treaty for the expropriation of their investment for the part of the Respondent's decision which relates to matters other than national security, as discussed above.\n\n**CHAPTER VIII - FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n426.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Treaty provides, in relevant part:\n\n(1) Investments and returns of investors of either Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\n\n427.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the expropriatory nature of the Respondent's actions, as well as its violation of the Claimants' \"legitimate expectations\" as investors in India mandate the conclusion that the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\") standard embodied in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. According to the Claimants, such breach exists regardless of the actual content of the FET standard applicable under the Treaty.568\n\nStatement of Claim, paras 199-215; Statement of Reply, paras 142-68; *See* Notice of Arbitration, paras 65-67; Transcript, Day 5, 1150:18-1155:18.\n\n428.\n\nThe Respondent's primary contention is that the FET standard embodied in the Treaty does not go beyond the minimum standard required by customary international law, and, even if an expansive FET standard were applicable, the Claimants' claims would still be untenable.569\n\nStatement of Defence, paras 121-56; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras 116-33; Transcript, Day 1, 180:8-184:25; Day 5, 1299:25-1301:22.\n\n***1. The Applicable Standard of Treatment***\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n429.\n\nThe Claimants' position is that a broad standard of FET applies to the present case. This standard of treatment is construed as \"an obligation to treat a foreign investor's investment in a way that does not frustrate the investor's underlying legitimate and reasonable expectations,\"570 and not in a way that is manifestly inconsistent, non-transparent, unreasonable...or discriminatory..\"571 This standard also includes \"the exercise of good faith or the absence of manifest irrationality, arbitrariness or perversity by [the host State],\"572 and \"a proportionate relationship\" between the supposed governmental aims and the State measures in question.573\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 201, citing *Saluka Investments.

In the Claimants' view, these cases, providing for the protection of the legitimate expectations of the investor, embody the FET standard applicable under Article 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\n430.\n\nFor the Claimants, the Respondent's argument that no broad FET standard applies is negated by the *White Industries* award,574 in which the equivalent clause in the Australia-India BIT was interpreted as \"a mainstream treaty FET clause, protecting an investor's 'legitimate expectations.'\"575 Accordingly, the Respondent's submission that the FET clause in India's BITs should be interpreted differently than other similarly-worded clauses fails.576\n\nStatement of Reply, paras 143-44, referring to *White Industries Australia Ltd. v.

CL-11).\n\n432.\n\nEven if the 1969 OECD Draft Convention on the Protection on Foreign Property (the **\"OECD Draft Convention\"**)581 treats a treaty-based FET clause as equivalent to the customary international law level of protection,582 the Claimants contend that the manifest intention of this Draft Convention was to buttress the customary international law minimum standard by emphasizing that it already required FET.583\n\nDraft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property, OECD, Article 1 and Notes and Comments to Article 1, para. 4(a) (Ex.

McLachlan, 'Investment Treaties and General International Law' (2008) 57 International and Comparative Law Quarterly 361, p. 382 (Ex. CL-71). The Claimants make a similar argument regarding the Respondent's reliance on Swiss government policy (*see* Statement of Defence, para. 124, fn. 265, citing *Opinions of the Public International Law Directorate of the Swiss Federal Political Department (Memoire de la Direction du Droit International Public du Departement Politique Federal),* in L. Caflisch, *La pratique suisse en matiere de droit international public,* p. 178 (Ex. R-74). According to the Claimants, if read in context, the Swiss government's statements equating FET with the customary standard appear to be an attempt to promote both standards, not weaken them.\n\n433.\n\nThe Claimants also consider the excerpts and authorities relied upon by the Respondent to reject an expanded FET standard beyond the minimum standard of treatment provided by customary international law and argue that they do not support the Respondent's case.584 According to the Claimants, these are all post-2001 NAFTA authorities, which are not useful in an analysis of the FET provision in the Treaty585 because of specific Notes of Interpretation by the three NAFTA States pursuant to which the NAFTA FET standard was defined as not requiring \"treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary minimum standard of treatment.\"586\n\nStatement of Reply, paras 156-57, referring to Statement of Defence, paras 125-27.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 156. At Statement of Reply, para. 157, the Claimants make a similar argument regarding India's reliance on the U.S. and Canadian Model BITs and on resolutions of European institutions, as they expressly limit, or purport to limit, their FET standard to customary minimum treatment standard (*see supra*, fn. 603).\n\nNAFTA Free Trade Commission, Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter 11 Provisions, para. 2(2), July 31, 2002.\n\n434.\n\nWhatever the answer to the relationship between the FET standard and customary international law, the Claimants argue that the *Neer* standard cited by India is inapposite to the present case.587 Notably, (i) *Neer* is not an investment protection case, as it concerned the host State's alleged failure to punish criminals responsible for the killing of a U.S. citizen;588 (ii) *Neer* does not discuss the words \"fair and equitable\" that the Tribunal must interpret;589 (iii) the so-called *Neer* test\u2014 which turns on whether conduct has fallen below \"international standards\"\u2014is ultimately a circular standard that leaves those standards undefined.590 Finally, even under NAFTA's 2001 revision, only *Glamis Gold* has expressed the \"customary international law minimum\" in terms of the *Neer* standard.591 A majority of cases follows the *Mondev* view that customary international law has moved on since *Neer* and now sustains a broader concept of FET.592\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 158, referring to *L.F.H.

The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n435.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the applicable standard is the minimum standard of FET under customary international law, the content of which is to be construed from a number of decisions following the 1926 *Neer v. Mexico* decision,593 which provides that \"the threshold [for the application of the standard] is extremely high\" and \"outrageous or egregious conduct is required before a violation is established.\"594\n\nThe Tribunal in *Neer v. Mexico* held that in order to violate this standard, the treatment of an alien \"should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency.\" *See L.F.H. Neer and Pauline E. Neer v. Mexico*, Mexico-U.S. General Claims Commission, Docket No. 136, Opinion, 15 October 1926 (1927) 21 American Journal Of International Law 555, p. 556 (Ex.

At Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 120, the Respondent also responds to the Claimants' interpretation of Swiss government policy, under which both the customary and the broad FET standards are promoted, by highlighting that no such affirmation is made (*see* Statement of Reply, fn. 296, citing *Opinions of the Public International Law Directorate of the Swiss Federal Political Department (Memoire de la Direction du Droit International Public du Departement Politique Federal),* in L. Caflisch, *La pratique suisse en matiere de droit international public,* p. 178 (Ex. R-74). Likewise, the Respondent is critical about the Claimants' reliance on Professor Mann to contend that the minimum treatment envisaged by FET goes beyond the minimum standard (*see* Statement of Reply, para. 153, citing F.A. Mann, 'British Treaties for the Promotion and Protection of Investments' (1981) 52 The British Yearbook of International Law 241, p. 244 (Ex. CL-56). According to the Respondent, Professor Mann's subsequent writings directly contradict this view. *See* Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 121, citing F.A. Mann, *The Legal Aspect of Money* (5th Edition, OUP 1992), p. 510 (Ex.

The Alleged Violation of the FET Standard***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n439.\n\nThe Claimants argue that, throughout DOS' approval and repeated endorsement of the Devas Agreement, which carried the full imprimatur of the Government of India,611 the Respondent created the legitimate expectation that Devas had a non-pre-emptible, exclusive right to use the S-band and operate the Devas system, and therefore that the State would not seek to undermine the Devas Agreement.612 Many of these assurances were made directly to the Claimants, and were thus plainly intended to induce the Claimants to inject capital.613\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 210; Statement of Reply, para. 163, citing *White Industries Australia Ltd. v. India*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 2011, para. 10.3.7 (Ex. CL-38).\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 164.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 210; Statement of Reply, para. 163.\n\n440.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent thereafter fabricated a *force majeure* decision to try to mask a deliberate revocation of the Devas Agreement,614 making only abrupt, \"ambush\" announcements regarding its intentions.615 The Claimants allege that their legitimate expectations in connection with their investment in Devas were completely subverted by these actions.616 Such conduct, the Claimants argue, constitutes an abuse of regulatory discretion seeking to destroy the agreed legal framework for the investment,617 not only in violation of the duty to act transparently and consistently618 but also against good faith.619\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 166.\n\n*See supra*, Chapter III - E.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 209; Statement of Reply, para. 165.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 168, citing *AWG Group v.

The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n442.\n\nThe Respondent's stance is that the Claimants' FET claims would not have merit even under their broad interpretation of the FET provision of the Treaty623 and are an attempt to fill *pro forma* the hole in their expropriation case.624\n\nStatement of Defence, paras 130-42; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras 129-33.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, para. 133.\n\n443.\n\nThe Respondent avers that the Claimants' \"legitimate expectations\" are based on a number of mistaken assumptions625 and ignore various key facts. First, the Government of India was not a party to the Devas Agreement, but a regulator, and no commitment or stabilization clause prevented it from taking policy decisions that might affect the Devas Agreement.626 Second, the S-band spectrum could not be used for terrestrial communications under current Indian regulations and policies.627 Third, the Government of India could not issue a license for the terrestrial component of the proposed Devas Services without auction, in contravention of TRAI policy.628 Finally, the Devas Agreement itself set forth a comprehensive scheme for its potential termination, which had been thoroughly negotiated and provided for nothing but the refund of the paid upfront capacity reservation fees if it were invoked.629\n\n*See* Statement of Defence, para. 134.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 138; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras 129, 131-32, citing, *inter alia*, *Total S.A. v.

R-99).\n\n445.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent notes that the Claimants do not point to any fact to support the allegation that its conduct \"unjustly enriched the state at the expense of the investor.\"635 The Claimants stance cannot prevail because (i) the Claimants had no acquired rights in this case; and (ii) the State did not take the policy decision to enrich itself, as the S-band was reserved for noncommercial, strategic purposes.636\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 139, referring to Statement of Claim, para. 211.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 139. *See* *Total S.A. v.

CL-11).\n\n446.\n\nThe Respondent finally argues that Government officials requesting corporate information or conducting tax audits cannot be legitimately said to be acting \"in bad faith.\"637 Also, the Claimants have shown that they are perfectly capable of exercising the right to seek a remedy for such allegedly improper investigations in the appropriate courts of India.638\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 141, fn. 323.\n\n*Id*., para. 141, referring to Viswanathan I, paras 218-19, 222; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 130.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n447.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that the Claimants made a qualifying investment under the Treaty but that the Respondent was partly justified in invoking Article 11(3) of the Treaty and thereby ordering Antrix to annul its contract with Devas.\n\n448.\n\nThis being said, Devas had between February 7, 2006 and February 17, 2011 a valid and effective contract with Antrix, and the Claimants were entitled to the protections of the Treaty.\n\n449.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Treaty reads:\n\nInvestments and returns of investors of either Contracting Parties shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.\n\n450.\n\nFor the purpose of this section of this Award, the Tribunal will concentrate on the first sentence of this Article. The question therefore is: were the Claimants granted fair and equitable treatment between February 7, 2006 and February 17, 2011?\n\n451.\n\nThe Parties spent some considerable time debating whether the FET clause under Article 4(1) was limited to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.\n\n452.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, there is nothing in the language of the Treaty or in its *travaux preparatoires* which would incorporate anything beyond the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. It refers to the 1969 OECD Draft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property which in one of its comments states that \"the standard required conforms in effect to the 'minimum standard' which forms part of customary international law.\"639 The Respondent also quotes a number of commentators and arbitral awards criticizing an expansive interpretation of the FET concept beyond the minimum standard provided under customary international law.640 It also notes that some countries have introduced a clear statement in their model BITs to the effect that FET is to be determined in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard.\n\nDraft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property, OECD, Article 1 and Notes and Comments to Article 1 (Ex. R-73).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 125.\n\n453.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the standard expressed in the 1926 Opinion of the Mexico-US General Claims Commission in the *Neer v. Mexico* case641 remains valid at least in terms of requiring an extremely high threshold.642 The *Neer* standard was to the effect that, in order to constitute a breach of customary international law, the treatment of an alien \"should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency.\" It quotes, in support, a few (mainly NAFTA) arbitral awards.643\n\n*See L.F.H. Neer and Pauline E. Neer v. Mexico*, Mexico-U.S. General Claims Commission, Docket No. 136, Opinion, 15 October 1926 (1927) 21 The American Journal Of International Law 555, p. 556 (Ex. R-88).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 128.\n\n*Id*., para. 128.\n\n454.\n\nIn any event, says the Respondent, no violation of the FET standard occurred in this case, even under an expansive interpretation of it. Citing a number of authors, arbitral awards and Indian judgments, it argues that (i) an FET obligation cannot, absent a specific commitment by the State, deprive the State of its inherent sovereign right to regulate the conduct of business within its borders; (ii) the mere existence of a BIT is no substitute for such a commitment; (iii) absent such a specific commitment, an investor cannot assume that there will be no adverse changes in law or policy affecting its investment; and (iv) hopes and dreams are not legitimate expectations.644\n\n*Id*., para. 130.\n\n455.\n\nAs to the Claimants, they counter, referring also to a number of arbitral awards and commentaries that (i) the FET obligation means more than the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law as presented by the Respondent;645 (ii) that the Respondent's invocation of the customary minimum treatment standard is unavailing, as it assumes a material distinction in practice between the FET standard and the obligations it owes under customary international law;646 and (iii), on any view, Article 4(1) creates a higher level of investment protection than the 1926 *Neer* standard invoked by the Respondent.647\n\nStatement of Reply, paras 142-149.\n\n*Id*., paras 150-157.\n\n*Id*., paras 158-161.\n\n456.\n\nOn this debate, the Tribunal shares the view expressed in *El Paso:*\n\nThe Tribunal considers this discussion to be somewhat futile, as the scope and content of the minimum standard of international law is as little defined as the BIT's FET standard, and as the true question is to decide what substantive protection is granted to foreign investors through the FET. The issue is not one of comparing two undefined or weakly defined standards; it is to ascertain the content and define the BIT standard of fair and equitable treatment.648\n\n*El Paso Energy International Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 2011, para. 335 (Ex. CL-11).\n\n457.\n\nThe Tribunal does not subscribe to the view that, today, a violation of the customary minimum standard was frozen as defined in *Neer* \"to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency.\"649 It is now generally recognized that customary international law has evolved since 1926, some awards giving the required minimum treatment a wider interpretation than others.650 FET in the Treaty, as in most other treaties, is not defined and the Treaty contains no wording limiting its scope and content to some external standard, whether it be international customary law or something else. In determining that scope and content, the Tribunal must rely on Article 31 of the VCLT,651 which requires a treaty to be \"interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n*L.F.H. Neer and Pauline E. Neer v. Mexico*, Mexico-U.S. General Claims Commission, Docket No. 136, Opinion, 15 October 1926 (1927) 21 The American Journal Of International Law 555, p. 556 (Ex. R-88).\n\nThe formulation may vary somewhat (e.g., *CMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, 2005 *,* para. 284: \"The Treaty standard of fair and equitable treatment (...) is not different from the international law minimum standard and its evolution under customary international law\"; *Azurix v. Argentin* a, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award, 2006, para. 361, after stating that FET and full protection and security permits an interpretation setting \"higher standards than required by international law,\" goes on to say that the Tribunal \"considers that its content is substantially similar whether the terms are interpreted in their ordinary meaning, as required by the Vienna Convention, or in accordance with customary international law.\" However, it is now well established that the concept of the minimum standard of customary law cannot be equated with the *Neer* description of it.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 31(1), done on May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S., 331.\n\n458.\n\nAs stated in *El Paso*, \"the legitimate expectations of the investors have generally been considered central in the definition of FET, whatever its scope.\"652 There is an overwhelming trend to consider the touchstone of fair and equitable treatment to be found in the legitimate and reasonable expectations of the parties, which derive from the obligation of good faith. This has been aptly stated by the tribunal in *Waste Management II:* \"In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the Host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\"653 And the tribunal in *Saluka* reiterated the same idea, when stating: \"The standard of 'fair and equitable treatment' is therefore closely tied to the notion of legitimate expectations which is the dominant element of that standard.\"654\n\n*El Paso Energy International Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 2011, para. 348 (Ex. CL-11).\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. Mexico* (\"Number 2\"), ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 2004, para. 98.\n\n*Saluka Investments. B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 2006, para. 302 (Ex. CL-31).\n\n459.\n\nA number of cases mentioned by each Party (quoting different sections) reached a similar conclusion.\n\n460.\n\nIn *Suez/AWG*,655 the tribunal, by majority, held that the FET standard is breached when a State \"frustrates or thwarts\" the \"legitimate expectations\" on which an investment was based.\n\n*Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A. and Vivendi Universal, S.A. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, Decision on Liability, 2010; *AWG Group Ltd. v. Argentina*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Liability, 2010, para. 223.\n\n461.\n\nIn *Bayindir*,656 the tribunal stated that the FET imposes the \"obligation to act transparently and grant due process, to refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures, from exercising coercion or from frustrating the investor's legitimate expectations with respect to the legal framework affecting the investment.\"\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 2009, para. 178.\n\n462.\n\nIn *CMS*,657 the tribunal described the FET standard as \"inseparable from stability and predictability\" and held that \"this is an objective requirement unrelated to whether the Respondent had any deliberate intention or bad faith in adopting the measures in question.\" The annulment committee in that case658 addressing this part of the award, declared that \"it was adequately founded on the applicable law and the relevant facts\" and added that \"legitimate expectations. may be relevant to the application of the fair and equitable treatment clause.\"\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, 2005, paras. 276-280.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Annulment, 2007, paras 85, 89.\n\n463.\n\nThe Tribunal need not enter into a lengthy discussion of the concept and scope of the FET standard in general. Suffice it to say for the purpose of this case that, whatever the scope of the FET standard, the legitimate expectations of the investors have generally been considered central to its definition. That concept however is not unlimited. Thus, the Claimants could not have had legitimate expectations that Article 11(3) of the Treaty would never be invoked. That provision was in full effect at the time of the signing of the Agreement in 2006 and no clause in that Agreement or any subsequent statement by the Respondent would indicate that the Claimants would be protected from the invocation of that provision of the Treaty. In that respect, the Tribunal has already found that 60% of the Respondent's decision validly relied on the protection of its essential security interests under Article 11(3) of the Treaty, while 40% would come under the expropriation provision of its Article 6.\n\n464.\n\nAs mentioned in the *El Paso* case,659 FET is an objective concept; it is the result of interests and rights of both the investor and the State and the result of such balancing may vary with the circumstances. In that context, transparency and good faith are key factors.\n\n*El Paso Energy International Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 2011, paras 356-365 (Ex. CL-11).\n\n465.\n\nIndependently of the text of the Devas Agreement,660 the Claimants were entitled to legitimate expectations that, in accordance with the text of the Treaty as well as under a general obligation under international law, the Respondent would deal with them in good faith.\n\nArticle 21 of the Devas Agreement states: \"The Parties hereby agree that they intend to discharge their obligations in utmost good faith. They therefore agree that they will, at all times, act in good faith and make all attempts to resolve all differences however arising out of or in connection with this Agreement by discussion.\" Similarly, Exhibit B of the Devas Agreement states in Articles 3.1.1.1 and 3.1.1.2: \"However, immediately following the launch failure or total satellite failure, if ANTRIX has sufficient reasons to believe that the implementation of accelerated schedule is not feasible, both parties will discuss in good faith to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution.\" (Ex R-1/JCB -37).\n\n466.\n\nThe preamble of the Treaty mentions the desire of the Contracting Parties \"to create favourable conditions for greater flow of investments.\" In Article 3(2), it states that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall in accordance with its laws render assistance to the investors of the other Contracting Party, whose investments were made in its territory, for obtaining the required clearances and permissions.\" To these general statements must be added the provisions of Articles 4 and 6 of the Treaty dealing with the treatment of investments and expropriation which have already been extensively considered in this award.\n\n467.\n\nIf one searches for a general obligation of good faith under international law, one need not go further than the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties in which one can find no less than five mentions of the requirement of good faith.661 This principle of good faith is not only self-standing, but it also stems from the concept of FET. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the *Tecmed* panel that \"the commitment of fair and equitable treatment... is an expression and part of the bona fide principle recognized in international law.\"662 However, this does not mean that every violation of FET by a State requires bad faith.663 The good faith principle may simply require that the foreign investment must be treated in a manner such that it \"will not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by foreign investor to make the investment.\"664\n\nVCLT, Preamble, Articles 26, 31, 46(2), 69. India has not acceded to the VCLT; nonetheless, it is recognized that Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT reflect the customary international law regarding international treaty provisions. See *Dispute Regarding Navigational & Related Rights (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua),* Judgment, 2009 I.CJ. Rep. 213, at 237, para. 47 and *Saluka Invs. B.V. v.

Unfortunately, nothing of the sort occurred; in fact, the evidence shows that right up to February 8, 2011, the Claimants were completely left in the dark about the Space Commission's decision and the alleged growing needs of the military and their possible impact on the Agreement; apart from notices that there were delays in the launching of the satellite, there were no signals from the Respondent, all along, that the Agreement might be challenged or modified. This includes a number of meetings with senior officials (including one with the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister on June 22, 2010) and Government Ministers and various correspondence, as well as the assurance given by Dr. Radhakrishnan during a meeting in Prague on September 29, 2010, that the GSAT-6 satellite would be shipped in early December 2010.665 The Tribunal has unchallenged evidence that at none of those meetings did the Respondent indicate that the Space Commission had decided to annul the Devas Agreement or that that there were competing military or other societal needs for the S-band spectrum which had been allocated to Devas.\n\nSingh I, para. 64.\n\n469.\n\nIt would be to no avail for the Respondent to argue that such strategic information could not be communicated to the Claimants. Indeed, the required disclosure would not entail informing the Claimants of the nature of those needs or revealing any secret information. The Respondent could and should have simply informed the Claimants that the Agreement was in jeopardy because of societal and strategic needs; it would then have been up to the Claimants to decide how much financial and other resources they were willing to put at risk in that context or to propose to the Respondent possible alternative solutions.\n\n470.\n\nLeaving aside the requirement of \"utmost good faith\" contained in the Agreement, the Respondent's conduct constitutes a clear breach of the simple good faith required under international law and the FET clause of Article 2 of the Treaty; the Respondent must be liable for this wrongful behavior and must compensate the Claimants for damages that they may have suffered thereby from July 2, 2010 to February 17, 2011, the date of the CCS decision. The Respondent's liability subsequent to that decision has been addressed earlier in this award.\n\n471.\n\nAs to the Claimants' argument that, by its conduct, the Respondent's unjustly enriched itself, it need not be separately addressed, taking into account the Tribunal's decision concerning expropriation and the breach of good faith under the FET provision of the Treaty.\n\n472.\n\nAs to the alleged harassing measures that the Respondent would have taken, the Tribunal has not received sufficient evidence to conclude that these measures were taken to punish the Claimants or Devas for exercising their respective rights. There is a world of difference between this case and the *Desert Line Projects LLC v. Yemen* upon which the Claimants rely *,* where the Tribunal held that a settlement agreement \"was imposed onto the Claimant under physical and financial duress.\"666\n\n*Desert Line Projects LLC v. Yemen*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award, 2008, para. 186.\n\n**CHAPTER IX - UNREASONABLE OR DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n473.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Treaty provides, in relevant part:\n\n(1) \u2026.Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.\n\n***1. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n474.\n\nThe Claimants aver that \"the determination of reasonableness is in its essence a matter for the arbitrator's judgment,\"667 but they also identify a number of elements from which unreasonableness may be derived. First, a finding of unfair and inequitable treatment may derive in unreasonableness.668 Second, reasonableness requires that the State's conduct \"bears a reasonable relationship to some rational policy.\"669 Third, \"withdrawal of undertakings and assurances given in good faith to investors as an inducement to [them] making an [investment] is by definition unreasonable....\"670 Fourth, unreasonableness is a synonym for arbitrariness, as is also pleaded by the Respondent.671 On these grounds, the Respondent's measures\u2014consisting of the nullification of an investment on specious grounds through a fabricated and self-made *force majeure* in direct contravention of numerous prior State approvals and assurances of support\u2014 are plainly \"unreasonable.\"672\n\n*BG Group Plc. v.

The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n476.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the term \"unreasonable\" in Article 4(1) of the Treaty is interchangeable with \"arbitrary,\" which appears to be agreed by the Claimants.676 In turn, the standard definition of arbitrariness is a \"wilful disregard of due process of law, and act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety,\"677 or a \"manifest impropriety.\"678 The threshold of proof for arbitrary conduct is high, and the burden is on a claimant to meet that standard.679 Conversely, a measure is reasonable when there is a rational policy to which the measure in question is reasonably related.680 On this basis, the Respondent concludes that there was nothing improper, shocking or unreasonable in the Government of India's decision to reserve the S-band spectrum for non-commercial, strategic requirements in light of the nation's burgeoning security needs.681\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 158; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 135, citing *National Grid plc v.

THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n478.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, its case\u2014\"featuring covert action to undermine a contract, a bogus 'policy' decision engineered towards commercial ends, and an insincere after-the-fact attempt to justify these self-interested actions under the mantra of 'security'\u2014overwhelmingly proves a breach of Article 4(1)'s prohibition on 'unreasonable' actions.\"\n\n479.\n\nThe Tribunal, by majority, has already concluded that, although extraneous factors may have played a role in the Respondent's decision, the Respondent had reasonable justification of military and other societal needs to take that decision partly under Article 11(3) and partly under Article 6 of the Treaty.\n\n480.\n\nThe Claimants also argue, quoting the *BG Group* award684 that this case involves the \"withdrawal of undertakings and assurances given in good faith to investors as an inducement to their making investments\" and that such action is \"by definition unreasonable and a breach of the Treaty.\"685 In that particular respect, the Claimants are on more solid ground and the Tribunal has already covered this issue above when discussing good faith and transparency. As demonstrated in a number of arbitral awards, while FET may have a broader meaning than \"unreasonable or discriminatory measures,\" such measures would automatically constitute a breach of FET.686\n\n*BG Group Plc. v. Argentina*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 2007, paras 342-43.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 170.\n\n*See, inter alia,* *CMS Gas Transmission Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, 2005, para. 290; *Saluka Investments. B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 2006, para. 460 (Ex. CL-31); *Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v. Republic of Kazakhstan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16, Award, 2008, paras. 679-81; *Joseph Charles Lemire v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Decision on Liability, 2010, paras. 259, 418.\n\n481.\n\nAs to the argument about discrimination, the Claimants refer to statements made by officials after the nullification of the Agreement, in which they sought to justify their actions on the grounds that foreigners might have profited from the Devas system and some reference to that argument can be found in documents anterior to the Government decision.\n\n482.\n\nHowever, looking at the Space Commission Note for the Cabinet Committee on Security,687 one can find a few references to foreign ownership but there is no suggestion that the Devas Agreement should be annulled because of that fact. Thus, in Article 2 of that Note, the Commission refers to the SATCOM policy approved by the Government of India on June 24, 1997, which authorized foreign parties to lease INSAT capacity. In Article 37, there is a mention that, among other subjects, the Commission, at its July 2, 2010 meeting, deliberated on foreign equity in Devas but the minutes of that meeting merely state that the Chairman answered these various queries.688 Elsewhere in these minutes, it is stated:\n\nNoting that ICC has not met since 2004, Commission suggested for reviving the ICC mechanism immediately. Also, as the activities of the Antrix have grown in the recent past involving execution of several contracts, and many of them with foreign parties, Commission suggested to set up a mechanism to review the structure and functioning of Antrix with a view to enhance the efficiency and to ensure due diligence of financial, contractual and legal aspects.689\n\nDepartment of Space, Note for the Cabinet Committee on Security, Annulling the \"Agreement for the Lease of Space Segment Capacity on ISRO/Antrix S-Band Spacecraft by Devas Multimedia Pvt Ltd.,\" February 16, 2011 (Ex.

But, even more significantly, nowhere in the publication, on February 17, 2011,691 of the CCS decision is there any indication that foreign ownership may have played any role in its conclusion that the S-band should be reserved for non-commercial purposes and that the Devas Agreement should be annulled.\n\n*Id*., paras. 41 and 42.\n\nPress Information Bureau, Government of India, CCS Decides to Annul Antrix-Devas Deal, February 17, 2011, available at pib.nic.in (C-134/R-35/JCB-220).\n\n484.\n\nThe claim under Article 4(1) of the Treaty is therefore rejected.\n\n**CHAPTER X- MOST-FAVOURED-NATION TREATMENT**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n485.\n\nParagraphs 2 and 3 of Article 4 of the Treaty provide as follows:\n\n(2) Each Contracting Party shall accord to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, treatment which shall not be less favorable than that accorded either to investments of its own or investments of investors of any third State.\n\n(3) In addition, each Contracting Party shall accord to investors of the other Contracting Party, including in respect of returns on their investments, treatment which shall not be less favorable than that accorded to investors of any third State.\n\n**A. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n486.\n\nThe Claimants' position is that, pursuant to the most favored nation (\"**MFN**\") clauses in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Articles 4 of the Treaty, they are entitled to the protections set forth in Article 3(2) of the Serbia-India BIT,692 which provides as follows:\n\n(2) Investments and returns of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party and shall enjoy full legal protection and security.693\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 75; Statement of Claim, paras 224-25; Statement of Reply, paras 173-87. Throughout their Notice of Arbitration, the Claimants gave notice that, on the basis of Articles 4(2) and (3) of the Treaty, they would rely on several provisions of BITs signed between India and third countries. Their final position, recalled in this award, is different from the one expressed in the Notice of Arbitration. *See* Notice of Arbitration, paras 63, 70.\n\nAgreement between The Government of The Republic Of India and The Federal Government of The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for The Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments, dated January 31, 2003, Article 3(2) (Ex. CL-40) (the \"**Serbia-India BIT**\").\n\n487.\n\nThe Respondent's main contention is that the MFN clauses in the Treaty cannot be relied upon by the Claimants to create an entirely new right as the one embodied in Article 3(2) of the Serbia-India BIT.694 Even if it were possible, there would be no breach of the full legal protection and security clause of the Serbia-India BIT on the facts of the case.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras 166-68; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras 137-39.\n\n***1. The Possibility of Importing the 'Full Legal Protection and Security' Clause of the Serbia-India BIT***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nThe Claimants submit, following the reasoning of the tribunal in *White Industries v. India,* that the '\"full legal protection and security' clause of Article 3(2) of the Serbia-India BIT, which they seek to import, is a 'more favorable substantive provision...in a third party treaty,'\"695 which, by the plain terms of Article 4(2) and (3), is importable.696 According to the Claimants, this approach is fully consistent with numerous arbitral decisions,697 and must be distinguished from importing \"an entirely new provision from another treaty,\" which is what the Respondent alleges the Claimants are attempting.698\n\n*White Industries Australia Ltd. v. India*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 2011, para. 11.2.3 (Ex. CL-38).\n\nStatement of Reply, paras 173-83.\n\n*See* Statement of Reply, para. 177, citing *Rumeli Telekom A.S. v. Kazakhstan*, ICISD Case No. ARB/05/16, Award, 2008, paras 575, 681 (Ex. CL-29); *EDF International S.A. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23, Award, 2012, paras 931-32; *MTD Equity Sdn Bhd, v.

Moldova*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/23, Award, 2013, para. 396.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 178, referring to Statement of Defence, para. 166.\n\n489.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the Respondent's claim that relying on the 'full protection and security' clause of the Serbia-India BIT would entail creating wholly new rights is based on selective quotations and misreading of a number of decisions, including *Paushok*699 and *Hochtief*.700 Whereas *Paushok* is of no assistance to India because the MFN clause at stake only extended MFN treatment in respect of the obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment,701*Hochtief* is, according to the Claimants, helpful to their own position. The claimant in *Hochtief* sought to rely, by means of an MFN clause, on a dispute resolution clause in a third party treaty which, unlike the applicable BIT, did not require the parties to litigate in the Argentine courts for 18 months before resorting to arbitration. The *Hochtief* tribunal allowed this importation because \"the 18-month pre-arbitration litigation requirement should be regarded as a matter of the treatment of investors in exercising their rights in relation to dispute settlement and not as the subject of a distinct right.\"702 Equally, the Claimants contend that, the 'full legal protection and security' clause of the Serbia-India BIT can be imported because both this BIT and the Treaty cover the same subject matter, i.e. the treatment of investments, meaning that the rights in the Serbia-India BIT are not \"wholly distinct\" from those in the Treaty.703\n\n*Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Company v.

The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n490.\n\nThe Respondent avers that the Claimants' attempt to import an entirely new provision from another treaty would be improper because it would entail creating a standard that is not present in the applicable Treaty.704 Investor-State tribunals, such as the ones in *Hochtief v. Argentina*, *Paushok v. Mongolia* and *Accession Mezzanine v. Hungary*705 have recognized that an MFN clause cannot be relied upon to create wholly new rights.706\n\nStatement of Defence, paras 166-69; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 137-39.\n\n*Accession Mezzanine Capital L.P. and Danubius Kereskedohaz Vagyonkezelo Zrt. v.

The Respondent's Alleged Violation of the 'Full Legal Protection and Security' Provision***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Claimants' Position**\n------------------------------\n\n491.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent has breached the 'full legal protection and security' clause of Article 3(2) of the Serbia-India BIT, and, in turn, Article 4(2) and (3) of the Treaty.707 This clause obligates the host State \"to ensure that neither by amendment of its laws nor by actions of its administrative bodies is the agreed and approved security and protection of the foreign investor's investment withdrawn or devalued.\"708 This standard has been violated by (i) the Indian Cabinet's actions, and other affirmative acts, which caused a \"withdrawal and devaluation\" of the investment, and (ii) the several government acts that served as a pretextual basis for annulling the Devas Agreement.709\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 224-25; Statement of Reply, paras. 184-86.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 224, citing *CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 2001, para. 613 (Ex. CL-5).\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 225, Statement of Reply, para. 184.\n\n492.\n\nThe Claimants argue that *AES v. Hungary*, cited by India, does not lead to a different conclusion.710 In that case the tribunal held that the respondent State had not breached the \"most constant protection and security obligation\" because it had acted \"with a view to achieving objectively rational public policy goals.\" By contrast, the Respondent's measures leading to the annulment of the Devas Agreement were not aimed, in the Claimants' case, at a legitimate and objective policy goal.711\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 185, referring to Statement of Defence, paras 170-72.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 185.\n\n493.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that it is no answer to the Respondent to claim that, because the Devas Agreement contained a *force majeure* clause applicable in the case of \"sovereign action,\" there was no \"withdraw[al]\" or \"devaluat[ion]\" of the \"agreed and approved security and protection\" applicable to the Claimants' investment.712 That clause did not give a license to Antrix to rely upon a self-generated *force majeure* defence.713\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 186, referring to Statement of Defence, para. 171, fn. 387.\n\nStatement of Reply, para. 186.\n\n**b. The Respondent's Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n494.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, even if the Tribunal disregarded its argument that the 'full protection and security' clause of Article 3(2) of the Serbia-India BIT cannot be imported into the Treaty, there would still be no breach of such clause on the facts of the case because it cannot operate as a legal stabilization clause.714 In the words of the *AES v. Hungary* tribunal:\n\nTo conclude that the right to constant protection and security implies that no change in law that affects the investor's rights could take place, would be practically the same as to recognizing the existence of a non-existent stability agreement as a consequence of the full protection and security standard.715\n\nStatement of Defence, paras 170-72; Respondent's Rejoinder, paras 140-42.\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Eromu Kft. v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22, Award, 2010, para. 13.3.5.\n\n495.\n\nThe Respondent then denies that the 'full security and protection' clause obligates the host State \"to ensure that neither by amendment of its laws nor by actions of its administrative bodies is the agreed and approved security and protection of the foreign investor's investment withdrawn or devalued.\"716 In the Respondent's view, it is unclear what \"agreed and approved security\" the Claimants refer to because the Devas Agreement made clear that the Government of India could take decisions in its sovereign capacity, without being limited by a stabilization clause.717\n\n*See* Statement of Claim, para. 224.\n\nStatement of Defence, fn. 387; Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 142.\n\n**B. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n------------------------------\n\n496.\n\nAs to the possibility of importing the \"full protection and security\" clause of the Serbia-India BIT, the Tribunal shares the views expressed by the Claimants concerning the possibility of importing the \"full protection and security\" clause of the Serbia-India BIT. The numerous arbitral awards mentioned by the Claimants and referred to above confirm that conclusion. Moreover, the three cases mentioned by the Respondent do not support its argument that accepting the importation of the relevant provision of the Serbia-India BIT would entail creating a standard that is not present in the applicable Treaty.\n\n497.\n\nAs far as the alleged violation by the Respondent of the \"full legal protection and security provision\" is concerned, the Tribunal disagrees with the Claimants' conclusion.\n\n498.\n\nAs to the State obligation under the FPS standard, it is generally described as an \"obligation of vigilance and due diligence\"718 and it has generally been applied in the context of \"use of force.\"719\n\n*Tecnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. Mexico,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF) /00/02, Award, 2003, para. 177; *El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 2011, paras 522-523; *Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers (Greece) v. The Republic of Albenia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award, 2009, paras 77 and 81.\n\n*Saluka Investments B.V. (The Netherlands) v. the Czech Republic,* Partial Award, 2006, para. 483; *Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. (APPL) v. Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Award, 1990, paras 46-53; *Wena Hotel Limited v. Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award, 2000, para. 84; *Eastern Sugar v. The Czech Republic,* Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Partial Award, 2007, para. 203.\n\n499.\n\nThe nature of that provision has been aptly described in the *El Paso* award as \"no more than the traditional obligation to protect aliens under international customary law and (that) it is a residual obligation provided for those cases in which the acts challenged may not in themselves be attributed to the Government, but to a third party.\"720 If, on the other hand, the acts can be attributed to the Government, then the FET standard would apply.\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 2011, para. 522.\n\n500.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that the invocation of *force majeure* by Antrix is attributable to the State under Article 8 of the ILC Articles. The Claimants' claim under full protection and security is therefore rejected.\n\n**CHAPTER XI - DECISIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n501.\n\n**For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides and awards as follows:**\n\n(a) **Unanimously, that the Claimants' claims relate to an \"investment\" protected under the Treaty;**\n\n(b) **Unanimously, that the notice of termination of the Devas Agreement sent by Antrix to Devas constituted an act of State attributable to the Respondent.**\n\n(c) **By majority, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims insofar as the Respondent's decision to annul the Devas Agreement was in part directed to the protection of the Respondent's essential security interests;**\n\n(d) **By majority, that the Respondent has expropriated the Claimants' investment insofar as the Respondent's decision to annul the Devas Agreement was in part motivated by considerations other than the protection of the Respondent's essential security interests;**\n\n(e) **By majority, that the protection of essential security interests accounts for 60% of the Respondent's decision to annul the Devas Agreement, and that the compensation owed by the Respondent to the Claimants for the expropriation of their investment shall therefore be limited to 40% of the value of that investment;**\n\n(f) **Unanimously, that the Respondent has breached its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants between July 2, 2010 and February 17, 2011.**\n\n(g) **Unanimously, that the Claimants' other claims shall be dismissed;**\n\n(h) **Unanimously, that any decision regarding the quantification of compensation or damages, as well as any decision regarding the allocation of the costs of arbitration, shall be reserved for a later stage of the proceedings.**"}]}
