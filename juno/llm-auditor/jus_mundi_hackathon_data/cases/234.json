However, these efforts have led me to conclusions that are dramatically different from those of my distinguished coarbitrators, on jurisdiction, liability and damages, and, accordingly, costs. Indeed, our respective conclusions are so different that I feel compelled to set forth my views on the most important differences in this dissenting opinion.\n\nJurisdiction\n------------\n\n2.\n\nMy principal disagreement1 with the majority regarding jurisdiction concerns the overriding issue of whether or not the SPA was procured through corrupt means.\n\nI do not agree that the majority\u2019s statement at para. 6.65 that Claimant is a \"member of the Uni\u00f3n Fenosa association of Spanish companies\" is relevant to the issue of whether or not Claimant is an \"investor\" within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the Treaty. I also do not agree with the statement at para. 6.68 that Claimant\u2019s investment should be treated \"holistically\" as \"one overall investment made by the Claimant comprising the Damietta Project.\"\n\n3.\n\nI fully concur with the majority\u2019s determination that such corruption, if proven, would, under the Treaty and as a matter of international public policy under international law, defeat jurisdiction over the claims, deny their admissibility, and render them unmeritorious.\n\n4.\n\nI also agree that the Respondent bears the legal burden of proving corruption under a \"balance of probabilities\" test, whether by means of direct evidence or circumstantial evidence. And I also agree that Respondent failed to meet its burden with respect to its allegations of corruption in the award of the EPC Contract to Halliburton and in Mr. Hussein Salem\u2019s involvement with the SPA.\n\n5.\n\nHowever, I believe that Respondent did meet its burden of proof with respect to Mr. Yehia El Komy\u2019s involvement with the project. The Respondent has demonstrated that there was a huge disproportion between, [REDACTED] and, on the other hand, his apparent contribution to the project. This demonstration of a classic red flag2 was sufficient to require a plausible and credible explanation from Claimant. But the explanations provided by Claimant were neither plausible nor credible and have been rejected even by the majority. As a result, the only inference that can be drawn is the one Claimant has sought to avoid, namely that Mr. El Komy\u2019s high compensation was for the purpose of exerting improper influence upon government officials in allowing the project and awarding the SPA.\n\nV. Khvalei, Using Red Flags to Prevent Arbitration from Becoming a Safe Harbour for Contracts that Disguise Corruption, in SPECIAL ICC SUPPLEMENT: TACKLING CORRUPTION IN ARBITRATION (2013), page 22 [RL-0168]. To be sure, Respondent has also cited numerous other red flags that are unnecessary to address here. See Respondent\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated 21 Dec. 2017, Annex 1, pages 4-5.\n\n6.\n\nUFACEX\u2019s arrangements with Mr. El Komy and his company. EATCO. envisaged enormous compensation, [REDACTED] Even more significantly, [REDACTED]3 Whether [REDACTED] in a US$ 1.4 billion project were just the normal compensation commensurate with the role of \"local partner\" depends upon what Mr. El Komy actually did and was expected to do in the way of contributing to the project.\n\nCl. Rej. Jur., Paragraph 62 (footnotes omitted).\n\n7.\n\nAs the majority points out, it does not appear that Mr. El Komy provided any funding net [REDACTED] His compensation as a local partner cannot be explained on the basis that he was a net source of capital.\n\n8.\n\nAs the majority also points out, Mr. El Komy does not appear to have brought any particular technical or other specialist expertise to the project. He had no personal expertise or experience in the LNG industry, no relevant background in the production and sale of natural gas, and his business experience in the petroleum industry generally was very limited and had only recently been acquired. Moreover, while Claimant asserts that Mr. El Komy was needed to help navigate the local permitting process and deal with national regulations relating to the project site, it offered no evidence that he had any particular ability or experience in this respect. Thus, none of these characteristics suggest a value to the project justifying such compensation.\n\n9.\n\nThe evidence of what Mr. El Komy and EATCO actually did on the project also falls short of demonstrating a contribution commensurate with the compensation he was given. The majority cites, at para. 7.88, the facts that \"EATCO took part in the preparation of the PreFeasibility Study: it prepared studies on possible sites for the Plant: it was responsible for the proposal from Chiyoda and APCI for the EPC contract; it negotiated and signed the Damietta Port Agreement of 8 August 2000 between UFACEX and the Damietta Port Authority; it procured licences from the Damietta Port Authority for SEGAS\u2019s work in December 2000 and March 2001; and it participated in the handover from the Damietta Port Authority to SEGAS of the land plot and jetty in April 2001.\" In my view these assertions overreach the evidence and overstate the facts.\n\n10.\n\nAs evidence that Mr. El Komy assisted with a pre-feasibility study. Claimant cites the 9 March 2000 EATCO-UFG preliminary agreement, which states that \"EATCO will support UFACEX in the development of a pre-Feasibility Study\" with \"Technical Works.\"4 But no such works were introduced or even referred to in the evidence. Nor is there evidence that EATCO prepared an \"Analysis of the Sites,\" as was contemplated in that Agreement.5 Indeed, Mr. El Komy seems to have played only a small role in the identification of a site; he attended only the last of a series of meeting with technical consultants engaged to advise on this and other technical questions6 and Claimant seems to have struggled with how to involve him more.7 Claimant\u2019s official, Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez, testified that EATCO was only one of many other participants in the site survey;8 its role did not even merit a mention in his written witness statements. In fact, the Damietta site was selected early on despite Mr. El Komy\u2019s preference for a different site, undermining the suggestion that his input was indispensable as alleged.\n\nAgreement between UFACEX and EATCO, 9 Mar. 2000, page 2 [C-0439].\n\nId.\n\nFax from A. Hernando to R. Villanueva (undated) [C-0445].\n\nMinutes of Meeting sent by Antonio Hernando to El\u00edas Velasco et al., 14 June 2000 [C-0444].\n\nTr. Day 2, page 620:18-22.\n\n11.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. El Komy\u2019s role in involving Chiyoda Corporation appears to have been merely as a go-between; in fact, another consultant already working with Claimant on the project, Mr. Omar El Komy (no relation, but who later joined EATCO), was the one who contacted Chiyoda and introduced both that company and APCI Company to Mr. Yehia El Komy.9 The latter\u2019s other involvement appears to have been tangential at best.10\n\nAgreement between Omar El-Komy, Hamed El- Maatawy and Yehya El-Komy, 9 May 2000 [C-0438].\n\nEmail from R. Villanueva, 17 July 2000 [C-0447]; Fax from R. Villanueva to Y. El-Komy (undated) [C-0467].\n\n12.\n\nMoreover, there is no evidence whatsoever that Mr. El Komy negotiated agreements with the Damietta Port Authority. At most, the evidence cited by Claimant shows that he signed as a witness to Claimant\u2019s own signature to such agreements and co-signed the eventual license along with Claimant, both as owners on behalf of SEGAS which was then still in formation.11 It is not even clear that Mr. El Komy was involved in the incorporation of SEGAS (a task which in any event could have been accomplished by any competent law firm), the only evidence being that he brought a photocopy of company registration papers with him to a meeting.12 Other indications of Mr. El Komy\u2019s involvement are of even less importance. Indeed, while securing the SPA was his first identified duty,13 Claimant denies that, after the initial meeting with the Petroleum Minister in January 2000, Mr. El Komy \"participate[d] any further in the substantive negotiations that led to the SPA.\"14\n\nDamietta Port Authority License, 16 Dec. 2000 [C-0328]; Agreement between UFACEX andthe Damietta Port Authority, 8 Aug. 2000 [C-0448]; Agreement between SEGAS and the Damietta Port Authority, 18 Oct. 2000 [C0449].\n\nLetter from G.

CM Jur., Paragraph 20.\n\n13.\n\nThus, Claimant\u2019s efforts to chronical Mr. El Komy\u2019s \"indispensable\" role in implementing the project, something that should have been easy to demonstrate if true, are actually undermined by the weakness of the evidence it has provided.\n\n14.\n\nClaimant\u2019s further explanation for Mr. El Komy\u2019s compensation, emphasized in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility - that he had conceived of and originated the idea for the project, was the \"first mover\" and was the person who initially brought the project to Claimant15 - is rightly rejected by the majority, since the evidence so clearly contradicts these assertions. Based on Claimant\u2019s own evidence as recounted by the majority, the project had been conceived by Claimant itself and had been developed on the Claimant\u2019s behalf by other consultants, who themselves later brought Mr. El Komy into the mix.\n\nCl. Rej. Jur.. Paragraph 29 (\"In reality, the payments to be received by EATCO pursuant to this contract were the result of negotiations between UFACEX and Mr. El-Komy regarding the commercial terms of their partnership. [REDACTED] reflected each party's bargaining power at the time, and comport with the central role that Mr. El-Komy played *in conceiving* the Damietta LNG Project and *bringing this business opportunity to UFG\u2019s attention\")* (emphasis added); *Id.,* Paragraph 30 (\"UFG need not belabor the obvious: a first mover who presents a potentially lucrative idea has leverage to capture a substantial amount of the economic gains.\").\n\n15.\n\nEven more mysteriously. Claimant also alleges that Mr. El Komy had \"decided to establish an LNG facility in Egypt\"16 himself and agreed to the \"relinquishment of equal control in the Project\" in favor [REDACTED] as if he and not the government enjoyed the authority to confer the rights to develop the LNG facility.17 Claimant does not explain how Mr. El Komy\u2019s \"decision\" to build the facility himself (despite his obvious lack of credentials for doing so) gave him any measure of \"control\" to relinquish to begin with, much less how it affected the relative \"bargaining power of the parties\" that Claimant says is reflected in the [REDACTED]18 This is especially glaring in light of Claimant\u2019s denial that Mr. El Komy exercised any special access to government authorities.\n\n*Id..* Paragraph 34.\n\n*Id.,* Paragraph 49.\n\n*Id.,* Paragraph 29. Claimant\u2019s reliance upon a clause in the UFACEX-EATCO preliminary agreement under which both sides agreed for three years to pursue the project together, and not alone or with others, begs the question of what gave Mr. El Komy the leverage to command such exclusivity. *See id..* Paragraph 40; Agreement between UFACEX and EATCO. 9 Mar. 2000 [C-0439].\n\n16.\n\nAs noted earlier. I agree with the majority that Respondent bears the burden of proving corruption, and I agree that there has been no dir ect evidence of bribery or money passing hands from Mr. El Komy or his company to others. But what the evidence does prove is that there is a tremendous and unexplained discrepancy between Mr. El Komy\u2019s involvement in the project and the compensation he was awarded. This clear red flag is sufficient, not to shift to Claimant a burden of proving that there was no corruption, as worries the majority, but to require Claimant *to go forward* with, at very least, a plausible and credible explanation.\n\n17.\n\nIt is not for the Tribunal to supply such an explanation. This is why I cannot accept the majority\u2019s conclusion that Mr. El Komy acted as a lobbyist with non-corrupt access to and influence over senior government officials. Not only is there no evidence of non-corrupt influence, this is not *Claimant\u2019s* explanation and indeed flies in the face of Claimant\u2019s own denials that Mr. El Komy exerted any influence on government officials at all.\n\n18.\n\nNor is this a matter of second guessing a commercial decision, but rather one of understanding the reasons for that decision in a situation where such understanding is required. As the majority notes, unanswered queries may have innocent explanations. But when the answers to queries that are actually proffered are not proven in circumstances where, if true, it should have been easy to do so, or worse, when the evidence affirmatively disproves them, I see no alternative but to infer that the true explanation is not an innocent one.19\n\nThis inference is not affected by the fact either that it was raised by Respondent only after arbitral proceedings were begun or that criminal investigations of Mr. El Komy in connection with the project were only begun years after the fact and are still ongoing.\n\n19.\n\nFor these reasons, I believe that we should conclude that corruption has been established by circumstantial evidence and that the claims should be dismissed.\n\nLiability\n---------\n\n20.\n\nI also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusions with respect to the Respondent\u2019s liability for a breach of the fair and equitable treatment provision in Article 4.1 of the Treaty. This includes my disagreement with the standards accepted by the majority for establishing a violation of this provision, which I will not address in light of the Parties\u2019 mutual treatment of the factor of legitimate expectations in assessing a violation of this particular treaty. I do however agree with Respondent that, even accepting the role of legitimate expectations, the threshold is high.20\n\nResp. Rej. Merits, Paragraph 221.\n\n21.\n\nI agree with the majority\u2019s statement that \"legitimate expectations depend on specific undertakings and representations,\" quoting the award in *Philip Morris v. Uruguay.21* However, I do wish to set out in some detail why I do not believe that either the 25 July 2000 Council of Ministers decision,22 or the 5 August 2000 Ministry of Petroleum letter,23 both of which are relied upon by the majority, provide the basis for any legitimate expectation that Egypt would forswear policies that either allegedly \"over\"-incentivized NG consumption or \"under\"-incentivized NG production. I also do not believe that those policies can be said to have caused the under-supply of gas to Claimant. Finally, I do not consider that Claimant has proven that EGAS\u2019s decision to deny gas to Claimant in favor of domestic demand was directed or instructed by the government of Egypt.\n\n*Philip Morris v. Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Award, 8 July 2016, Paragraph 426 (emphasis omitted) [RL-151]. I also agree with the majority that, in the absence of such an undertaking, Claimant has not established any other violation of Articles 3(1), 4(1), 4(2) or 4(5) of the Treaty.\n\nMinutes of the 18th Meeting of the Council of Ministers of25 July 2000 [C-0456].\n\nLetter from Ministry of Petroleum, First Undersecretary (Ismail Karara) to Uni\u00f3n Fenosa, Chairman (Jos\u00e9 Maria Amustategui), 5 Aug. 2000 [C-0169/C-0413].\n\n22.\n\nIt must be assumed that, at the time it pursued the project, UFACEX knew that it was a national policy priority to guarantee the supply of domestic demand for natural gas.24 To overcome such a policy, a clear and specific undertaking by the government would have been necessary. But the government was unwilling to provide UFACEX with a guarantee of EGPC\u2019s supply obligations to assure that gas would be supplied even if it meant domestic demand was unmet. One of the goals of UFACEX\u2019s January 2000 meeting with Minister Fahmy was \"identifying the support/guarantees that the Government of Egypt can provide to the Project.\"25 But all they were able to obtain was Minister Fahmy\u2019s personal \"support\" and \"commitment.\"26 Indeed, the 17 May 2000 MOU between UFACEX and EPGC is express in stating that EGPC would be its own guarantor.27 This is a repudiation of the notion that the government was ever willing to guarantee EGPC\u2019s SPA commitments.\n\n*See, e.g.,* \"Egypt - Integrated Gas Strategy; Exports Won\u2019t Exceed 25% of Output,\" APS Review Gas Market Trends, 17 January 2000 [BRG-31] (\"The following are the six points of the Master Plan, approved in October 1999 by the new government of Dr. Atef Obeid which expressed clear support for proposals to export gas in liquid form and by pipeline as well as proposals to accelerate Egypt's shift from oil to gas for domestic energy and industrial feedstocks:  \n 1. Gas exports should at no time exceed 25% of Egypt's total output capacity. This means the domestic gas requirements of Egypt - a top priority of the current Egyptian regime under President Hosni Mubarak - *will always be guaranteed.\")* (emphasis added).\n\nUFACEX memo to Elias Velasco and Santiago Roura re \"LNG - Egypt,\" 28 Jan. 2000, page 1 [C-0344].\n\n*Id*., page 2.\n\nMemorandum of Understanding Between EGPC and UFACEX [for the] Development Of A Natural Gas Liquefaction Facility, 17 May 2000, Appendix 1 [C-0168]:  \n*\"APPENDIX 1: TERM SHEET OF THE NATURAL GAS SALE AND PURCHASE AGREEMENT*   \n*Seller: EGPC.*   \n*Seller's Guarantor: The EGPC shall guarantee all and any obligations of Seller under the Natural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement.\"*\n\n23.\n\nNonetheless, the majority accepts the proposition that the 25 July 2000 Council of Ministers decision28 and the 5 August 2000 Ministry of Petroleum letter29 together amount to a \"specific undertaking\" sufficient to support a legitimate expectation that the government would tailor its policies to assure adequate supply to Damietta. But I do not think that such a momentous undertaking can be inferred from these acts.\n\nMinutes of the 18th Meeting of the Council of Ministers, 25 July 2000 [C-0456]\n\nLetter from Ministry of Petroleum, First Undersecretary (Ismail Karara) to Uni\u00f3n Fenosa S.A., Chairman (Jos\u00e9 Maria Amustategui), 5 Aug. 2000 [C-0169/C-0413].\n\n24.\n\nThe chronology of events shows that, apart from evidencing approval of the project in general, the approvals given by the Ministry of Petroleum and the Council of Ministers related specifically to the SPA\u2019s prices for the volumes of gas to be sold, an issue which was always, and expressly, subject to government approval.\n\n25.\n\nAll of the basic economic terms of the SPA *except price* (i.e., volume, take-or-pay percentage, performance stand-by letter of credit, start date) were already fixed in the 17 May 2000 MOU between UFACEX and EGPC; price was to be \"finally agreed\" in the SPA.30\n\nMemorandum of Understanding Between EGPC and UFACEX [for the] Development Of A Natural Gas Liquefaction Facility, 17 May 2000, Appendix 1 [C-0168].\n\n26.\n\nNegotiations on the price and all other terms of the SPA were completed by 15 July 2000 when the SPA was signed in principle.31 At that point, the SPA was subject to government approval only of \"the *agreements that have been made regarding the price of the gas\"32*\n\nSee Draft Memorandum Number 56, 2000 [C-0360].\n\n*Id.* (emphasis added).\n\n27.\n\nOn 20 July 2000, the EGPC Board approved a memorandum that described the agreed price and other basic economic terms of the SPA, and authorized action *\"to conclude the contractual procedures as required\u2019* \u201933 But the Board was obviously concerned with the maximum price provisions, because its decision was marked up to note that a further meeting was to be held with UFACEX *\"in order to increase the maximum price ceilings\u2019* \u201934 (As with all Board decisions, these conclusions were notified to and endorsed by Minister Fahmy, in accordance with EGPC\u2019s foundational statute.35)\n\nMemorandum number 56, Agenda of the XIIIth Meeting of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian General Petroleum Commission, 20 July 2000 (emphasis added) [C-0359].\n\n*Id.* (emphasis added).\n\nLaw 20 of 1976 [C-0126] (\"Article 11: The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall notify the Board's decisions to the Minister of Petroleum for consideration in adoption and he shall have the power to amend or abolish them, and has to take its decision about them and notify it to the Board within thirty days from the date of the arrival of the papers to him.\").\n\n28.\n\nAs had been understood, the \"conclusion of the contract procedures\" required government approval of the agreed prices. To this end, a memorandum was prepared by the Ministry of Petroleum for the Council of Ministers that, again, summarized the basic economic terms of the SPA, including the price terms as had been agreed on 15 July 2000, and requested approval for the conclusion of a contract *\"according to the conditions and prices mentioned in the memorandum to be paid in dollars\"*36 Based upon this memorandum, on 25 July 2000 the Council of Ministers gave its approval to the \"signing [of] a memorandum of understanding with Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Company to develop a project for the liquefaction of natural gas for export to Spain?\u201937\n\nMemorandum to be submitted to the Cabinet on Contracting with the Spanish Company (Union Fenosa) for Exporting the Egyptian Natural Gas, July 2000, page 11 (emphasis added) [C-0458].\n\nMinutes of the 18th Meeting of the Council of Ministers of 25 July 2000, page 3[C-0456].\n\n29.\n\nThe majority considers at paras. 9.57 and 9.66 that the approvals of the government related to specific provisions of the SPA by which, among other things, EGPC warranted an adequate supply of gas to meet contract requirements (Sections 23.2 and 24. 3), agreed to limitations on the invocation of *force majeure* (Sections 15.2 and 15.3(b)) and, most importantly, committed \u2018 *\u2018to procure that the Egyptian authorities undertake not to interfere with the rights of Buyer under this Agreement, and not to dictate or promulgate any act or regulation which could directly or indirectly affect the rights of Buyer under this Agreement, or affect the capacity of Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement, even in the case of a NG shortage in Egypt, save for Force Majeure situations as defined in this Agreement\"* (Section 21.1). But the evidence indicates the government approvers were not even provided with the full terms agreed-upon, but rather only with summaries of key terms necessary to evaluate the adequacy of the price terms.\n\n30.\n\nNone of the particular terms cited is even described in the memorandum that went to the EGPC Board38 which, on 20 July 2000, approved \"the contents of the memorandum\" and, on that basis, authorized the concluding of contract procedures.39 These were the decisions \"endorsed\" by Minister Fahmy in his 24 July 2000 notation to the minutes.40\n\nDraft Memorandum Number 56, 2000 [C-0360].\n\nMemorandum number 56, Agenda of the XIIIth Meeting of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian General Petroleum Commission, 20 July 2000 [C-0359].\n\n*Id.*\n\n31.\n\nThese provisions were also not described in the similar memorandum that went to the Council of Ministers on 25 July 2000, which requested approval for signing a contract *\"according to the conditions and prices mentioned in the memorandum\"-,*41 the Council\u2019s actual decision was to approve signing a contract for *\"a project for the liquefaction of natural gas.*..\"42 Minister Fahmy\u2019s 27 July 2000 letter to the Prime Minister reported that the contract had been agreed *\"according to the above mentioned* [prices] *and the main conditions which were stated in the memorandum submitted to the Cabinet\"*43\n\nMemorandum to be submitted to the Cabinet on Contracting with the Spanish Company (Union Fenosa) for Exporting the Egyptian Natural Gas, July 2000 (emphasis added) [C-0458].\n\nMinutes of the 18th Meeting of the Council of Ministers of 25 July 2000 (emphasis added) [C-0456].\n\nLetter from S. Fahmy (Minister of Petroleum) to H.E. Dr. Atef Ebeid (Prime Minister), 27 July 2000 [C-0461].\n\n32.\n\nThe 29 July 2000 Technical Department Memorandum describes the decisions of EGPC\u2019s Board of Directors and the Council of Ministers as approvals of \"the project\" and does not include any of these particular provisions in its summary of the \"main characteristic[s]\" of the SPA.44\n\nMemorandum from the Technical Affairs Office of the Ministry of Petroleum, 29 July 2000 [C-0459].\n\n33.\n\nIn short, while these particular terms were clearly binding on EGPC, there does not appear to be any evidence that they were known to, much less approved by, the government officials involved. Their concern was for the prices to be charged at the volume promised.\n\n34.\n\nMost importantly, I do not believe that there is any basis for concluding that the 5 August 2000 Ministry letter to UFG\u2019s Chairman constitutes in particular the undertaking of the Egyptian authorities \"not to interfere with the rights of [the] Buyer\" that EGPC was obligated to procure in SPA Section 21.1. The letter merely states, in full pertinent part, \"On behalf of the Ministry of Petroleum I have the pleasure to inform you that the Egyptian Government official [sic] endorsed the natural gas Sales and Purchase Agreement signed on August 1st, 2000 between UFACEX and EGPC.\"45 This single sentence simply cannot bear the weight assigned to it by the majority at para. 9,145 as the \"the decisive tipping factor in establishing the Respondent\u2019s breach of Article 4(1) of the Treaty.\"\n\nLetter from Ministry of Petroleum, First Undersecretary (Ismail Karara) to Uni\u00f3n Fenosa S.A., Chairman (Jos\u00e9 Maria Amustategui), 5 August 2000 [C-169].\n\n35.\n\nThe letter makes no reference whatsoever to Section 21.1. It does not even use any of the terminology of Section 21.1. There is no contemporaneous evidence at all that it was intended or considered to implement Section 21.1.46\n\nNor do I consider that, as the majority maintains in para. 9.61, the Respondent was \"associating itself\" with Section 21.1 by means of the 5 August 2000 letter in the sense that it was somehow agreeing to effectuate EGPC\u2019s obligation to procure a government undertaking. As noted in para. 9,121 of the Award, the commentary to the ILC Articles explains that there is a difference between a State\u2019s \"acknowledgment and adoption of the conduct in question as its own\" and \"cases of mere support or endorsement\" by the State. *See* James Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], Article 11.\n\n36.\n\nIf Uni\u00f3n Fenosa had actually considered it as such, it would certainly have cited it in its letters to the Ministry seeking its help with regard to EGAS\u2019s performance of the SPA, especially after EGAS expressly noted in its 16 October 2005 letter to UFG that it considered its supply commitment to be subject to \"the *priority given to local demand'* \u201947 But, neither Section 21.1 nor the 5 August 2000 letter is ever mentioned in any of the communications of complaint by Claimant listed in para. 9,125 of the award.\n\nLetter from EGAS to UFG, 16 Oct. 2005 [R-364].\n\n37.\n\nThe absence of such evidence is even odder in light of the contention that a government undertaking under Section 21.1 was a *sine qua non* to UFACEX\u2019s agreement to the SPA. If it was truly an \"essential condition\" of the transaction, Section 21.1 would have been drafted as a condition precedent, not as an obligation to be performed in the future. It is difficult to see how an investor could reasonably have understood such terms of the 5 August 2000 letter to constitute a specific assurance to make domestic demand a subsidiary priority, and to have based a major investment on such terms.\n\n38.\n\nIn the end, for this reason, I do not believe that such an undertaking by the government, while perhaps highly desirable, was an essential condition of UFACEX\u2019s investment.48 In making the investment, UFACEX appears to have justified taking the risk of under-supply on the basis of considerations other than any specific assurance by the government, namely, EGPC\u2019s own promise to supply Damietta in preference to domestic demand and, most importantly, the then-current optimistic projections of future natural gas production in Egypt. This explains why there were no strenuous protests when a real Section 21.1 undertaking was not procured by EGPC.\n\nIt is notable that a government guarantee or non-interference undertaking was not among the \"Main Principles\" set forth in the 17 May 2000 MOU. *See id.,* Article 4 (\"ARTICLE 4 MAIN PRINCIPLES OF THE NATURAL GAS SALE AND PURCHASE AGREEMENT - The Natural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement shall be negotiated in good faith between the Parties and its content shall observe the basic terms and conditions set forth in Appendix 1 hereto\") and Appendix 1. Nor were these mentioned in the MOU as one of the \"Additional Commitments.\" *Id.,* Article 5 (\"ARTICLE 5 ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS BY EGPC IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROJECT - 5.1 EGPC is aware that the execution of the Natural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement is a key element for the successful development of the Project. 5.2 EGPC agree to use its best efforts to assist in issuing all necessary permits, licences and authorizations for the development of the Project in accordance with Egyptian regulations and applicable laws. 5.3 EGPC represents and warrants to UFACEX that its surplus of natural gas will be sufficient to feed the Complex under the terms and conditions set forth in Appendix 1.\").\n\n39.\n\nThis is supported by provisions of the SPA. Section 24.1, entitled \"Mutual Representations,\" states that UFACEX, as well as EGPC, represented and warranted that \"*(f) it has consulted with its own legal, regulatory, tax, business, investment, financial, and accounting advisors to the extent it has deemed necessary, and it has made its own investment, hedging, and trading decisions (including decisions regarding the suitability of this Agreement)* based upon its own judgement *and upon any advice from such advisors as it has deemed necessary and not upon any view expressed by the other Party,\" \"(g) it understands the terms, conditions, and risks of this Agreement and is capable of assuming and willing to assume (financially and otherwise) those risks* and *\"(h) it is acting as principal, and not as agent, fiduciary, or any other capacity.\"* Section 25.9 would seem to describe the universe of persons/entities bound by the terms of the SPA: *\" This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns\"*49\n\nNatural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement, 1 Aug. 2000 (emphasis added) [C-0002].\n\n40.\n\nThe majority considers that the juxtaposition of timing and the terms of Article 21.1, on one hand, and the letter, on the other, excludes any objective interpretation other than that the letter was the separate, extra-contractual undertaking required under Section 21.1. But, in my view, there is a much simpler and likely interpretation.\n\n41.\n\nAs noted above, the EGPC Board\u2019s 20 July 2000 decision to approve the memorandum on the SPA noted that a further meeting was to be held with UFACEX *\"in order to increase the maximum price ceilings.\"*50 In fact, the day after the meeting of the Council of Ministers, on 26 July 2000, EGPC had such a meeting with UFACEX and the parties agreed to raise the maximum prices from $1.00/MMBTU to $1.25/MMBTU.51 However, as Claimant states, \"the executed version of the SPA contains a handwritten note from EGPC Chairman Mohammed Tawila that \u2018*[t]he price* [of gas] *is subject to final approval by the Egyptian Governmental authorities*,\u2019\"52\n\nMemorandum number 56, Agenda of the XIIIth Meeting of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian General Petroleum Commission, 20 July 2000 (emphasis added) [C-0359].\n\nLetter from S. Fahmy (Minister of Petroleum) to H.E. Dr. Atef Ebeid (Prime Minister), 27 July 2000 [C-0461].\n\nCl. Mem. Merits, Paragraph 127. *See also*, Natural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement, 1 Aug. 2000, signature page [C-0002].\n\n42.\n\nThus, at signing, the single remaining pre-condition to, and the only additional approval required for, the full effectiveness of the SPA was approval of the final price. In this circumstance, it was clearly the function of the 5 August 2000 Ministry letter to give notice of the approval given for the new price terms. There has been no contention that such notice of this outstanding approval was accomplished by any other means.\n\n43.\n\nThus, I believe that both the 25 July 2000 Council of Ministers decision and the 5 August 2000 Ministry of Petroleum letter must be read as approving the project generally and approving, specifically, the price to be paid for the gas at agreed volumes, and nothing else.53 I do not see a basis for concluding that they gave rise to any legitimate expectation that Egypt would forswear its natural gas consumption and production policies in order to guarantee EGAS\u2019s supply commitments.\n\nThis is not contradicted by the documents relating to the price increases in 2006, 2007 and 2008 (C-0320, C0392, C-0460, C-0462, C-0463), which cite Minister Fahmy\u2019s involvement only in the final price negotiations of 26 July 2000.\n\n44.\n\nIn the majority\u2019s view, at para. 9,145, \"the Respondent\u2019s conduct failed to meet its obligations under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty, taking into account as a relevant factor the legitimate expectations generated by the Respondent\u2019s undertaking in the form of the Ministry of Petroleum\u2019s letter dated 5 August 2000, as described above.\" The majority finds that Respondent frustrated Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations in two ways. First, it finds that the shortages in gas supply to Claimant beginning in 2010 were due to \"long-standing policies of subsidising domestic users of gas and electricity,\" which it says began after execution of the SPA, \"together with the failure to encourage the finding of gas deposits in Egypt\" (paras. 9. 127 - 9,130). Second, it finds that, at some point before EGAS\u2019s 24 February 2103 notice of *force majeure, the* government had *\"directed* EGAS to limit and eventually stop the supply of feed gas under the SPA to the Damietta Plant.\" I disagree with both of these conclusions.\n\n45.\n\nFirst, as verified by Claimant\u2019s own expert,54 domestic subsidies long predated the SPA and, indeed, domestic energy pricing had not previously increased since 1993.55 More importantly, Egyptian gas production under the government\u2019s policies was obviously sufficient to meet the requirements of the SPA, given that the demands of the Damietta Plant56 constituted only a fraction of total production. Short of holding that Respondent had given assurances to Claimant that it would guarantee enough production to supply *all* customers, there is no basis to say that these policies caused undersupply to Claimant. And this is aside from the immensity of holding a State\u2019s entire energy policy to constitute an FET violation.\n\nBRG ER1, Paragraph 32.\n\nEgyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, *The Arab Republic of Egypt: Initial Communication on Climate Change*, June 1999, page27 [BRG-165].\n\nEquating Damietta Plant issues with Claimant\u2019s particular issues is misleading since Claimant only has rights to just under 60 % of Damietta tolling capacity, with EGAS itself enjoying the rights to the just-over 40% remaining. Cl. Mem. Merits, Paragraph 172.\n\n46.\n\nSecond, there is no direct evidence, and insufficient indirect evidence, that EGAS acted under the government\u2019s direction and control in curtailing supplies under the SPA.57 Respondent denies any such direction or instruction and produced witness testimony to support that denial.58 None of the public statements by officials cited by the majority supports the assertion that EGAS acted under instruction. The brief press report of Minister Kamal\u2019s 15 October 2012 statement that \"Egypt has stopped exporting gas to Jordan and Spain\" does not quote him, does not refer to any government decisions and correctly observes what was happening within Egypt as a collective.59 Similarly, the equally brief press report paraphrasing Minister Ismail\u2019s 24 November 2013 statement in relationship to one of the arbitrations commenced by Claimant that \"we should first cover local market\u2019s need from natural gas,\" also does not mention any government decision and at most speaks to the consonant policies of EGAS andthe government.60\n\nI do not consider the holding in the *Ampal v. Egypt* to support an opposite conclusion. Unlike the situation here, in *Ampal,* as the Award notes in para. 9,110, the Ministry of Petroleum acted as the principal in the transactions at issue by operation of a resolution of the Council of Ministers. *Ampal v. Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/11, Decision on Liability and Heads of Loss, 21 February 2017, [CL-0273], Paragraph 141.\n\nHameed WS, Paragraph 25.\n\n\"Petroleum Minister: Gas exports to Jordan, Spain halted,\" Egypt Independent [C-0286].\n\n\"Petroleum minister: Butane distribution to be revised,\" Al Gomhouria (undated) [C-0280],\n\n47.\n\nThe other statements attributed to government officials during meetings are similarly deficient in their support of the majority\u2019s conclusion. The testimony of Mr. Egea Krauel that Minister Kamal\u2019s alleged undertaking to study the situation made him realize that Claimant was being singled out is a *non sequitur* and hardly proof of an instruction to EGAS. Indeed he does not even corroborate Mr. S\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez\u2019s testimony that Minister Kamal had undertaken to \"make a decision;\"61 Mr. S\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez fails in any case to state what the subject matter of such a decision was to be. (The letter sent by UFG following this meeting makes no mention of either of these statements attributed to Minister Kamal.62)\n\nS\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez WS1, Paragraph 25.\n\nLetter from UFG (Jose Mar\u00eda Egea Krauel and Cesare Cuniberto) to Minster of Petroleum (Osama Kamal), 21 September 2012 [C-0048].\n\n48.\n\nThe claim that Minister Ismail stated in a 26 November 2103 meeting that \"Egypt will in fact not comply with its obligations in the near future\"63 seems hard to credit and does not corroborate an instruction to EGAS. Moreover, that such a statement was made was vigorously denied in the reply by the Ministry.64\n\nLetter from UFG (Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Egea Krauel and Cesare Cuniberto) to Minister of Petroleum (Sherif Ismail), 5 December 2013 [C-0085]. It is worth noting that, despite its reference to \"Egypt\u2019s obligations,\" even this letter, sent shortly before the notice of dispute was served, makes no allusion whatsoever to either Article 21.1 of the SPA or to the Ministry\u2019s 5 August 2000 letter.\n\nLetter from Ministry of Petroleum (Sherif Sousa) to UFG (Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Egea Krauel and Cesare Cuniberto), 19 January 2014 [C-0086].\n\n49.\n\nThus, I do not believe that there was a violation of the Treaty\u2019s FET provision based upon either the assertion that government energy policies caused the under-supply or the assertion that EGAS acted to curtail supply under the direction and control of the government.65\n\nFor this reason, I also do not agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion in para. 9,147 that there was a technical FET violation resulting from the non-payment of tolling fees by EGAS to SEGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract.\n\nDamages\n-------\n\n50.\n\nRegarding damages, I agree with the majority on the exclusion by operation of SPA Section 8.1[1] and other reasons of Claimant\u2019s claims for lost dividends from SEGAS and loss of profits on undelivered gas that was not replaced by UFG. I also agree, that as a result of our unanimous decision to dismiss Claimant\u2019s tax-free zone claim, we need not consider the related claim to damages. However I dissent from the majority\u2019s ultimate conclusions with respect to other damages that would be claimable if Egypt\u2019s liability had been demonstrated.\n\n51.\n\nThe majority is of the view at paras. 9.84 and 9,126 that Claimant has been \"almost ruined\" by the non-supply of gas under the SPA. But I think that this significantly overstates Claimant\u2019s situation. Indeed, the Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Gas Group\u2019s 2014 annual report states only that \"[t]he absence of Egyptian gas caused the Company\u2019s supply costs rise [sic], reducing profits compared with previous years.\"66 The Group\u2019s Directors\u2019 Report for the financial year ending on 31 December 2015 states that \"[t]he absence of Egyptian gas, along with the effects derived from the fall in the global energy scenario, has caused a notable reduction in profits compared with previous years.\"67 Thus, far from being an issue of Claimant\u2019s survival, the Egyptian non-supply is a matter only of reduced profits.\n\n2014 Annual Report of Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Gas Group, page 190 [R-0345].\n\nDirectors\u2019 Report For The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2015, page 1 [NAV-185, page 1 following the Consolidated Annual Accounts.] The report also states that, while \"[a]lso in 2015, the toller EGAS has maintained its suspended payment of the amounts due to SEGAS, putting *the subsidiary* in a critical situation with respect to its financial backers and suppliers, although *all its financial obligations have been correctly settled.\" Id.,* page 3 (emphasis added). *See also* the testimony of Claimant\u2019s expert that \"over the entire period, from 2006 to 2015, UFG generally made profits at a portfolio level.\" Tr. Day 5, page 1446:15-16.\n\n52.\n\nSimilarly, I find Claimant\u2019s presentation on quantification of damages to be greatly overstated.\n\n53.\n\nFirst, while the majority prefers the approach of the Claimant\u2019s experts, that approach, even in its third alternative, suffers from a number of deficiencies that make it excessively speculative. This is primarily because, rather than producing many of the underlying transactional documents or even verifying them, it has relied upon print-outs from Claimant\u2019s own internal databases. This is particularly true with respect to documentation of individual transactions on which Claimant may have suffered any actual loss;68 there is no ability for Respondent to contest whether Claimant allocated Claimant\u2019s most expensive replacement gas to replace the Egyptian gas to maximize the claim.69\n\nTr. Day 6, page 1600:1-3.\n\nBDO ER2, Paragraph 10.66.\n\n54.\n\nClaimant\u2019s experts argue that, because they are the product of a large company accounting system, it has no reason to doubt the accuracy of the data,70 and that it would have been too \"burdensome\" to produce many of the documents themselves.71 But, notwithstanding the fact that Claimant\u2019s accounts are audited for purposes of financial reporting, data produced for litigation is not subject to audit for the purpose. Moreover, while \"burdensomeness\" may well be a ground for objecting to discovery requests, it is the not a ground for failing actually to prove damages suffered. In the context of a US$ 4 billion claim, producing such documents, or at least a forensic audit of such data, for review by a respondent is not only reasonable, but necessary.\n\nNavigant ER2, Paragraphs 10-12.\n\nNavigant Hearing Presentation, page 25.\n\n55.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal finds that SPA Section\u2019s 8.1[2]\u2019s 90%-of-price limitation does not affect damages because the Claimant\u2019s experts calculated the limitation\u2019s threshold to be higher than the nominal amounts claimed for extra costs for delivered gas and costs of replacing undelivered gas. But at the hearing, Respondent\u2019s expert submitted, without objection, a calculation based, not on monthly totals as used by Claimant\u2019s expert, but on transaction-by-transaction totals (using Claimant\u2019s data), concluding that the resulting limitation was US$ 567 million below the nominal amounts claimed.72 I am persuaded that such a basis more accurately tracks the actual costs suffered due to gas not delivered within the meaning of SPA Section 8.1[2] and thus that the SPA provision limits the amount claimable to US$ 1,853 billion.\n\nTr. Day 2, pages 1577:22 - 1582:5.\n\n56.\n\nThird, I disagree with the majority that further efforts to mitigate damages could not reasonably be required of Claimant. Respondent has provided sufficient evidence through its experts to show that Claimant had plentiful opportunities beyond those identified by Claimant\u2019s financial executive Mr. Conti73 to reduce its delivery obligations that would have allowed it to avoid substantial portions of its replacement costs. These include renegotiating existing contracts in the favorable environment of declining gas demand in Spain, declining to enter into new short-term contracts and invoking *force majeure* on existing contracts. Without the benefit of contract terms known only to Claimant, Respondent\u2019s expert testified that short-term industrial contracts alone could have accounted for as much as US$ 841 million of Claimant\u2019s claimed losses.74 While these changes would have necessitated further alterations to Claimant\u2019s business model, the temporary curtailment of particular lines of business does not imply that Claimant would thereby have had to close substantially or completely its multi-line business.75\n\nConti WS, Paragraph 17.\n\nBDO ER2, Paragraph 9.10.\n\nI also do not consider relevant that the fact that mitigation is required at all is due to Respondent\u2019s treaty breach; by definition, the question of mitigation never arises at all unless there has been some breach.\n\n57.\n\nNor could invoking *force majeure* on its downstream contracts earlier than it did on 14 December 201476 be considered as unreasonable requirement. As early 20 March 2013, half of Claimant\u2019s Board of Directors and its CEO argued for taking just such a step.77 The fact that the other half of the Board squelched this idea cannot render it unreasonable, and any costs incurred subsequent to that date should be considered as a business decision purely to Claimant\u2019s account.\n\nCl. Rep. Merits, Paragraph 457. *See also* Notice of Force Majeure from UFG to UFGC, 12 Dec. 2014 [C-0431]; Notice of Force Majeure from UFGC to GNF subsidiary one 12 Dec. 2014 [C-0432]; Notice of Force Majeure from UFGC to GNF subsidiary two 12 Dec. 2014 [C-0433]; Notice of Force Majeure from UFGC to GNF subsidiary three 12 Dec. 2014 [C-0434].\n\nMinutes of the Meeting of the Board of Directors of the Company Uni\u00f3n Fenosa. S.A., Mar. 20,2013 [ R.-0353].\n\n58.\n\nThe area in which further mitigation by Claimant could have had its greatest impact would have been in the diversion of all of the LNG it had under contract from Oman to downstream customers. While Claimant made the point that it is not claiming for any costs of replacing Omani LNG, it never denied that diverting the 2.2 bcma available from Oman would have substantially reduced the need to purchase higher priced gas to replace Damietta LNG. While this would have eliminated the profits that Claimant would otherwise have gained from the sale of the Omani LNG on the Asian spot market, such lost profits would not have been claimable here under the Tribunal's decision. By the uncontested calculation by Respondent\u2019s expert, this would have reduced this head of damages to at most US$ 241 million.\n\nCosts\n-----\n\n59.\n\nFinally, as a result of my differences with the majority on the above issues. I also disagree that costs should be awarded to the Claimant.\n\nDissent\n-------\n\n60.\n\nFor all of the above reasons, I respectfully dissent to the award as set forth, including the dispositions in Operative Part XIII as indicated therein."}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n***A: SELECTED ABBREVIATIONS***\n-------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (2006) |\n| BIT or Treaty | Agreement on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Arab Republic of Egypt, signed on 3 November 1992 and entered into force on 26 April 1994 |\n| BCM or bcm | Billion cubic meters |\n| Bcma or bcma | Billion cubic meters per annum |\n| C-[#] | Claimant's Exhibit |\n| CL-[#] | Claimant's Legal Authority |\n| Cl Mem Merits | Claimant's Memorial on the Merits dated 7 August 2015 |\n| Cl CM Jur | Claimant's Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction dated 13 June 2016 |\n| Cl Obj Bif | Claimant's Objection to Bifurcation dated 22 December 2015 |\n| Cl Rej Bif | Claimant's Rejoinder on Bifurcation dated 5 February 2016 |\n| Cl Rep Merits | Claimant's Reply Memorial on the Merits dated 7 October 2016 |\n| Cl Rej Jur | Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated 16 January 2017 |\n| ClSoC | Claimant's Statement of Costs dated 17 May 2017 |\n| COS | Claimant's Opening Statement |\n| Damietta Plant | The gas liquefaction plant in Damietta, Egypt |\n| EATCO | Egyptian Arab Trading Company |\n| EGAS | Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company |\n| EGPC | Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation |\n| ENI | Eni S.p.A. |\n| ENPPI | Engineering for the Petroletun & Process Industries |\n| ER# | First, Second, etc. Expert Report |\n| GASCO | Egyptian Natural Gas Company |\n| GNF | Gas Natural Fenosa |\n| Hearing | Healing on Jurisdiction and the Merits held on 6 to 11 March 2017 |\n| IBA Rules | The IBA Rules on Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (29 May 2010) |\n| ICSID or the Centre | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965 |\n| ILC Articles | Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts of the International Law Commission |\n| [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] |\n| LNG | Liquefied Natural Gas |\n| NG | Natural Gas |\n| MBtu or MMBtu or MMBTU | Million British Thermal Units |\n| R-[#] | Respondent's Exhibit |\n| RL-[#] | Respondent's Legal Authority |\n| Resp CM Merits | Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits dated 13 June 2016 |\n| Resp Obj Jur & Req for Bif | Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Request for Bifurcation dated 25 November 2015 |\n| Resp Rej Merits | Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits dated 16 January 2017 |\n| Resp Rep Bif | Respondent's Reply Memorial on Bifurcation dated 18 January 2016 |\n| Resp Rep Jur | Respondent's Reply Memorial on Objection to Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated 7 October 2016 |\n| Resp SoC | Respondent Statement of Costs dated 17 May 2017 |\n| RfA | Request for arbitration dated 14 February 2014 |\n| ROS | Respondent's Opening Statement |\n| SEGAS | Spanish-Egyptian Gas Company S.A.E. |\n| SPA | Natural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement between Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation, as \"Seller\", and Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Desarrollo y Acci\u00f3n Exterior, S.A., as \"Buyer\", dated 1 August 2000 |\n| Tr.

(hereinafter referred to as \"UFG\", \"Uni\u00f3n Fenosa\" or the \"Claimant\"). UFG is a company organized under the laws of the Kingdom of Spain in 1998 as a gas subsidiary of the Spanish electricity utility company, Uni\u00f3n Fenosa S.A., which has its headquarters in Madrid, Spain.\n\n1.2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Arab Republic of Egypt and is hereinafter referred to as \"Egypt\" or the \"Respondent.\"\n\n1.3.\n\nThe Claimant and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\" The Parties' respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n(2) The Arbitration's Procedure\n-------------------------------\n\n1.4.\n\nOn 14 February 2014, the Claimant filed with ICSID a request for arbitration against the Respondent (the \"Request\" or \"RfA\").\n\n1.5.\n\nOn 27 February 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In her Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n1.6.\n\nOn 28 February 2014, the Claimant appointed Mr J. William Rowley, QC, a national of Canada and the United Kingdom, as its party-appointed arbitrator, pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. By letter of the same date, ICSID informed the Parties that, as provided in ICSID Arbitration Rule 2(3), either of the Parties might choose the formula of Article 37(2)(b) at any time 60 days after the registration of the Request for Arbitration, if no agreement had been reached on another procedure for constituting the Tribunal within that period. ICSID noted that the Parties had not yet informed ICSID of any agreement on the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment. ICSID also invited the Respondent to respond regarding the Claimant's proposed method of constitution of the Tribunal.\n\n1.7.\n\nBy letter of 30 May 2014, the Claimant invoked the formula contained in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and confirmed its previous appointment of Mr Rowley as its party-appointed arbitrator.\n\n1.8.\n\nBy letter of 30 May 2014, ICSID acknowledged that the Claimant had invoked Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, according to which the tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each Party and the president of the tribunal appointed by agreement of the Parties. By the same letter, ICSID acknowledged the Claimant's appointment of Mr Rowley as a co-arbitrator. ICSID also invited the Claimant to propose a name of a person to serve as president of the tribunal and to invite the Respondent to concur with such a proposal, as provided in ICSID Arbitration Rule 3(1)(a)(i).\n\n1.9.\n\nBy letter of 1 June 2014, the Respondent appointed Mr J. Christopher Thomas, a national of Canada, as arbitrator in this case pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n1.10.\n\nOn 3 June 2014, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr Rowley had accepted his appointment as a co-arbitrator.\n\n1.11.\n\nOn 4 June 2014, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr J. Christopher Thomas had accepted his appointment as a co-arbitrator. On the same date, ICSID invited the Parties to proceed with the appointment of a third arbitrator to serve as president of the tribunal.\n\n1.12.\n\nOn 3 November 2014, Mr Thomas voluntarily withdrew his acceptance of his appointment. By letter of the same date, ICSID invited the Respondent to appoint another arbitrator in place of Mr Thomas.\n\n1.13.\n\nOn 7 November 2014, the Claimant requested the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to appoint the arbitrator not yet appointed by the Respondent, pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n1.14.\n\nOn 8 November 2014, the Respondent appointed Mr Mark Alan Clodfelter, a national of the United States of America, as arbitrator pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n1.15.\n\nOn 13 November 2014, M. Clodfelter accepted his appointment as a party-appointed arbitrator.\n\n1.16.\n\nBy letter of 25 November 2014, ICSID acknowledged the Parties' mutual agreement to appoint Mr V.V. Veeder as president of the tribunal. Mr Veeder accepted his appointment on 7 December 2014.\n\n1.17.\n\nOn 8 December 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed constituted on that date. Ms Milanka Kostadinova, ICSID Senior Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n1.18.\n\nBy agreement between the Tribunal and the Parties, the first session was held on 25 February 2015 by telephone conference. The Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that no Party had any objection to the appointment of any Member of the Tribunal. They agreed, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be the ICSID Arbitration Rules in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that hearings should take the place at ICSID in Washington, D.C., \"unless the Parties agree otherwise.\"1\n\nPO1, Paragraph 10.2.\n\n1.19.\n\nThe agreement of the Parties and the Tribunal's decisions were embodied in Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO1\"), which was signed by the President and circulated to the Parties by the Secretary on 3 August 2015. On the same date, the Tribunal also issued Procedural Order No. 2 (\"PO2\"), by which it granted to the Parties permission to file written submissions concerning the procedural timetable after 7 August 2015.\n\n1.20.\n\nIn accordance with the Parties' partial consensus on the procedural timetable reached at the first session, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits on 7 August 2015, along with supporting documentation.\n\n1.21.\n\nBy letter of 24 August 2015, the Respondent filed an application to the Tribunal for permission to submit a Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, together with a request for bifurcation, by 15 December 2015 (as opposed to a deadline of 16 November 2015, as determined earlier). The Claimant opposed the application by letter of 31 August 2015. The Respondent replied to such objections by letters of 4 and 15 September 2015; and the Claimant responded by letters of 17 and 23 September 2015, respectively.\n\n1.22.\n\nOn 28 September 2015, having considered the Parties' written submissions, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (\"PO3\"), fixing a deadline of 25 November 2015 for the filing the of Respondent's Memorial of Objections to Jurisdiction, together with any request for bifurcation.\n\n1.23.\n\nOn 25 November 2015, the Respondent filed a Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Request for Bifurcation, along with supporting documentation.\n\n1.24.\n\nOn 2 December 2015, the Tribunal held a procedural meeting by telephone conference call with the Parties to address outstanding issues regarding the procedural timetable for the entire case, including for the Parties' respective submissions on Respondent's request for bifurcation and its application for a stay, or suspension, of the arbitration.\n\n1.25.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal's directions given during the procedural conference call on 2 December 2015, on 9 December 2015 the Parties submitted by letter their respective proposals for procedural calendars on both bifurcated and non-bifurcated scenarios. The Respondent also submitted its proposed procedural calendar if the Tribunal were to order a stay or suspension of this arbitration pending the resolution of three other arbitrations pending before the Cairo Regional Centre for International Commercial Arbitration (\"CRCICA\") and the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\").\n\n1.26.\n\nOn 22 December 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (\"PO4\"), setting out a procedural timetable for the filing of the Claimant's Counter-Memorial in Opposition to the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation, the Respondent's Reply to such Counter-Memorial and the Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial. The Tribunal reserved, for the time being, its decision regarding Respondent's request for a stay or suspension of this arbitration.\n\n1.27.\n\nOn 22 December 2015, the Claimant filed its Objection to Respondent's Request for Bifurcation.\n\n1.28.\n\nOn 30 December 2015, the Respondent requested an adjustment of dates as proposed in a schedule. On the invitation by the Tribunal, on 11 January 2016, the Claimant submitted its response to the Respondent's letter of 30 December 2015, objecting to any date adjustments.\n\n1.29.\n\nOn 18 January 2016, the Respondent filed its Reply Memorial on Bifurcation.\n\n1.30.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Bifurcation.\n\n1.31.\n\nOn 4 March 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 (\"PO5\") concerning the two procedural issues of bifurcation and stay/suspension raised by the Respondent on 25 November 2015. The Tribunal decided to join the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction to the merits of the dispute. With regard to the Respondent's application for a stay/suspension, the Tribunal requested that it \"continue to be informed on a regular basis by the Parties of the progress made in the CRICCA and ICC arbitrations (insofar as it may be permissible for each of them to do so).\"2 The Tribunal made no order for a stay or suspension of this arbitration.\n\nPO5, Paragraph 3.11.\n\n1.32.\n\nOn 8 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 (\"PO6\"), by which it addressed certain unresolved differences between the Parties over the procedural timetable. The Tribunal fixed a procedural calendar for the filing of further written pleadings and requests for document production. The Tribunal also proposed dates for the oral hearing, which both Parties subsequently confirmed as beginning on 6 March 2017.\n\n1.33.\n\nOn 13 June 2016, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility; and the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits.\n\n1.34.\n\nFollowing the completion of their first round of written pleadings on the merits, pursuant to the Tribunal's PO1 and PO6, on 29 July 2016 the Parties submitted their respective Schedules of Requests for Document Production.\n\n1.35.\n\nOn 22 August 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 (\"PO7\") addressing the production of documents disputed by the Parties.\n\n1.36.\n\nBy letter of 12 September 2016, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties had been unable to complete the work necessary to carry out the Tribunal's directions relating to document production by the deadline of 31 August 2016, as required by PO7. As a result, the Claimant had agreed with the Respondent upon an extension of the deadlines for the remaining two rounds of written pleadings. The Tribunal approved the Parties' agreed extension on 13 September 2016.\n\n1.37.\n\nOn 22 September 2016, the Claimant and the Respondent submitted their respective privilege logs.\n\n1.38.\n\nIn accordance with the adjusted timetable, on 7 October 2016, the Respondent filed its Reply Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility; and the Claimant filed its Reply on the Merits.\n\n1.39.\n\nOn 26 October 2016, the Claimant requested an order from the Tribunal directing the Respondent to produce the five documents listed in the Respondent's Privilege Log, subject to any confidentiality undertakings considered appropriate by the Tribunal, and to produce documents responsive to the Claimant's Request No. 1 ordered under the Tribunal's PO7.3\n\nPO7, Paragraph 30.\n\n1.40.\n\nOn 28 October 2016, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to reply by 7 November 2016.\n\n1.41.\n\nOn 7 November 2016, the Respondent filed observations disputing the Claimant's application of 26 October 2016, and asked the Tribunal to reject the Claimant's request that the five documents listed in the Respondent's Privilege Log be produced. The Respondent further stated that, following a diligent search, it had not identified any documents responsive to the Claimant's Request No. 1; namely, for the 1999 Gas Master Plan for Egypt issued by the Government of Egypt and/or its State-owned companies (the \"Master Plan\").\n\n1.42.\n\nOn 12 December 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 (\"PO8\") concerning production of documents and procedural matters. The Tribunal made no order for the production of the five documents listed in the Respondent's Privilege Log. The Tribunal stated that that it \"will [...] keep the matter under consideration in the light of any further relevant circumstances, including the Hearing.\"4 The Tribunal asked the Respondent to clarify its position concerning its knowledge of any version of the Master Plan held by any third person or organization; whether it had made any attempt to procure such a version from any such third party; and to describe such attempt or attempts. The Tribunal also invited the Parties to inform the Tribunal concerning the status of their travel and visa arrangements for the March 2017 Hearing.\n\nPO8, Paragraph 5.\n\n1.43.\n\nBy letter of 28 December 2016, the Respondent replied that it was unable to locate or procure the particular document.\n\n1.44.\n\nOn 16 January 2017, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits and the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n1.45.\n\nOn 31 January 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 concerning procedural matters.\n\n1.46.\n\nOn 6 February 2017, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organisational meeting by telephone conference with the Parties. By letter of 6 February 2017, ICSID transmitted to the Parties the Tribunal's decision to maintain the scheduled date and venue of the Hearing. The Parties were asked to inform the Tribunal promptly of any material event jeopardizing the March 2017 Hearing in Washington, D.C. resulting from political developments in the USA's new administration.\n\n1.47.\n\nThe Tribunal also approved the Parties' agreed positions concerning the organisation of the Hearing, as communicated to the Tribunal on 3 February 2017. These included the hearing schedule and allocation of time, the preparation of an indicative complete hearing schedule, the order in which fact witnesses would be called for examination, the presentation of hearing bundles and other materials, the submission of posthearing briefs and statements of costs, and main logistical matters.\n\n1.48.\n\nOn 6 February 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 (\"PO10\"), by which it confirmed that the March 2017 Hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits will be held in Washington, D.C.\n\n1.49.\n\nBy email of 8 February 2017, both Parties submitted their lists of fact witnesses and experts for cross-examination at the Hearing.\n\n1.50.\n\nBy letter of 22 February 2017, the Respondent requested that the Claimant withdraw from the record certain documents filed with the Claimant's Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (namely Exhibits C-0456 and C-0458 through C-0463) or, in the alternative, that the Tribunal find these documents inadmissible and strike them from the record of the arbitration. The Respondent argued that these documents constituted confidential state secrets not subject to disclosure under Egyptian law.\n\n1.51.\n\nOn 24 February 2017, the Claimant applied to the Tribunal for leave to introduce additional documents into the record, including twelve Exhibits (C-0476 through C0487) (the \"New Documents\") and seven Legal Authorities (CL-0250 through CL-0256).\n\n1.52.\n\nBy letter of 28 February 2017, responding to the Respondent's letter of 22 February 2017, the Claimant declined to withdraw any of the documents and opposed the Respondent's request that the Tribunal strike these documents from the record. The Claimant's letter was accompanied by one new Exhibit (C-0488)5 and sixteen additional Legal Authorities (CL-0257 through CL-0272).\n\nDockets of Exhibits submitted on behalf of Mr. Sameh Fahmy in Case No. 41 of 2011, [C-0488].\n\n1.53.\n\nOn 1 March 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 (\"PO11\"), concerning the examination of expert witnesses.\n\n1.54.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimant requested leave from the Tribunal to introduce into the record a new Legal Authority.6 By email of 5 March 2017, the Respondent indicated that it did not object to the Claimant's request. The new Legal Authority was admitted into the record of the arbitration by the Tribunal on 6 March 2017.7\n\n*Ampal v. Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/11, Decision on Liability and Heads of Loss, 21 February 2017, [CL-0273].\n\nTr. D1 10:16-22.\n\n1.55.\n\nOn 2 March 2017, responding to the Claimant's application of 24 February 2017, the Respondent stated that it did not oppose the admission of two of the New Documents (namely Exhibits C-0482 (Transcripts of the CRCICA case 896 Hearings of 30 January and 3 February 2017) and C-0487 (English translation of Exhibit NAV-175)), but raised arguments as to why the remainder should not be admitted into evidence.\n\n1.56.\n\nOn 2 March 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 (\"PO12\") directing the Respondent to reply in writing to the Claimant's letter of 28 February 2017. The Tribunal indicated that it wished to decide the procedural issue before the commencement of the Hearing on 6 March 2017.\n\n1.57.\n\nBy letter of 5 March 2017, responding to the Claimant's letter of 28 February 2017, the Respondent reiterated its request that the Tribunal exclude from the record of the arbitration Claimant's Exhibits C-0456 and C-0458 through C-0463, pursuant to Article 9(2)(f) of the IBA Rules.\n\n1.58.\n\nThe Hearing was held at ICSID in Washington D.C., USA, from 6 to 11 March 2017.

The Claimant's new factual Exhibits were admitted *de bene esse*.10 The Tribunal announced its decision without reasons, but indicated that it might wish to revisit the decision later.11\n\nTr. D1 11-58.\n\nTr. D1 56.\n\nTr. D1 57.\n\nTr. D1 56.\n\n1.62.\n\nAs directed by the Tribunal on the final day of the Hearing,12 by letter of 15 March 2017 the Claimant confirmed that, having performed a comprehensive review of the hearing record, it had determined that, from the disputed ten New Documents. one was referred to during the Hearing (Exhibit C-0486). The Claimant maintained that the admission of the New Documents was warranted; and it requested that the Tribunal confirm the admission of all documents labeled C-0476 through C-0486.\n\nTr. D6 1795.\n\n1.63.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses below the admission of these several \"*de bene esse*\" materials.\n\n1.64.\n\nOn 19 April 2017, the Parties agreed on transcript corrections. The finalized transcripts were sent to the Tribunal on 1 May 2017.\n\n1.65.\n\nDuring the Pre-Hearing conference-call on 6 February 2017 and again at the Hearing,13 the Tribunal requested the Parties to try to complete and provide an agreed chronology. On 21 April 2017, the Claimant sent to the Respondent a draft chronology for comments. On 22 April 2017, the Respondent objected to the draft prepared by the Claimant. On the same date, the Claimant transmitted its draft chronology to the Tribunal.\n\nTr. D6 1708-1709.\n\n1.66.\n\nOn 23 April 2017, the Tribunal inquired when the Respondent would be in a position to submit its own draft chronology and/or comment on the Claimant's draft chronology. On 28 April 2017, the Respondent replied that it would provide comments within 2-3 weeks.\n\n1.67.\n\nOn 17 May 2017, each Party filed a statement of costs.\n\n1.68.\n\nOn 22 May 2017, the Respondent sent a redline PDF reflecting Respondent's comments on the draft chronology prepared by the Claimant to the Tribunal. A clean Word version of the revised document was also attached.\n\n1.69.\n\n*The \"de bene esse\" Materials:* As to C-0456 and C-0458 to C-0463, these materials were submitted as exhibits to the Claimant's Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility. The Respondent requested that the Claimant withdraw them or, alternatively, that the Tribunal strike them from the record pursuant to Article 9(2)(f) of the IBA Rules. The Claimant refused to withdraw them. The Tribunal ruled on the first day of the Hearing that it should retain and inspect these documents *de bene esse.*\n\n1.70.\n\nAs to Exhibits C-0476 to C-0488, the Claimant submitted these materials on 24 February (C-0476 through C-0487) and 28 February 2017 (C-0488). The Respondent did not oppose the admission of two of these documents, namely: C-0482 and C-0487. The Tribunal decided on the first day of the Hearing that these other materials would be inspected by the Tribunal *de bene esse* and ruled upon their admission later\n\n1.71.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided this procedural issue as follows: Only one of these documents was referred to by the Claimant during the Hearing, namely C-0486 (see the Claimant's letter of 15 March 2017). In that letter, however, the Claimant asked the Tribunal to confirm the admission of all its materials. In the circumstances, in the absence of any material prejudice to the Respondent, the Tribunal has decided to admit all such materials into the evidential file.\n\n1.72.\n\n*The Six (Seven Documents):* On 21 June 2017, the Respondent filed an application for the production of six additional documents produced by the Claimant in CRCICA Arbitration No. 896/2013. The Claimant objected to their production by letter of 30 June 2017. The Respondent replied by letter of 8 August 2017.\n\n1.73.\n\nOn 4 September 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13 (\"PO13\"). The Tribunal ordered the Claimant to produce to the Tribunal and the Respondent true copies of the requested documents *de bene esse*. The Tribunal made the production of these documents subject to the Parties' entering into a suitable confidentiality agreement given that four of the documents were said to be confidential as regards other interested parties.\n\n1.74.\n\nOn 20 September 2017, following the execution by the Respondent of a confidentiality undertaking, the Claimant produced the six documents ordered by the Tribunal. The Claimant also produced an additional seventh contemporaneous document, a Termination Agreement dated 27 November 2003 (not covered by PO13).\n\n1.75.\n\nBy letter of 23 November 2017, the Respondent asserted that the six documents produced were highly relevant and material to the issues of corruption, reiterated its request that the Six Documents be admitted into evidence, and sought permission from the Tribunal to file a short submission on these documents to assist the Tribunal. By letters of 30 November 2017 and 8 December 2017, the Claimant objected to the application and requested that the Tribunal reject the Respondent's proposal for a written submission supporting admission of the six documents.\n\n1.76.\n\nOn 12 December 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14 (\"PO14\"). The Tribunal granted permission to the Respondent to submit, in writing, short observations not exceeding five pages on \"the six documents.\" Further, the Tribunal requested the Respondent to comment, in writing, upon the other matters raised in the Claimant's letter dated 8 December 2017.\n\n1.77.\n\nBy its letter dated 8 December 2017, the Claimant informed the Tribunal (*inter alia*) of developments in the CRICA Arbitration (896) between UFG and EGAS:\n\n*Earlier this week, on December 5, 2017, EGAS sought leave from the Tribunal in CRCICA Case 896 to disclose to Egypt the pleadings filed by UFG and EGAS on EGAS' corruption defense in that case. EGAS explained to the Tribunal that it sought such leave because Egypt intends to submit these Case 896 pleadings in this arbitration. Specifically, EGAS stated: 'We understand that the Arab Republic of Egypt would seek to place these submissions before the tribunal in Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Gas, S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/4).' Egypt's determination to use these materials must be quite strong since EGAS made its request notwithstanding that the Case 896 Tribunal had already closed that proceeding and admonished the parties not to submit further requests [\u2026] As we have previously noted, EGAS has entered into a joint defense agreement with Egypt and is therefore doubtless well informed of *Egypt's intentions in this arbitration* [... ].*\n\n1.78.\n\nPursuant to PO14, the Respondent made its written submissions on the \"six documents\" and other matters by letter dated 21 December 2017. At the Tribunal's request of 23 December 2017 under PO14, the Claimant submitted its response by letter dated 3 January 2018.\n\n1.79.\n\nPursuant to the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 15, the Respondent made further submissions by letter dated 22 January 2018; and the Claimant made further submissions by letter also dated 22 January 2018.\n\n1.80.\n\nIn its Procedural Order No. 16 dated 2 February 2018, the Tribunal decided as follows:\n\n*1. The Tribunal refers to the Respondent's application to the Tribunal for an order admitting new documents into this arbitration's evidential file and to the Claimant's opposition to the Respondent's application. The Respondent's application addressed originally only six documents. The Claimant thereafter produced a seventh document. The Tribunal considers that all seven documents should be read together for the purpose of this Procedural Order.*\n\n*2. The Tribunal refers to its Procedural Orders Nos 13, 14 and 15 and the Parties' respective letters (or email messages) dated 22 January 2018 (two), 3 January 2018, 21 December 2017, 8 December 2017, 30 November 2017, 23 November 2017, 20 September 2017 (email), 19 September 2017 (email), 8 August 2017, 30 June 2017 and 21 June 2017.*\n\n*3. Notwithstanding the Respondent's application made at a late stage of this arbitration, the Tribunal considers that these six new documents are relevant to issues raised by the Parties' dispute, as also the seventh document. Accordingly, the Tribunal has decided to admit these seven new documents into the evidential file, together with the Parties' several submissions regarding these documents made in their respective correspondence listed above.*\n\n*4. This Procedural Order is strictly limited to the admission of the seven new documents into the evidential file. The arbitration's evidential file is closed to the Parties. Nonetheless, the Tribunal reserves its right to request any further written explanations from the Parties.*\n\n1.81.\n\n*The \"Parallel Arbitrations\"*: By letter dated 8 June 2018, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of developments in certain \"parallel arbitrations.\" By letter dated 8 June 2018, the Claimant responded to the Respondent's said letter. By its Procedural Order No. 17 of 11 July 2018 (see also below), the Tribunal decided to retain these two letters on the file for information and not evidential purposes; and, in the circumstances, it rejected the Claimant's application to respond further to the Respondent's letter.\n\n1.82.\n\n*Closure:* By its Procedural Order No. 17, the Tribunal closed the proceeding on 11 July 2018, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1). The Tribunal's Order was dispatched to the Parties by email on the same date.\n\nPART II: THE PARTIES' DISPUTE\n-----------------------------\n\n(1) Introduction\n----------------\n\n2.1.\n\nA dispute exists under the Treaty between the Claimant, UFG, and the Respondent, the Arab Republic of Egypt, in regard to UFG's alleged investments in Egypt regarding the Damietta natural gas liquefaction plant located in the northeast of Egypt (the \"Damietta Plant\") and associated legal and contractual rights. In general terms, UFG's business concerns the liquefaction, shipping, regasification and commercialisation of natural gas. The Respondent, a sovereign State, advances objections as to jurisdiction and admissibility in regard to the Claimant's claims. Alternatively, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to suspend this arbitration pending the resolution of similar disputes in other arbitrations. In the further alternative, the Respondent denies any liability to the Claimant and, if liable, disputes the amounts of compensation claimed by the Claimant.\n\n(2) The Claimant's Claims\n-------------------------\n\n2.2.\n\nIn summary, UFG contends that the Respondent has failed, through its own acts and omissions and through the acts and omissions of its State instrumentalities and organs for which the Respondent bears international responsibility (EGPC and EGAS), to afford to UFG's investments in Egypt the protections granted by the Treaty.1 UFG contends that its investments have suffered and continue to suffer significant harm as a result of the decisions attributable to the Respondent to curtail and cut the supply of natural gas to the Damietta Plant, which eventually resulted in the Damietta Plant's complete shut-down for lack of the necessary gas supply.2\n\nRfA, Paragraph 2.\n\nRfA, Paragraph 3.\n\n2.3.\n\nUFG contends that the Respondent, through its own actions and omissions and by the acts and omissions of EGAS, EGPC and their affiliates, has breached its substantive obligations under the Treaty; namely:3 (i) the obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment to UFG's investments under Article 4(1); (ii) the obligation not to hamper by means of unjustified or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, expansion or disposal of UFG's investment under Article 3(1); (iii) the obligation to protect UFG's investment under Article 3(1); and (iv) the obligation to provide UFG's investment with treatment not less favourable than that accorded to investments made by its own nationals or investors of a third country under Articles 4(5) and 4(2) of the Treaty.\n\nRfA, Paragraphs 26-29.\n\n(3) The Respondent's Objections, Responses and Defences\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n2.4.\n\nIn summary, as to jurisdiction and admissibility, the Respondent first contends that the Damietta project was \"riddled with corruption\": UFG selected Halliburton, whose bid was US$ 50 million higher than that of the next competitor, as its subcontractor; and Halliburton's CEO pleaded guilty in the USA to violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including bribes and kickbacks in connection with the Damietta Project.4\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 5.\n\n2.5.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that UFG's procurement of the Project is replete with \"red flags.\" As explained later in Part VII of this Award, these red flags include the following, based particularly on the \"Six Documents\" [REDACTED] :\n\n(i) the Project takes place in a country known for corrupt payments, namely Egypt at the time of the events in question;\n\n(ii) [REDACTED]\n\n(iii) There is no substantial time lag between [REDACTED] and the date when the main contract is awarded to the principal ([REDACTED] to 1 August 2000);\n\n(iv) The subject matter of the [REDACTED] is not tangible (for example, [REDACTED]\n\n(v) The agent has a close personal or family relationship, or business relationship, with a public official or relative of an official (such as that between Mr El Komy and the Respondent's Minister Mr Fahmy), which is the only qualification the agent brings to the venture;\n\n(vi) The agent is a shell company or has some other non-transparent corporate structure (EATCO is a shell entity owned by members of Mr El Komy's family);\n\n(vii) [REDACTED]\n\n(viii) [REDACTED]\n\n2.6.\n\nThe Respondent submits, therefore, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or should not exercise its jurisdiction because the Claimant procured its alleged investments through corrupt and illegal means in violation of Egyptian law and international public policy.5\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 7; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph 8.\n\n2.7.\n\nThe Respondent next contends that the Claimant has failed to establish that its alleged investments were investments of a Spanish investor at the time that the acts and omissions occurred that the Claimant alleges to constitute violations of the Treaty. The Respondent submits that, in July 2007, SEGAS assigned to HSBC UK all of its rights under the Tolling Agreements in the context of a refinancing transaction that led UFG to pledge to HSBC Egypt its shares in SEGAS, and associated rights to the Damietta Plant, as security. Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to establish any investment under the Treaty.6\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 44- 45 and 50; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph 48.\n\n2.8.\n\nThe Respondent next contends that this dispute is essentially contractual in nature7 and has been submitted to contractual arbitrations.8 Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction or should not exercise its jurisdiction over this dispute.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 51.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 73.\n\n2.9.\n\nAs to the suspension of this arbitration, the Respondent requests that this Tribunal suspend or stay this arbitration until the resolution of the contractual claims in the contractual arbitrations by the ICC and CRCICA tribunals.9\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 90 to 92.\n\n2.10.\n\nAs to the merits, the Respondent contends that the conduct of which UFG complains is not attributable to the Respondent;10 nor is the conduct an exercise of sovereign powers that could engage the Respondent's international responsibility under the Treaty;11 there is, in any event, no breach of the FET standard of the Treaty;12 the Respondent did not fail to accord protection to UFG's investment;13 the Respondent did not impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or expansion of UFG's investment by unjustified or discriminatory measures;14 the Respondent did not fail to accord to UFG National or MFN Treatment;15 and, in any event, any wrongful conduct complained of would be precluded by state of necessity, if, *quod non*, such conduct were attributable to the Respondent, involved an exercise of governmental authority and was not in conformity with the obligations under the Treaty.16 Further, the Respondent contends that no recoverable damages have been proven by UFG.17\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 181.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 213.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 220.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 288.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 288.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 314.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 331.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 367.\n\n(4) The Parties' Prayers for Relief\n-----------------------------------\n\n2.11.\n\n*Jurisdiction/Admissibility - The Respondent's Claim for Relief:* The Respondent requests the Tribunal in Paragraph 110 of its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Request for Bifurcation, in material part:\n\n*(b) Dismiss Claimant's claims for lack of jurisdiction;*\n\n*(c) In eventu, decline to exercise jurisdiction over Claimant's claims;*\n\n[...]\n\n*(e) Order Claimant to pay to Respondent the full costs of this arbitration, including, without limitation, arbitrators' fees and expenses, administrative costs, counsel fees, expenses and any other costs associated with this arbitration;*\n\n*(f) Order Claimant to pay to Respondent interest on the amounts awarded under (e) aboveuntil the date of full payment;*\n\n*(g) Grant any further relief to Respondent as it may deem appropriate.*\n\n2.12.\n\n*Jurisdiction/Admissibility - The Claimant's Claim for Relief* : The Claimant requests the Tribunal, in Paragraph 89 of its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, to order the following relief:\n\n*(a) Reject Egypt's jurisdictional objections in their entirety and confirm its jurisdiction over the dispute;*\n\n*(b) Order Egypt to pay all costs and expenses of the jurisdictional phase of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of UFG's legal representatives in respect of this phase and any other costs; and*\n\n[(c)] *Order any further relief that the tribunal deems just and appropriate.*\n\n2.13.\n\n*Stay/Suspension - The Respondent's Claim for Relief* : The Respondent requests the Tribunal in Paragraph 110 of its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and Request for Bifurcation, in material part, to:\n\n*(d)* In eventu *, suspend the proceedings pending the resolution of the Contractual Arbitrations* [described as the ICC arbitration between SEGAS and EGAS under the Tolling Agreement; the CRCICA arbitration between UFG and EGAS under the SPA; and the CRCICA arbitration between UFG and EGAS under the SPA).\n\n2.14.\n\n*Stay/Suspension - The Claimant's Claim for Relief* : The Claimants requests the Tribunal in Paragraph 212 of its Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, in material part to:\n\n*(c) Deny Egypt's request that these proceedings be suspended pending resolution of the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations* [\u2026]\n\n2.15.\n\n*Merits: The Claimant's Claim for Relief* : The Claimant requests the Tribunal, in Paragraph 638 of its Memorial on the Merits,18 to order the following relief:\n\n*a.

Award Claimant compensation for the full amount of damages it suffered due to Egypt's breaches of its BIT obligations, in the amounts set forth in this Memorial;*\n\n*c. Award Claimant pre-award and post-award interest on any compensatory amounts until the date of full satisfaction of the award, at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal in accordance with the BIT;*\n\n*d. Order Egypt to pay all costs and expenses of this arbitration, including ICSID's administrative fees, the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal, the fees and expenses of UFG's legal representatives in respect of this arbitration and any other costs of this arbitration; and*\n\n*e. Grant any other and further relief that it deems just and proper.*\n\n*See also* the Claimant's request in the Reply on the Merits, Paragraph 473.\n\n2.16.\n\n*Merits: The Respondent's Claim for Relief:* The Respondent requests the Tribunal, in Paragraph 389 of its Counter-Memorial on the Merits,19 to order the following relief:\n\n*(a) Dismiss the Claimant's claims in their entirety for lack of jurisdiction and/or as inadmissible;*\n\n*(b) In eventu, stay the proceeding pending the resolution of the contractual arbitrations;*\n\n*(c) Alternatively, dismiss Claimant's claims on the merits in their entirety;*\n\n*(d) In the further alternative, declare that Claimant is not entitled to the damages it seeks, or to any damages;*\n\n*(e) In any event, order Claimant to pay all the costs of this arbitration as well as the Respondent's legal costs and expenses in connection with this arbitration, including but not limited to its attorney's fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of its experts; and*\n\n*(f) grant such further relief against Claimant as the Tribunal deems fit and proper.*\n\nSee also the Respondent's request in the Rejoinder on the Merits, Paragraph 465.\n\nPART III: THE PRINCIPAL TEXTS\n-----------------------------\n\n(1) Introduction\n----------------\n\n3.1.\n\nThe Tribunal here describes and recites, for later ease of reference, the principal legal texts to which it refers later in this Award.\n\n(2) The Treaty [C-0001]\n-----------------------\n\n3.2.\n\nThe Treaty was signed between Spain and Egypt on 3 November 1992; and it entered into force on 26 April 1994.\n\n3.3.\n\nArticle 1 of the Treaty, \"Definitions,\" provides in material part (to which the Tribunal has here added square brackets for ease of reference below):\n\n*For the purposes of the present Agreement,*\n\n*1.

In addition to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this article, each Party shall apply, under its own law, no less favourable treatment to the investments of investors of the other Party than which is that granted to its own investors.*\n\n3.6.\n\nArticle 6 of the Treaty, \"Nationalization and Expropriation,\" provides in material part:\n\n*The nationalization, expropriation or any other measure of similar characteristics or effects that may be applied by the authorities of one Party against the investments in its own territory of investors of the other Party must be applied exclusively for reasons of public interest pursuant to the law, and shall in no case be discriminatory. The Party adopting such measures shall pay to the investor or his legal beneficiary an adequate indemnity in convertible currency without unjustified delay.*\n\n3.7.\n\nArticle 11 of the Treaty, \"Disputes between One Party and Investors of the Other Party\", provides in material part (the \"Arbitration Agreement,\" to which the Tribunal has here added square brackets for ease of reference below):\n\n*1. Disputes between one of the Parties and one investor of the other Party shall be notified in writing, including a detailed information, by the investor to the host Party of the investment. As far as possible the Parties shall endeavour to settle these differences by means of a friendly agreement.*\n\n*2. If these disputes cannot be settled in this way within six months from the date of the written notification mentioned in paragraph 1, the conflict shall be submitted, at the choice of the investor, to:*\n\n- [1] *a court of arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.*\n\n- [2] *the court of arbitration of the Paris International Chamber of Commerce.*\n\n- [3] *the ad hoc court of arbitration established under the Arbitration Rules of Procedure of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law.*\n\n- [4] *the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) set up by the 'Convention on Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States', in case both Parties become signatories of this Convention.*\n\n- [5] *Regional Center for International Commercial Arbitration in Cairo.*\n\n*3.

The latter takes the form of a chronology, limited to the facts found necessary by the Tribunal for the purposes of this Award.\n\n4.3.\n\n*(VI) Jurisdiction (with Admissibility) Issues:* In Part VI of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the Respondent's jurisdictional objections; namely (as alleged by the Respondent): (i) the absence of any protected investments within the meaning of Article 1 of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention; (ii) the \"claimsplitting\" tactics employed by the Claimant and SEGAS in their disputes and several arbitrations with the Respondent and EGAS; and (iii) the contractual nature of the Claimant's claims.\n\n4.4.\n\n*(VII) Corruption Issues:* In Part VII of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the Respondent's other objection to jurisdiction and admissibility based on \"corruption,\" namely the several alleged acts of corruption by the Claimant (including its predecessor UFACEX) in procuring the SPA made with EGPC (succeeded by EGAS).\n\n4.5.\n\n*(VIII) Necessity Issues:* In Part VIII of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the defence of necessity under customary international law pleaded by the Respondent to preclude its international responsibility for the alleged international wrongs under the Treaty towards the Claimant. (The Treaty does not contain any specific provision on the defence of necessity).\n\n4.6.\n\n*(IX) Merits Issues:* In Part IX of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the merits of the Claimant's claims and the Respondent's defences under the Treaty.\n\n4.7.\n\n*(X) Compensation Issues;* In Part X of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the Parties' respective submissions on compensation, applying the legal principles applicable under the Treaty and international law.\n\n4.8.\n\n*(XI) Stay/Suspension Issues:* In Part XI of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the Respondent's contention (opposed by the Claimant) that the Tribunal should decline to exercise its jurisdiction, or order a stay (or suspension) of this arbitration pending the resolution of CRCICA and ICC arbitrations.\n\n4.9.\n\n*(XII) Costs Issues:* In Part XII of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the Parties' respective claims for legal and arbitration costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention (namely, the expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with this arbitration, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of ICSID's facilities).\n\n4.10.\n\nThe list and description of these principal issues is not exhaustive. Moreover, the Tribunal has not found it necessary or appropriate to decide in this Award all issues forming part of the Parties' overall dispute.\n\n*PART V: THE PRINCIPAL FACTS*\n-----------------------------\n\n*(1) Introduction*\n------------------\n\n5.1.\n\nThe following description of persons and events is not exhaustive, albeit lengthy. Moreover, the events are mostly confined to evidential references to contemporary documentation in the form of a documentary chronology. The chronology is largely drawn from the Parties' own chronologies submitted at the request of the Tribunal. These rival chronologies were not agreed between the Parties; and, further, it should not be assumed that any Party agrees with the Tribunal's chronology below, recording the more limited facts found necessary by the Tribunal for the purpose of this Award.\n\n*(2) Dramatis Personae*\n-----------------------\n\n5.2.\n\nThe project for the Damietta Plant included several legal and other persons, at different times.\n\n5.3.\n\n*UFG:* UFG is the Claimant. It is a company incorporated under the laws of Spain, and (by \"assignment\") a contractual party to the SPA. It also owns just under 80% of SEGAS' shares. Mr J.M. Egea Krauel was UFG's Chairman from December 2009 onwards. In March 2010, Mr J. S\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez was appointed UFG's Executive Vice-President for Supply and Operations. Both testified as factual witnesses in this arbitration.1\n\nEgea Krauel WS; Tr. D2 482-552; S\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez WS1 and WS2; Tr. D2 401-477.\n\n5.4.\n\n*UFACEX* : UFG's predecessor-in-interest in regard to the SPA and the Damietta Plant was Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Desarrollo y Acci\u00f3n Exterior S.A. (\"UFACEX\"). It was a wholly owned subsidiary of Uni\u00f3n Fenosa, which later merged with another company to become Gas Natural Fenosa SDG, S.A., and which holds 50% of the shares in UFG.\n\n5.5.\n\n*UFGC:* UFG owns 99.99% of UFGC *.* UFGC bought gas from UFG, and sold it on to other customers outside Egypt.\n\n5.6.\n\n*SEGAS:* SEGAS, the owner and operator of the Damietta Plant, is owned as to just under 80% by UFG. UFG established SEGAS in 2000, as an Egyptian joint stock company majority-owned by UFG, to develop and operate the Damietta Plant. At the time of the SPA, the Damietta Free Zone was operative, having been established in 1993.2 As intended by UFG, SEGAS was granted tax-free status under Egyptian tax laws by GAFI (the Respondent's General Authority for Foreign Investment and Free Zones).3 That tax status was changed by the Respondent in 2008. That change forms part of UFG's claims in this arbitration.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 43.\n\nDecision of the Director of GAFI No. 3336 of 2001 regarding a License for the Spanish Egyptian Gas Company (SEGAS) to Carry out its Activities in accordance with the Private Free Zone Regime, [R-0075].\n\n5.7.\n\nOf SEGAS' directors from 2000 to 2009, Mr Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez testified as a factual witness in this arbitration. Another former director and shareholder was Mr Yehia El Komy (who was not called as a witness in this arbitration). Mr J.L. de Lara Alonso-Bur\u00f3n was an engineer employed by SEGAS at the Damietta Plant from April 2005 to December 2012 (excepting a period of convalescence in Spain from December 2006 to November 2007). He testified as a factual witness in this arbitration.4\n\nDe Lara Alonso-Bur\u00f3n WS; Tr. D2 636-670.\n\n5.8.\n\nAs Mr Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez testified:\n\n*Uni\u00f3n Fenosa decided from the beginning to create a local corporate vehicle, SEGAS, for the sole purpose of building, owning and operating the Damietta Plant. SEGAS was incorporated in Egypt in 2000. SEGAS does not itself own, purchase, or export gas but instead provides liquefaction services in exchange for the payment of a tolling fee. The fee is to be paid by UFG and EGAS as tollers (companies who own natural gas that is liquefied at the LNG plant) under two separate Tolling Contracts and is prorated on the basis of the gas quantities they have contracted to toll through the Plant. EGPC and EGAS each obtained 10% ownership of SEGAS; and EGAS obtained 51.98% of the Plant's production capacity for an initial four-year period and thereafter only up to 41.80% for the remaining contract years.*5\n\nFern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez WS, Paragraph 17.\n\n5.9.\n\n*Gas Natural Fenosa* : In 2009, Uni\u00f3n Fenosa merged with Gas Natural SDG, S.A., becoming \"Gas Natural Fenosa.\" As a result, Gas Natural Fenosa owns 50% of UFG, which in turn owns 79.99870% of SEGAS. The remaining shares in SEGAS are owned by EGAS (10%), EGPC (10%) and a subsidiary of Gas Natural Fenosa (0.00087%).\n\n5.10.\n\n*ENI* : In 2003, Uni\u00f3n Fenosa sold 50% of its interest in UFG to ENI Spa. (\"ENI\").\n\n5.11.\n\nFor ease of reference below, save where the context requires otherwise, these different entities are described as \"Uni\u00f3n Fenosa,\" \"Gas Natural Fenosa,\" \"SEGAS,\" \"UFACEX\" and \"UFG\" (as the sole Claimant in this arbitration).\n\n5.12.\n\n*EATCO.* The Egyptian Arab Trading Company (\"EATCO\") is an Egyptian company, operated and controlled by Mr Yehia El Komy, a national of Egypt. From the early days of the Project, EATCO and Mr El Komy had a relationship with Uni\u00f3n Fenosa. Mr El Komy was not a witness in this arbitration.\n\n5.13.\n\nIn brief, this relationship included the following: EATCO and UFACEX entered into an agreement on 9 March 2000.6 under which the parties were to undertake a prefeasibility study into the Damietta Plant, and EATCO was to provide logistical and technical support to UFACEX. UFACEX [REDACTED]\n\nAgreement between UFACEX and EATCO, 9 March 2000, [C-0439].\n\n5.14.\n\n*Mr El Komy:* As already indicated. Mr. Yehia El Komy was an Egyptian businessman, operating EATCO. of which he was the Chairman and Managing Director. His role in the Project is controversial and strongly disputed between the Parties. As pleaded in the Claimant's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, the Claimant contended that Mr El Komy was the originator of the Project, a partner of UFACEX and that the fees he received were relatively modest in the light of his contributions to the Project, beginning with events leading up to the SPA.10\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 8 and 54.\n\n5.15.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Mr El Komy's role was much more significant, as part of a corrupt conspiracy involving (*inter alia*) EATCO, UFACEX and UFG. The Respondent refers, in particular, to contemporary documents, all of which are addressed in the chronology below under the heading \"Six Documents\" (there are, in fact, seven such documents).11\n\nThe Tribunal has taken the Respondent's case on these Six Documents largely from Annex I to its letter dated 21 December 2017.\n\n5.16.\n\n*EGPC:* The Respondent created EGPC (the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation) by law in 1976 to regulate and manage the Egyptian hydrocarbons sector.12\n\nLaw No. 20 of 1976 regarding the Egyptian Petroleum Corporation, 17 March 1976, [R-0002].\n\n5.17.\n\n*EGAS:* EGAS is wholly owned by EGPC. It succeeded, by way of \"assignment\" to EGPC's rights and obligations under the SPA.

It featured the creation of a 'Master Plan' which should remain valid through 2017. The Master Plan involves price optimization to attract investors, increased gas exports, and infrastructure development, qualified by six considerations:*\n\n*1. An export ceiling - 25%> of total production;*\n\n*2. No foreign or domestic gas operator may export gas from Egypt prior to investing in Egypt's domestic gas market;*\n\n*3. Special incentives were established to encourage foreign and Egyptian Exploration & Production (E&P) companies to establish marketing franchises, in order to promote gas-based business within Egypt;*\n\n*4. Incentives were also established to encourage diversification within the gas industry;*\n\n*5. Exploration & Production (E&P) incentives were aimed to maintain a higher level of attractiveness, when compared with neighboring countries;*\n\n*6.

ELKOMI, Chairman and Managing Director of EATCO, setting out the reality and viability of our expectations.*\n\n5.28.\n\nThe fax of 20 January 2000 from Mr El Komy states (*inter alia*) in relation to the Project: \"we would like to inform you that we have obtained the initial approval from the Egyptian government to construct such a project.\" It is cited more fully below:\n\n*Reference to our telephone conversation at this week and with regard to the meeting held on Jan 10, 2000 with Mr Omar El-Koumy, ADGAS-U.A.E. regarding the Spanish company interest to construct LNG and Electrical Power Plant of 500 MW using local Egyptian natural gas, we would like to inform you that we have obtained the initial approval from the Egyptian government to* [construct] *such Project.*\n\n*The power plant of 500 MW will be able to supply the LNG plant with the required electricity and the remaining capacity will be tied to the local national grid with mutual agreement on the prices of natural gas and supply of electricity to the national grid per KW.*\n\n*We also can obtain long term supply of natural gas with a contract of 25 years renewable for another 25 years and so on. The price formula will be mutually agreed between the Egyptian government and the new company to be established to construct such project.*\n\n*EATCO will secure all local land for the project and all local license for the project and also EATCO will be the local partner in this project.*\n\n*I'm going to meet the minister of petroleum of Egypt on 23.1.2000 for arranging the meetings required with you and the Spanish company in this regard. We understand that the Spanish company will fund the project completely and will be able to utilize all LNG produced by this plant. We understand that the capacity of LNG will be in the range of 2.5 million metric tons per year.*\n\n*The official gas price will be US50,041 per m3 of natural gas supplied to the battery limit of LNG* [...]\n\n5.29.\n\nIt also sets out a work plan with meetings in Egypt to be attended by Uni\u00f3n Fenosa, including a meeting with the \"Oil Minister\" to explain the Project and \"to confirm the approval of the Egyptian government to the Project.\"\n\n5.30.\n\nAccording to the Respondent *,* this first document directly contradicts the Claimant's contention that \"the SPA was the result of genuine arm's length negotiations between the parties involved.\"21 In fact, again according to the Respondent, this document shows that, even before UFACEX had even met with the Minister of Petroleum (Mr Sameh Fahmy), or submitted a proposal for the SPA, or [REDACTED] Mr El Komy represented that he had already secured \"the initial approval\" for the Damietta Project (in only ten days). As the cover letter addressed to Uni\u00f3n Fenosa states, so the Respondent submits, Mr El Komy's representation confirmed the \"reality and viability\" of the expectations shared by Uni\u00f3n Fenosa, apparently to obtain the Project by any means. It did so in a contract of the same duration, substantially the same quantity and ([REDACTED]) a more favourable price than this initial proposal.22\n\nThe Respondent cites from the letter dated 30 June 2017 from the Claimant to the Tribunal, Page 4.\n\nThe Respondent refers to UFGTREATY 0047965 and the Natural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement, [C-0002].\n\n5.31.\n\n*26-30 January 2000* : A delegation from UFACEX attends a meeting with the Minister of Petroleum (Mr Sameh Fahmy) in Egypt. A contemporaneous memorandum prepared by a member of the UFACEX delegation describes the meeting as follows:\n\n*Between January 26 and 30, a UNI\u00d3N FENOSA delegation held a series of meetings for the purpose of gathering information and obtaining a clearer perception of the potential LNG project that had been presented to the management of UNI\u00d3N FENOSA* [...] *we had a meeting with the Minister of Petroleum, Sameh Fahmy, who has openly confirmed the support of the Government of Egypt for this Project. The Minister mentioned during the meeting that other international groups had expressed an interest in the Project, and encouraged UNI\u00d3N FENOSA to submit a proposal for negotiation (in case UNI\u00d3N FENOSA was interested in the Project) shortly. Thus, in relation to this meeting with the Minister, we have summarized our impressions of him and our/the Minister's commitments:*\n\n*- A young, active and ambitious Minister.*\n\n*- He is very familiar with the gas business.*\n\n*- Although he has been Minister for only a short time, he is eager to do a 'well-known' project in a short period of time.*\n\n*- He has a personal interest in the project and entering the Spanish market.*\n\n*- We have his support for the project and his commitment to provide the gas with a long-term contract of 20 to 25 years at a competitive price* [\u2026]23\n\nUFACEX Memorandum to Elias Velasco and Santiago Roura of 23 January 2000 re \"LNG - Egypt,\" 28 January 2000, [C-0344].\n\n5.32.\n\nThis meeting is the beginning of the negotiations leading to the execution of the SPA on 1 August 2000.

Mr Shaaban testified as a factual witness in this arbitration.24\n\nShaaban WS1, Paragraph 5; Tr. D3 687-688.\n\n5.33.\n\nMr Shaaban's witness statement described the negotiations of the SPA as follows:\n\n*During the negotiations with UFACEX, which lasted for several months, no representatives from the Ministry of Petroleum or Government were present. EGPC was negotiating in its own name and independently, and all instructions to Committee members were made by EGPC representatives. I am not aware of any instructions given by the Ministry to the members of the Committee on the terms we negotiated with UFACEX, and as far as I know, the Ministry was not involved in these negotiations, nor was EGPC required to seek or obtain any approvals from the Ministry regarding these terms.*25\n\nShaaban WS1, Paragraph 7.\n\n5.34.\n\n*2 March 2000 - The Six Documents:* The Respondent next refers, as the second of these documents, to the minutes of 2 March 2000 of a UFACEX internal meeting (\"UFGTREATY 0047964\").\n\n5.35.\n\nThese minutes, headed \"Re: Natural Gas Liquefaction Project in Egypt,\" record the attendees of this meeting as follows: Mr Eloy \u00c1lvarez Pelegry, Mr Juan Manuel \u00c1lvarez Gonz\u00e1lez, Mr Jorge Porras, Mr Antonio Hernando Villaroya, Mr Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Su\u00e1rez and Mr Arturo Torrego.\n\n5.36.\n\nThe \"matters discussed\" at the meeting include the following:\n\n*Mr Antonio Hernando produced the draft letter to EATCO, for signature by Mr Eloy \u00c1lvarez, in which the request for additional information and for a possible meeting date of March 7 is repeated.*\n\n*He also produced the draft MoU with EATCO which, with slight changes (postponement of the date of commitment to a pre-feasibility study and a fuller description of the tasks that EATCO undertakes to carry out in this first phase) will be used at the next meeting. He also produced a form Confidentiality Agreement between EATCO and UFACEX, which may be used as a model for work with engineers/consultants, who will be mentioned below.*\n\n*The MoU with the Egyptian Authority is being drawn up as a draft in two different versions: depending on whether EATCO is simply an agent activating the project or more of an investor partner. This document may not be finalized until such time as these and other points of the agreements with EATCO have been defined* [\u2026]\n\n5.37.\n\nAccording to the Respondent *,* these minutes, some two months prior to the MOU for the Project, show that UFACEX deliberated on preparing two different versions of the MOU, one portraying Mr El Komy's company EATCO as \"simply an agent activating the project\"; and the other as \"investor partner.\" As alleged by the Respondent, despite the Claimant's contention that Mr El Komy played a leading role in the [REDACTED] Project in May 2000 UFACEX adopted a version of the MOU that did not disclose EATCO's stake in the Project (or refer to it at all), thereby demonstrating a concern within UFACEX about disclosing Mr El Komy's role in procuring the Project.26\n\nMemorandum of Understanding between EGPC and UFACEX [for the] Development of a Natural Gas Liquefaction Facility, 17 May 2000, [C-0168].\n\n5.38.\n\n*09 March 2000:* UFACEX and EATCO execute a Preliminary Agreement.

EGAS was to supply up to the maximum amount of natural gas needed for the nominal capacity of the Plant, which resulted in a gas quantity of 7.56 billion cubic meters per annum (\"bcma\"). The economics of the Damietta Plant were dependent upon its receiving the contractually agreed quantities of natural gas from EGPC (later EGAS).\n\n5.61.\n\nLater, the Ministry of Petroleum produces a number of memoranda on the SPA for the Council of Ministers or the Minister for Petroleum, after the SPA had been signed on 1 August 2000: an undated memorandum;54 a memorandum dated 14 November 2006 outlining amendments to the SPA's pricing mechanism, which had been negotiated with UFG;55 and two memoranda dated 27 August 200756 and January 200857 concerning further proposed amendments to the pricing mechanism in the SPA.

It was a contractual requirement of great significance. It was made in the form of the letter dated 5 August 2000 from the Ministry of Petroleum, cited below.\n\n5.67.\n\n*03 August 2000:* Egyptian Counsel for UFACEX confirms that the negotiation and signature of the SPA were proper and comply with all applicable Egyptian regulations:\n\n*According to the relevant laws applicable in the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Egyptian Petroleum Corporation is entitled to execute the* [SPA] [...]\n\n*No law, ordinance, statutes or regulations of the Arab Republic of Egypt or of any local authority applicable to or binding on EGPC or by which EGPC will become bound [...] will be violated by the execution and delivery of the* [SPA].59\n\nLegal Opinion from Zaki Hashem & Partners, 3 August 2000, [C-0455].\n\n5.68.\n\n*05 August 2000:* By letter dated 5 August 2000 to Uni\u00f3n Fenosa, the First Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Petroleum writes, in English:\n\n*On behalf of the Ministry of Petroleum I have the pleasure to inform you that the Egyptian Government official [sic: officially] endorsed the natural gas Sales and Purchase Agreement signed on August 1st, 2000 between UFACEX and EGPC* [...]60\n\nLetter from Ministry of Petroleum, First Undersecretary (Ismail Karara) to Uni\u00f3n Fenosa S.A., Chairman (Jos\u00e9 Maria Amustategui), 5 August 2000, [C-0169].\n\n5.69.\n\n*08 August 2000:* UFACEX executes an agreement with the Damietta Port Authority.\n\nThe agreement's purpose is:\n\n*Preamble.*\n\n*I.

EGPC participation of 10% in Damietta LNG plant is based on the concept that EGPC will be the only Egyptian shareholder in this project.*\n\nMr Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez testified:\n\n*During the EPC Bid Process in 2001, the two consortiums that we considered recommended increasing the capacity of the LNG train to 7.56 Bcm instead of 4.4 Bcm as originally agreed. This would allow a large increase in capacity with almost the same initial investment and equivalent operating costs because of significant economies of scale. We proposed the increase in the size of the project and the Ministry of Petroleum agreed, repeatedly assuring UFG that Egypt had ample gas supply to accommodate expanded capacity and approved the expansion. Later, in 2002, UFG offered Egypt the opportunity to participate directly in the Damietta Project and thus monetize Egypt's natural gas resources by selling LNG directly on the international market.

The resulting political turmoil, social unrest and deteriorating security situation creates uncertainty over Egypt's economic prospects for both domestic and foreign investors. Along with the continuing Global Financial Crisis and the subsequent Eurozone crisis, this leads to a sharp fall in foreign direct and financial investments in 2011 and 2012,190 especially into the petroleum sector.191 In 2013 and 2014, economic growth and foreign direct investment remains poor.192 As of these dates, the Government of Egypt expects the country to emerge from its economic crisis only in the coming two to three years.193\n\nKhan ER, Paragraph 47.\n\nKhan ER, Paragraphs 51-52.\n\nKhan ER, Paragraphs 53-55.\n\nKhan ER, Paragraph 66.\n\n5.193.\n\nMr De Lara Alonso-Bur\u00f3n testified that:\n\n*Street protests in Egypt intensified on 25 January 2011. I remember hearing that there were calls for people to join the demonstrations in the press that week. The press was saying that big demonstrations would take place on 28 January 2011, after Friday noon prayers.*194\n\nDe Lara Alonso-Bur\u00f3n WS, Paragraph 16.\n\n5.194.\n\nThe Respondent's expert witness, Dr Khan testified:\n\n*At the same time, Egypt was also suffering from an unfolding energy crisis that manifested itself in country-wide electricity shortages and daily power cuts. In addition to the inconvenience and hardships this caused households, energy shortages also had a negative impact on industry, which in many cases, such as heavy industries like cement production, were operating at 50-60 per cent capacity. This energy crisis had a strong negative impact on the economy, with significant reductions in industrial production and employment.*195\n\nKhan ER, Paragraph 48.\n\n5.195.\n\nMr El Mahdy testified to similar effect:\n\n*The Global Financial Crisis and the 2011 revolution caused instability and security concerns that* made *investors reluctant to invest.*196\n\n*In consequence, investment fell for both exploration for new fields, and development of existing* fields *with existing infrastructure in order to maintain or increase capacity. The latter, in particular, caused a rapid decline in the levels of gas production.*197\n\nTr. D3 725.\n\nTr. D3 819-820.\n\n5.196.\n\nThis national shortage of gas production, as compared to supply, began in 2002-2003, with a net shortage across all natural gas consumers of 0.1 bcma. This steadily increases to a shortage of 7.0 bcma in 2009-2010. In 2010-2011 the shortage increases further to 10.9 bcma, and thereafter increases sharply to 20.5 bcma in 2012-2013.198\n\nBRG ER1, Annex B-16.\n\n5.197.\n\nIn response to the gas shortages and the risk of blackouts across the country, EGAS prioritised distribution of gas to the domestic market in order to maintain power generation.199 As a result, the supply of gas to plants that exported gas was either minimised, or stopped completely.200\n\nEl Mahdy WS1, Paragraph 16; Hameed WS, Paragraph 24.\n\nHameed WS, Paragraph 24.\n\n5.198.\n\nA later report of the Managing Director of UFG to the Board of Directors, of 20 March 2013, outlined the economic effects of the 2011 revolution in Egypt. The report referred to permanent riots in Cairo, Port Said, Alexandria and Suez, and a \"permanent state of insurrection and civil commotion\" since 2011.201 The recurrent political instability was the main factor behind deterioration in investments, a rise in the unemployment rate, and a decline in industrial production.202 According to the report, \"[f]oreign direct investment came to a virtual standstill following the revolution\", and would not likely return \"[u]ntil security and stability return to the country and greater clarity is achieved in the political transition.\"203 In the claim before the Commercial Court of Madrid brought against UFG and some of its directors, by some of its other directors, the claimant directors referred to a proposal by UFG's Head Office on 20 March 2013 to issue force majeure notices to its customers as a result of the Egyptian revolution, and the slowdown of foreign direct investment and consequent deterioration in gas extraction and production capacity that resulted.204\n\nReport of the Managing Director to the Board of Directors Meeting, \"Gas S&P Contracts.

According to UFG, this situation resulted from the Respondent's decision to block deliveries of contractually agreed gas supply to the Damietta Plant whilst diverting gas supplies to other purchasers, most notably to the domestic electricity generation sector. As a result of these actions, so UFG contends, UFG was able to lift only two full cargoes of LNG from the Plant after July 2012, instead of the 39 cargoes originally planned and agreed for this period.229 Since December 2012, no LNG has been lifted from the Damietta Plant, which has remained idle.\n\n*See* S\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez WS1, Paragraph 25; Egea Krauel WS, Paragraph 23.\n\n5.220.\n\n*31 January 2012* : EGAS sends *force majeure* notices to UFG and SEGAS under Article 15.4 of the SPA and Clause 17 of the EGAS Tolling Contract regarding a shutdown at the facility of one of the main upstream suppliers (Burullus).230 The Burullus facility had shut down for technical reasons, owing to emulsion.\n\nLetter from EGAS (Ashraf Zaki) to UFG (Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Egea Krauel), 31 January 2012, [C-0015]; Letter from EGAS (Ashraf Zaki) to SEGAS (Jos\u00e9 Luis Torre), 31 January 2012, [C-0016]\n\n5.221.\n\n*1 February 2012:* One day later, UFG rejects the *force majeure* notice sent by EGAS under the SPA:\n\n*First of all we would like to thank you for the information provided to us with regard to the shutdown in Burullus facilities and we really regret the consequences of this event.*\n\n*Notwithstanding the aforementioned, taking into consideration the Sale and Purchase Agreement* [...] *nowadays UFG cannot accept this letter as a Force Majeure notification based on the following contractual considerations* [...]\n\n*Consequently, please kindly consider the present letter as an official UFG's rejection of the FM notification mentioned above and eventual suspension of EGAS' obligations under the SPA.*231\n\nLetter from UFG (Javier S\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez) to EGAS (Ashraf Zaki), 1 February 2012, [C-0017].\n\n5.222.\n\n*6 February 2012* : SEGAS also rejects the *force majeure* notice sent by EGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract.\n\n*We understand that the Burullus facility has resumed its operations* [...] *As we have not timely received full particulars of the event as detailed here above and until we receive and analyze them, we are not in a position to accept your Force Majeure Notification and reserve our rights under Article 17 of the Tolling Contract to reject such notification.*232\n\n(EGAS does not follow up on its *force majeure* notices).\n\nLetter from SEGAS (Jos\u00e9 Luis Torre, Managing Director Operations) to EGAS (Ashraf Zaki, Vice Chairman for Operations), 6 February 2012, [C-0018].\n\n5.223.\n\n*22 February 2012* : EGAS and UFG representatives meet in Cairo concerning issues over EGAS' feedgas supply. UFG requests proportional curtailments of other industries to ensure compliance with the HOA's Minimum Feedgas Commitment; and UFG reiterates its cooperation with EGAS and the Egyptian authorities, including price renegotiations for gas sales:\n\n[W]*e are seriously concerned by your description of the current situation, which led to EGAS' default on the feedgas supplies to the Damietta LNG Plant and would cause the feedgas supply to Damietta LNG Plant* [...] *to be significantly below the Minimum Feedgas Commitment agreed in the Heads of Agreement [...] [T]his will have direct consequences over us, such as damages, costs and/or additional expenses* [...]\n\n[O]*ur view is that EGAS must and can act promptly to supply Damietta LNG Plant at the minimum committed level under the HoA (560 mmscfd, on average). The current shortfall stands at around 175 mmscfd, and we see different alternatives that EGAS can implement to comply with its Minimum Feedgas Commitment during 2012. These include a limited prorata reduction of Industry and Other consumers, a limited increase of mazout as primary energy for electricity generation and certain industrial consumers or a combination of both. Such measures are directly under your control and will have as a consequence the avoidance of the Default in the supply to Damietta LNG Plant under the HoA (not to mention those under the SPA).*\n\n*As the Country faces difficult supply/demand scenarios through the Transient Period 2011-2013, UFG has shown its strong commitment with EGAS, in particular, but also with Egyptian Authorities in general, by recently agreeing a natural gas price increase and a reduction (even temporarily and to be recovered in the future) of the volumes down from the contractual volume to a minimum committed quantity. Now we strongly request that EGAS takes the necessary steps to guarantee the supply of natural gas to the Damietta LNG Plant within the agreed level.*\n\n*We trust EGAS will support the compliance of our agreement in place, and we are sure that this will strengthen the continued development of our partnership, but also it will strengthen EGAS and the Egyptian Petroleum Sector as a whole, since the opposite (i.e., the continued default under the agreement) will not help UFG to continue supporting EGAS and will surely have as a consequence, apart from the economic losses, deficit in the sector, delay in projects, lack of new investments and finally additional shortfalls affecting both exporters and domestic consumers.*233\n\nLetter from UFG (Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Egea Krauel and Alessandro Della Zoppa) to EGAS (Mohamed Shoeib), 27 February 2012, [C-0019].\n\n5.224.\n\n*13 March 2012* : Mr Paolo Conti, SEGAS' Managing Director of Administration and Control, informs the SEGAS Board of Directors (including representatives of EGAS) that:\n\n*Among the highlights for year 2011 Mr Conti refers to the production of the plant not being adversely affected by the revolution that has taken place in the country during this year adding nevertheless that the final production was significantly under the budget expectations.*234\n\nSEGAS Board of Directors Meeting Minutes, 13 March 2012, [R-0356].\n\n5.225.\n\n*15 March 2012* : UFG rejects EGAS' stated reasons for the reduced supply; and UFG alleges that EGAS discriminates against UFG:\n\n*Reference is made to yesterday's communication received by SEGAS in which a supply to Damietta LNG Plant of only 150 mmscfd was announced due to gas production reduction in certain limited gas fields. As a direct consequence of such nomination, well below the minimum turn down ratio of the Damietta LNG Plant, SEGAS has been forced to stop production for the third time in year 2012.*\n\n*Contractually, supply of NG to Damietta LNG Plant is not supported by any particular field and EGAS is 'the exclusive responsible for the transportation, supply and delivery of NG' [...] keeping at all times a 'back-up supply to meet an on stream (load) factor of 95%' in the Plant, regardless of the origin of the gas.*\n\n*Consequently any eventual reduction of gas availabilities in a field cannot be used by EGAS as a contractual reason to reduce the feed gas to Damietta LNG Plant, as still remains a sufficient amount of gas in the grid to fill the plant according to EGAS contractual obligations.*\n\n*As per the contracts in force, Damietta LNG Plant has to be treated in a non-discriminatory manner in comparison with other NG customers which means that an eventual reduction of NG in the grid has to be shared on a pro-rata basis between all customers.

The outcome of the meeting is referred to in a letter of 5 December 2013 from UFG to EGAS:\n\n*We write you further to the meeting that, together with the Chairman of EGPC and the Chairman of EGAS, we held with Your Excellency on November 26th at the Ministry's premises* [...]\n\n*Our meeting with Your Excellency of November 26th takes place at a very difficult instance, after EGAS failed to deliver natural gas for the production of at least one LNG cargo during November.* [S] *uch obligation was unconditional under the Transient Agreement* [...]\n\n*EGAS' unapologetic refusal to comply with the Agreement less than a month after its entry into force is astonishing. We note, in this context, your equally distressing statement during our meeting on November 26th that Egypt will in fact not comply with its obligations in the near future.*\n\n*We have listened to your explanations during the meeting but, although we appreciate any efforts that the Petroleum Ministry and EGAS may have made to obtain the minimal quantities of gas during the short time of the LNG Plant's cooldown, we cannot accept your assertion that the reason not to supply feedgas to the LNG Plant was the need to prioritize the available gas to other customers which cannot be curtailed. It is clear to us that the reason for shutting down the Damietta LNG Plant has been the deliberate decision to discriminate, once more, against UFG by directing available natural gas to the rest of the consumers (exports to Jordan, exports of LNG in the other Egyptian export project, all industrial and petrochemical customers, including exporters of industrial and petrochemical products and gas-based power generation).*327\n\nLetter from UFG (Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Egea Krauel and Cesare Cuniberto) to Minister of Petroleum (Sherif Ismail), 5 December 2013, [C-0085].\n\n5.310.\n\nMr Egea Krauel testified about this meeting in his written evidence, as follows:\n\n*My colleagues and I went to Cairo and met with Sherif Ismail (who had now become Minister of Petroleum), Taher Abdelraheem (Chairman of EGAS) and Sherif Hadara (Chairman of EGPC) on November 26, 2013, approximately ten days after we were forced to shut down the Damietta LNG Plant. Minister Ismail and Mr Abdelraheem apologized for EGAS's failure to meet its supply commitments. They explained that they had faced some diminution in gas production. Minister Ismail said that he could not stop supply to electricity generators and fertilizer producers and thus had to stop supplying UFG. He said that he had received phone calls from the Ministers of Electricity and Industry asking him not to shut down supply to power generators and the industrial consumers. This explanation (which had nothing to do with the alleged 'national security' issues) left no doubt as to the fact that the Government's decision to cut supply to UFG was motivated by political convenience: it was less politically damaging to cut supply to one large consumer (especially when that consumer is a foreign company) than to apportion a reduction of supply across different users and economic sectors. Minister Ismail said that despite having agreed to the Transient Agreement, there was no gas for UFG. With great astonishment, I responded that, given the very low commitments agreed upon in the Transient Agreements, the Ministry of Petroleum and EGAS should have foreseen this issue, and had other customers ready to reduce their gas intake instead of yet again sacrificing UFG. I particularly insisted on the fact that fertilizer producers were essentially gas exporters (fertilizer production consumes enormous quantities of gas and Egyptian producers ultimately export a significant part of their fertilizers) and there was thus reason to curtail their supply as well. I summarized the main content of the meeting held on November 26, 2013 in my letter sent on December 5, 2013, which makes clear that the Minister of Petroleum had instructed EGAS to stop supplying the Damietta LNG Plant*.328\n\nEgea Krauel WS, Paragraph 34.\n\n5.311.\n\nMr S\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez also described the meeting in his written evidence:\n\n*We met with the Minister of Petroleum (Mr Sherif Ismail)* [...] *He said that he could not give us any gas because the Ministry had to prioritize diverting the gas to power generation plants throughout the country, as well as other industrial consumers, and added that he could not stop the fertilizers and power plants, cement plants, and other industrial users. Unlike the correspondence that we had received from EGAS just a few days earlier, there was no mention of any 'national security' issues*.329\n\nS\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez WS1, Paragraph 37.\n\n5.312.\n\n*December 2013* : EGAS fails to comply with the terms of the Transient Agreement by defaulting on payments due to SEGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract. On 5 December 2013, UFG writes to EGAS:\n\n*Additionally we would like to underline that as at this date EGAS has not made the payments due to SEGAS on November 2013.*330\n\nLetter from UFG (Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Egea Krauel and Cesare Cuniberto) to Minister of Petroleum (Sherif Ismail), 5 December 2013, [C-0085].\n\n2014\n----\n\n5.313.\n\n*19 January 2014:* The Respondent replies to UFG's letter of 5 December 2013.331 It merits citing in full:\n\n*We are in receipt of your letter of 5 December 2013 wherein you make several allegations against the Government of Egypt in connection with gas delivery to Union Fenosa Gas (UFG) and the Spanish Egyptian Gas Company (SEGAS).*\n\n*We observe that gas deliveries to UFG and SEGAS are governed by agreements entered into by UFG (or its subsidiaries), SEGAS, the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation and/or the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS). The Government of Egypt is in no way, either directly or indirectly, a party to those agreements. We are, therefore, not in a position to comment on their content or performance. Any dispute arising under the agreements would be purely contractual in nature and should be resolved directly with the relevant counterparty (or counterparties).*\n\n*In this context, we strongly reject your allegations that Egypt has 'repudiated' certain undertakings or failed to 'fulfill its minimal commitments' or that Egypt made statements to the effect that it would not 'comply with its obligations in the near future', As Egypt is not bound by any contractual commitments in respect of the delivery of gas to UFO or SEGAS, it cannot have 'repudiated' or failed to honor any 'commitments' in this regard.*\n\n*We similarly strongly reject your contention that Egypt is deliberately discriminating against UFG by 'directing available natural gas to the rest of the consumers' and has allegedly given 'instruction' to EGAS to halt deliveries to UFG and SEGAS. We regret that you would make such a serious allegation without offering any substantiation thereof.*\n\n*We are also extremely surprised and disappointed by UFG's blatant mischaracterization of the conversations which took place during our meetings of September and November 2013 and by your suggestion that the Ministry was somehow a party to the negotiation and/or performance of the so-called Transient Agreement between EGAS and UFG. We therefore reject this disingenuous attempt at distorting the record which appears to be designed for the sole purpose of implicating the Government of Egypt in a contractual dispute to which it is not a party. As you correctly observe, the Government of Egypt places great emphasis on maintaining the confidence of foreign companies in the face of the ongoing difficulties confronting Egypt's economy and, in particular, its energy industry. It was strictly in accordance with this spirit that the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources sought to lend its support to the ongoing negotiations between UFG and EGAS. The Ministry's involvement goes no further and certainly cannot ensure any favorable outcome to the negotiations.*\n\n*That said, we still hope that UFG and EGAS will soon reach an amicable resolution of the dispute between them.*\n\nLetter from Ministry of Petroleum (Sherif Sousa) to UFG (Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Egea Krauel and Cesare Cuniberto), 19 January 2014, [C-0086].\n\n5.314.\n\nIt is unnecessary to refer here to the Parties' further correspondence.

As regards (ii) and (iv), the objection may raise issues as to admissibility, i.e. the non-exercise of jurisdiction by the Tribunal as distinct from jurisdiction. However, for the purpose of this Award, this is a distinction that makes no difference; and it is therefore convenient to subsume all issues of admissibility with issues of jurisdiction.\n\n6.2.\n\nAs regards (iv) corruption, the Tribunal addresses the Parties' dispute separately in Part VII below. This Part VI addresses only (i) the \"investment\" issues; (ii) the \"claim-splitting\" issues and (iii) the \"contractual nature\" of the Claimant's claims (which partly overlaps with the previous issues).\n\n6.3.\n\nThe *Treaty:* Article 1 of the Treaty defines \"Investor\" and \"Investment\": see the text cited in Part III(2) above. It is not disputed that the Claimant is an \"Investor,\" *ratione personae*, as a legal entity incorporated in Spain under Article 1(1)(b) of the Treaty. As to \"Investment\" under Article 1(2) of the Treaty, issues arise from the Claimant's participation in the SPA, its performance by the Claimant and its successive amendments. In regard to the Claimant's shares in SEGAS, as an Egyptian legal entity involved in the Damietta Project, issues arise as to whether the Claimant maintained its ownership of those shares and, also, whether SEGAS owned any relevant rights under its EGAS Tolling Contract with EGAS, thereby affecting the status or value of the Claimant's shareholding in SEGAS as an investment under Article 1(2) of the Treaty.\n\n6.4.\n\n*Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention:* There appears to be no separate issue regarding the requirement for an \"investment\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention (for its text, see Part III(5) above). Subject to the issue over SEGAS' rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract, if the Claimant, as an \"investor\" had an \"investment\" satisfying the test under Article 1 of the Treaty, it satisfied Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention as regards this same test. The Tribunal considers that both Article 25(1) and Article 1 include, as part of the same test, a \"holistic approach\" and the \"indicia\" of an investment listed in *Salini v. Morocco* (2001).1\n\n*Salini v. Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 July 2001, [CL-0006].\n\n6.5.\n\n*\"Claim-Splitting\"* : The Respondent contends that the Tribunal should not exercise its jurisdiction in this arbitration on the ground that the Claimant and SEGAS have improperly engaged in claim-splitting between the ICC, CRCICA and Treaty arbitrations. It is here appropriate to describe these ICC and CRCICA international commercial arbitrations.\n\n6.6.\n\nThe ICC Arbitration (ICC 19382/MD/TO) was commenced by SEGAS against EGAS on 11 April 2013 claiming Toll-or-Pay fees under the EGAS Tolling Contract, in the amount of approximately US$ 82.9 million. (Following its second partial award of 24 May 2016, the ICC tribunal issued its final award dismissing SEGAS's claim; there was no pleaded issue of corruption by EGAS; and this arbitration is now at an end).\n\n6.7.\n\nThis ICC Arbitration was followed by a second ICC arbitration brought by HSBC against EGAS in February 2018, apparently as the assignee of SEGAS in respect of rights to tolling fees under the EGAS Tolling Contract. (The Tribunal refers to this second ICC arbitration as the \"HSBC Arbitration\"). It is pending.\n\n6.8.\n\nThe first CRCICA Arbitration (896) was commenced by the Claimant against EGAS on 17 May 2013, claiming damages for the failure to comply with provisions for price adjustments under the SPA, in the amount of approximately US$ 9.7 million. This first CRCICA tribunal, with its seat in Cairo, issued a partial award on 7 August 2015 and a final award on 21 December 2017, dismissing (*inter alia*) the Claimant's claims; there was also an issue of corruption pleaded by EGAS against the Claimant which was rejected by the tribunal. This arbitration is now at an end.\n\n6.9.\n\nThe second CRCICA Arbitration (899) was commenced by the Claimant against EGAS on 30 May 2013 claiming damages for the failure to supply natural gas under the SPA, in the amount of approximately US$ 2.8 billion. This arbitration was stayed; but the stay was lifted in early 2018 following the final award issued by the tribunal in the first CRCICA Arbitration (896). This second CRCICA Arbitration remains pending, with oral hearings apparently fixed for October and December 2018.\n\n6.10.\n\n*Corruption* : The Respondent contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction or cannot exercise its jurisdiction under the Treaty on the ground that the Claimant (with its associated companies, including UFACEX) procured the SPA by means of corruption. The Tribunal addresses this jurisdictional objection separately below, following its decisions on the Respondent's other jurisdictional objections.\n\n6.11.\n\nBefore its analyses and decisions *,* the Tribunal summarises below the Parties' respective cases on the issues of jurisdiction, \"claim-splitting\" and corruption. As indicated in other Parts of this Award, such summaries do not recite in full either Party's written and oral submissions. Nonetheless, the Tribunal has considered such submissions in full; and the omission of a reference to any submission should not be treated as an indication that it has not been considered by the Tribunal. (As earlier, for ease of reference, the Tribunal does not distinguish between the Claimant, \"UFG\" and UFACEX unless the context requires otherwise).\n\n*(2) The Respondent's Case*\n---------------------------\n\n6.12.\n\nIn summary, it is the Respondent's case that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Claimant has failed to establish that it has protected investments. The Respondent also argues that the Tribunal lacks or should decline to exercise jurisdiction because the \"gas supply dispute\" between the parties is contractual in nature and is to be settled by the contractually agreed *fora* and because the Claimant (with SEGAS) has engaged in claim-splitting and its claims in this ICSID arbitration have the same \"fundamental basis\" as those raised in the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations.2\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 43-77; Resp Rep Bif, Paragraphs 28-52; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraphs 48-100.\n\n6.13.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the Tribunal lacks *ratione materiae* jurisdiction over the dispute and refers to: (a) the pledge of UFG's shares in SEGAS; (b) the assignment of SEGAS' rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract; and (c) the SPA) which, according to the Respondent, does not qualify as \"an investment.\"\n\n*(a) The Pledge of UFG's* Shares *in SEGAS*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n6.14.\n\nThe Respondent submits that an investment of an investor of the other Contracting Party must exist at the time of the measures alleged to constitute a treaty violation.3 Relying on the award in *Phoenix v. Czech Republic* (2009) *,*4 the Respondent asserts that an investment treaty tribunal lacks jurisdiction over measures alleged to constitute a treaty violation that occur after an investor loses its status as an investor with a protected investment.5\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 43; Resp Rep Bif, Paragraph 28.\n\n*Phoenix v.

The Respondent contends that UFG pledged its shares in SEGAS to HSBC Bank Egypt S.A.E (\"HSBC Egypt\") as collateral against possible default by SEGAS (the owner of the Damietta Plant) on the loan repayment in the context of SEGAS' debt refinancing arrangements in July 2007.6\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 44, referring to Cl Mem Merits, Paragraph 179.\n\n6.16.\n\nReferring to the award in *Cementownia v. Turkey* (2009),7 and other ICSID awards that adopted similar reasoning, the Respondent contends that the Claimant bears the burden of proving that it held the investment at issue at the time of the measures alleged to constitute the treaty violation.8\n\n*Cementownia v. Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/2 *,* Award, 17 September 2009, [RL-0023], Paragraphs 112-114.\n\nResp Rep Bif, Paragraph 30; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph 51, citing *CCL v.

Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 2 September 2011, [RL-0054], Paragraphs 121-128.\n\n6.17.\n\nThe Respondent submits the Claimant has failed to satisfy its burden to establish that it has remained at all relevant times the owner of the SEGAS shares.9 First, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to provide any affirmative evidence of ownership, such as share certificates, which the Respondent notes are in the physical possession of HSBC. Second, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's \"bare\" allegation that it has retained \"full ownership\" of the SEGAS shares following the Share Pledge Agreement;10 and it argues: \"the terms of the Share Pledge Agreement belie this allegation.\"11 The Respondent points out that Clause 9.1 of the Share Pledge Agreement, on which the Claimant relies,12 provides that UFG could no longer assign \"any of its rights, title and interest in, to and under [the SEGAS shares]\" without meeting certain conditions \"to the satisfaction of [HSBC], acting reasonably.\"13 The Respondent argues that the Share Pledge Agreement therefore supports its case that, as a result of the pledge, the Claimant could no longer exercise full ownership rights in relation to the SEGAS shares, including the right to dispose of these shares.14\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 52.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 53, referring to Cl Rej Bif, Paragraph 21.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 53.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 53, referring to Cl CM Jur, Paragraph 56.\n\nShare Pledge Agreement between UFG, SEGAS, and HSBC Bank Egypt S.A.E., 27 July 2007, [C-0325], Article 9.1.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 53.\n\n6.18.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's alternative argument that even if, *in eventu*, UFG transferred \"legal ownership\" of the SEGAS shares to HSBC, it retained \"beneficial ownership\" of the shares.15 The Respondent observes that the Claimant has failed to point to any investment treaty tribunal that has accepted jurisdiction in the absence of legal ownership.16 According to the Respondent, whether the Claimant remained the owner after pledging its shares and transferring the share certificates to HSBC is \"a serious question that requires analysis under Egyptian law,\" which governs the Share Pledge Agreement.17 The Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to establish that the Egyptian law even recognizes the concept of beneficial ownership.18\n\nCl Obj Bif, Paragraph 70.\n\nResp Rep Bif, Paragraph 31.\n\nResp Rep Bif, Paragraph 30.\n\nResp Rep Bif, Paragraph 31.\n\n6.19.\n\nFurther, the Respondent objects to the Claimant's argument that, irrespective of the issue of ownership rights in the SEGAS shares, the Claimant's \"contractual rights under the Share Pledge Agreement independently satisfy the BIT's definition of investment,\" specifically a \"'form. of participation' in SEGAS within the meaning of Article 1(2) of the [\u2026] Treaty.\"19 The Respondent notes that the Share Pledge Agreement is not an agreement between UFG and SEGAS (concerning UFG's participation in SEGAS), but rather between UFG and SEGAS, on the one hand, and HSBC, on the other. Moreover, \"the Share Pledge Agreement does not confer on the Claimant any 'governance rights' vis-a-vis SEGAS or any other form of participation in SEGAS\"; nor does it grant any other rights to the Claimant, as it only serves \"to limit or potentially transfer any such rights.\"20\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 54, citing from Cl CM Jur, Paragraph 58.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraphs 54-55.\n\n6.20.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent argues that with respect to the SEGAS shares, the Claimant has failed to establish that these shares were investments by the Claimant as a Spanish investor at the time of the alleged violation of the Treaty.21\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 50; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph 56.\n\n*(b) The* Assignment *of SEGAS' Rights under the Tolling Contracts*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.21.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, SEGAS' contractual rights under the Tolling Contracts do not constitute \"an investment\" protected under the Treaty because of the absolute assignment of these rights.22 The Respondent observes that SEGAS has assigned by way of security to HSBC Bank Plc. (\"HSBC UK\") all of its present and future contractual rights under the Tolling Contracts, pursuant to the Offshore Security Agreement between SEGAS and HSBC UK23 (as trustee for the financial institutions providing funds to SEGAS), under the same refinancing agreements that included the Share Pledge Agreement.24 In support of its position, the Respondent refers to the ICC tribunal's award of 24 March 2016 in the arbitration initiated by SEGAS against EGAS for unpaid tolling fee under the EGAS Tolling Contract, which held (in relevant part) that:\n\n[B]*y executing the Offshore Security Agreement and related documents in July 2007, SEGAS assigned to HSBC absolutely its rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract and* [\u2026] *those rights were not effectively transferred back to SEGAS by the Deed of Reassignment.*25\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 45-50; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraphs 57-62.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 45-46, referring to the Offshore Security Agreement between SEGAS and HSBC UK, 27 July 2007, [C-0343/R-0038], Clause 3.1.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 57; Resp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 45-50; Resp Rep Bif, Paragraphs 33-35.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 58, citing *Spanish Egyptian Gas Company v.

Relying on *Salini v. Morocco* and other ICSID awards,33 the Respondent maintains that the \"investment\" must meet certain objective requirements. The Respondent submits that it is well established that commercial transactions, such as the SPA, do not meet the inherent characteristics of contribution, duration and risk that define \"an investment.\"34\n\nResp Rep Bif, Paragraph 35; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph 63.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraphs 64-67, citing *Salini v.

The Respondent also points out that the Claimant does not seek any compensation for damages in relation to any money it had invested to construct the Damietta Plant, but instead bases its claims on purported lost cash flows \"resulting from its failure to receive the gas it was entitled under the SPA\" and dividends it would have allegedly received \"had the Damietta Plant received the gas that it was supposed to receive under the SPA.\"37\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 73, referring to Cl CM Merits, Paragraphs 593-594.\n\n6.29.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent submits that the fundamental nature of the Claimant's claim in this arbitration is a commercial transaction, namely the SPA; and, thus, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the dispute.38\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 74.\n\n*(d) Contractual Claims and \"Claim-Splitting\"*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n6.30.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or, alternatively (if it had any jurisdiction), the Tribunal should decline to exercise such jurisdiction, because the \"gas supply dispute\" is essentially contractual in nature and is to be settled by the contractually agreed *fora* (and not ICSID arbitration).\n\n6.31.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute because the bases of the Claimant's claims in the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations and its principal claims and all claims for compensation in the present arbitration are predicated on EGAS's alleged failure to perform its contractual obligations, *i.e*., to supply the contractually-agreed volumes of natural gas under the SPA.39\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 51-63; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraphs 75-100.\n\n6.32.\n\nThe Respondent invokes the doctrine of sovereign authority to argue that it does not bear state responsibility for EGAS's breaches of the SPA. Relying on *Suez v. Argentina* and other ICSID awards, the Respondent argues that for a State to incur responsibility for investment treaty breaches, it must act in the exercise of its sovereign powers.40 The Respondent notes that while the Claimant refers to the Respondent's policies, and alleged acts of EGAS in conformity with those policies, the Claimant has failed to identify a sovereign act of the Respondent, such as a law, decree or judgment, that would have caused EGAS acts or omissions alleged to constitute a violation of the SPA. The Respondent therefore submits that its international responsibility cannot be engaged for the purpose of Article 11 of the Treaty (providing for ISDS).41\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 53, citing *Suez v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on Liability, 30 July 2010, [CL-0037], Paragraph 142.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 52-56; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph77.\n\n6.33.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the present dispute has previously been submitted by SEGAS to CRCICA and ICC arbitrations.42 The Respondent notes that the Claimant has failed to address the meaning of Article 11 of the Treaty, which provide the investor \"a choice\" between SCC, ICC, CRCICA or ICSID Convention arbitration, and the meaning of Article 26 of the ICSID Convention which ensures that ICSID arbitration is the exclusive remedy absent agreement to the contrary.43\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 64-77; Resp Rep Bif, Paragraphs 44-56; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraphs 75-100.\n\nResp Rep Bif, Paragraph 45.\n\n6.34.\n\nThe Respondent submits that because the dispute before this Tribunal shares the same \"fundamental basis\" as the disputes previously submitted to CRCICA and ICC arbitrations, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over such dispute under Article 11 of the Treaty and Article 26 of the ICSID Convention.44 Referring to the \"fundamental basis of the claim\" test adopted by the tribunals in *H&H v. Egypt* and *Pantechniki v. Albania,*45 the Respondent argues that the essence of the dispute submitted by the Claimant to ICSID arbitration and all of its ICSID claims, with the exception of its claims claim based on the revocation of SEGAS Free Zone licenses, is that the Respondent, through EGAS, has failed to supply the contractually agreed gas and has thus treated the Claimant less favorably than other consumers.46\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 78.\n\n*H&H v. Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/15, Award, 6 May 2014, [RL-0026]; *Pantechniki v. Albania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award, 30 July 2009, [RL-0028].\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 85.\n\n6.35.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's allegations that the \"triple identity test\" leads to the opposite conclusion. Relying on the award in *Grynberg v. Grenada,47* the Respondent argues that the Claimant may not maintain, on the one hand, that its control over SEGAS gives rise to jurisdiction over the investment and then claim that it is not a party to the ICC arbitration, on the other.48 According to the Respondent, the factual and legal grounds in the parallel commercial arbitrations are \"inextricably linked\" to those in the ICSID arbitration.49 The Respondent rejects the Claimant's argument that the damages issues in the four arbitrations are different. The Respondent argues that the Claimant seeks damages on the same precise bases as in the ICSID arbitration.50\n\n*Grynberg v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Award, 10 December 2010, [RL-0045], Paragraph 7.1.5.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraphs 87-88.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 92.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraphs 96.\n\n6.36.\n\nIn conclusion, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to show that its claims in this arbitration have an autonomous existence outside the SPA and related agreements. According to the Respondent, because the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations share the same fundamental basis, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims under Article 11 of the Treaty and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.51 According to the Respondent, the Tribunal should \"decline jurisdiction pursuant to the principle of *lis pendens* to prevent Claimant's abusive multiple claims strategy (claim-splitting).\"52\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 99.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 100.\n\n(3) The Claimant's Case\n-----------------------\n\n6.37.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Parties' dispute as all the requirements for jurisdiction in both the Treaty and the ICSID Convention are satisfied.53 According to the Claimant, the Respondent's challenges to the Claimant's ownership and control over its investment are meritless. The Claimant asserts that its approximately 80% shareholding of SEGAS, its contractual and legal rights under and relating to the SPA, its rights under related agreements, and its money, services and resources invested in the Damietta Project are all rights and assets which constitute, individually and collectively, protected investments within the meaning of both Article 1(2) of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.54\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraphs 304-326.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraphs 310 and 319-321.\n\n*(a) The Pledge of UFG's Shares in SEGAS*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n6.38.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it has owned its shares in SEGAS at all relevant times and has fully met its burden of proof. The Claimant contends that, whilst it did grant to HSBC a security interest in those shares by means of the Share Pledge Agreement, the pledge did not deprive its ownership in the shares. Under Egyptian law (as the governing law of the Share Pledge Agreement) a pledge of shares as security does not transfer ownership from the pledgor to the pledgee.55 The Claimant relies in this regard on Articles 125 and 129 of the Egyptian Commercial Code.56\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 56; Cl Rej Bif, Paragraph 20, citing the Egyptian Commercial Code, Articles 125 and 129, [C-0335].\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 134.\n\n6.39.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's contention that it has not remained the legal and beneficial owner of the SEGAS shares, allegedly because UFG may not sell its shares without complying with certain conditions to the satisfaction of HSBC.57 The Claimant submits that the Respondent's position contradicts the express terms of Clause 8.1(a) of the Share Pledge Agreement that recognises the Claimantas \"the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Secured Assets\" at the time the Share Pledge Agreement was concluded. The Claimant argues that Clause 8.1(e) further recognises that UFG will continue to own the SEGAS shares for the duration of the Agreement, given that in this provision UFG warrants that it will not pledge or assign its interest in SEGAS in the future.58 According to the Claimant, Clause 6 of the Share Pledge Agreement further confirms UFG's continuing ownership of the SEGAS' shares, because HSBC may not enforce its security interest save in the case of default.59\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 135; Cl CM Jur, Paragraphs 67-68; Cl Obj Bif, Paragraph 68.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 137.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 135-138.\n\n6.40.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that it \"expressly retained almost all of its ownership rights, including the right (subject to certain conditions) to sell the secured assets [Clause 9], the right to vote its shares in SEGAS and the right to dividends [Clause 5].\"60 According to the Claimant, those interests constitute the essence of ownership and comprise a \"forms of participation in a company\", which satisfy the Treaty's definition of \"investment.\"\n\nCl Rej. Jur., Paragraph 133.\n\n6.41.\n\nThe Claimant points out that HSBC's rights over SEGAS' shares under the Share Pledge Agreement (as governed by Egyptian law) contrast significantly with the HSBC UK's rights over SEGAS' interests in the Tolling Contracts under the Offshore Security Agreement (as governed by English law). Under the latter Agreement, SEGAS has \"assigned absolutely\" its rights in the EGAS and UFG Tolling Contracts. The Claimant acknowledges that, under English law, an \"absolute assignment\" entails the complete transfer of legal rights from one party to the other. The Claimant asserts that the concept of \"absolute assignment\" does not exist under Egyptian law.61\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 139.\n\n6.42.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that its protected investments include not only its shares in SEGAS, but also the rights corresponding to these shares. The Claimant asserts that its expressly retained voting rights and rights to dividends corresponding to these shares alone constitute a protected investment, regardless of the party that may formally own SEGAS' shares. The Claimant submits that those rights satisfy the Treaty's definition of \"rights arising from all types of contributions made for the purpose of creating economic value\": see Article 1(2)[2].62\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 141.\n\n6.43.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimant asserts that it continues to own its shares in SEGAS despite the share transfer to HSBC under the Share Pledge Agreement. Since that Agreement expressly provides that voting and dividend rights have been retained by the Claimant, the Claimant concludes that such rights satisfy the Treaty's definition of \"investment\" whether or not they \"flow from its independent ownership of its shares in SEGAS or from the Share Pledge Agreement or from a combination both.\"63\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 143.\n\n*(b) The Assignment of SEGAS'* Rights *under the Tolling Contracts*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.44.\n\nThe Claimant contends that SEGAS' assignment of its rights under the Tolling Contracts does not impact this Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n6.45.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, SEGAS' Tolling Contracts are only relevant to the extent they might affect the dividends that SEGAS would have paid to the Claimant, which is an issue of damages.64 The Claimant acknowledges that SEGAS' right to payment under its Tolling Contracts with EGAS and UFG belong to HSBC UK; but it points out that the assignment is part of a financing arrangement and that HSBC UK is obliged to assign the rights back to the Claimant once SEGAS' debts have been repaid.65\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 63; Cl Rej Jur, Paragraph 144.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 145.\n\n6.46.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, under Article 15 of the Offshore Security Agreement, any payments received under the Tolling Contracts, including payments made by EGAS, are to be paid to a specific HSBC account and used for specific purposes, *i.e.*, financing SEGAS' operations, paying SEGAS' debt and paying dividends to SEGAS' shareholders (*i.e.*, UFG and EGAS). Accordingly, the Claimant and SEGAS both have an interest in EGAS' performing its obligations under the EGAS Tolling Contract.66\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 145.\n\n6.47.\n\nThe Claimant re-asserts that it expressly holds the right to receive dividends from SEGAS and that right constitutes part of its \"investment\" under the Treaty as it is \"clearly an ownership interest, or at least a form of participation.\"67 The Claimant therefore concludes that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over its claim that the conduct of the Respondent affected the amount of dividends that the Claimant received from SEGAS. The separate issues of whether or how much SEGAS would have paid to the Claimant, by way of dividends, are relevant to damages -but not jurisdiction.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 146.\n\n*(c) The* SPA\n-------------\n\n6.48.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the SPA satisfies the Treaty's definition of \"investment\" and therefore constitutes a protected investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, as also Article 1(2) of the Treaty.68\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 68;Cl Rej Jur, Paragraph 147.\n\n6.49.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the SPA is not a \"simple sales agreement,\" as characterised by the Respondent. It is part of a larger investment that is to be viewed \"holistically.\"69 The Claimant relies on several awards, including *Chevron v. Ecuador*70 in support to its case that the majority of investment tribunals employ a \"holistic view\" of investments. The Claimant submits that its property and contract rights in shares of SEGAS and its rights under the SPA comprise parts of the same investment and must be viewed holistically.71\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 65;Cl Rej Jur, Paragraph 147.\n\n*Chevron v.

Malaysia* (2009).73 It contends that other tribunals have not applied *Salini* as separate, additional criteria, especially when the definition of investment under the applicable treaty does not contradict the general understanding of this term.74\n\n*Malaysian Historical Salvors v. Malaysia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10, Decision on the Application for Annulment, 16 April 2009, [RL-0069], Paragraphs 80-81.\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 68; Cl Rej Jur, Paragraph 150.\n\n6.52.\n\nThe Claimant observes that the Respondent has not addressed the issues of whether the SPA satisfies the *Salini* test. The Claimant submits that the SPA satisfies all four criteria for an investment under the *Salini* test, namely (i) duration; (iii) regularity of profit and return; (iii) assumption of risk; and (iv) substantial commitment.75\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 69 and Foonote 125; Cl Rej Jur, Paragraph 154.\n\n6.53.\n\nThe Claimant distinguishes the present case from *Global Trading v. Ukraine* (2010) *,*76 on which the Respondent relies to argue that a sale-and-purchase contract can never satisfy the *Salini* test. The Claimant points out that the *Global Trading* tribunal found that the sale and purchase contacts in that case lacked the essential \"connecting factor of being 'associated with an investment.'\"77 The Claimant submits that, in contrast, the SPA is an essential part of the Damietta LNG Project.\n\n*Global Trading v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/11, Award, 1 December 2010, [RL-0068].\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 155.\n\n6.54.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimant submits that the SPA cannot be isolated from its overall investment in Egypt when the Tribunal analyses whether an investment exists for the jurisdictional purposes of the Treaty and the ICSID Convention. The Claimant argues that the Tribunal should reject all jurisdictional objections of the Respondent regarding an \"investment,\" since the Respondent has failed to provide any valid arguments as to why the Claimant's claims do not satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of the Treaty.78\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 70.\n\n*(d)* Contractual *Claims under the Treaty and \"Claim-Splitting\"*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.55.\n\nThe Claimant submits that its treaty claims have not been submitted to any form of arbitration.79 The Claimant rejects the Respondent's contentions that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant's treaty claims because the Claimant has only suffered wrongs comprising contractual breaches by EGAS and that the contractual fora prevail over this ICSID arbitration. The Claimant submits that it has raised legitimate treaty claims against the Respondent that are distinct from the claims by SEGAS in the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations.80\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraphs 71-88.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 156-163.\n\n6.56.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Claimant relies on the *Oil Platform Case* (1996)81 and ICSID decisions that have followed the same reasoning, in support of its case that, for jurisdictional purposes, it need only to establish a *prima facie* case that the Respondent has breached the Treaty.82 The Claimant notes that the Respondent has provided no argument or evidence to rebut the *prima facie* legitimacy of the Claimant's claims for treaty breaches.83 According to the Claimant, the filing of the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations before this Treaty arbitration is \"by pure happenstance\"; and that fact does not \"lessen the seriousness to Egypt's Treaty breaches.\"84 The Claimant concludes that it has established a *prima facie* case in which each of its treaty claims falls within the substantive protections of the Treaty.\n\n*Oil Platforms Case*, International Court of Justice, Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins, 12 December 1996, I.C.J.

The Claimant relies on a number of decisions in which ICSID tribunals have recognised that a contract's forum selection clause did not foreclose the right of the claimant to bring an ICSID arbitration.85\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 167.\n\n6.58.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the adjudication of its claims against EGAS in the two CRCICA arbitrations cannot be dispositive of the Claimant's treaty claims against the Respondent in this Treaty arbitration.86 While the Claimant acknowledges that some of its treaty claims share some factual background with SEGAS' contractual claims, it argues that its treaty claims are not contractual in nature since they are predicated on the Respondent's breaches of the Treaty and are grounded on international law and not on EGAS' contractual obligations under the SPA and Egyptian law. The Claimant maintains that the underlying factual matrices of the parallel arbitrations are not sufficient to sustain a jurisdictional objection in this ICSID arbitration.87\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 164-170.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 172.\n\n6.59.\n\nWith respect to the ICC arbitration between SEGAS and EGAS, the Claimant disputes the Respondent's allegations that the decision of the ICC tribunal is dispositive of claims in this arbitration. The Claimant argues that its right to dividends from SEGAS is based on its position as SEGAS' shareholder. According to the Claimant, the ICC tribunal made no finding on the substantive merits of the Claimant's claim to dividends from SEGAS because the ICC arbitration concerned SEGAS' own right to bring a claim under the EGAS Tolling Contract for EGAS' failure to make Toll-or-Pay payments due to SEGAS.88 The Claimant submits that whilst the ICC tribunal found that SEGAS could not exercise its rights under the Tolling Contract because of the assignment of these rights to HSBC UK, that tribunal did not make findings that Toll-or-Pay payments were not due from EGAS and did not dismiss SEGAS' claims on the merits.89\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 165.\n\nTr. D2 393:5-12.\n\n6.60.\n\nThe Claimant submits that: \"[t]he analytical prism that most clearly illustrates the core distinctions between the claims in this ICSID arbitration and those in the three different commercial arbitrations is the triple-identity test.\"90 The Claimant submits that this legal standard, which requires the identity of the parties, the causes of action, and the relief sought, has been applied by the majority of investment tribunals;91 and that the Tribunal \"should look, in particular, at the identity of the claims and the causes of action to determine whether the claims are the same of different.\"92\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 78.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 177, referring to *LG&E v.

D2 397:18-22.\n\n6.61.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's contention that the Claimant's claims in this arbitration have the same \"fundamental basis\" as the Claimant's and SEGAS' contractual claims against EGAS. The Claimant submits that the Respondent's jurisdictional objection is effectively a \"fork-in-the-road\" argument.93 The Claimant submits that Article 11 of the Treaty does not contain a 'fork-in-the-road' provision *;* and it does not require the Claimant to choose one form of dispute resolution to the exclusion of others.94 Contrary to the Respondent's position, the Claimant argues that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention does not preclude this Tribunal's jurisdiction, because the Claimant did not take the Parties' dispute before multiple investment tribunals.95 Finally, the Claimant contests the Respondent's invocation of *lis pendens.* The Claimant asserts that that \"the initiation of multiple proceedings does not itself evidence an abuse of process\" and argues that it has dully demonstrated that the commercial arbitrations will not dispose of its claims before this Tribunal.96\n\nTr.

As already indicated, this factor does not appear to be an issue between the Parties.\n\n6.66.\n\nAs to the SPA, its execution, amendments and performance by the Claimant, the Tribunal decides that, together, these amount to an \"Investment\" under Article 1(2)[5] of the Treaty, as \"rights to engage in economic and commercial activities authorized by law or by virtue of a contract, particularly those rights to [\u2026] exploit natural resources.\" It also decides, on the facts in this case, that these rights satisfy the guidelines provided by the ICSID award in *Salini v. Morocco* (2001) in regard to duration, profit and return, risk and commitment to the development of the Respondent's economy *.*99 The Tribunal reaches the same conclusion as regards Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. In support of these conclusions, the Tribunal points to the facts of this case, as set out in Part V above, which speak for themselves.\n\n*Salini v. Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 16 July 2001, [CL-0006].\n\n6.67.\n\nAs to its shares in SEGAS, as at the time of their acquisition by the Claimant, the Tribunal decides that these qualified as an \"Investment\" under Article 1(2)[1] of the Treaty, as \"shares and other forms of participation in companies\" and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, subject to the issue addressed below regarding the continuity of such share ownership and SEGAS' rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract.\n\n6.68.\n\nThe Tribunal also decides that these investments are to be treated \"holistically\" as one overall investment made by the Claimant comprising the Damietta Project.\n\n6.69.\n\nThe issue arises whether the Claimant subsequently lost part of this investment by SEGAS assigning absolutely to HSBC UK its rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract, by virtue of Clause 3.1(ii) of the Offshore Security Agreement dated 27 July 2007 between SEGAS and HSBC UK (\"the Offshore Security Agreement\").100\n\nOffshore Security Agreement between Spanish Egyptian Gas Company \"SEGAS\" as Borrower and HSBC Bank PLC as Offshore Security Trustee, 27 July 2007 [C-0343/R-0038], Clause 3.1, Schedule 1.\n\n6.70.\n\nThe law applicable to the Offshore Security Agreement was English law: see Clause 28. The law applying to the EGAS Tolling Contract was also English law: see Article 11.1.101 The Claimant acknowledges that SEGAS' rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract were pledged to HSBC UK as security under the Offshore Security Agreement. The question is whether SEGAS agreed to more than a mere form of security.\n\nTolling Contract between SEGAS and EGAS, 30 June 2003, [C-0003].\n\n6.71.\n\nIt was decided by the ICC tribunal in its second partial award of 24 May 2016 in the ICC Arbitration between SEGAS and EGAS that SEGAS, following its absolute assignment to HSBC UK, could no longer claim tolling fees from EGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract.102 Paragraphs 376 and 379(ii) of this award contained the ICC tribunal's decision (with Paragraphs 313ff), as follows:\n\n*376. The Tribunal has found that, by executing the Offshore Security Agreement and related documents in July 2007, SEGAS assigned to HSBC absolutely its rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract and that those rights were not effectively transferred back to SEGAS by the Deed of Reassignment. Although EGAS was late in pleading the Assignment as a ground for opposing SEGAS's claims, having done so in the Rejoinder, it is not now estopped from relying on the Assignment to object to SEGAS claiming rights retained by HSBC. Thus, the Tribunal finds that SEGAS is not entitled to recover from EGAS the toll and pay amounts and tolling fees claimed in this arbitration.*\n\n[...]\n\n*379. For the reasons stated, the Tribunal hereby Awards, Orders and Declares:* [\u2026]\n\n*(ii) The sums claimed for outstanding toll-or-pay amounts and tolling fees under the EGAS Tolling Contract are not recoverable by SEGAS, because of the absolute assignment created by the Offshore Security Agreement.*\n\n*Spanish Egyptian Gas Company v. Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company*, ICC Case No. 19392/MD/TO, Second Partial Final Award, 24 May 2016, [R-0323].\n\n6.72.\n\nThe ICC tribunal's decision is legally binding upon EGAS and SEGAS, as *res judicata* under the ICC Rules. However, the Claimant was not a party to this ICC arbitration; nor was the Respondent. There is therefore an issue as to the *res judicata* effect of this award upon the Parties in this arbitration.\n\n6.73.\n\nThis ICC award does not preclude the Claimant's shares in SEGAS qualifying as an investment as at the time of the Claimant's acquisition of those shares, prior to the Offshore Security Agreement. The issue arises only from the terms of the Offshore Security Agreement, as decided by the ICC tribunal in its ICC award.\n\n6.74.\n\nWhilst the Offshore Security Agreement provided for an \"absolute assignment\" of SEGAS' rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract, the Claimant did not thereby absolutely assign to HSBC the ownership of its shares in SEGAS. This is confirmed by Clause 9 of the Share Pledge Agreement of 27 July 2007 between the Claimant, SEGAS and HSBC Egypt whereby the Claimant remained conditionally entitled to maintain its interest in those shares.103 Its shares in SEGAS did not become worthless or non-existent with the Offshore Security Agreement (see also Clause 3.1(ii) of the Offshore Security Agreement).\n\nShare Pledge Agreement between UFG, SEGAS, and HSBC Bank Egypt S.A.E., 27 July 2007, [C-0325].\n\n6.75.\n\nArticle 9.1 of the Share Pledge Agreement, subject to the Offshore Agreement, permitted the Claimant (*inter alia*) to sell, transfer, part with its interest in, dispose of or otherwise deal with any of the rights, title and interest in its SEGAS shares, subject to four conditions \"to the satisfaction of the Onshore Security Agent, acting reasonably.\" That agent was HSBC. The law applicable to the Share Pledge Agreement was the law of Egypt: see Article 18.1. The Tribunal has been shown no provisions of Egyptian law that treat Article 9 as being consistent only with an absolute assignment of the Claimant's shares in SEGAS to HSBC, depriving those shares of any value or existence as regards the Claimant.\n\n6.76.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, after the Offshore Security Agreement, these retained rights by the Claimant over its shares in SEGAS were sufficient to maintain the Claimant's \"investment\" under Article 1(2) of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Nonetheless, the value of those rights, in the form of any dividends payable by SEGAS to the Claimant, could be affected by SEGAS' inability, under the ICC award or otherwise, to recover fees due from EGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract. That factor, however, may raise an issue as to compensation for a breach of the Treaty by the Respondent; but not an issue of jurisdiction.\n\n6.77.\n\n*\"Claim-Splitting\":* The Respondent contends that the Claimant (with SEGAS) has engaged in an elaborate and improper strategy of \"claim-splitting.\" It points to the two CRCICA Arbitrations commenced by the Claimant, the ICC Arbitration commenced by SEGAS and this arbitration, with the significant overlap of factual and expert witnesses in the four separate arbitrations.104 The Respondent also points to the formal relief claimed by EGAS, as the respondent in the CRCICA Arbitration (896), that the CRCICA tribunal should \"[f]ind and declare that EGAS's gas supply obligations have been relieved by reason Force Majeure.\"105\n\nTr. D1 251-258; ROS, Vol. II, Slides 66-67.\n\n*Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Gas S.A. v. Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company*, CRCICA Case No. 896/2013, EGAS's Reply to Counter Defense, 30 September 2016, [R-0359], Paragraph 377(ii).\n\n6.78.\n\nThe Respondent relies upon several awards to support its submission that the Claimant's claims in this arbitration are precluded by such claim-splitting and overlapping issues, including *Helnan v. Egypt* (2008)106 and *Grynberg v. Grenada* (2010).107 To a similar but greater effect, the Respondent might now also rely upon the recent award in *Orascom v. Algeria* (2017).108\n\n*Helnan v. Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19, Award, 3 July 2008, [RL-0025], Paragraph 163.\n\n*Grynberg v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Award, 10 December 2010, [RL-0045], Paragraph 7.1.11.\n\n*Orascom v. Algeria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/36, Award, 31 May 2017, Paragraph 542 (footnote omitted, citing *Grynberg v. Grenada*).\n\n6.79.\n\nIn *Orascom v. Algeria* (2017), the tribunal decided, based on the general principles of good faith and abuse of rights under international law, as follows:\n\n*542. In particular, an investor who controls several entities in a vertical chain of companies may commit an abuse if it seeks to impugn the same host state measures and claims for the same harm at various levels of the chain in reliance on several investment treaties concluded by the host state. It goes without saying that structuring an investment through several layers of corporate entities in different states is not illegitimate. Indeed, the structure may well pursue legitimate corporate, tax, or predispute BIT nationality planning purposes. In the field of investment treaties, the existence of a vertical corporate chain and of treaty protection covering 'indirect' investments implies that several entities in the chain may claim treaty protection, especially where a host state has entered into several investment treaties. In other words, several corporate entities in the chain may be in a position to bring an arbitration against the host state in relation to the same investment. This possibility, however, does not mean that the host state has accepted to be sued multiple times by various entities under the same control that are part of the vertical chain in relation to the same investment, the same measures and the same harm.*\n\n6.80.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Claimant and SEGAS have come close to the dividing line between proper and improper conduct in pursuing four separate arbitrations, under the Treaty, the SPA and the EGAS Tolling Contract with such overlapping factual issues and evidence.\n\n6.81.\n\nHowever, the position in the present case is materially different from the situations addressed in *Helnan v. Egypt* (2008), *Grynberg v. Grenada* (2010) and *Orascom v. Algeria* (2017) *.* In those cases, there was bad faith and/or *res judicata* found against the claimants. In this case, given the cumulative effect of the different disputing parties, applicable laws and causes of action under the separate legal instruments, there can be no *res judicata* effect of the ICC arbitration award upon the Claimant and the Respondent in this ICSID arbitration. As to bad faith, the Tribunal does not find that the Claimant (with SEGAS) was not acting in good faith, although its tactics appear to the Tribunal be wasteful of time, effort and expense, both for EGAS and the Respondent but also, possibly, for the Claimant and SEGAS. Unfortunately, consensual arbitration ill serves multi-party disputes. As to *Orascom v. Algeria* (2017), the investor had deliberately structured its investment through several layers of corporate entities so as to gain the protection of multiple investment treaties. That is not the present case.\n\n6.82.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasises that this analysis is limited to the issues of jurisdiction. As will appear from Part X below, the Tribunal returns to the indirect effect of the ICC award on the Claimant's claims under the Treaty. It also takes steps in this Award to ensure that the Claimant does not benefit from any 'double recovery' in respect of equivalent losses under the Treaty, the SPA and the EGAS Tolling Contract. The Tribunal also addresses the risk of inconsistent findings between the other arbitrations and this Award in deciding the Respondent's application for a stay or suspension of this arbitration, in Parts X and XI below.\n\n6.83.\n\nAs to the nature of the Claimant's claims in this ICSID arbitration, the Claimant has made it abundantly clear that all its claims are based on alleged breaches of the Respondent's obligations under the Treaty and not for any contractual breaches of the SPA or related agreements by EGAS. The Tribunal accepts the Claimant's formulation of its claims, although it recognizes (as will be apparent below) that there is a significant factual overlap between issues common to these treaty and contractual claims.\n\n*(5) Summary of Decisions*\n--------------------------\n\n6.84.\n\nThese conclusions as to jurisdiction are subject to the Tribunal's decisions on corruption addressed in Part VII below.\n\n6.85.\n\nAs a matter of jurisdiction, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant is a protected investor with a protected investment under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention, sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to address and decide on their merits its claims pleaded in this arbitration under the Treaty.\n\n6.86.\n\nAs a matter of admissibility, the Tribunal decides that it may exercise such jurisdiction to address and decide on their merits the claims pleaded by the Claimant in this arbitration under the Treaty,\n\n6.87.\n\nAs matters of jurisdiction and admissibility, the Tribunal decides to dismiss the Respondent's objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and to exercise of such jurisdiction to address and to decide on their merits the Claimant's claims pleaded in this arbitration under the Treaty.\n\nPART VII: THE CORRUPTION ISSUES\n-------------------------------\n\n(1) Introduction\n----------------\n\n7.1.\n\nAs indicated in Part VI above, the Tribunal addresses here in Part VII the Respondent's other jurisdictional objections based on \"corruption,\" namely the alleged acts of corruption by the Claimant (including its predecessor UFACEX) in procuring the SPA made with EGPC (succeeded by EGAS).\n\n(2) The Respondent's Case\n-------------------------\n\n7.2.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction or should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the Claimant's investments because they were procured through corrupt and illegal practices to which the Claimant was a party. The Respondent submits that such investments are not protected under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.1\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 14-42; Resp Rep Bif, Paragraphs 19-27; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraphs 7-47; Tr.

The Respondent alleges three separate instances of corrupt conduct.\n\n7.4.\n\nFirst, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant's \"process to select the subcontractor to build the Damietta Plant was [\u2026] rife with corruption.\"2 Specifically, the Claimant awarded the EPC Contract for the Damietta Plant to a joint venture consortium led by Halliburton/KBR, whose bid was US$ 50 million higher than that of the next competitor. Halliburton/KBR's CEO later pleaded guilty in the USA to violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for bribing Egyptian Government officials in connection with an \"unnamed Egypt LNG project.\" According to the Respondent, the reference was to the Damietta Project because at the time there were only two such projects in Egypt; and Halliburton had no involvement in the other project.3\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 26.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 26; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph 20, Footnote 31; Resp CM Merits, Paragraphs 47-49.\n\n7.5.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that the Claimant engaged Mr Hussein Salem, a \"former Egyptian intelligence officer and friend of then-President Mubarak,\" who himself publicly stated that he \"used his personal connections in the Egyptian Government for UFG's benefit.\"4 According to the Respondent, Mr Salem fled Egypt after the 2011 Revolution and was implicated in several additional instances of corruption.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 18 and Footnote 13.\n\n7.6.\n\nThird, the Respondent alleges corruption relating to the Claimant's association with Mr Yehia El Komy. The Respondent contends that the Damietta Project \"was the result of influence peddling and corrupt practices as the then-Minister of Petroleum, Mr Sameh Fahmy, steered the Damietta LNG Project to UFG at the behest of a personal friend, Mr Yehia El Komy, based on their personal relationship and to enrich Mr El Komy.\"5\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 14.\n\n7.7.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that Mr El Komy arranged for the Claimant to enter the Egyptian gas market and procure the Damietta Project corruptly.6 The Respondent observes that the Claimant had no prior LNG experience; and that it came as \"a surprise in the industry when the company was awarded the Damietta Project.\"7 The Respondent notes that Mr El Komy's family-owned company, EATCO, only added gas and petroleum investments to its corporate activities more than a year after the conclusion of the SPA.8\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 15-17; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraphs 9-18.\n\nTr.

The Respondent argues that the acquisition of the SPA without a tender process violated Article 15 of the EGPC Commercial Activity Regulation because there was no \"case of necessity\" to contract with UFG, which possessed no experience in the LNG sector, the Damietta Project did not involve appropriate prices, and was unilaterally approved by the Minister of Petroleum (Mr Fahmy) without a recommendation of EGPC's Deciding Committee to give UFG a non-bid contract.21 Rather, the SPA was obtained through \"covert dealings behind closed doors,\"22 a course \"clearly unlawful under Egyptian law.\"23 According to the Respondent, the short period for negotiations leading to the SPA is also consistent with the existence of corruption. As a result, the SPA was awarded in breach of mandatory requirements of Egyptian law.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 23; Resp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 23-25.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 20; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraphs 22-23.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 28.\n\n7.16.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the corrupt and illegal practices that surround the Damietta Project disqualify the Claimant's alleged investments from protection under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention, and warrant the dismissal of the case on jurisdictional grounds or, in the alternative, render the Claimant's claims inadmissible.24\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 31-42; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraphs 31-47; Tr.

The Respondent refers to several decisions of the Egyptian courts, which have held that such contracts are null and void.25 According to the Respondent, as a result, the SPA, the Tolling Contracts, and all ancillary agreements are invalid and legally unenforceable as a matter of international, Egyptian and English law; and any rights under these agreements or rights or assets resulting from their implementation are not protected under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.26\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 30, citing Case No. 11492 of 65 J, Administrative Court, Economic and Investment Disputes Division, 7th Circuit, 7 May 2011, [R-0033]; Case No. 40510 of 65 J, Administrative Court, Economic and Investment Disputes Division, 7th Circuit, 21 September 2011, [R-0034]; Case No. 34248 of 65 J, Administrative Court, Economic and Investment Disputes Division, 7th Circuit, 21 September 2011, [R-0035]; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph 34.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 36 and 41; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph 34.\n\n7.18.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the wording of Articles 3(1), 1(2) and 1(2)[5] of the Treaty, which expressly provide that: \"[e]ach Party shall protect in its territory the investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations,\"27 and defines protected investments as \"any kind of assets, such as goods and rights of all sorts, acquired under the law of the host country of the investment and in particular, [\u2026] rights to engage in economic and commercial activities authorized by law or by virtue of a contract, particularly those rights to search for [...] or exploit natural resources, in accordance with existing laws and regulations.\"28 The Respondent submits that the Treaty does not protect investments in violation of the host State's laws and, relying on *Inceysa v.

The Respondent asserts that tribunals have held that the difficulty of proving allegations of corruption and illegality renders it inappropriate to apply a heightened standard of proof for such allegations and have in practice tailored the standard of proof to the circumstances of each case, accepting circumstantial evidence as means of proving allegations of corruption and bribery. The Respondent asserts that, whatever the applicable standard, it has met its burden of proof in demonstrating corruption at the inception of the Damietta Project.34\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 29 (emphasis in original), referring to Cl CM Jur, Paragraph 8.\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 29, citing *Metal-Tech v.

It is the Respondent's case that, even if the Egyptian statute of limitations barred the prosecution of the corrupt practices at issue, the Respondent is not prevented from seeking the dismissal of these ICSID proceedings under international law, because a domestic statute of limitation \"cannot apply to claims filed under the ICSID Convention,\" as was decided in *Maffezini v. Spain* (2000) *.*37\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraph 46, citing *Maffezini v. Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Award, 13 November 2000, [CL-0070], Paragraph 93.\n\n*(3) The Claimant's Case*\n-------------------------\n\n7.23.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant denies the Respondent's allegations of corruption and asserts that they are \"wholly unsubstantiated and false.\"38 The Claimant asserts that the Respondent lacks any evidence to establish that corruption occurred or that the SPA was illegally concluded.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 16; Cl Obj Bif, Paragraph 27.\n\n7.24.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, even if the Respondent's submissions were accepted as credibly raising claims of corruption, they provide no basis for ousting the Tribunal's jurisdiction or depriving the Claimant from its treaty protections for the following reasons. First, a finding of corruption is not an automatic jurisdictional \"trump\" card. Second, the Respondent has failed to prosecute public officials for any alleged corruption relating to the SPA. Third, the Respondent has ratified the SPA through subsequent acts, including six amendments to the SPA, which can also be considered protected new \"investments\" not tainted by corruption allegations relating to the inception of the project.39\n\nCl Obj Bif, Paragraph 28.\n\n7.25.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Respondent is required to prove its corruption allegations following the \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard of proof.40 According to the Claimant, the Respondent has failed to meet such standard and has not provided any actual evidence to support its corruption allegations, let alone sufficient evidence to meet the requisite standard. For this reason alone, the allegations merit summary dismissal.41\n\nCl Obj Bif, Paragraph 29 (emphasis omitted); Cl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 10 and 25.\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 8.\n\n7.26.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the timing of the Respondent's allegations confirms their opportunistic nature. The Claimant notes that the Respondent did not claim that the SPA was corruptly obtained until 15 years after it was signed, after the Claimant had submitted its Memorial on the Merits in this ICSID arbitration.42\n\nTr. D2 359:12-18.\n\n7.27.\n\nThe Claimant further observes that the Respondent has effectively dropped two of its initially three allegations of corrupt conduct and seeks to suppress evidence disproving the third. In addition, the Respondent resorts to misrepresentations and maintains allegations that lack any factual support.\n\n7.28.\n\nWith respect to the first allegation of corrupt conduct regarding Halliburton, the Claimant denies that it has anything to do with the corruption identified in the plea agreement of the former Halliburton/KBR CEO under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.43 The Claimant submits that any corrupt arrangements at Halliburton involved its own CEO and a \"consultant\" who was a former Halliburton employee, but not anyone at UFG. With respect to the payment of US$ 10 million under such an arrangement between Halliburton and a consultant on the Damietta EPC bid, the Claimant denies any knowledge of and involvement in any such scheme.44\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraphs 11-12.\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 12.\n\n7.29.\n\nWith respect to the second allegation, the Claimant maintains that the Respondent's allegations concerning Mr Hussein Salem have no merit.45 The Claimant asserts that it has never had any dealings with Mr Salem; and it denies that Mr Salem had any involvement in the negotiation of the SPA. The Claimant further submits that the Respondent has not provided any evidence to the contrary.\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraphs 13-14.\n\n7.30.\n\nWith respect to the third allegation, the Claimant contends that the corruption and illegality allegations of the Respondent relating to Mr Yehia El Komy are equally meritless and unsubstantiated by evidence.46\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraphs 15-32.\n\n7.31.\n\nThe Claimant denies that Mr El Komy was UFACEX's \"agent\" or \"broker\" engaged to buy influence.47 The Claimant describes Mr El Komy as a local businessman, with a degree in geology and experience as investor in the petroleum industry, who \"decided to establish an LNG facility in Egypt\" and had \"the necessary technical and industry knowledge to put this project together.\"48 The Claimant asserts that Mr El Komy was instrumental in the inception of the Damietta Project.49 Moreover, EATCO's role in handling local regulatory and logistical matters was clear from the outset;50 and [REDACTED] confirms the role played in the early days of the Project and its value for the Claimant. [REDACTED] was terminated less than a year after its conclusion. For the Claimant, Mr El Komy's role is consistent with the usual role of a local partner in substantial international investment projects.51\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 17 ; Cl Rej Jur, Paragraph 30.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 34.\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 18.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 22.\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 17; Cl Rej Jur, Paragraph 8.\n\n7.32.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Mr El Komy's active role as a business partner in the early days of the Project is supported by the evidence. The Claimant asserts that Mr El Komy proposed the idea of the Damietta Project to UFACEX.52 Specifically, Mr El Komy and EATCO played a leading role in the incorporation of SEGAS, securing government permits necessary to develop the Project, identifying of suitable locations for the Damietta Plant, participating in the selection of the Damietta Plant's EPC contractor, and securing of the necessary agreements, permits and licenses for the construction of the Plant.53\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 8, 18, 22,30, 44, 50, 55 and 57.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 50.\n\n7.33.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's assertions that Mr El Komy was an instrument to facilitate corruption by exerting improper influence over Minister Fahmy and points out that there is no evidence to support such assertions.54 The Claimant argues that the Respondent's sole \"evidence\" [REDACTED], which the Claimant freely produced during the document production phase in this arbitration. The Claimant asserts that [REDACTED] only serves to emphasise Mr El Komy's and EATCO's key role in the development of the Damietta Project.55 According to the Claimant, Mr El Komy was \"the originator of the project, the 'first mover' and a true partner [of] UFACEX.\"56 The Claimant asserts that [REDACTED] reflect Mr El Komy' instrumental role in the inception of the Project, EATCO's level of participation in SEGAS, and the bargaining power of the parties at the time.57\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 21; Cl Rej Jur, Paragraph 30.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 26-27.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 8.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 29.\n\n7.34.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, [REDACTED] have nothing to do with corruption. [REDACTED] was the result of commercial compromise and not corruption.58\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 44.\n\n7.35.\n\nThe Claimant rejects as false the Respondent's allegations that Mr El Komy was to contribute only US$ 10 million to SEGAS' issued share capital.59 The Claimant asserts that EATCO was to contribute US$ 40 million (25% to be paid-up within three months of SEGAS' incorporation and 75% over the next five years).60 The Claimant points out that [REDACTED]61 The Claimant decided to end its partnership with EATCO because of EATCO's failure to contribute to SEGAS' capital. The buy-out of Mr El Komy's shares was considered necessary;62 and the price paid by UFACEX was fair and reasonable.63\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 58.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 59.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 60.\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 22; Cl Rej Jur, Paragraph 61.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 62.\n\n7.36.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that [REDACTED] does not establish the existence of any corruption.64 There is also no evidence that any payment was made to Minister Fahmy on behalf of UFG.65 [REDACTED].66 The Claimant emphasises that [REDACTED]67\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 49.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 52.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 46-48; Tr. D2 380.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 48 (emphasis omitted).\n\n7.37.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that there is nothing inappropriate about [REDACTED] only demonstrates EATCO's \"expansive and continuing role in the Project.\"68 [REDACTED]69\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 49.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 7 and 112.\n\n7.38.\n\nWith respect to [REDACTED] the Claimant asserts that it served primarily to compensate the imbalance that existed between UFACEX and EATCO in their respective receipts derived from the Project.70 [REDACTED] The Claimant submits that [REDACTED] which it submits \"was a relatively modest amount of compensation to EATCO in comparison to the billions of dollars the [UFG] expected to generate over the life of the Project.\"71\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 53.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 54.\n\n7.39.\n\nThe Claimant further asserts that the SPA was the result of genuine arm's length negotiations between UFACEX and EGPC.72 Specifically, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has not demonstrated that the SPA is a \"direct agreement\" and, even if it were, all conditions for the SPA were fully satisfied.73 According to the Claimant, the SPA was the product of a competitive process in accordance with Egyptian law.74 As a factual matter, there was no violation of EGPC's internal bidding rules.75 Moreover, the Claimant asserts that it is entitled to rely on Article 24.1 of the SPA, in which the EGPC's Chairman warranted that he had \"all powers, authority and applicable approvals (it any) necessary to enter into the Agreement.\"76 Further, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent itself determined that the SPA was \"necessary\" for its economic development.77 In addition, the Claimant points out that the price for natural gas was genuinely and intensely negotiated between the Parties, was increased by the Minister of Petroleum, and that it was considered to be \"appropriate\" according to EGPC itself.78 The Claimant also argues that the price was approved by the Respondent's Council of Ministers.79 Also, the Claimant rejects the Respondent's assertions that the SPA was unilaterally approved by the Minister of Petroleum and maintains that the SPA was approved by the Respondent's Cabinet and by the Economic Commission of EGPC's Board of Directors.80\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 70-96.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 76; Tr. D2 385.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 73-76.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 97; Tr. D2 383:384.\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraph 28.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 77-82.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 83-84.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 85.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 93-96; Tr. D2 383.\n\n7.40.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, corruption is not an issue of jurisdiction or admissibility in this case. It submits that any consequences of corruption (which it denies) should form part of the merits.81 Moreover, even if corruption were found to be implicated in the conclusion of the SPA, that would make the SPA voidable and not void automatically. It is therefore for the Tribunal to determine whether the SPA is to be considered avoided in all the circumstances.82\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraphs 33-39.\n\nTr. D2 391:5-15.\n\n7.41.\n\nThe Claimant further alleges that the Respondent misstates the law governing corruption issues and that the Respondent's assertion that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction on the basis of corruption and illegality has no legal basis. The Claimant submits that corruption allegations could not lead to a dismissal of the present case on jurisdictional grounds.\n\n7.42.\n\nFirst, the Claimant submits, international anti-corruption law, as well as policy considerations in international investment arbitration, demand that corruption not be treated as an inflexible automatic jurisdictional \"trump\" card leading to an automatic dismissal of the case for lack of jurisdiction.83 The Claimant argues that the legal materials cited by the Respondent in support of it jurisdictional objections based on corruption allegations are either inapplicable or support the Claimant's case.84\n\nCl CM Jur, Paragraphs 34-39; Cl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 101-107.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 108-112.\n\n7.43.\n\nSecond, the Claimant contends that the Respondent's failure to prosecute the former Minister Fahmy deprives it of the right to invoke corruption in this arbitration.85 The Claimant points out that the Respondent has not offered any reasons why the Tribunal should not apply the *Wena v. Egypt* standard that lack of prosecution is a ground for disregarding a State's corruption defences.86\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 113-116.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 114.\n\n7.44.\n\nThird, the Claimant submits that, by its implementation and further amendments to the SPA for the past fifteen or more years, the Respondent has acquiesced in or ratified any corruption or any violation of public bidding regulations that may have occurred in regard to the SPA.87\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 117-122.\n\n7.45.\n\nLastly, the Claimant contends that all periods for civil and criminal liability for any acts of corruption have already passed and, consequently, that the Respondent has lost the right to raise corruption as a jurisdictional objection or defence on the merits.88 The Claimant submits that the Respondent's reliance on *Maffezini v. Spain* (2000) in support of it position that a domestic statute of limitation does not apply to claims under the ICSID Convention is misguided. According to the Claimant, Maffezini v. Spain (2000) stands for the principle that in treaty arbitration an investor's treaty claim should not be barred by domestic statutes of limitation because it is based on international law. The Claimant notes that, to the contrary, the Respondent's \"corruption and illegality defences are based precisely upon violation of national law.\"89\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 123-126.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 126.\n\n(4) The Tribunal's Analyses and Decisions\n-----------------------------------------\n\n7.46.\n\nThe Tribunal's starting-point is necessarily the Treaty. Article 1(2) defines an \"investment\" as assets and rights \"acquired under the law of the host country [Egypt].\" Article 3 provides protection for investments \"made in accordance with [Egypt's] laws and regulations by investors of [Spain].\" In the Tribunal's view, an investment made corruptly by a Spanish investor under the laws of Egypt does not qualify for protection under the Treaty.\n\n7.47.\n\nThe SPA was subject to, as its \"governing law,\" the laws of Egypt: see Article 16.1 of the SPA. The SPA also contained a provision for CRCICA arbitration, in Egypt: see Article 16.4 of the SPA. The Tribunal takes judicial notice that a party's corrupt acts in procuring a contract in Egypt, such as the SPA with EGPC, are criminal offences under Egyptian law.\n\n7.48.\n\nThus, so the Tribunal concludes, the effect of international public policy under the Treaty as a matter of international law and also as a matter of Egyptian law, proven corruption by the Claimant in procuring the SPA would be fatal to the Claimant's claims derived from the SPA in this arbitration, as regards jurisdiction, admissibility and the merits.\n\n7.49.\n\nThe Respondent's case, however, turns on the facts alleged by the Respondent and denied by the Claimant, rather than upon any material difference as to the legal principles applicable to the Respondent's case. Hence, this Part of the Award should be read with the facts found by the Tribunal in Part V of this Award.\n\n7.50.\n\nThe Claimant was not an original party to the SPA. However, as elsewhere decided in this Award, the Claimant stands in the shoes of the original Buyer (UFACEX). The Claimant can have no better rights under the Treaty than UFACEX, its associated company. The original Buyer and the Claimant were, together, closely involved in the Damietta Project from the outset.\n\n7.51.\n\nThe Respondent advanced, in its pleadings, three separate allegations of corruption against the Claimant and its associated companies, all members of the Uni\u00f3n Fenosa group of companies, to the effect that the \"Damietta LNG Project was riddled with corruption.\"90 These concerned, as listed above: (i) the EPC Contract with Halliburton; (ii) the SPA and Mr Hussein Salem; and (iii) the SPA and Mr Yehia El Komy. The Tribunal addresses each of these allegations below; but it is appropriate first to identify certain common features.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 5.\n\n7.52.\n\nThe first feature is the legal burden and standard of proof for these allegations of corruption against the Claimant. As the party making these allegations, the Respondent bears the legal burden of proof. As to the standard of proof, although these allegations amount to serious criminal misconduct, the Tribunal considers that the standard of proof remains \"the balance of probabilities.\" As has long been recognised, corruption is rarely proven by direct cogent evidence; but, rather, it usually depends upon an accumulation of circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence of corruption is as good as direct evidence in proving corruption. There is no reason in this arbitration, which is not a criminal proceeding, to impose a higher standard of proof: see the *Libananco* award (2011).91\n\n*Libananco v. Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 2 September 2011, [RL-0054], Paragraph 125.\n\n7.53.\n\nThe second feature is the timing of these allegations. They were first made in this arbitration by the Respondent on 25 November 2015, more than 15 years after the SPA of 1 August 2000. Whilst the lapse of time provides, by itself, no complete answer to the Respondent's allegations under international law, it raises doubts as to why such allegations were not raised and investigated by the Respondent's criminal authorities long before 2015; and why criminal prosecutions have still not been brought against certain individuals in Egypt.\n\n7.54.\n\nThe third feature is the SPA itself, as \"endorsed\" by the Respondent at the time, both in draft form and as executed by the parties. It was signed by EGPC's chairman. Under Article 24.1 of the SPA, EGPC represented and warranted that the SPA had been authorised and approved; that the SPA constituted the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of EGPC; and that the execution and performance of the SPA would not cause it to violate any law or regulation. Whilst the terms of Article 24.1 provide, by themselves, no complete answer to the Respondent's allegations under international law, these raise a presumption of legality, albeit rebuttable, that is inconsistent with corruption by the parties to the SPA.\n\n7.55.\n\n(i) *Halliburton*: The Halliburton KBR consortium was granted the EPC Contract by SEGAS on 19 December 2001 (see Part V above).\n\n7.56.\n\nLater, Halliburton's Chief Executive Officer, Mr Albert Stanley, pleaded guilty to corruption under the USA's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and the SEC (with the USA's Department of Justice) charged Halliburton (with others) with paying bribes to obtain illegally contracts worth more than US$ 6 billion.92\n\nZachary A. Goldfarb, \"Halliburton, KBR Settle Bribery Allegations,\" *The Washington Post* (12 February 2009), [R-0025]; Chris Baltimore, \"Ex-KBR CEO Gets 30 Months for Nigeria Scheme,\" *Reuters* (23 February 2012), [R-0026]; \"U.S. Targets Overseas Bribery; KBR Exec's Plea Widens Probe,\" *Pro Publica* (9 September 2008), [R-0027].\n\n7.57.\n\nThese acts of corruption by bribery (with kickbacks), as publicly reported, included one or more unnamed projects in Egypt. The Tribunal assumes, on the limited materials before it, that one such project was the Damietta Project. There are no evidential materials before this Tribunal linking such corrupt acts with the Claimant or the SPA.\n\n7.58.\n\nThe Respondent has the legal burden of proving that the Claimant (or any of its associated companies) was party or privy to acts of corruption by Halliburton and officers of the Respondent in regard to the execution or performance of the EPC Contract. Its case cannot succeed without such proof. There can be no such guilt inferred from Halliburton's mere association with SEGAS as the Claimant's majority-owned subsidiary under the EPC Contract.\n\n7.59.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered these limited materials in regard to Halliburton. There is no proof in these proceedings of any involvement by the Claimant or SEGAS in any corrupt acts by Halliburton in regard to EPC Contract, the SPA or the Damietta Project. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent has not discharged its legal burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, in regard to corruption by Halliburton.\n\n7.60.\n\n(ii) *Mr Hussein Salem*: According to the Respondent, Mr Salem was a close \"confidant\" of President Mubarak. After the Egyptian Revolution, it was publicly reported in 2012 that Mr Salem (who was no longer in Egypt) had been involved in corrupt practices in regard to Egyptian sales of natural gas.\n\n7.61.\n\nHe was publicly quoted in the press as saying: \"Yes I made gas deals with Israel. We have a lot of gas in Egypt and can export it. I made an agreement with Israel which had political undertones, [...]. As for sending gas to Spain - well I owe them, because they gave me Spanish citizenship and welcomed me and my family.\"93\n\n\"Fugitive Tycoon Hussein Salem Smuggled 450 Million Euros out of Egypt During Revolution, Claims Heikal,\" Ahram Online (9 February 2012) [R-0017].\n\n7.62.\n\nThere is no contemporary evidence that Mr Salem was involved in the negotiations for or the execution or the performance of the SPA; nor that Mr Salem ever met an officer or employee of the Claimant (or any of its associated companies). The only evidence of possible corruption is Mr Salem's statement contained in the press report cited above.\n\n7.63.\n\nThat statement is obviously disturbing. However, by itself, it does not implicate the Claimant in acts of corruption in the negotiations for and execution or performance of the SPA. The Tribunal decides, on this limited material, that the Respondent has not discharged its legal burden of proof, again on a balance of probabilities, in regard to alleged corruption by Mr Salem.\n\n7.64.\n\n(iii) *Mr Yehia El Komy:* The Respondent's case regarding Mr El Komy developed during these arbitration proceedings, culminating in the documentation and submissions made by the Respondent pursuant to the Tribunal's Procedural Orders Nos 13, 14 and 15 on the \"Six Documents\" (see Part I above).\n\n7.65.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Respondent's case raises serious factual issues that require consideration at some length of the relevant evidence adduced before this Tribunal.\n\n7.66.\n\nThe Respondent's allegations concern Mr El Komy's relationship with the Claimant (including the Claimant's associated companies), Mr Sameh Fahmy (as the Minister of Petroleum at the time the SPA was executed on 1 August 2000) and, so it seems, President Mubarak. It is alleged by the Respondent that unnamed persons corruptly within EGPC or the Ministry procured the SPA with the connivance of UFACEX and the Claimant (including their associated companies).\n\n7.67.\n\nMr El Komy was an Egyptian geological engineer and businessman, working in Egypt. He had no relevant background in the production and sale of natural gas. Mr El Komy (with his family) owned and controlled an Egyptian company, the Egyptian Arab Trading Company formed in 1996 (\"EATCO\").94\n\nSummary of the Constitution Contract of the Egyptian Arab Trading Company Limited Partnership, 14 April 1996, [R-0328].\n\n7.68.\n\nFollowing the Egyptian Revolution in 2011, Mr El Komy was arrested by the Egyptian authorities. On 27 December 2011, he was convicted of credit fraud and sentenced to three years' imprisonment; and on 29 March 2012, he was again convicted and sentenced to a suspended term of imprisonment and heavily fined for fraud and corruption.95 None of these charges related to the Claimant, the SPA or the Damietta Project.\n\n\"Court Sentences Former Housing Minister, Alaa Mubarak's Father-in-Law to Prison,\" *Egypt Independent* (29 March 2012), [R-0016]; \"Businessman Yehia El Komy sentenced to 3 years in prison,\" *Mada Al Balad* (27 December 2011), [R-0335].\n\n7.69.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Respondent's Counsel informed the Tribunal that Mr Fahmy and Mr El Komy were both \"under investigation by Egyptian authorities in connection with the corruption surrounding the Damietta Project and, in particular, the gas price terms of the [SPA].\"96 These investigations appear to have begun in 2015 and remain pending.97\n\nTr. D2 312.\n\nLetter from Public Prosecution Office to Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority, 12 February 20015, [R-0031]; Memorandum from Public Prosecution Office to Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority, 18 August 2016, [R-0320].\n\n7.70.\n\nAs publicly reported from an interview in 2007, Mr El Komy explained his involvement with the Damietta Project, as follows:98\n\nDuring this period, [about 1999] I became familiar with Union Fenosa, which was looking to buy natural gas, so I proposed that they build a plant to liquefy gas and export it to Spain. I was trying to get a 50% share in this plant with the Spaniards, but they requested a higher share of the project, so the shares became 60% for Union Fenosa and 40% for me. I submitted the project to the government, which approved it because it was profitable and brought new technology for the first time into Egypt.\n\n*[...]*\n\n*I have not completely withdrawn from the Project, but rather I have sold my share in it and kept a share in the Spanish Union Fenosa, but only a small share. My departure was due to disagreements about a number of points inside the Project, including the project site. I would have preferred it to be in Idku, because if we had built the plant in Idku, we would have benefitted from the Brent gas fields in the area.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*Then we faced another point of disagreement, which was choosing the contractor. Fenosa preferred the Japanese company Chiyoda over the American company Kellogg, which is a subsidiary of Halliburton [sic: it was in fact the other way around], despite there being a difference in cost of around USD 50 million more to be paid to the American company.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*I faced pressure that led me to sell my 40% share of the Project, as the Government wanted to increase the capital of the Project since the Project's investments were valued at USD 400 million. With the increase, I was asked to pay USD 160 million at the time, and obstacles were placed in front of me. I felt that the Government was pressuring me to withdraw from the Project.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*Q: Did you propose the Damietta Project to Dr Hamdi el Banbi when he was Minister of Petroleum and he refused it, as is rumored?*\n\n*A: No, I did not propose the Project to him. Talk about the Project began in 1999 when Engineer Sameh Fahmy became the minister.*\n\n*Q: What are the facts behind your relationship with the father of the current Minister of Petroleum Sameh Fahmy? Was he a partner of yours in one of your petroleum projects?*\n\n*A: The father of the Petroleum Minister had a consulting office, and he prepared the study for the oil refinery that I established in 10P th P [sic] of Ramadan City. However, that goes back to about 1995 only. He didn't participate as a partner with me in the crude oil refining company, but he held 300 membership shares as a member of the company's board of directors only.*\n\n\"Yehya el Komy, Former Partner in the Damietta LNG Project, Reveals: the Government Pressured Me to Sell My Share in the Project,\" *Egypt Independent* (21 July 2007), [R-0004].\n\n7.71.\n\nFrom this evidence, as also confirmed by other materials, the Tribunal concludes that Mr El Komy had a prior business relationship with Mr Sameh Fahmy's father in or about 1995, but none with Mr Sameh Fahmy personally as at 1999 onwards. Although Mr El Komy's experience did not include natural gas projects before the SPA, the Tribunal accepts that both he and EATCO had some professional and business experience with oil and petrochemical projects.99\n\nUFACEX Memorandum to Elias Velasco and Santiago Roura re \"LNG - Egypt,\" 28 January 2000, [C-0344]; Agreement between Omar El-Komy, Hamed El-Maatawy and Yehya El-Komy, 9 May 2000, [C-0438]; Agreement between EATCO and UFACEX, 28 June 2000, [R-0318].\n\n7.72.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant (with its associated companies), with Mr El Komy as an intermediary, corrupted unnamed person(s) in order to procure the SPA for UFACEX during the period from January 2000 to 1 August 2000. Despite the juxtaposition of his name, there is no specific allegation from the Respondent that such corrupt persons included the Minister of Petroleum at the time, Mr Sameh Fahmy, personally.\n\n7.73.\n\nThe Respondent's case against the Claimant, its associated companies, Mr El Komy and EATCO turns on a succession of inferences drawn from contemporary documentation, as now known to the Respondent. The Tribunal considers each of these documents separately, before considering the Respondent's allegations as a whole.\n\n7.74.\n\nThis contemporary documentation comprises the \"Six Documents\" (in fact, seven) described and cited in Part V above. It is appropriate to address each of these documents in turn.100\n\nThe Tribunal has considered as regards these seven documents (*inter alia*) the Respondent's submissions by its letters dated 21 December 2017 and 22 January 2018.\n\n*(i) The fax of 21 January 2000 from Messrs Ortega and El Maatawy to Mr El\u00edas Velasco Garcia of Uni\u00f3n Fenosa, with an attached fax of 20 January 2000 from Mr El Komy:*101\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*See* Part V above, at Paragraphs 5.26ff.\n\n7.75.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the relevant document is Mr El Komy's attached fax message. It evidences an earlier meeting of 10 January 2000 between Mr El Komy and others regarding \"the Spanish company interest\" to construct a plant using Egyptian natural gas; and it refers to a prospective meeting on 23 January 2000 with the Minister of Petroleum (then, Mr Sameh Fahmy). The Tribunal sees nothing in this fax evidencing any corrupt purpose. Its contents are consistent with Mr El Komy's description of himself as a substantive business partner of the Claimant and its associated companies, rather than a mere broker or agent.\n\n7.76.\n\nThese were early days for the Damietta Project, with much to be settled even as a proposal to be formulated by UFACEX. The reference to \"initial approval of the Egyptian Government\" could not therefore be an actual \"approval,\" but rather only initial support for the eventual Damietta Project (whatever it might be). There was a later meeting with the Minister attended by Mr El Komy and Uni\u00f3n Fenosa during the latter's visit to Egypt from 26 to 30 January 2000. The UFACEX memorandum is of that meeting consistent with the Tribunal's finding.102\n\n*See* Part V above, at Paragraphs 5.31ff.\n\n*(ii) The Minutes of the UFACEX internal meeting of 2 March 2000:*103\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*See* Part V above, at Paragraphs 5.34ff.\n\n7.77.\n\nAt this meeting, the participants discussed a draft Memorandum of Understanding with EATCO, in two different versions. The first treated EATCO \"simply as an agent activating the project.\" The second treated EATCO as \"more of an investor partner.\" The choice required further agreement with EATCO.\n\n7.78.\n\nThese were, again, early days in the relationship between the Claimant (UFACEX) and Mr El Komy and EATCO. It is clear that Mr El Komy was thought to have sufficient experience with sufficient resources to be an \"investor partner,\" as he was to be. The reference to EATCO's alternative role as an \"agent\" is not, by itself proof of any corrupt intent. There is nothing suspicious about UFACEX's need to discuss the forms of the agreement with Mr El Komy.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n7.79.\n\n[REDACTED] It was one of many contracts between these parties in what had become a complicated project, with multiple parties executing different legal agreements at different times. In the Tribunal's view, whilst its terms were generous to EATCO, this agreement is consistent with Mr El Komy's role as an investor and business partner in the Damietta Project. It is not proof, by itself, of any corrupt activity by the Claimant, Mr El Komy or EATCO.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n7.80.\n\n[REDACTED] The Tribunal notes that the choice of site for the Damietta Project was important: the LNG facilities situated at Damietta would not have access to its own gas field, but would be dependent on the Respondent's national grid for its supply of natural gas.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n7.81.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n7.82.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this agreement means what it states. It is inconsistent with any reward for corrupt acts by Mr El Komy and EATCO. The Tribunal sees no reason to treat the terms as a disguise for nefarious conduct by any of the parties. Even if one or more the parties misreported the sale price of SEGAS' shares to the Cairo Stock Exchange (as the Respondent contends), by itself, that delinquency does not evidence corruption in regard to the SPA, as alleged by the Respondent.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n7.83.\n\n[REDACTED] In the Tribunal's view, as with the earlier exiting agreements of April-May 2002, this agreement does not evidence corrupt acts by the Claimant, Mr El Komy or EATCO.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n7.84.\n\nOstensibly, this agreement terminates the Claimant's relationship with Mr El Komy. However, if not (as the Respondent contends), it evidences only a residual relationship between the Claimant, Mr El Komy and EATCO in limited terms similar to [REDACTED]. Its financial terms were certainly not ungenerous. However, again, the Tribunal cannot see this agreement as evidencing corrupt acts of the Claimant, Mr El Komy or EATCO in regard to the SPA.\n\n7.85.\n\nMany of these agreements contain \"confidentiality\" clauses, from which the Respondent draws malign inferences. In the Tribunal's view, that practice is not unusual for transnational commercial agreements. It is not therefore proof, by itself, that contractual parties have guilty minds with something to hide.\n\n7.86.\n\nThe Respondent also drew further inferences from the \"economical truth\" employed by the Claimant, particularly its change in emphasis in describing Mr El Komy's role in the Damietta Project during the course of this arbitration. Faced with allegations of corruption pleaded by the Respondent in this arbitration, the Claimant's reticence is perhaps comprehensible. In any event, it was not, in the Tribunal's view, the sign of guilty minds by the Claimant (or its counsel).\n\n7.87.\n\nThe Respondent also criticised Mr Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez (of SEGAS) for limiting his testimony to exclude or limit his involvement with Mr El Komy, [REDACTED] With hindsight, Mr Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez might well have been more forthcoming about his role in regard to that agreement. However, the Tribunal cannot fault him for misrepresenting his testimony to this Tribunal (as alleged by the Respondent), neither in writing nor in answers to questions at the Hearing, where he was cross-examined by the Respondent.\n\n7.88.\n\nThe Tribunal has already taken note that the several payments received by Mr El Komy and EATCO in regard to the Damietta Project seem generous. However, it is not for this Tribunal to second-guess, long after the events, upon what conditions the Claimant (with its associated companies) should have paid for the work of Mr El Komy and EATCO. Over a period of some two years, Mr El Komy, as an \"investorpartner\" provided personal services for the Damietta Project; and EATCO also made contributions to the Project. For example, EATCO took part in the preparation of the Pre-Feasibility Study;110 it prepared studies on possible sites for the Plant;111 it was responsible for the proposal from Chiyoda and APCI for the EPC contract;112 it negotiated and signed the Damietta Port Agreement of 8 August 2000 between UFACEX and the Damietta Port Authority;113 it procured licences from the Damietta Port Authority for SEGAS' work in December 2000 and March 2001;114 and it participated in the handover from the Damietta Port Authority to SEGAS of the land plot and jetty in April 2001.115 The reward for all this was a commercial matter for negotiation and agreement between the parties at the time. In the Tribunal's view, the several payments received by Mr El Komy and EATCO, by themselves, do not support any necessary inference that they formed part of a corrupt scheme relating to the SPA. The Tribunal also notes that the relations between the Claimant (with SEGAS) and Mr El Komy (with EATCO), as originally envisaged, were prematurely brought to an end in mid-2002. Accordingly, the payments originally agreed between these parties reflected an intent to form a much longer relationship.\n\nAgreement between UFACEX and EATCO, 9 March 2000, [C-0439], Pages 1-2.\n\nMinutes of Meeting sent by Antonio Hernando to El\u00edas Velasco *et al*., 14 June 2000, [C-0444], Page 2.\n\nMinutes of Meeting sent by Antonio Hernando to El\u00edas Velasco *et al*., 14 June 2000, [C-0444], Page 3; Email from Ricardo Villanueva, 5 July 2000, [C-0446]; Email from Ricardo Villanueva, 17 July 2000, [C-0447]; Fax from Ricardo Villanueva to Yehia El-Komy, undated, probably July 2000, [C-0467]\n\nAgreement with the Damietta Port Authority, 8 August 2000, [C-0448].\n\nLetter from SEGAS to the Damietta Port Authority, 21 March 2001, [C-329].\n\nPlot Handover Minutes, 1 April 2001, [C-0451].\n\n7.89.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the SPA was executed by EGPC in breach of its own procedures as regards a public bid.116 Mr Ahmed Shaaban testified that EGPC, during the SPA's negotiations with UFACEX was \"negotiating in its own name and independently;\" and that he was not aware \"of any instructions given by the Ministry [of Petroleum].\"117\n\nResp Obj to Jur, Paragraphs 21ff.\n\nShaaban WS1, Paragraph 7.\n\n7.90.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, even if correct, this breach can support no inference of corruption by the Claimant in circumstances where the SPA was approved in draft by the Egyptian Council of Ministers and, after its execution, \"endorsed\" by the Minister of Petroleum. Moreover, the SPA was thereafter amended several times. If there had been any breach of procedures in first signing the SPA, it would be odd that such a breach was not later identified by EGPC (later EGAS) and acted upon before agreeing to such amendments. It never was.\n\n7.91.\n\nThus far, the Tribunal has considered these materials individually, together with the related testimony adduced in writing and orally at the Hearing. The Tribunal concludes that, taken individually, the Respondent has not proven its case on the basis of inferences drawn from these materials, including the \"Six Documents.\" It is, however, necessary for the Tribunal to stand back from these individual factors, assessed separately, so as to consider the Respondent's allegations more broadly.\n\n7.92.\n\nAs to the source of funds for the Damietta Project, there is no evidence that Mr El Komy provided any significant capital. Mr El Komy's fax message of 20 January 2000 (Document (i) above) records his expectation that \"the Spanish company will fund the company completely and will be able to utilize all LNG produced\" (emphasis supplied). Whilst UFACEX's internal memorandum dated 28 January 2000 notes Mr El Komy's offer to secure \"financial capacity,\" it confirms that Mr El Komy \"expects that we [UFG] provide financing and markets.\"118\n\nUFACEX Memorandum to Elias Velasco and Santiago Roura re \"LNG - Egypt,\" 28 January 2000, [C-0344].\n\n7.93.\n\nFrom the evidence before this Tribunal, it does not appear that Mr El Komy provided any funding net of what he received, or was due to receive, from the Claimant [REDACTED] alone dwarfed the U$ 2.87 million he paid in as capital (quite apart from the [REDACTED]). Nor was Mr El Komy contemplated as a customer for production from the Damietta Plant; nor was he in fact.\n\n7.94.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Claimant's choice of Mr El Komy as a local partner for the Damietta Project cannot be explained on the basis that Mr El Komy (with EATCO) was a net source of capital for the project.\n\n7.95.\n\nAs to the expertise of Mr El Komy and EATCO, neither appear to have brought any particular specialist expertise to the project. Mr El Komy was trained as a geological engineer; but it is undisputed that he had no personal expertise or experience in the LNG industry. It is also far from clear that he had had any extensive business experience in the petroleum industry more widely in regard to major projects.\n\n7.96.\n\nUFACEX's internal memorandum dated 28 January 2000 reporting on the early discussions with Mr El Komy cites three categories of experience: he is \"currently the leading company in a joint venture [...] whose purpose is to build 'a State of the art used lube oil refining facility and blending lube oil plant in the new satellite industrial city east of Cairo' called Tenth of Ramadan\"; he is \"currently pursuing a number of oil concessions in the Gulf of Suez; and he \"is developing together with other partners the Suez Petrochemical Company (SPC) Project, consisting in the production of polyethylene and polypropylene.\"119 As can be seen, all three are *prospective* projects.\n\nUFACEX Memorandum to Elias Velasco and Santiago Roura re \"LNG - Egypt,\" 28 January 2000, [C0344].\n\n7.97.\n\nThe first project appears to have been a low-level motor oil recycling venture. It was eventually established sometime before 2007, according to the press interview Mr El Komy gave that year;120 that it was still in the future as of January 2000 is confirmed by the agreement dated 9 May 2000 between Mr El Komy, Mr Omar El-Komy and Mr El Maatawy:121 \"[EATCO] is currently establishing an oil refinery factory.\" The third project appears to be the methanol-to-olefins project mentioned in the press report of January 2002,122 as something that EATCO Petrochemical Company \"is to have,\" but that, as of Mr El Komy's 2007 interview, was still being worked on but lacked funding.123\n\n\"Yehya el Komy, Former Partner in the Damietta LNG Project, Reveals: the Government Pressured Me to Sell My Share in the Project,\" *Egypt Independent* (21 July 2007), [R-0004].\n\nAgreement between Yehia El Komy, Omar El Komy and Hamed El Maatawy, [C-0438].\n\n\"EGYPT - Egyptian LNG & P/L Gas Exports May Exceed 27 BCM/Y by 2010,\" *APS Review Oil Market Trends,* [R-0005].\n\n\"Yehya el Komy, Former Partner in the Damietta LNG Project, Reveals: the Government Pressured Me to Sell My Share in the Project,\" *Egypt Independent* (21 July 2007), [R-0004].\n\n7.98.\n\nThe MOU dated 9 March 2000 between the Claimant and Mr El Komy seems to recognise this situation. It notes (in the present tense) that Mr El Komy \"is also investing in several projects in oil and petrochemical sector.\"124 In his 2007 press interview, Mr El Komy states that at some time after working as an engineer in Libya, he bought an oil field services company.125 However, EATCO appears to have added oil field services and oil and gas investments to its authorised company activities only in 2001, towards the end of Mr El Komy's active relationship with the Claimant.126\n\nAgreement between UFACEX and EATCO, 9 March 2000, [C-0439].\n\n\"Yehya el Komy, Former Partner in the Damietta LNG Project, Reveals: the Government Pressured Me to Sell My Share in the Project,\" *Egypt Independent* (21 July 2007), [R-0004].\n\nTr. D2 309-310; Excerpt of the Commercial Registry of the Egyptian Arab Trading Company, 18 December 2016, [R-0327].\n\n7.99.\n\nThus, although the MOU dated 9 March 2000 records that Mr El Komy \"has been rendering advisory and assistance services in Egypt for many years;\"127 and [REDACTED],\"128 Mr El Komy's relevant experience was limited and recent. It would appear to have been acquired in 1999-2000 only.\n\nAgreement between UFACEX and EATCO, 9 March 2000, [C-0439].\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n7.100.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes the Mr El Komy's professional expertise (with EATCO) cannot explain the Claimant's choice of Mr El Komy as a local partner for the Damietta Project.\n\n7.101.\n\nAs to access to senior decision-makers, the evidence for an explanation is stronger. Access to government power can be a valuable asset to bring to a project involving the purchase of natural resources from the State or State entity, particularly when such natural resources comprise highly regulated sectors of the economy controlled by the State. Different States have a variety of standards governing the propriety of taking advantage of such access; lobbying can take many forms; and a paid lobbyist is not necessarily committing a crime or other impropriety.\n\n7.102.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Mr El Komy was chosen by the Claimant primarily to act as a lobbyist with access to senior figures in EGPC and the Ministry of Petroleum. That is not, by itself, evidence of corruption. The factual question is whether Mr El Komy was more than a lobbyist, on the evidence adduced before this Tribunal.\n\n7.103.\n\nThe Claimant denies that Mr El Komy offered any advantages from special access to the Respondent's decision-makers in regard to the SPA. Indeed, the Claimant goes to great pains to stress the absence of any special relationship between Mr El Komy and Minister Fahmy, pleading that \"this so-called 'fact' is nothing of the sort,\" and that \"Egypt has provided no evidence whatsoever that anyone exercised any back-channel influence.\"129\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 24 and 520.\n\n7.104.\n\nhe Claimant's explanation for why it chose Mr El Komy as a business partner, as pleaded in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, is that: \"[t]he project was the original idea of El-Komy;\"; that \"he conceived of the idea and [...] [w]ithout his 'first mover' participation, the Project would not have been initiated and moved forward;\" and that \"he was the person who initially brought the proposal to Uni\u00f3n Fenosa.\" The Claimant alleges that Mr El Komy himself \"decided to establish an LNG facility in Egypt\" and agreed, not only to share the opportunity with claimant, but also to the \"relinquishment of equal control in the Project.\"130\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 8, 18, 22, 34 and 49.\n\n7.105.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the evidence adduced in this arbitration does not support the Claimant's explanation.\n\n7.106.\n\nIn his witness statement, Mr Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez (of SEGAS), who was responsible for overseeing the Damietta Project, testified that: \"[b]y 1999, Uni\u00f3n Fenosa had been assessing several options to secure long-term gas supply [\u2026] [and it] was *at that time* that Uni\u00f3n Fenosa heard of an opportunity to develop an LNG project in Egypt\" (emphasis supplied). He also testified that the Claimant \"decided to explore this possibility and several executives met with the Egyptian Minister of Petroleum in November or December of 1999.\"131\n\nFern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez WS, Paragraph 6.\n\n7.107.\n\nThe Tribunal infers that the Project was conceived by Uni\u00f3n Fenosa in 1999, before Mr El Komy became involved with the Claimant in early 2000. He did not bring the project to the Claimant. The Tribunal also infers that the project had been the subject of previous development on the Claimant's behalf by other, qualified persons. One or more of these persons later brought Mr El Komy into their discussions.\n\n7.108.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts, as the Claimant's Rejoinder pleads, that \"Mr El-Komy and EATCO [\u2026] were from the outset viewed as necessary to the Project.\"132 The question is \"why.\"\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 57.\n\n7.109.\n\nMr El Komy and EATCO were not passive or secretive participants in the Damietta Project. He openly identified himself (with EATCO) and was publicly identified with UFACEX from the outset of his involvement in the Project with UFACEX. He did not act as a covert peddler of influence, with his principal's identity kept hidden from the Respondent's decision-makers. To this extent, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant's submission that no evidence exists, in this arbitration, of any \"back-channel influence.\" However, the Tribunal does not accept that there was no \"influence.\" It concludes that there was influence exercised by Mr El Komy over senior decisionmakers at the Ministry of Petroleum and EGPC over the SPA; but that it was not corrupt.\n\n7.110.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by three factors. First, the Respondent's case does not prove that any monies passed from Mr El Komy or EATCO to any senior decisionmaker. There was, on the evidence adduced before this Tribunal, no bribe paid or promised to any such decision-maker. Mr El Komy and EATCO were well-rewarded for their involvement in the Damietta Project. However, in the absence of corruption and as already indicated, it is not for this Tribunal to second-guess, with hindsight and the lapse of time, commercial decisions that were made by the Claimant towards Mr El Komy that may now seem mistakenly generous.\n\n7.111.\n\nSecond, the relevant events occurred more than fifteen years ago. Although Mr El Komy was prosecuted and convicted for other crimes in Egypt, it is significant that he has never been prosecuted by the Respondent for criminal conduct in regard to the SPA. Nor has any senior decision-maker at EGPC or the Ministry of Petroleum (including Minister Fahmy) been prosecuted in regard to the SPA.\n\n7.112.\n\nThird, the belated plea of corruption, raised by the Respondent as a jurisdictional objection after the commencement of this arbitration, raises a suspicion that the plea serves a convenient tactical purpose. This suggestion is strengthened by the weakness of the Respondent's two other pleas relating to Halliburton and Mr Hussein Salem, both of which seemed only to serve a tactical purpose in seeking to defeat or delaythe Claimant's claims against the Respondent. These two pleas should not have been made by the Respondent based on the materials presented by it to the Tribunal.\n\n7.113.\n\nNonetheless, contrary to the Claimant's submissions, the Respondent and its legal representatives should not be criticised for raising its allegations of corruption in this arbitration in regard to Mr El Komy. These allegations were not frivolous. Several were classic \"red flags\"; but even the reddest of red flags does not suffice without proof of corruption before the tribunal. Whilst it can be relatively easy to allege corruption, it is less easy to prove it, as observed in the *Metal-Tech* award (2013).133 Suspicion is not equivalent to proof. Unanswered queries may have innocent explanations, not amounting (in the absence of explanations) to proof of corruption. With hindsight, what business people agree not infrequently defies logic or commonsense to non-business people, again without amounting to proof of corruption. The legal burden of proving corruption rests upon the party alleging corruption; and it is not discharged by placing the burden on the adverse party to prove the absence of corruption.\n\n*Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, [RL-0002].\n\n7.114.\n\nMoreover, with a case dependent upon circumstantial evidence (as in the present case), it is often a question of joining up the dots; but there have first to be dots in the evidence adduced before the tribunal. In this case, so the Tribunal decides, there are insufficient dots; and the red flags are outnumbered by neutral black flags.\n\n7.115.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal has read the Final Award dated 21 December 2017 issued in the CRCICA arbitration (896), as submitted in these arbitration proceedings by the Claimant and the subject of written comments by the Respondent. The CRCICA tribunal there dismissed a similar plea of corruption made by EGAS as the respondent against the Claimant as the claimant. It is apparent that the CRCICA tribunal received more evidential materials from the parties (including specific oral testimony) than were adduced by the Parties in this arbitration. Moreover, given that the parties in the CRCICA arbitration are not both the same as the Parties to this arbitration, the Tribunal has thought it right to pay no regard to the CRCICA tribunal's analysis or decision in its award. The Tribunal has therefore not done so for the purpose of this Award. Nor has this Tribunal thought it appropriate to take into account evidence adduced before the CRICA tribunal (as recorded in its award). Such evidence is not evidence in this arbitration between different parties. Nonetheless, having reached its conclusion on the Parties' submissions and evidential materials in this arbitration, the Tribunal draws some comfort that its conclusion appears to be consistent with the decision of the CRICICA tribunal.\n\n(5) Summary of Decisions\n------------------------\n\n7.116.\n\nThe Tribunal finds, as facts relevant to jurisdiction (with admissibility) and the merits, that there was no evidence of corruption against the Claimant (including UFACEX) in regard to the SPA proven by the Respondent in this arbitration, where the Respondent bore the legal burden of proving its allegations on a balance of probabilities.\n\n7.117.\n\nFor all the reasons stated above, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent's three allegations of corruption by the Claimant in regard to the SPA.\n\nPART VIII: THE NECESSITY ISSUES\n-------------------------------\n\n(1) Introduction\n----------------\n\n8.1.\n\nThe Tribunal addresses here the defence of necessity under customary international law pleaded by the Respondent to preclude its international responsibility for the alleged international wrongs under the Treaty towards the Claimant, particularly under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. The Treaty does not contain any specific provision on the defence of necessity.\n\n8.2.\n\nUnder customary international law, necessity is one of the circumstances that the State can invoke to preclude the wrongfulness of an act in breach of an international obligation of that State, including a breach of its obligations under a bilateral treaty.\n\n8.3.\n\nThe conditions to invoke a plea of necessity under international are confirmed in Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.1 It provides as follows:\n\n*1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:*\n\n*(a) is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and*\n\n*(b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.*\n\n*2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:*\n\n*(a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or*\n\n*(b) the State has contributed to the situation of necessity.*\n\nInternational Law Commission, *Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentaries*, Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of its Fifty-Third Session, UN Doc.

Thus, the Tribunal is content to apply its terms, as explained by the ILC's commentary.2\n\nJames Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], 178ff.\n\n(2) The Respondent's Case\n-------------------------\n\n8.5.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent invokes the state of necessity as an alternative defencein the event that the Tribunal were to find that the alleged acts committed by the Respondent, or by EGAS or EGPG attributable to the Respondent, breached its obligations under the Treaty.3\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 331ff; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 360ff.\n\n8.6.\n\nSuch a defence was recognized in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* (1997), on which the Claimant also relies, and in *Continental Casualty v. Argentina* (2008).4 The Respondent submits that the conditions for the defence of necessity in Article 25 of the ILC Articles are fulfilled in the present case.5 Its case falls under the following several headings.\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraph 361, citing *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovaquia)*, Judgment, 25 September 1997, *I.C.J.

Argentina* (2006) and *Impregilo v. Argentina* (2011); and also from the Zimbabwean political crisis: *Von Pezold v. Zimbabwe* (2015) *.* In these cases *,* the ICSID tribunals decided that an \"essential interest\" of a State and its \"existence\" extend (*inter alia*) to the social, economic, financial and political interests of the State. Thus, contrary to the Claimant's case, such an interest includes the maintenance of the State's public order and stability, as well as the maintenance of its basic services.7 The Respondent notes in this regard that the Impregilo tribunal decided that water and sewage services qualified as an essential interest within the meaning of Article 25 of the ILC Articles.8\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 336-340, citing *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovaquia),* Judgment, 25 September 1997, *I.C.J.

Zimbabwe (2015) (as to which the tribunal found that there was no threat to Zimbabwe's essential interests) are clearly present in this case.9 Unlike Von Pezold v. Zimbabwe (2015), the Respondent's essential interest in maintaining stability, security and internal peace was threatened because the situation in Egypt.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 341-344.\n\n8.10.\n\nThat situation, so the Respondent submits: \"(i) reached historic levels of violence, (ii) was out of control due to riots and clashes across the country, (iii) could not be brought under control by police or otherwise, (iv) reached a level far beyond a threat solely to the party in power in Egypt, and (v) constituted a threat to the basic functioning of society and the maintenance of internal stability.\"10 All this caused a dramatic drop in the supply of natural gas both internally and for exportation. That led to repeated blackouts across the country and consequently to more widespread violence and unrest.11\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 345; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 363-366; ROS, Vol. III, Slide 75, referring to the Minutes of the Meeting of the UFG Board of Directors in March 2013 where the Managing Director stated that the situation in Egypt was \"out of control\"; Minutes of the Meeting of the Board of Directors of the company Uni\u00f3n Fenosa, S.A., 20 March 2013, [R-0353], Pages 8-9.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 343-344; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraph 363.\n\n8.11.\n\nThe Respondent submits that all these factors, on which other tribunals have relied in deciding the same issue of necessity, demonstrate that a \"grave and imminent peril\" was present in the present case.12 The Respondent contests the Claimant's understanding of the term \"immediate\" and \"proximate\" as misleading. It wrongly limits the peril to physical proximity.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 344-346 referring to *Sempra v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award, 28 September 2007, [CL-0032], Paragraph 349; *Von Pezold v. Zimbabwe*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15, Award, 28 July 2015, [RL-0113], Paragraph 636; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 363 and 368-371.\n\n8.12.\n\nRelying on the same case as the Claimant, namely the decision in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* (1997), the Respondent emphasises that the ICJ decided that \"a 'peril' appearing in the long term might be held to be 'imminent' as soon as it is established, at the relevant point in time, that the realization of that peril, however far off it might be, [is] certain and inevitable.\" The Respondent contends that this approach applies to the present case with respect to the risk of total blackouts that would have \"certainly and inevitably\" occurred, had the Respondent not prioritised the needs of domestic users in Egypt.13\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 372-375, citing *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovaquia)*, Judgment, 25 September 1997, *I.C.J. Reports 1997,* p.7,[RL-0112], Paragraph 54.\n\n8.13.\n\nThe Respondent also asserts, contrary to the Claimant's suggestions, that the prioritisation of gas supply to domestic needs was \"the only way\" to maintain public order and basic services, as \"the electricity sector in Egypt was largely dependent on natural gas to fuel it.\"14 If the Respondent had acted otherwise, it \"would thus have led to more numerous and prolonged blackouts, and even more severe accompanying violent protests and demonstrations, further aggravating the perilous security situation.\"15\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 351; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 374-388.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 351 (footnote omitted); Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 374-388.\n\n8.14.\n\nThe Respondent emphasises that a \"balanced\" interpretation of this factor is required, otherwise it would be \"virtually impossible\" for a State successfully to invoke the defence of necessity.16 The Respondent refers to the ICSID *ad hoc* committee's analysis in *Enron v. Argentine* (2010), noting that the requirement \"is not one of certainty, but one of reasonable probability.\"17 Relying on the ILC Commentary to Article 25 of the ILC Articles (with the decisions of ICSID tribunals), the Respondent submits that the fact that there are different views as to whether the conduct followed was the only way to respond to the situation, does not bar the State from invoking the defence of necessity.18\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 348; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 374-377.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 348; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 374-383; *Enron v.

Nor can a mere factual connection between the State's conduct and the situation of necessity constitute a basis for the determination of such contribution.28 The Respondent contends that the Claimant's assertions are misleading; the Claimant fails to demonstrate \"a direct link\" between the Respondent's policies and the economic and political crisis during the Egyptian revolution.29 The Respondent further submits that it repeatedly tried to control the situation, but the revolution left the Respondent with no discretion as to its policies for the supply of gas to domestic users.30\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 360-363, citing *Enron v.

That submission finds no support in the legal materials upon which the Claimant relies. Rather, so the Respondent submits, these materials merely provide for the possibility of compensation; it is not a requirement.31 Also, there is no such compensation to investors or for investments required under the Treaty.32 The Respondent contends that the Claimant must \"bear the risk of the state of necessity and its consequences and be denied the compensation it requests,\"33 as in *LG&E v. Argentina* (2006) where the tribunal decided to the same effect.34\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 400-406.\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 407-408.\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraph 411.\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 409-411, citing *LG&E v.

In addition, Spain itself has an interest in the gas supply provided by UFG from Egypt, and that interest was impaired by Egypt's conduct.*36\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 407 (footnote omitted); COS, Part I, Slide 69.\n\n8.23.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, since the defence of necessity is a ground precluding the wrongfulness of an act violating an international obligation, by invoking the state of necessity the Respondent concedes that its acts as alleged by the Claimant are wrongful.37 In support of this submission, the Claimant refers to the ICJ's reasoning in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* (1997), as well as several ICSID awards to the same effect.38\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 401-402.\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 401-402, citing *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovaquia),* Judgment, 25 September 1997, *I.C.J.

According to the Claimant, this is reflected in the negative wording of Article 25 but also in the \"only way\" requirement and the safeguard of an \"essential\" interest from a grave and imminent peril.39\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 403-405; COS, Part I, Slides 70-72, citing *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovaquia)*, Judgment, 25 September 1997, *I.C.J.

It is a cumulative multi-element standard. Accordingly, failing to satisfy any element should negate the application of the defence of necessity. The Respondent has failed to prove any of these multiple elements.40 In support of its submissions, the Claimant relies upon several awards where tribunals have rejected the defence of necessity. The Claimant notes in this regard that most of the cases that the Respondent invoked for its case did not in fact find in favour of the defence of necessity.41\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 406-407, citing *National Grid v.

Such reductions were the result of \"misguided\" policies that caused an imbalance between the demand for and the supply of gas in Egypt.44 Therefore, cutting off the gas supply to the Plant was intended by the Respondent to address gas shortages and not blackouts.45\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 412-417 and 425.\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 412-416; COS, Part I, Slides 79-81.\n\n8.28.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant submits that the revolution relates to a political crisis mainly pertaining to the Mubarak and Morsi regimes and that the widespread protests, as described by the Respondent, did not impact the Plant at Damietta. Thus, there was no \"imminent\" or \"proximate\" danger relevant to the gas supply to the Plant. Accordingly, the Respondent's defence of necessity is unfounded and cannot excuse the Respondent's failure to comply with its obligations under the Treaty.46\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 419-429.\n\n8.29.\n\nFurther, the Claimant contends that cutting off the gas supply was not the \"only way\" to safeguard the Respondent's essential interest in maintaining public order and providing basic services against a grave and imminent peril allegedly threatened by the violent protests and the blackouts during the Egyptian revolution.\n\n8.30.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent had other alternatives. Citing *Sempra v. Argentina* (2007) *, CMS v. Argentina* (2005) and *AWG v. Argentina* (2010), the Claimant notes that the Tribunal does not need to determine policy alternatives that the Respondent could have adopted. Rather, the Tribunal should only determine whether the policy adopted was the only way to remedy the situation.47\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 430-433, citing *Sempra v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award, 28 September 2007, [CL-0032], Paragraph 351; *CMS v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, 12 May 2005, [RL-0103], Paragraph 323; *AWG v. Argentina*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Liability, 30 July 2010, [CL-0200], Paragraph 260.\n\n8.31.\n\nTo that end, the Claimant submits that:\n\n*Egypt and EGAS could have set aside and provided for the warranted supply - and the promised back-up supply - for the Claimant as contracted. The Respondent could also have bought gas abroad and supplied the Claimant; or at least it could have supplied* [the Claimant] *proportionately with supplies to other users, as required by the SPA. Finally, and at a minimum,* [the Respondent] *could have compensated* [the Claimant] *for its costs of obtaining a replacement supply for* [its requirements in] *Spain. But* [the] *Respondent took none of these actions, preferring instead to force the full consequences of* [its] *decisions onto* [the Claimant] *, a foreign investor, whilst privileging other domestic industries.*48\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 450 and 435-450;COS, Part I, Slide 86.\n\n8.32.\n\nIn support of a strict interpretation of the \"only way\" requirement in Article 25(1)(a) of the ILC Articles,the Claimant relies on the reasoning of the *LG&E* tribunal and the commentary to Article 25 on State Responsibility. Both confirm, so it submits, that the defence of necessity cannot be invoked if other means were available, even if they were \"more costly or less convenient.\" That was the case here for the Respondent.49\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 440-442, citing *LG&E v.

Argentina* (2010) *.* In fact, so the Claimant contends, the \"only way\" being a \"reasonable probability requirement\", was one of the issues which the ICSID *ad hoc* committee decided not to answer.50\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 443-449, citing *Enron v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment, 30 July 2010, [RL-0115], Paragraphs 371 and 373.\n\n8.34.\n\nBased on the testimony of its expert witnesses, the Claimant contends that the Respondent contributed to its alleged situation of necessity through its \"ill-advised\" and \"inadequate\" gas policies that caused a demand-supply imbalance, hence the gas supply shortages and the Respondent's failure to comply with its obligations towards the Claimant.51 In support of this assertion, the Claimant relies on the *Impregilo* tribunal's decision to similar effect.52 The Claimant further asserts that the gas supply shortages had an impact on Spain's interest to provide gas for its citizens.53\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 451-460; COS, Part I, Slides 87-90.\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 459, citing *Impregilo v.

That continued failure does not conform to the requirements of Article 25 of the ILC Articles, as it has been recognized by several arbitral tribunals deciding the same issue.54 The Claimant contends that the Respondent provided no evidence as to the continuation of any situation of necessity.55\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 462-464.\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 462-464.\n\n8.36.\n\nLastly, the Claimant submits that even if the defence of necessity were accepted by the Tribunal, it could not relieve the Respondent from its obligation to compensate the Claimant under the Treaty. The Claimant submits that such compensation is required in Article 27 of the ILC Article. It is further confirmed in the ILC Commentary to the ILC Articles, as well as the ICJ decision in *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* (1997) and the ICSID tribunal's in *EDF v. Argentina* (2012).56\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 465-471; COS, Slides 91-92, citing *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project (Hungary/Slovaquia)*, Judgment, 25 September 1997, *I.C.J.

It is none the worse for that. It deserves to be addressed upon its own terms, however inconsistent it may be with the Respondent's primary case. Alternative cases are invariably inconsistent with primary cases; the latter should not infect the former; nor vice-versa.\n\n8.38.\n\nThe Tribunal decides that the Respondent bears the legal burden of proving its defence of \"necessity\" under customary international law, as a positive allegation. Moreover, the elements of that defence, as listed in Article 25 of the ILC Articles, are cumulative. In other words, it is for the Respondent to prove each of the relevant elements and not for the Claimant to disprove any of them. That is clear from the negative formulation of Article 25(1) and 25(2) (\"may not be invoked\", \"unless\" and \"if\"), together with elements that fall almost exclusively within the actual knowledge of the State invoking the defence of \"necessity.\" This approach also accords with the ILC's Commentary applicable to Article 25 of the ILC Articles: see Chapter V at Comment (8) and Comment (14) on Article 25.57\n\nJames Crawford, *The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press 2002), [CL-0185], 162 and 183.\n\n8.39.\n\nThe first element is listed in Article 25(1) of the ILC Articles as \"the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation\" of the State. Applied to the present case, that \"act\" is the Respondent's alleged breach of the Treaty's FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. That breach allegedly consisted of the Respondent's interference with the supply of gas by EGAS to the Plant, thereby frustrating the Claimant's legitimate expectations based upon the Respondent's undertaking in the Ministry of Petroleum's letter dated 5 August 2000 issued pursuant to Article 21.1 of the SPA (as explained later in this Award).\n\n8.40.\n\nThat interference began before 2010 (*i.e.* before the Global Financial Crisis and the Egyptian revolution). It has continued to the present day. During 2012 and 2013, of a total gas production in Egypt of 58.8 Bcma, only 0.3 Bcma was supplied to the Plant. As already found above, this minimal quantity compares starkly with supplies to the Respondent's preferred users of gas: 28.8 Bcma to Power Plants, 14.7 Bcma to industrial users and 5.7 Bcma to the Idku Plant.58 There was no attempt by the Respondent to ensure that the Claimant be treated \"no worse,\" for an indefinite period, than any other purchaser of natural gas in Egypt, using the words of Article 15.2 of the SPA.\n\nBRG ER1, Figure 24, Annex B-3.\n\n8.41.\n\nThe second element listed in Article 25(1)(a) relates to \"the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril.\" In the Tribunal's view, the application of this second element to the present case raises important issues of timing.\n\n8.42.\n\nAs the first issue of timing, the Egyptian revolution began during the spring of 2011 (when President Mubarak resigned from office). It was only by EGAS's letter of 4 February 2013 to the Claimant that any suggestion was made that \"the continuing social and political instability in Egypt\" was an event of \"force majeure\" under the SPA, followed by EGAS' formal notice of force majeure on 24 February 2013.\n\n8.43.\n\nYet, disruptions in the supply of gas to the Plant had begun in 2006, long before EGAS' invocation of *force majeure* under the SPA in 2013.\n\n8.44.\n\nBy 2012, there were temporary black-outs in Egypt, caused by the lack of electricity. These were caused by an inadequate national grid and a lack of power generation capacity, particularly at times of peak demand. This was well-known at the time. As Professor Medlock testified, \"[t]he tightened electricity market balance in Egypt over the past several years is well documented.\"59 This imbalance was in turn caused by the Respondent's earlier decisions not to promote the development of gas deposits in Egypt, not to improve the national grid and not to build more power generating plants, with a mix of fuels. By 2012, the black-outs required the Respondent to prioritise gas supplies to generate electricity for consumers.\n\nMedlock ER1, Paragraph 24.\n\n8.45.\n\nThe Tribunal does not discount the fact of social unrest or the Respondent's reasonable concerns that serious unrest might ensue, still less the fact of the Egyptian revolution beginning in early 2011. Yet, the curtailment of gas to the Damietta Plant both pre-dated and post-dated the Egyptian revolution. It was not the proximate cause for curtailing gas supplies to the Plant. That proximate cause lay in the Respondent's long-standing policies as to the development of gas deposits, electrical power generation, the national grid and the preferential use of gas for users and consumers in Egypt.\n\n8.46.\n\nIn other words, the \"act\" was not \"the only way\" for the Respondent \"to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril,\" using the words in Article 25(1)(a) of the ILC Articles. In contrast to the Claimant and the Damietta Plant, other commercial users of gas remained preferred by the Respondent. This is confirmed by the disproportionality in the reductions for delivered gas between the Damietta Plant and other commercial users in 2012-2013; namely: 12% reductions for Industrial users (receiving 14.8 Bcma), 14% for Power users (28.9 Bcma), 14% for Idku (5.7 Bcma) and 60% (0.3 Bcma) for the Damietta Plant (from a total production of 58.8 Bcma); and the Plant's reduction resulted in a curtailment of 96% in the Claimant's contractual volumes for export.60 In 2012-2013, if the \"act\" had been \"the only way,\" it would have been equally necessary for the Respondent to curtail supplies to other commercial users to a similarly minimal level as the Damietta Plant and the Claimant. That was not done.\n\nBRG ER 1, page 73, Figure 24 (\"Disproportionality of Damietta Plant Curtailments to Uncurtailed Demand (FY 2012-13)\" with Annexes B-3 & B-16, BRG ER2, page 68, Table 9 (\"Summary of Exporter Curtailments\"); *see also* COS, Part I, Slide 57.\n\n8.47.\n\nAs to the second timing issue, the Egyptian revolution had ceased by 2015. Yet, the resumption of gas supplies to the Plant did not then take place; nor has any such resumption taken place to date. As confirmed by the ILC's commentary on Article 27, the defence of necessity under international law lapses \"if and to the extent that the circumstance precluding wrongfulness no longer exists.\"61\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, [CL-0064], Article 27; James Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185],189ff.\n\n8.48.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the non-supply of gas to the Plant was not attributable to the Egyptian revolution or social unrest; nor was it begun or maintained as the only way to safeguard the Respondent's essential interest against a grave and imminent peril, within the meaning of Article 25 of the ILC Articles.\n\n8.49.\n\nThe third element listed in Article 25(1)(a) relates to an \"essential interest\" against a grave and imminent peril. In the Tribunal's view, for present purposes, the Respondent's relevant interest under Article 25 at the material time lay, not in the maintenance of public safety, but in the shortage of gas inEgypt.\n\n8.50.\n\nThat shortage originated in the Respondent's long-standing policies of subsidising domestic users of gas and electricity, together with a statement of policy (but not actual practice) to encourage the finding of gas deposits in Egypt.\n\n8.51.\n\nThese events had begun in the late 1990s, following the discovery of natural gas deposits off the Egyptian coast. It led to a public statement of policy by the Respondent to develop the use of natural gas as a substitute for liquid fuels in several economic sectors.62 To encourage that use, the Respondent promoted the use of gas in the electricity sectors of the Egyptian economy; and it subsidised users of natural gas, both as gas itself and gas as a means of generating electricity.63\n\nBRG ER1, Paragraphs 34-35; Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, \"The Arab Republic of Egypt: Initial Communication on Climate Change,\" June 1999, [BRG-165].\n\nBRG ER1, Paragraphs 66ff and 77ff; Medlock ER1, Paragraph 22.\n\n8.52.\n\nAs to the statement of policy intended to encourage new discoveries of natural gas, the Respondent did not later translate that statement into policies sufficient to attract producers to discover and develop new natural gas fields. There was sufficient gas in existing fields and proven reserves to meet demand, at least up to 2017.64 From 2000 to 2008, however, with the rise in oil prices, the Respondent introduced a price cap for all-natural gas agreements.65 Even when the costs to producers significantly increased from 2004 onwards, the Respondent maintained the price cap.66\n\nWood McKenzie Report, \"Development Timetable for gas Fields in Egypt,\" [RPS-16]\n\nBRG ER1, Paragraphs 40 and 135.\n\nRPS ER1, Figure 8.\n\n8.53.\n\nThe result was an imbalance between the supply and demand of Egyptian gas. It was well established by 2006, as an increasing trend.67 This was well known at the time. Later, as already recited in Part V above, on 24 March 2014, the Minister of Petroleum, subsequently Prime Minister (Mr Sherif Ismail) acknowledged that a contributing factor to such imbalance had been the \"irrational\" consumption of Egyptian gas due to \"subsidy.\"68\n\nTabulation of Data used by RPS, [RPS-4].\n\n\"The Oil and Gas Sector in Egypt: Vision and Challenges,\" Speech (unofficial transcript) of Sherif Ismail, Egyptian Minister of Petroleum at the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt (24 March 2014), [C-0192].\n\n8.54.\n\nAs to gas subsidy, when it was eventually reformed by the Respondent in 2014, the World Bank calculated in 2015 that the reform had already yielded cost savings equivalent to 3.3% of Egypt's GDP.69\n\nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \"Program Document for a Proposed Loan in the Amount of US $1,000 Million to The Arab Republic of Egypt for a First Fiscal Consolidation, Sustainable Energy and Competitiveness Programmatic Development Policy Financing\" (23 November 2015), [BRG-255].\n\n8.55.\n\nAs to gas supply, the imbalance could not be swiftly corrected, even if the Respondent had been minded to do so. There is a significant time lag between the first discovery of a new gas field and its first commercial production, particularly for offshore fields. For onshore fields, according to testimony from Mr Davison and Mr Walkup, the time lag is about six to seven years and, for offshore fields, about nine years.70 Mr Goncalves testified that it took longer in Egypt, up to 12 years.71 This time lag was also well-known at the time.\n\nRPS ER2, Paragraph 67; Walkup ER1, Paragraph 37.\n\nBRG ER1, Paragraph 93.\n\n8.56.\n\nNonetheless, little or no steps were taken by the Respondent to encourage producers to discover and develop new gas fields. As a result, Egyptian gas production reached its apogee in 2009 and then began to flatten.72 This was before the Egyptian revolution.\n\nRPS ER2, Figure 6.\n\n8.57.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the imbalance between supply and demand was not caused by the Egyptian revolution or the Global Financial Crisis. That was not the proximate cause of the non-supply of gas to the Claimant. The proximate cause was an overall shortage of Egyptian gas, applied by the Respondent inequitably amongst different users in Egypt.\n\n8.58.\n\nContrary to the Respondent's submission, that shortage of gas was not the relevant \"essential interest\" of the Respondent at the material time, sufficient to justify the defence of necessity against \"a grave and imminent peril\" within the meaning of Article 25 of the ILC Articles.\n\n8.59.\n\nAs to the fourth element listed in Article 25(2)(b) of the ILC Articles, the issue arises whether the Respondent \"contributed to the situation of necessity.\" In the Tribunal's view, this concept does not fit easily with long term macro-economics, such as is present in this case.\n\n8.60.\n\nTo an extent, a situation of necessity can always be traced back, as a matter of history, to political and economic mistakes made by a State years, if not decades, earlier. It may involve the State's relations with one or more other States, including economic and political factors lying outside its border (such as the Global Financial Crisis). Ordinarily, at the time when such mistakes were made, the State may not know of the consequences of its mistake, still less know that it has even made any mistake. Accordingly, this element of contribution requires a common-sense interpretation, placing the contributory event in chronologically proximity to the situation of necessity. Also, as the ILC Commentary to Article 25 of the ILC Articles states, \"the contribution to the situation of necessity must be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral.\"73\n\nJames Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], Article 25, Comment (20).\n\n8.61.\n\nThe Tribunal is not inclined to find that the Respondent's defence of necessity, if otherwise made out, would fail under this fourth element of \"contribution\" under Article 25. The Respondent did not subjectively intend that social unrest should take place, leading to the Egyptian revolution and its consequences of 2011-2014. It did not cause or foresee the consequences of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008. Nor did the Respondent subjectively intend that there would be, independently from these events, a shortage in electricity supply and a shortage of gas in Egypt. However, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to decide this fourth element, one way or the other, given the Tribunal's earlier decisions above.\n\n(5) Summary of Decisions\n------------------------\n\n8.62.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent has not proven the defence of \"necessity\" under customary international law, as expressed in Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. In these circumstances, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to address the Claimant's further submissions on Article 27 of the ILC Articles.\n\nPART IX: THE MERITS ISSUES\n--------------------------\n\n(1) Introduction\n----------------\n\n9.1.\n\nThe Tribunal here addresses the merits of the Claimant's claims and the Respondent's defences under Articles 3(1), 4(1), 4(2) and 4(5) of the Treaty.1\n\nAgreement on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Arab Republic of Egypt, [C-0001].\n\n9.2.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the Treaty requires the Respondent to protect in its territory the investments made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of Spain and \"shall not hamper, by means of unjustified or discriminatory measures, the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, expansion, sale and if is the case, the liquidation of such investments.\"\n\n9.3.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Treaty provides that the Respondent \"shall guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment for the investments made by investors of [Spain]\" (the \"FET standard\").\n\n9.4.\n\nArticles 4(2) and 4(5) of the Treaty address discriminatory or \"less favourable\" treatment for the covered investments than that applied to investments by investors of a third country or by Egyptian investors.\n\n9.5.\n\nThere is a substantial overlap between these respective protections, as applied to the present case. For this reason, the Tribunal here focuses on the Claimant's case under the FET standard under customary international law in Article 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\n(2) The Claimant's Case\n-----------------------\n\n9.6.\n\n*FET Standard:* In summary, the Claimant contends that the Respondent breached the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty, through its actions and omissions and by the acts and omissions of the Respondent and of EGAS, EGPC and their affiliates attributable to the Respondent.2\n\nRfA, Paragraphs 2, 9, 16-17 and 24-25; Cl Mem Merits, Section IV.A; Cl Rep Merits, Section IV; COS, Part I, Slide 9.\n\n9.7.\n\nIn particular, the Claimant submits that the Respondent failed to afford fair and equitable treatment to its investment in the Damietta Plant by: (i) creating and then frustrating the Claimant's legitimate expectations in the contractual performance of the SPA; (ii) failing to ensure an adequate gas supply to the Damietta Plant and prioritising the domestic market and other gas consumers at the Claimant's expense; (iii) pursuing gas sector policies and market interventions that caused gas shortages and invoking them to avoid its obligations; and (iv) undersupplying the Damietta Plant and allocating available gas in a discriminatory, disproportionate and nontransparent manner.3 The Claimant also contends that the Respondent violated the FET standard when it undermined the stability of the Claimant's legal and business framework by enacting Law No. 114 for 2008 that amended the Investment Guarantees and Incentives Law and cancelled SEGAS' Free Zone License.4\n\nRfA, Paragraphs 9, 16-17 and 24-26; Cl Mem Merits, Section IV.A; Cl Rep Merits, Section IV; COS, Part I, Slide 9.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Section IV.A.3, Paragraphs 334 and 503-506;The Claimant does not devote a specific section of its Reply on the Merits to its free zone claim; *see also* Cl Mem Merits, Section II.D.3; Cl Rep Merits, Section II.D, for the factual background on the Free Zone status.\n\n9.8.\n\nThe Claimant points to the ordinary meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment\" in the FET standard as \"just, even-handed, unbiased, legitimate, reasonable.\"5 It notes that other tribunals have decided that the FET standard \"ensures that the foreign investor is not unjustly treated, with due regard to all surrounding circumstances, and that it is a means to guarantee justice to foreign investors.\"6 The Claimant submits that the FET standard is \"inherently flexible\" that may be implicated by \"different types of host State misconduct,\"7 and encompasses the protection of investors' \"legitimate expectations.\"8 The Claimant emphasises that \"no investment tribunal has ever refused to find that the [FET] standard protects legitimate expectations.\"9 In response to the Respondent's argument that legitimate expectations are limited to a \"specific commitment,\"10 the Claimant replies that the concept is broader and claims that a \"State's unilateral declarations, its regulatory framework, and other conduct and circumstances can create legitimate expectations\" and that each situation must be evaluated individually.11\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 329, citing *National Grid v.

The Claimant submits that whilst the Government endorsed the SPA, it also adopted policies that undermined EGPC and EGAS' obligations to the Claimant and used EGAS to implement the Ministry's strategy of prioritising the domestic market over the Claimant.29 The Claimant claims that the Government's policies, including subsidising gas usage across industries, over-stimulated demand for gas and led to a domestic gas shortfall.30 Paired with the Government's strategy of giving local market demand priority - a strategy that did not exist when the SPA was signed - the Government caused EGPC and EGAS to fall short of meeting their obligations to the Claimant by 190 million MMBtus between 2006 and 2010, and to fail to deliver any gas since 2012.31 In response to the Respondent's argument that the decision to cut off the gas supply to the Claimant did not involve sovereign authority, the Claimant refers the Tribunal to its arguments on attribution(see below).\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraphs 257-263, 396-413;

COS, Part I, Slides 38-43.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 46; Cl Rep Merits, Paragraph 313; COS, Part I, Slide 46.\n\n9.19.\n\nFurther, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent violated the FET standard by revoking, by Law No. 114 of 2008, the Free Zone status of SEGAS originally established under Law No. 8 of 1997, which excluded the profits and dividends of projects established in free zones from Egyptian tax and regulations.34 The Claimant contends that it had relied on this status in making its investment in the Project and is significantly harmed through its revocation.35\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraphs 275, 334, 504 and 569; COS, Part I, Slide 48; citing Investment Guarantees and Incentives Law No. 8 of 1997, and the 25-year licence granted to SEGAS for the LNG complex to operate as a \"private Free Zone Company,\" [C-0 1 09]; \"Doing Business in Egypt,\" *Practical Law* (2015), [C-0293].\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 503, citing Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez WS, Paragraph 16; COS, Part I, Slide 49.\n\n9.20.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that \"international trade law further confirms UFG's legitimate expectations\" and refers to the World Trade Organization (\"WTO\") Agreements, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1994 (\"GATT\") \"which sets out binding rules that limit the right of WTO Members to restrict or prohibit exports to other Members.\"36 The Claimant asserts that WTO jurisprudence on Article XI:1 of the GATT \"'lays down a general obligation to eliminate quantitative restrictions' on trade\" and \"forbids not only outright prohibitions on importation or exportation but also other 'restrictions',\" including \"measures that create uncertainties and affect investment plans, restrict market access for imports, or make importation prohibitively costly\" or \"ha[ve] a limiting effect.\"37 The Claimant thus concludes that \"Egypt's international obligation to ensure compliance with WTO rules in good faith further confirms the [Claimant]'s legitimate expectation that Egypt would neither require nor allow the prioritization or exclusive allocation of natural gas for domestic use in violation of WTO rules\" and \"to suggest otherwise is to suggest that the [Claimant] should have anticipated that Egypt would violate its treaty obligations.\"38\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 335, citing in particular Article XI:1 of the GATT, which provides that \"No prohibitions or restrictions other than duties, taxes or other charges, whether made effective through quotas, import or export licenses or other measures, shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting party on the importation of any product of the territory of any other contracting party or on the exportation or sale for export of any product destined for the territory of any other contracting party.\";

Thus, the Claimant asserts that, whilst its main case is that \"Egypt itself, through the Ministry of Petroleum and other agencies and officials, made the decision to decrease (and then stop altogether) the supply of natural gas to the [Claimant] in order to prioritize Egypt's domestic market,\" EGPC's and EGAS' conduct \"equally implicates Egypt's liability for breaching the BIT.\"39\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 206.\n\n9.23.\n\nThe Claimant submits that EGPC's execution of the SPA is attributable to the Respondent primarily because EGPC was an organ of the State under Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (being declaratory of international law),40 and thus that EGPC's obligations under the SPA to supply gas are the basis of legitimate expectations that the Respondent would assure such supply.41 The Claimant submits that, despite the fact that EGPC \"assigned\" (novated) the SPA to EGAS in 2002 (effective as from 1 August 2001),42 EGPC remains \"responsible for the obligations under it.\"43\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, [CL-0064].\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 318.\n\nLetter from EGPC (Ibrahim Saleh) and EGAS (Mohamed Tawila) to Uni\u00f3n Fenosa, S.A. (El\u00edas Velasco), 17 October 2002, [C-0170].\n\nCl Rep Merits, Footnote 530 (\"Although EGPC assigned the SPA to EGAS, it remains responsible for the obligations under it. But in any event, UFG's expectations must be measured at the time the contract was signed, and it was signed with EGPC as a state organ. EGAS is also an organ of the state.\").\n\n9.24.\n\nThe Claimant submits that EGAS's failure to supply gas to the Claimant under the SPA is also attributable to the Respondent, under international law, because EGAS, too, is an organ of the State under Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. According to the Claimant, EGAS' decision to curtail supplies to the Damietta Plant was an exercise of governmental authority under Article 5 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility; and that EGAS did so on the instructions of or under the direction or control of the Respondent within the meaning of Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. As a result, so the Claimant concludes, the Respondent is itself responsible for the curtailment of supply of feed gas under the SPA.\n\n9.25.\n\nFor the purpose of Article 4 of the ILC Articles, the Claimant contends that EGPC is an organ of the Respondent under Article 4 by reason of the following factors:\n\n(i) The fact that EGPC enjoys separate legal personality under Egyptian law is not determinative of its status as an organ of the State under international law;\n\n(ii) EGPC is wholly owned by the Respondent and was created by Law No. 20 of 1976 to manage all sectors of the Egyptian petroleum industry,44 that the Claimant contends is a core governmental function.45 EGPC is, by statute and along with the Ministry of Petroleum and EGAS, a constituent part of the Egyptian \"Petroleum Sector,\" that developed national strategies for the gas industry;46\n\n(iii) \"[A]s a 'public authority' operating under the guidance of the Ministry of Petroleum,\"47 EGPC is governed by public law and its decisions are administrative decisions subject to the review of the Egyptian State Council;48\n\n(iv) EGPC is controlled by the Government with the chairman of its board of directors appointed by the Respondent's President and other board members appointed by the Prime Minister based recommendations of the Minister of Petroleum.49 By law, EGPC is subject to the financial supervision of the Government's Central Audit Agency,50 and all of the decisions of EGPC's board of directors must be sent to the Minister of Petroleum for ratification, amendment or rescission.51 EGPC is not \"operationally autonomous\" of the Government, as demonstrated by the fact that the Ministry of Petroleum closely controls its decision-making and operations;52\n\n(v) EGPC has represented itself in a private offering memorandum to potential investors that it was an \"economic authority of the Arab Republic of Egypt, rather than a corporation, with the same legal status as the Central Bank of Egypt and the Suez Canal Authority,\" with all decisions of the Board of Directors being required to be notified to the Minister of Petroleum for approval;53 and\n\n(vi) The ICSID tribunal in *Ampal v.

It submits that the Claimant has not established that the Respondent's conduct gave rise to any \"legitimate expectations\" on which it relied in making its investment; that the Respondent frustrated these expectations; and that the Respondent has otherwise violated the FET standard.59\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 218-219; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraph 213.\n\n9.30.\n\nWhilst the Respondent accepts that legitimate expectations are an essential element of the FET standard, the Respondent contends that the standard is not \"flexible\" (as the Claimant argues), but rather presents a \"high threshold\". According to the Respondent, the Claimant has not met this threshold.60 The Respondent relies on *Waste Management v. Mexico II* (2004) to argue that the standard requires \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic\" conduct leading to \"an outcome which offends judicial propriety\" to breach the FET minimum standard.61\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 220-222, citing *Biwater v.

The Respondent points out that the Claimant claims reliance upon a statement by the Egyptian Minister of Petroleum in 2005, years after its investment in 2000, whilst its witness on this point (Mr Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez) \"was not involved in the negotiation and drafting of the [SPA]\" and thus cannot speak to the Claimant's reliance on any alleged representations at the time.71 The Respondent contends that expectations arising after an investment is made are not protected under the FET standard.72\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 227, citing Fern\u00e1ndez Mart\u00ednez WS, Paragraph 8; Cl Merits, Paragraph 384; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 230-235.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 227-228, citing *National Grid v.

Ecuador* (2006), the Respondent asserts that, in the absence of a specific commitment from the host State like a stabilisation agreement, the foreign investor has no right or legitimate expectation that the tax regime will not change during the life of the investment.76 In this regard, the Respondent notes that \"it is undisputed that the Parties never entered into a tax stabilization agreement\" and the Claimant invested knowing that SEGAS was subject to changes in the regulation of free zones under Investment Law No. 8 of 1997.77 Again referring to *Parkerings v.

It contends that the standards of international law for determining attribution are demanding; and that the Claimant has failed to meet any of them.\n\n9.46.\n\nAs regards EGPC, the Respondent denies that EGPC is an organ of the State; and it maintains that, in any event, as a result of EGPC's \"assignment\" (or novation) of its rights and obligations under the SPA, no responsibility by EGPC for subsequent conduct by EGAS can arise.92\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraph 145, Footnote 244 (\"Because the breaches alleged by Claimant in this case concern conduct that occurred after EGPC assigned its rights and obligations under the Natural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement to EGAS in 2002, it is unnecessary for Respondent to address any of Claimant's further arguments in this respect. To the extent Claimant has argued that as a result of EGPC's entering into the Natural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement, Claimant has reasonably relied on legitimate expectations vis-a-vis Respondent at the time of the making of its investment, Respondent will show that this is unsupported and unsupportable as a legal and factual matter.\").\n\n9.47.\n\nAs regards EGAS, the Respondent also contests that EGAS is an organ of the State;93 that EGAS exercised any government authority by conduct94 and that EGAS was instructed or directed in such conduct by organs of the Respondent.95\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 145-146 and 195; Resp CM Merits, Paragraphs 183-191.\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 145 and 166-178; Resp CM Merits, Paragraphs 192-202.\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 145 and 179-186; Resp CM Merits, Paragraphs 203-212.\n\n9.48.\n\nAs regards Article 4 of the ILC Articles, the Respondent disputes that EGPC is an organ of the State by reason of the following factors:\n\n(i) The fact that an entity has separate legal personality is determinative that it is not an organ of the State, at least in the absence of exceptional circumstances;96\n\n(ii) State organs are entities that are part of the structure of the State and act on its behalf,97 whereas EGPC is a corporation having legal personality separate from the State.98\n\n(iii) EGPC is not considered to be a State organ under Egyptian law,99 and the fact that it is owned by the State does not make it part of the organisation of the State under international law;100\n\n(iv) EGPC is engaged in the development and exploitation of petroleum resources, which is a commercial rather than a governmental activity.101\n\n(v) The fact that EGPC is subject to the financial supervision of the Egyptian Central Audit Agency does not make it part of the structure of the State;102 indeed, it has \"an independent planning budget prepared on the same pattern as commercial budgets.\"103\n\n(vi) The fact that certain of EGPC's decisions have been held to be subject to Egyptian administrative law is irrelevant to the question of whether the conduct of EGPC at issue in this case is attributable to the Egyptian State under international law;\n\n(vi) The negotiation and execution of the SPA by EGPC were no more the exercise of governmental authority than similar actions by a private contractor;104 and\n\n(vii) The decision in *Ampal v.

The Tribunal determines the issues of attribution by reference to Articles 4, 5, 8 and 11 of the ILC's Articles on State Responsibility, being declaratory of customary international law, as argued by the Parties.\n\n9.50.\n\nThe Tribunal first addresses the Claimant's case under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. As already indicated, the Respondent denies any liability to the Claimant under any provision in the Treaty, including Article 4(1). The Tribunal's analysis below should be read with the fuller description of material events in Part V above, together with the complete text of the relevant legal provisions in Part III above.\n\n9.51.\n\n*The FET Standard* : Article 4(1) of the Treaty requires the Respondent, towards the Claimant, \"to guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment of the investments made by investors of the other Party.\" This FET standard provides a broad protection to covered investments and investors. The Tribunal is content to apply under Article 4(1) the customary international law standard as prohibiting (*inter alia*) conduct by the host State \"which is unjust, arbitrary, unfair, discriminatory or in violation of due process,\" including conduct that frustrates an investor's \"legitimate expectations,\" as decided by the NAFTA tribunal in *Merrill v. Canada* (2010).106\n\n*Merrill v. Canada*, ICSID Case No. UNCT/07/1, Award, 31 March 2010, [RL-0070], Paragraph 208.\n\n9.52.\n\n*Legitimate Expectations:* As to \"legitimate expectations,\" the Tribunal is content to adopt the statement, as cited by the Respondent,107 in *Philip Morris v. Uruguay* (2016): \"It clearly emerges from the analysis of the FET standard by investment tribunals that legitimate expectations depend on specific undertakings and representations made by the host State to induce investors to make an investment.\"108\n\nTr. D1 268:11-18.\n\n*Philip Morris v. Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Award, 8 July 2016, [RL-0151] (emphasis omitted).\n\n9.53.\n\nThe Tribunal has also been guided by several other decisions cited by the Parties, including *Parkerings v. Lithuania* (2007), *Glamis v. USA* (2009)109 and *Mobil v. Canada* (2012).110 Applying these materials, in addition to the requirement for a specific undertaking or representation attributable to the Respondent, the Claimant must also establish that: (i) its expectations were reasonable in the circumstances; (ii) it relied upon such undertaking or representation when it made its investment in Egypt; and (iii) that the Respondent's non-compliance with its undertaking or representation violated the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. The Tribunal does not consider that such a representation or undertaking amounts to a free-standing part of the FET standard but, rather, that it is \"a relevant factor\" in assessing whether or not the Respondent violated the FET standard, as was decided in *Mobil v. Canada* (2012).111\n\n*Glamis v. United States*, Award, 8 June 2009.\n\n*Mobil v. Canada*, Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum, 22 May 2012, [CL-0043].\n\n*Mobil v. Canada*, Decision on Liability and on Principles of Quantum, 22 May 2012, [CL-0043], Paragraph 152; *see also CMS v. Argentina*, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine, 25 September 2007, [RL-0162], Paragraph 89; *Waste Management v. Mexico II*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, [CL-0033], Paragraph 98; See also *MTD v. Chile*, Decision on Annulment, 21 March 2007, Paragraph 67.\n\n9.54.\n\nWhether such a factor applies to any particular case, however, must depend upon the particular circumstances of that case, both as to the State and to an organ of the State (including the question of whether it is an organ of the State). In the Tribunal's view, these several tests are largely fact-specific in the present case.\n\n9.55.\n\nThe Claimant emphasises that this \"is not a contract case.\"112 If it were, the Claimant's contractual rights would be subject to the applicable laws and dispute resolution provisions in its contracts. The Claimant contends, however, that the Respondent violated the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty under international law. The Tribunal accepts, as the Respondent submits, that it has no jurisdiction to decide any claim by the Claimant for breach any of contractual rights under any agreement made by the Claimant and its associated companies subject to their applicable municipal laws and provisions for dispute resolution before international commercial arbitration tribunals. The Tribunal here asserts its jurisdiction under the Treaty in respect only of alleged violations of the Respondent's obligations towards the Claimant under the Treaty.\n\nTr. D1 63:1; Tr. D1 66.\n\n9.56.\n\nThe Claimant contends under international law that (*inter alia*) the Respondent frustrated the Claimant's legitimate expectations, in breach of the Ministry of Petroleum's undertaking of 5 August 2000, by interfering with the performance by EGPC and subsequently EGAS of their contractual obligations under the SPA (with the EGAS and UFG Tolling Contracts); by engaging in inconsistent conduct towards the Claimant; by adopting discriminatory measures towards the Claimant; and by conduct that lacked proportionality and transparency towards the Claimant. To that end, the Claimant relies upon expectations derived from (but not based on) its contractual rights, the Respondent's own conduct and the status of EGPC and EGAS as legal entities wholly-owned by the Respondent whose acts and omissions are attributable to the Respondent under international law.\n\n9.57.\n\nThe Claimant's case relies first, for its \"legitimate expectations,\" on the Ministry's undertaking of 5 August 2000 and rights derived from the SPA between the Claimant (as UFICEX's \"assignee\") and the Seller (originally EGPC succeeded by EGAS), whereby, in the Claimant's submission, \"EGPC/EGAS\" (as the Seller) undertook several obligations for the supply of natural gas to UFACEX/UFG during the SPA's term of 25 years. These included the following contractual terms:\n\n(i) Under Article5.1,the Seller agreed to sell and deliver 4 BCMof gas annually;\n\n(ii) Under Article 5.1[5], the Seller \"shall at all times keep a backup supply to meet an on stream (load) factor of 95% of the LNG Complex.\"\n\n(iii) Under Article 15.2 of the SPA, in the event of \"*Force Majeure*\" (as there defined), the Seller \"shall treat Buyer no worse than any other present or future purchaser/s [sic] of NG\"; and \"[t]his right shall be binding upon the Parties at all time, including the event of shortage of NG. \"113\n\n(iv) Under Article 15.3(b):\n\n*In the case of the Seller, Force Majeure shall not include changes in market conditions including, without limitation, changes that: (i) Directly or indirectly affect the demand for or price of NG; (ii) Result in the diversion of NG to other users; (iii) Are due to the inability of the transportation system and/or pipeline (whether for reasons of maintenance, repairs or lack of capacity or otherwise) to meet consumer demand and/or Buyer demand.*\n\n(v) Under Article 21.1:\n\n*EGPC undertakes to procure that the Egyptian authorities undertake not to interfere with the rights of Buyer under this Agreement, and not to dictate or promulgate any act or regulation which could directly or indirectly affect the rights of Buyer under this Agreement, or affect the capacity of Buyer to perform its obligations under this Agreement, even in the case of a NG shortage in Egypt, save for Force Majeure situations as defined in this Agreement.*\n\n(vi) Under Article 23.2:\n\n*Seller is the sole responsible* [sic] *for securing adequate supplies of NG for performance of its obligations hereunder. Seller shall, throughout the Term, provide Buyer or Lenders with such further assurances as Buyer or Lenders may reasonably request from time to time regarding the continued adequacy of NG supply sources relied upon by Seller to perform hereunder. In no case this shall represent for Seller additional obligations to those set forth in this Agreement.*\n\n(vii) Under Article 24.3, the Seller acknowledged that it:\n\n*is aware that the supply of NG to Buyer* [\u2026] *is a key element of the successful development of the Project, and therefore Seller represents and warrants that its availability of NG will be sufficient to feed the Complex under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Also Seller represents and warrants that it has, and will have during the Term, all the legal, administrative and corporate rights, licenses and authorizations to deliver the NG at the Delivery Point and to comply with all its obligations under this Agreement.*\n\nNatural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement, [C-0002].\n\n9.58.\n\nUnder theterms of the SPA, EGPC acted as a principal towards UFACEX in regard to the SPA: Article 24.1(h). EGPC was not, however, an entity created and operating in the private sector of the Egyptian economy. As already indicated, EGPC was wholly owned bythe Respondent. Yet, EGPC had a separate legal personality under Egyptian law. Thus, Article 20 of the SPA addressed sovereign immunity; and the waiver of such immunity clearly targeted EGPC (later, EGAS), rather than UFACEX (later, the Claimant).\n\n9.59.\n\nThe Respondent was not a contractual party to the SPA, as confirmed by Articles 21.1 and 24.1(h) of the SPA, and also the separate approval of the SPA by the Respondent's executive branch. Such separate approval would not have been necessary if the Respondent were a contractual party to the SPA. As to such approval, it took place by the Council of Ministers on 25 July 2000 (before the SPA was executed) and by the Ministry of Petroleum's letter dated 5 August 2000 to the Claimant (shortly after such execution).\n\n9.60.\n\nThe Ministry's letter dated 5 August 2000 provided, in material part:114 \"On behalf of the Ministry of Petroleum I have the pleasure to Inform you that the Egyptian Government official [sic] endorsed the natural gas Sales and Purchase Agreement signed on August 1, 2000 between UFACEX and EGPC.\"\n\nLetter from Ministry of Petroleum, First Undersecretary (Ismail Karara) to Uni\u00f3n Fenosa S.A., Chairman (Jos\u00e9 Maria Amustategui), 5 August 2000, [C-0169]. The Tribunal does not consider that this statement by the Respondent falls within Article 24.1(f) and (g) of the SPA: it was not a \"mutual representation\" made between EGPC and UFACEX as the contractual parties to the SPA.\n\n9.61.\n\nThis letter uses the phrase (in English) that the Egyptian Government \"official[ly] endorsed\" the SPA. It was a shorthand term signifying, in the circumstances known to the Government, EGPC and UFACEX, something more specific. In the Tribunal's view, the Respondent was thereby associating itself, as a non-contractual party, with the terms of Article 21.1 of the SPA.\n\n9.62.\n\nUnder this provision, EGPC expressly:\n\n*Undertakes to procure that the Egyptian authorities undertake not to interfere with the rights of the Buyer under this Agreement and not to dictate or promulgate any act or regulation which could directly or indirectly affect the rights of Buyer under this Agreement, or affect the capacity of Buyer [sic: Seller] to perform its obligations under this Agreement, even in the case of a NG shortage in Egypt, save for Force Majeure situations as defined in this Agreement* [\u2026]\n\nThe Tribunal emphases the phrase \"to procure that the Egyptian authorities undertake.\" As a matter of ordinary English, this necessarily refers to a separate extracontractual \"undertaking\" by the Egyptian authorities, and not to an undertaking by EGPC alone under the SPA. EGPC's contractual undertaking was to procure the undertaking from the Egyptian authorities. By the term \"Egyptian authorities,\" the contracting parties were referring to the Egyptian Governmental authorities, including the Ministry of Petroleum.\n\n9.63.\n\nEGPC discharged its undertaking to \"procure\" the undertaking by the Egyptian Governmental authorities, in accordance with Article 21.1, in the form of the Ministry of Petroleum's letter dated 5 August 2000. The Respondent's \"official endorsement\" of the SPA is, in the circumstances, to be understood as comprising the separate, extra-contractual undertaking required under Article 21.1 of the SPA. In the Tribunal's view, the juxtaposition of timing and the terms of Article 21.1 and the letter exclude any other objective interpretation.\n\n9.64.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent's 'undertaking' was an important extra-contractual condition for UFACEX's participation in the Project. Without such an endorsement from the Respondent, conforming to the undertaking required under Article 21.1 of the SPA, the Damietta Project would not have proceeded beyond the signing of the SPA. A breach of EGPC's undertaking to procure the Respondent's undertaking would have amounted to the wholesale repudiation of the SPA and the immediate renunciation of the Project. At the time, it does not appear that this requirement for the Respondent's undertaking was in the least controversial. The Respondent (by its Ministry of Petroleum) was supporting the Project; and the Respondent's Council of Ministers had approved the draft SPA.\n\n9.65.\n\nIt was essential for the Claimant to receive natural gas under the SPA. There was no other source of natural gas for the Plant. It was to be connected to the national grid; and it was not to be supplied from its own gas field. Without such supply, the Plant would become a \"white elephant.\"\n\n9.66.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, nothing could be clearer than the provisions in the SPA, principally Article 24.3 recording the Seller's awareness \"that the supply of NG to Buyer under this Agreement is a key element for the successful development of the Project, and therefore Seller represents and warrants that its availability of NG will be sufficient to feed the Complex under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\" It is also evident from Articles 21.1, 24.1 and 24.3 whereby the Seller was responsible for securing all necessary permits and support from the Respondent's administrative and other agencies, so as to perform its obligations to supply natural gas to the Plant.\n\n9.67.\n\nAll this was known to the Respondent at the material time, from its approval of the SPA's draft terms by its Council of Ministers on 25 July 2000 (based on the Minister of Petroleum's memoranda) and, particularly, at the time of the Ministry of Petroleum's letter dated 5 August 2000. As more fully explained in Part V above, the Minister of Petroleum \"endorsed,\" *i.e.* approved, the decision of EGPC's board of directors dated 14 July 2000 authorising EGPC to execute the SPA.115 The Minister's memorandum of July 2000 (otherwise undated but preceding EGPC's execution of the SPA on 1 August 2000) requested the Council of Ministers also to approve the signing of the SPA, as there described.116 Whilst the Minister was primarily concerned with the pricing mechanisms under the SPA, it is inconceivable that both the Minister and the Ministry of Petroleum were unaware of the draft SPA's non-pricing terms, including Article 21.1 of the SPA.\n\nMemorandum number 56, Agenda of the XIIIth Meeting of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian General Petroleum Commission, 20 July 2000, [C-0359].\n\nMemorandum from the Minister of Petroleum (Sameh Fahmy) to be submitted to the Cabinet on Contracting with the Spanish Company (Uni\u00f3n Fenosa) for Exporting the Egyptian Natural Gas, July 2000, [C-0458].\n\n9.68.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal discounts the Respondent's attempts to downplay the significance of the Ministry of Petroleum's letter dated 5 August 2000. Given the importance to UFACEX of the Respondent's undertaking required under Article 21.1 of the SPA, if no such extra-contractual undertaking had been forthcoming from the Respondent, there would have been prompt and strenuous protests from UFACEX at the time. There were none.\n\n9.69.\n\nConversely, the Tribunal discounts the Claimant's attempts to transform the terms of the Ministry's letter dated 5 August 2000 and associated conduct into a general guarantee of EGPC's contractual obligations as Seller under the SPA. Under the SPA, EGPC was not acting as an agent for the Respondent but expressly as a principal, as already noted above (see Article 24.1(h) of the SPA). Under Egyptian law as the SPA's applicable law (Article 1.1 of the SPA), EGPC's contractual obligations under the SPA did not accrue to the Respondent given EGPC's separate legal status from the Respondent. If it had been intended to bind the Respondent generally to the terms of the SPA as a guarantor or primary co-obligor, it would have been easy for UFACEX, EGPC and the Respondent to use contractual language to such effect. There was none in the Ministry's letter dated 5 August 2000 or the SPA.\n\n9.70.\n\nThus, the Tribunal returns to the Ministry's letter dated 5 August 2000 and the wording to which it relates, namely Article 21.1 of the SPA, as constituting a separate extra-contractual undertaking made by the Respondent under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\n9.71.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the effect of this undertaking was to preclude the Respondent, in the absence of good faith over the 25-year term of the SPA, from: (i) interfering with the rights under the SPA of the Buyer (UFACEX, later the Claimant); (ii) dictating or promulgating any act or regulation which could directly or indirectly affect the rights of the Buyer under the SPA; and (iii) affecting the capacity of the Buyer to perform its obligations under the SPA, even in the case of a shortage of natural gas in Egypt - subject to *force majeure* situations as defined in the SPA. Noncompliance in bad faith with the undertaking, assessed objectively, would amount to a breach of the Respondent's obligations under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\n9.72.\n\nThe proviso regarding *force majeure* in the Ministry's letter was clearly intended to protect the Respondent from responsibility for a situation where the performance of the SPA was suspended for *force majeure* under Article 15 of the SPA. It is complicated definition, albeit subject to specific conditions.\n\n9.73.\n\nFirst, as a matter of English, the proviso cannot swallow the Respondent's undertaking, so as to render it nugatory. It must be read (with Article 15 of the SPA) as being subordinate to the undertaking, *i.e.* as an exception limiting but not extinguishing the scope of the undertaking.\n\n9.74.\n\nSecond, Article 15.1 of the SPA provides that any \"force majeure\" event or circumstance must lie \"beyond the reasonable control of a Party or Parties (acting and having acted with a reasonable level of due diligence).\" It is a qualified protection. It would not be open to the Respondent to breach its undertaking so as to cause a *force majeure* event and then to assert *force majeure* as a defence under the FET standard.\n\n9.75.\n\nThird, Article 15.2 provides relief \"for so long as and to the extent\" that a \"force majeure\" event or circumstance exists. Its Sub-paragraph (A) provides similarly that the Seller is relieved from liability only (*inter alia*) \"for so long and to the extent that due to 'Force Majeure' [\u2026]. Seller is unable to make available the properly nominated quantity of NG in accordance with [the SPA].\" This is an important temporal limitation.\n\n9.76.\n\nFourth, Sub-paragraph (A) also provides that where a \"force majeure\" event or circumstance \"partially affects\" the Seller's obligations to supply natural gas, the Seller \"shall treat Buyer no worse than any other present or future purchasers of NG [...] including the event of shortage of NG.\" This is, again, an important limitation, excluding adverse discrimination in the supply of gas to the Buyer at times of shortage.\n\n9.77.\n\nFifth, by Article 15.3(b) of the SPA, \"force majeure\" does not include \"changes in market conditions [\u2026] that (i) [d]irectly or indirectly affect the demand for [\u2026] NG; (ii) [r]esult in the diversion of NG to other users; (iii) [a]re due to the inability of the transportation system and/or pipeline [\u2026] to meet consumer demand and/or Buyer demand.\" This is an important limitation as to the scope of *force majeure*.\n\n9.78.\n\nLastly, Article 15.4 requires a party seeking relief for \"force majeure\" to give prompt notice with relevant information, including \"full particulars of the Force Majeure event, its effects on the affected Party, and the remedial measures proposed.\" (It will be recalled that EGAS gave written notice of *force majeure* under Article 15.4 of the SPA on 31 January 2012 and 24 February 2013: see Part V above). For the purposes of this Award, the Tribunal assumes that such notice complied with the formal requirements of Article 15.4 of the SPA.\n\n9.79.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the Respondent' separate extra-contractual undertaking by the Ministry of Petroleum's letter dated 5 August 2000 extends, in accordance with its terms, only to the SPA (as amended subsequently). It does not extend, in accordance with its terms, to the EGAS or UFG Tolling Contracts or any other contractual agreements relating to the Damietta Plant. Neither of these Tolling Contracts existed at the time of the Ministry's letter, being agreed later on 30 June 2003.\n\n9.80.\n\nAt the time when the SPA was executed on 1 August 2000, the Buyer was UFACEX. Pursuant to Article 18 of the SPA, UFACEX assigned its rights to the Claimant on 30 June 2003. On 17 October 2002, EGPC gave notice that it had assigned (or novated) its rights and responsibilities under the SPA to EGAS, to be effective as from 1 August 2000.\n\n9.81.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, upon this \"assignment\" by UFACEX, the Claimant acquired the full benefits possessed by UFACEX in regard to the SPA, including the Ministry's letter of 5 August 2000 (addressed, in fact, not to UFACEX, but to Uni\u00f3n Fenosa). UFACEX was and remains the Claimant's sister company, within the Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Group of companies, with Spanish nationality. The Claimant was not, therefore, a stranger intervening in the Project. To the contrary, it had been involved in the Project from the beginning. The Claimant therefore stands in the shoes of UFACEX, as from 1 August 2000 onwards, in regard to the effect of the Ministry's letter dated 5 August 2000.\n\n9.82.\n\nAs a party to the SPA, the Claimant (with members of the Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Group) entered into long-term agreements to supply natural gas to Spanish power plants and other agreements to supply gas to Spanish industrial plants. It also proceeded to complete the Plant (with SEGAS), at a cost of US$ 1.4 billion.\n\n9.83.\n\nOn the evidence adduced in this arbitration, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant reasonably formed legitimate expectations based on the letter of 5 August 2000 from the Respondent's Ministry of Petroleum that, in the words of Article 21.1 of the SPA, the Respondent (*inter alia*) would not interfere with the rights of the Buyer under the SPA or dictate any act which could directly or indirectly affect the rights of the Buyer under the SPA, save for *force majeure* situations as defined in Article 15 of the SPA.\n\n9.84.\n\nThe Tribunal also concludes that the Claimant reasonably relied upon those expectations, to its subsequent considerable detriment. There can be no doubt that the Claimant has been almost ruined by the non-supply of natural gas under the SPA. From the time when the Plant's commercial operations began on 15 October 2006 to the end of 2010, the shortfall was 190 million BTUs;117 and from 2012 to 2014, the supply was too limited to comprise even a single cargo. The Damietta Plant has lain idle since 2014; and it remains idle to the present day.\n\nHeads of Agreement between EGAS and UFG, 23 November 2011, [C-0010].\n\n9.85.\n\n*The Tolling Contracts* : The Claimant next relies upon the two Tolling Contracts (i) between EGAS (as Toller) and SEGAS (as Owner) dated 30 June 2003118 and (ii) between SEGAS (as Owner) and the Claimant (as Toller) also dated 30 June 2003.119 The Claimant is not a party to the EGAS Tolling Contract. The Respondent is not a contractual party to either Tolling Contract.\n\nTolling Agreement between SEGAS and EGAS, 30 June 2003, [C-0003], to be later amended on (*inter alia*) 31 March 2004; Amendment No. 3 to the Tolling Contract between EGAS and SEGAS, 31 March 2004, [C-0174].\n\nTolling Contract between UFG and SEGAS, 30 June 2003, [C-0188], to be later amended on (*inter alia*) 31 March 2004; Amendment No. 3 to the Tolling Contract between UFG and SEGAS, [C-0173].\n\n9.86.\n\nIn theory, under these two Tolling Contracts, EGAS would supply feed gas for the Plant to SEGAS and, indirectly to the Claimant. These Tolling Contracts became effective on the date of the Plant's Commercial Start Date; namely 15 October 2006 (see Part V above).\n\n9.87.\n\nThe EGAS Tolling Contract has its own provisions on applicable law and dispute resolution. Article 11.1 provides for English law \"as its applicable law\". Article 11.3 provides for ICC arbitration in Paris. (It gave rise to the \"ICC Arbitration\" described above in Parts I and VI of this Award). As with the SPA, there is a provision on the waiver of sovereign immunity (Article 12); and a representation and warranty that SEGAS and EGAS were acting as principals and not therefore as agents of the Claimant or Respondent respectively (Article 13(f)). There is no provision similar to Article 21.1 of the SPA.\n\n9.88.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that the Tolling Contracts do not fall within the terms of the letter dated 5 August 2000 from the Ministry of Petroleum. Hence, the Claimant cannot make a direct claim for \"legitimate expectations\" under the FET standard in respect of these Tolling Contracts. (Indirectly, the Claimant claims US$ 404,745,000 as \"unpaid dividends\" payable by EGAS to the Claimant (as SEGAS's majority shareholder) derived, at least in material part, from tolling fees due, but unpaid, under the EGAS Tolling Contract). The Tribunal considers other aspects of this claim below.\n\n9.89.\n\n*SEGAS' Lost Free Zone Status:* SEGAS was granted its tax-free status in the Damietta Free Zone on 9 December 2001. That status was revoked on 5 May 2008. As with the Tolling Contracts, this claim for US$ 107 million does not, so the Tribunal decides, benefit from the Ministry's letter dated 5 August 2000; and it cannot therefore derive support from the Claimant's case on \"legitimate expectations\" under the FET standard. The Tribunal considers other aspects of this claim below.\n\n9.90.\n\n*Attribution* : It is appropriate to consider next the position of (i) the Respondent's executive branch and (ii) the positions of EGPC and EGAS under international law. As already indicated, the Tribunal here addresses the Parties' respective cases on the basis of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.120 These are generally accepted as authoritatively reflecting the principles of customary international law as they relate to attribution; as such, both the Claimant and the Respondent relied upon them in this arbitration; and the Tribunal is here content to do the same.\n\nJames Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], Article 4.\n\n9.91.\n\nArticle 4 of the ILC Articles, \"Conduct of Organs of a State,\" provides:\n\n*(1) The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central government or of a territorial unit of the State.*\n\n*(2) An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State.*\n\n9.92.\n\nAs to the Respondent's executive branch as an organ of the Respondent, no controversy arises as to attribution. Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility confirms that, under international law, the conduct of a State's executive branch shall be considered as an act of that State. Hence, the conduct of the Ministry of Petroleum, as with other Ministries and the Council of Ministers, is attributable to the Respondent.\n\n9.93.\n\nAccording to the ILC Commentary to Article 4, \"[t]he reference to a 'State organ' covers all the individual or collective entities which make up the organization of the State and act on its behalf. \"121 Of course, a State may become subject to obligations entered into on its behalf by entities other that organs of the State, but this is governed by general principles of the law of agency (not attribution).\n\nJames Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], 94, Comment (1).\n\n9.94.\n\nEntities considered to be organs automatically include \"any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the State. \"122 This normally excludes entities that enjoy separate legal personality under internal law.123 However, according to the ILC Commentary, \"the conduct of certain institutions performing public functions and exercising public powers (e.g. the police) is attributed to the State even if those institutions are regarded in internal law as autonomous and independent of the executive government.\"124\n\nJames Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], Article 4(2).\n\n*See* *Bayindir v. Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, 27 August 2009, [CL-0086], Paragraph 119 (holding that Pakistan's National Highway Authority was not a State organ, because of its separate legal personality under internal law); *EDF (Services) v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009, [CL-0038], Paragraph 190 (holding that a State-owned airport holding company and a State airline were not State organs because they both \"possess[ed] legal personality under Romanian law separate and distinct from that of the State.\"); *Hamester v. Ghana*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, [RL-0009], Paragraph 184 (holding that the Ghanaian Cocoa Board was not a State organ principally because it was \"not classified as a State organ under Ghanaian law, but was created as a 'corporate body,' which can be 'sued in its corporate name.'\"); *see also* James Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], 112, Comment (6) (\"Since corporate entities, although owned by and in that sense subject to the control of the State, are considered to be separate, prima facie their conduct in carrying out their activities is not attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of governmental authority within the meaning of article 5.\").\n\nJames Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], 92, Comment (6).\n\n9.95.\n\nThus, as the tribunal in *Almas v. Poland* (2016) decided: \"[I]nternal status does not necessarily imply that an entity is not a State organ if other factors, such as the performance of core governmental functions, direct day-to-day subordination to central government, or lack of all operational autonomy, point the other way.\"125\n\n*Almas v. Poland*, UNCITRAL, Award, 27 June 2016, [CL-0186], Paragraph 207.\n\n9.96.\n\nAt the same time, circumstances sufficient to connote the status of an organ of the State to a separate legal person must be extraordinary, involving functions and powers considered to be as quintessentially powers of Statehood, such as those exercised by police authorities. As the International Court of Justice stated in the *Bosnian Genocide Case* (2007), \"to equate persons or entities with State organs when they do not have that status under internal law must be exceptional, for it requires proof of a particularly great degree of State control over them, a relationship which the Court's Judgment quoted above expressly described as 'complete dependence'.\"126\n\n*Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro*, *I.C.J. Reports 2007*, p. 43, [RL-0049], Paragraph 393.\n\n9.97.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that EGPC is not considered to be an organ of the State under Egyptian law; and that it instead enjoys a separate legal personality under Egyptian law.127 The fact that it is wholly owned by the State is of no material consequence.128 Corporate state enterprises existing outside of the structure of the State are a common phenomenon.\n\nLaw No. 20 of 1976, [C-0126] (\"Article 1: Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation is a public authority having a juristic legal personality working for the development and best exploitation of petroleum resources, and providing for the country's needs of different petroleum products.\").\n\n*See* Abby Cohen Smutny, \"State Responsibility and Attribution, When is a State Responsible for Acts of States Enterprises? Maffezini v. Spain,\" in T. Weiler (ed), *International Investment Law and Arbitration: Leading Cases from the ICSID, NAFTA, Bilateral Treaties and Customary International Law* (2005), [CL-0065], 35 (\"State ownership is not sufficient to constitute a State organ, as a State may be a shareholder in a private law company.\"); *see also* James Crawford, *State Responsibility* (Cambridge University Press, 2013), [RL-0080], 118 (\"Mere ownership of an entity by a state, however, will not automatically convert that entity into an organ of the state.\").\n\n9.98.\n\nNor does the Tribunal consider the facts that EGPC is denominated by Egyptian law as a \"public authority\" and is statutorily part of the Egyptian \"Petroleum Sector\" that develops strategies for the natural gas sector to be sufficient to make it part of the structure of the State, and thus one of its organs under international law. Both State ownership of entities and their involvement in the development of State-owned natural resource necessarily implicate public sector concerns. But participation in the public sector is not the same thing as being integral to the State apparatus, as was decided by the tribunal in *Ulysseas v. Ecuador* (2012).129\n\n*See* Resp CM Merits, Paragraph 189 Footnote 443, citing *Ulysseas v. Ecuador*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 12 June 2012, [RL-0079], Paragraph 135 (\"The circumstances that the Entities are part of the Ecuadorian public sector and are subject to a system of controls by the State in view of the public interests involved in their capacity does not make them organs of the Ecuadorian State for the purposes of Article 4 of the ILC Articles.\").\n\n9.99.\n\nImplicating public concerns as they do, it is unsurprising that State-owned non-organs would be subject to State-run financial auditing under the same mechanism that applies to entities that are organs of the State. Nor is it dispositive that certain decisions of an entity are subject to oversight under administrative public law, as is alleged hereby the Claimant, especially if other decisions it takes are not.\n\n9.100.\n\nThese specific factors were considered by the *Ulysseas* tribunal, which did not find that they connoted the status of a State organ under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.130 Moreover, as the Respondent contends, there has been no proof that the conduct at issue here, namely EGPC's entering into the SPA, constituted an administrative law decision.131\n\n*See* *Ulysseas v. Ecuador*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 12 June 2012, [RL-0079], Paragraph 134 (\"All Entities are subject to a system of controls under the 1998 Constitution, which is exercised by the Office of the Comptroller General of Ecuador as to their revenues, expenses and investments and the utilization and custody of public property. The 2008 Constitution reinforced the public nature of the Entities by providing that they \"shall operate as companies subject to public law.\") (footnote omitted).\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 201.\n\n9.101.\n\nNor can EGPC's engagement in the development and exploitation of natural resources be considered as a purely governmental activity, as opposed to a commercial activity. It is uncontested between the Parties, as the Tribunal accepts, that EGPC has the power to contract in its own name and for its own account, as a principal, as it did with the SPA. It has an \"independent schematic budget prepared on the same pattern of commercial budgets\" and \"the Corporation funds are funds owned by the State private ownership.\"132 As the *Almas* tribunal decided, \"where an entity engages on its own account in commercial transactions, even if these are important to the national economy, this inference [that it is a *de facto* organ] will not be drawn.\"133\n\nLaw No. 20 of 1976, [C-0126] (\"Article 5: The financial year of the Corporation starts with the financial year of the State and ends with its end. And with taking into consideration the provisions of law No 53 for year 1973 about State General Budget, the corporation shall have an independent schematic budget prepared on the same pattern of commercial budgets, and the Corporation funds are funds owned by the State private ownership.\")\n\n*Almas v. Poland*, UNCITRAL, Award, 27 June 2016, [CL-0186], Paragraph 210.\n\n9.102.\n\nIn support of its case that EGPC's functions are governmental in nature,134 the Claimant contends that \"exporting natural gas in its natural state or liquefied, and its derivatives, to international markets\" is a \"sovereign function.\"135 But, whilst \"under the Egyptian Constitution, all minerals, including solid, liquid and gaseous resources, are the property of the [S]tate,\" as the Claimant points out,136 private companies manage private natural gas resources as a matter of course and, notwithstanding the fact that governmental export approval may be required, the act of exporting natural gas in any form is not, by its own nature, a sovereign act.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraphs 488 and 491.\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 285.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 495 (brackets in original).\n\n9.103.\n\nWhilst the Parties agree that the \"right to grant concessions [\u2026] is certainly a governmental function,\"137 requiring a decision by the President of the Republic and approval of the National Assembly,138 they differ on the role played by EGPC (and later by EGAS). The Claimant submits that EGPC and EGAS \"enter [\u2026] into concession contracts with producers\"139 and are \"the vehicle by which Egypt grants concession rights.\"140\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 495; Law No. 61 of 1958 on the Award of Concessions Relating to the Investments of Natural Resources and Public Utilities and the Amendment of the Concessions' Terms as amended by Law No. 152 of 1960, [R-0282].\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph135; Cl Rep Merits, Paragraph 170; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraph 32.\n\nRep Merits, Paragraph 283.\n\nRep Merits, Paragraph 283.\n\n9.104.\n\nAs already found by the Tribunal, the Government is a non-contractual party to the SPA and other agreements concluded by EGPC and EGAS. As the Respondent submits, the SPA itself is not a concession agreement, but a commercial agreement for the sale of natural gas.141 Indeed, the Claimant itself describes the SPA as among \"the contracts and *commercial* decisions and operations of [Egypt's] State-owned companies.\"142\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 200; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraph 160.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 17 (emphasis added) (\"The Government was, of course, free to undertake any of these policies, but having made representations and commitments to UFG that it would ensure the availability of sufficient gas for the next 25 years to ensure fulfillment of the contractual supply to UFG, the Government was required to comply with its commitments and to enable its State-owned companies to do so. Moreover, the Government was required not to interfere, in its sovereign capacity and for policy reasons, *with the contracts and commercial decisions and operations of its State-owned companies*. Yet, the Government did exactly this, by causing the diversion of gas supplies away from UFG and toward what it called the 'domestic market,' without offering or paying compensation to UFG.\") (emphasis here added).\n\n9.105.\n\nMoreover, whilst EGPC is \"owned by and *in that sense* subject to the control of the State,\"143 the Claimant has not proven with respect to EGPC a \"direct day-to-day subordination to central government, or lack of all operational autonomy,\" in the words of the *Almas* tribunal.144\n\n*See also* James Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], 112, Comment (6) (\"Since corporate entities, although owned by and in that sense subject to the control of the State, are considered to be separate, prima facie their conduct in carrying out their activities is not attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of governmental authority within the meaning of article 5.\")(emphasis added).\n\n*Almas v. Poland*, UNCITRAL, Award, 27 June 2016, [CL-0186], Paragraph 207; Cl Rep Merits 272.\n\n9.106.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the fact that EGPC's chairman and board members are designated by Government officials and that the board members appointed include Government officials. In the Tribunal's view, these factors are insufficient to show that EGPC is \"lacking any real autonomy\" and does not have at least \"some qualified, but real, margin of independence.\"145 Private parent corporations routinely appoint their officers as members of the boards of directors of their wholly-owned subsidiaries without thereby losing shareholder immunity from liability.\n\n*Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro*, *I.C.J. Reports 2007*,p. 43, [RL-0049], Paragraph 394.\n\n9.107.\n\nThe fact that decisions of EGPC's board of directors must be sent to the Minister of Petroleum for possible ratification, amendment or rescission does not show that the Minister actually used this authority (which is no different from a shareholder override in a privately owned corporation) to supervise EGPC's regular activities. For example, the tribunal in *Jan de Nul v. Egypt* (2008) declined to find that the Suez Canal Authority was an organ of the Egyptian State, despite the involvement of the Egyptian Government nearly identical to that alleged there.146\n\n*Jan de Nul v. Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13, Award, 6 November 2008, [CL-0022], Paragraph 146 (\"Applying a structural test, the Claimants put forward that (i) SCA is considered a 'Public Authority' by Egyptian law (Article 2, Paragraph 1 of Law No. 30/1975);(ii) SCA's Chairman, Directors of the Board, Managing Director and General Manager are all appointed by means of presidential decrees of the President of the Republic (who also decides on their salaries, their removal and their bonuses) (Article 3 of Law No. 30/1975); (iii) SCA reports to the Prime Minister, who must also approve all the decisions of its Board of Directors before they become effective (Article 2, Paragraph 2 and Article 3, Paragraph 2, of Law No. 30/1975); (iv) the charges collected by SCA are included in the Public Treasury Balance Sheet and SCA's accounts and balance sheets are supervised by the Central Auditing Department, the State organ exercising financial control over the administration of public funds (Article 5 of Law No. 30/1975); (v) all SCA's employees have the status of public officials (Article 13 of Law No. 30/1975); (vi) SCA is subject to the rules on public procurement which apply to ministries and State authorities (citation omitted); (vi) SCA's acts are subject to the judicial review of the administrative courts, whose jurisdiction is limited to disputes with the government and government entities\") (emphasis omitted); *see also* Paragraph 162 (\"For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the SCA is not an organ of the State, and that, as a consequence, its acts cannot be attributed to Egypt.\").\n\n9.108.\n\nThis conclusion gives context to EGPC's representation in the private offering memorandum to potential investors, relied upon by the Claimant, that it had \"the same legal status as the Central Bank of Egypt and the Suez Canal Authority.\" In the light of the decision in *Jan de Nul v. Egypt* (2008), that representation is consistent with the Respondent's submissions in this case. Indeed, notwithstanding the fact that, as the prospectus pointed out, EGPC was an \"economic authority\" and that \"[a]ll decisions of the Board of Directors are required to be notified to the Minister of Petroleum for approval,\" the offering memorandum expressly states in the same passage that \"[t]he Arab Republic of Egypt and the Egyptian Government, however, are not legally liable for EGPC's obligations to third parties unless expressly guaranteed. \"147\n\nOffering Memorandum for Petroleum Export Limited, 14 July 2005, [C-0125], Page 32.\n\n9.109.\n\nThe ICSID tribunal in *Ampal v. Egypt* (2017) came to a different conclusion with respect to EGPC's status as an organ of the Egyptian State within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles.148 That tribunal cited as reasons EGPC's designation as a \"public authority\" \"overseen by the Minister of Petroleum,\" with capital consisting of \"[f]unds allocated to it by the State\" and a chairman and board appointed by and partially consisting of Government officials, with the Minister of Petroleum \"empowered to amend or cancel [Board] resolutions.\"149 However, the decision does not explain why these factors show that EGPC is part of the structure of the State so as to deny its autonomous existence. Indeed, as noted earlier, these factors all have analogues in private companies that clearly do not have the effect of subjecting shareholders to liability for corporate obligations.\n\nTr. D1 74:15-19; *Ampal v. Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/11, Decision on Liability and Heads of Loss, 21 February 2017, [CL-0273], Paragraph 138.\n\n*Ampal v. Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/11, Decision on Liability and Heads of Loss, 21 February 2017, [CL-0273], Paragraph 138 (brackets in original).\n\n9.110.\n\nIn addition, as regards Article 4 of the ILC Articles, the *Ampal* award is distinguishable from the circumstances of this case. The transaction at issue there arose from an earlier agreement between the States of Israel and Egypt. A Council of Ministers' resolution in furtherance of that inter-State agreement expressly \"[a]uthorize[d] the Ministry of Petroleum *represented by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation* to negotiate [\u2026] and conclude the contract.\"150 An agency relationship binds a State as principal whether or not the agent (EGPC) is an organ of the State. Here, as the Tribunal has already decided, EGPC was expressly acting as a principal and not as an agent for the Respondent in concluding the SPA.\n\n*Ampal v. Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/11, Decision on Liability and Heads of Loss, 21 February 2017, [CL-0273], Paragraph 141.\n\n9.111.\n\nFor this same reason, in the Tribunal's view, the Claimant's reliance on the award in *Wintershall v. Qatar* (1989) is misplaced.151 While the tribunal there agreed with the claimant's argument in that contractual case that, \"[a]s a matter of Qatari law it is clear that QGPC operates as *an arm or agent* of the Government in respect of the concession areas held by it,\"152 its dispositive conclusion was that \"QGPC was acting as an agent of the Government of Qatar and, therefore, all actions attributed to QGPC in this case must be attributed to the Government,\"153 and that \"[t]he mere fact that QGPC is acting as agent for the Government, rather than the Government itself so acting, does not in any sense take away from the Tribunal's jurisdiction in this case.\"154 Again, here, EGPC was not acting as the Respondent's agent in concluding the SPA.\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 275.\n\n*Wintershall v. Qatar*, Final Award, 5 February 1988 and 31 May 1988, 28 ILM 795 (1989), [CL-0188], 812 (emphasis added).\n\n*Wintershall v. Qatar*, Final Award, 5 February 1988 and 31 May 1988, 28 ILM 795 (1989), [CL-0188], 811.\n\n*Wintershall v. Qatar*, Final Award, 5 February 1988 and 31 May 1988, 28 ILM 795 (1989), [CL-0188], 812.\n\n9.112.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that EGPC was not an organ of the Egyptian State with respect to the SPA, within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The same reasoning applies to EGAS (as EGPC's \"assignee\" in October 2002), on materially similar facts. Thus, EGAS was not an organ of the Respondent under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.\n\n9.113.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to Article 5 of the ILC Articles, \"Conduct of Persons or Entities exercising Elements of Governmental Authority.\" It provides:\n\n*The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under Article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.*\n\n9.114.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant's case is separately advanced by Article 5 of the ILC Articles in regard to EGPC and EGAS. The Claimant has not established that EGPC or EGAS are \"empowered\" by Egyptian law to exercise governmental authority. As the ILC Commentary explains, \"the internal law in question must specifically authorize the conduct as involving the exercise of public authority; it is not enough that it permits activity as part of the general regulation of the affairs of the community. It is accordingly a narrow category.\" The ILC Commentary also states that a situation falling within Article 5 \"is to be distinguished from situations where an entity acts under the direction or control of the State, which [i] covered by Article 8.\"155 The Tribunal has not been shown any provision of Egyptian law 'specifically authorising' EGPC to conclude the SPA in the exercise of the Respondent's public authority.\n\nJames Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], 101-102, Comment (7).\n\n9.115.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore turns to Article 8 of the ILC Articles, \"Conduct Directed or Controlled by a State.\" It provides:\n\n*The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.*\n\n9.116.\n\nUnder Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the conduct of a person (not being an organ of the State) shall be considered an act of a State under international law if the person is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the conduct. Its application, as the ILC Commentary states, depends upon \"a specific factual relationship\" between the person engaging in the conduct and the State.156 The ILC Commentary addresses the position of state entities, as follows: \"[\u2026] The fact that a State initially establishes a corporate entity [\u2026] is not a sufficient basis for the attribution to the State of the subsequent conduct of that entity.\"157 Moreover, there is a distinction to be drawn between the conduct of the State itself and the conduct of a person attributable to the State, as was held by the ICJ in *Nicaragua v. USA*.158\n\nJames Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], 110, Comment (1).\n\nJames Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], 112, Comment (6).\n\n*Nicaragua v. USA*, *I.C.J. Reports 1986*, p. 14.\n\n9.117.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant's case is advanced by Article 8 of the ILC Articles in regard to EGPC's conclusion of the SPA. The factors identified above in regard to Article 4 of the ILC Articles apply equally to Article 8.\n\n9.118.\n\nThe position in regard to EGAS is different, following the \"assignment\" between EGPC and EGAS on 17 October 2002. Thereafter, as regards the curtailment in the supply of natural gas to the Damietta Plant, the Tribunal considers that EGAS did act on the instructions of and under the control and direction of the Respondent, namely its Ministry of Petroleum, within the meaning of Article 8 of the ILC Articles. As to that factual relationship, the Tribunal addresses EGAS' role further below.\n\n9.119.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, in the *Ampal* award, the tribunal likewise decided (*inter alia*) that EGAS, in regard to the termination of its agreement to export natural gas to Israel, did act under the direction and control of the Respondent, within the meaning of Article 8 of the ILC Articles:159\n\n*The Tribunal finds that there is overwhelming evidence that the decisions of EGPC and EGAS to conclude and terminate the GSPA were all taken with the blessing of the highest levels of the Egyptian Government. Such acts are attributable to the Respondent pursuant to Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility as EGPC and EGAS were 'in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of' the Respondent in relation to the particular conduct.*\n\n*Ampal v. Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/11, Decision on Liability and Heads of Loss, 21 February 2017, [CL-0273], Paragraph 146.\n\n9.120.\n\nThe Claimant also invokes Article 11 of the ILC Articles, \"Conduct Acknowledged and Adopted by a State.\" It provides:\n\n*Conduct which is not attributable to a State under the preceding articles shall nevertheless be considered an act of that State under international law if and to the extent that the State acknowledges and adopts the conduct in question as its own.*\n\n9.121.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that Article 11 of the ILC Articles in regard to EGPC and EGAS separately advances the Claimant's case. As the ILC Commentary explains, there is a difference between \"acknowledgment and adoption of the conduct in question as its own\" and \"cases of mere support or endorsement\" by the State; and that what is required is that \"the State identifies the conduct in question and makes it its own.\"160 That was not so in regard to EGPC's conclusion of the SPA, by reason of the factors identified above in regard to Article 4 of the ILC Articles. As regards EGAS' performance of the SPA following the \"assignment\" in 2002, the matter is covered by Article 8 of the ILC Articles to be addressed (on the facts).\n\nJames Crawford, *The ILC's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (Cambridge University Press, 2002), [CL-0185], Article 11.\n\n9.122.\n\n*Breach:* It is appropriate to address separately the Claimant's several claims that the Respondent breached the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty; namely: (i) the curtailed supply of natural gas to the Damietta Plant under the SPA; (ii) the nonpayment of fees due to SEGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract; and (iii) the loss of SEGAS' Free Zone tax status.\n\n9.123.\n\n*(i) Gas Supply:* Under the SPA, the \"Commercial Operations Date\" of the Damietta Plant occurred on 15 October 2006. There were, almost immediately, shortages in the supply of gas to the Plant, leading to the Claimant's letter to EGAS dated 26 January 2007, followed by the Claimant's further letter dated 29 May 2007. Shortages continued, leading to the first draft Side Letter of 11 July 2008 between the Claimant and EGAS. The problem was not resolved, leading to the Claimant's letter dated 26 August 2008 and the meeting with the Minister of Petroleum on 16 October 2008. All this took place before the Global Financial Crisis and long before the Egyptian revolution.\n\n9.124.\n\nThese shortages of feed gas to the Plant continued in 2009 to 2010. In late 2008, the Global Financial Crisis had begun. In early 2011, the Egyptian revolution began. Neither affected the Damietta Plant physically (then or later). Shortages continued as from 2010 onwards, as described in Part V above. On 31 January 2012 and 24 February 2013, EGAS sent to the Claimant notices of *force majeure* under Article 15 of the SPA.\n\n9.125.\n\nDuring this period, the Claimant (with SEGAS) regularly complained to EGAS, EGPC and the Ministry of Petroleum: see the former's letters and email messages dated 13 January 2010, 26 January 2010, 26 January 2010, 16 February 2010 (with the meetings on 16 March and 15 April 2010), 27 April 2010, 6 August 2010, 3 December 2010 (with the draft HOA of 23 February 2011), 13 August 2011, 4 November 2011 (with the HOA of 23 November 2011 and the meeting of 27 February 2012), 15 March2012, 8 May 2012, 22-29 May 2012, 11 June 2012, 28 June 2012, 15 July 2012, 25 July 2012, 26 August 2012, 9 October 2012 (following the meeting with the Minister of Petroleum on 16 September 2012), 17 October 2012, 6 November 2012, 15 November 2012, 16 November, 5 December 2012 (following the meeting with the Minister of Investment on 14 November 2012 and the Minister of Petroleum on 27 November 2012), 10 December 2012 and 12 December 2012. It is unnecessary here to recite the terms and contract of these communications: these are set out, to the extent relevant, in Part V above.\n\n9.126.\n\nAs already found by the Tribunal, the Claimant has been almost ruined by the nonsupply of natural gas to the Claimant under the SPA; and the Damietta Plant has become a \"white elephant.\" The Tribunal identifies two overlapping phases of this curtailed supply for natural gas feeding the Plant.\n\n9.127.\n\nThe first phase from early 2010 originated from the Respondent's own policies. As described more fully in Part VIII above, these were long-standing policies of subsidising domestic users of gas and electricity, together with the failure to encourage the finding of gas deposits in Egypt (notwithstanding a statement of policy otherwise). Beginning before 2010, the Respondent over-stimulated local demand for natural gas by providing subsidies to consumers of gas and electricity (generated from gas) and by encouraging local industries to convert to gas; and, on the supply side, by pricing and other policies that restricted the further development by local gas producers of Egypt's natural gas resources.\n\n9.128.\n\nThe results were foreseeable and actually foreseen in the Wood Mackenzie report of 28 May 2007 on SEGAS' Damietta LNG Financing (see Part V above). It identified (inter alia) a \"supply-demand gap\" emerging in the short term (2009-2010) unless \"progress is made on signing upstream GSAs and sanctioning new development projects this year [2007].\" The Respondent chose not to encourage the finding and development of further gas deposits in Egypt; and, as a result, together with its policies on subsidising domestic users of gas and gas-produced electricity, the curtailment of feed gas to the Damietta Plant was inevitable.\n\n9.129.\n\nThese consequences were acknowledged by the Minister of Petroleum. In his public address on 24 March 2014, the Minister recognised that there was in Egypt an \"irrational consumption due to subsidy.\"161 That \"irrationality\" had begun after the SPA's execution with the Ministry's strategy to focus on the local demand for natural gas and give it \"absolute priority.\"162 It was not reasonable foreseeable, nor actually foreseen by UFACEX (or the Claimant) in August 2000.\n\n\"The Oil and Gas Sector in Egypt: Vision and Challenges\" - Speech (unofficial transcript) of Sherif Ismail, Egyptian Minister of Petroleum at the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, 24 March 2014, [C-0192].\n\nEGAS Annual Report 2010-2011, [C-0350], Page 5; El Mahdy WS2, Paragraph 5.\n\n9.130.\n\nAs to this first phase, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent frustrated the Claimant's legitimate expectations derived from the Ministry of Petroleum's undertaking in regard to the SPA, in the form of its letter dated 5 August 2000.\n\n9.131.\n\nThe second phase began with EGAS notice of *force majeure* on 24 February 2013. Before that date, the Respondent had decided to discriminate between users of gas. Exercising its sovereign authority and public powers, the Respondent directed EGAS to limit and eventually stop the supply of feed gas under the SPA to the Damietta Plant. The Respondent's decision to discriminate against the Plant placed an excessive and disproportionate burden on the Claimant, in comparison to other non-consumer users of gas supplied by EGAS in Egypt, both Egyptian and Non-Egyptian.\n\n9.132.\n\nIn his speech to the Egyptian Parliament on 15 October 2012, the Minister for Petroleum explained that the Respondent had stopped the exporting of gas to Jordan and Spain \"because of increasing consumption in the domestic market.\"163 The reference to Spain clearly indicated the Claimant's exports to Spain from the Damietta Plant: it was the only exporter of Egyptian natural gas to Spain.\n\n\"Petroleum Minister: Gas Exports to Jordan, Spain Halted,\" *Egypt Independent* (15 October 2012), [C-0286].\n\n9.133.\n\nThere had earlier been a meeting between the Claimant and the Minister of Petroleum on 16 September 2012, in response to the Claimant's letter dated 26 August 2012. The meeting is described in the testimony of Mr Egea Krauel and Mr S\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez,164 as also in the Claimant's contemporary letter dated 21 September 2012. The Minister stated that he was \"in the process of reviewing the situation of every exporter [of natural gas]\" (including the Claimant), and that he was \"analysing the contractual frameworks and the legal conditions for stopping gas deliveries to one consumer in order to improve supply to other gas users.\" As recited in Part V, Mr Egea Krauel testified that the Claimant realised from the Minister's statements that \"UFG had been singled out as the offtaker of gas from the grid whose supply would be indefinitely interrupted.\"\n\nEgea Krauel WS, Paragraphs 21-22; S\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez WS1, Paragraph 25; Letter from UFG (Jos\u00e9 Maria Egea Krauel and Cesare Cuniberto) to Minister of Petroleum (Sherif Ismail), 5 December 2013 [C-0085].\n\n9.134.\n\nFollowing this meeting and the absence of any material response from the Ministry of Petroleum, the Claimant's letter dated 9 October 2012 to the Minister stated (*inter alia*) as follows:\n\n*UFG expresses concern to EGAS about EGAS' discriminatory treatment of UFG in the supply of gas. As we had the opportunity to discuss in such meetings, UFG is deeply worried because of the current situation of the feed gas supply to Damietta Plant since, despite of our constant spirit of cooperation, the actual level of supply in the past few months has been considerably lower than EGAS commitments in previous meetings and tremendously below the contractual volumes under the SPA and the agreed Minimum Feed Gas Commitment for the period. Far from improving, the situation has further deteriorated to the point that no supply of gas has been delivered to the Damietta Plant since 16 July 2012, as explained in more detail below. Furthermore, this shortage of supply represents a clear discriminatory measure against UFG by EGAS and the Egyptian authorities, as evidenced by the fact that the supply of gas has not been interrupted to other consumers (such as, for example, the liquefaction plant in Idku)* [...]\n\n9.135.\n\nThe Damietta Plant was shut down in early November 2013, for want of feed gas. Subsequent public and private statements by the Minister of Petroleum further confirmed that the Damietta Plant had been targeted by the Respondent in favour of supplying gas to other users and consumers in Egypt, both Egyptian and NonEgyptian.\n\n9.136.\n\nAs reported in the press on 24 November 2013, the Minister of Petroleum stated that, as regards \"the Spanish Union Fenosa,\" \"we should first cover [the] local market's need from natural gas.\"165 In a private meeting with the Claimant on 26 November 2013, so Mr Egea Krauel and Mr S\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez testified (as also confirmed in the Claimant's letter dated 5 December 2013 to the Minister), the Minister said that Egypt will in fact not comply with its obligations in the near future and that \"he could not give us any gas because the Ministry had to prioritize the gas to power generation plants throughout the country, as well as other industrial consumers.\"166\n\n\"Petroleum minister: Butane distribution to be revised,\" *Al Gomhouria* (24 November 2013), [C-0280].\n\nS\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez WS1, Paragraph 37; Egea Krauel WS, Paragraph 34; Letter from UFG (Jos\u00e9 Maria Egea Krauel and Cesare Cuniberto) to Minister of Petroleum (Sherif Ismail), 5 December 2013 [C-0085].\n\n9.137.\n\nAs the Claimant correctly concluded, it was politically more expedient for the Respondent to curtail and cut supply to one large consumer (*i.e.* the Claimant) than to apportion a reduction of supply across different users equitably.\n\n9.138.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, as regards both phases, the Respondent's decisions to cut and curtail gas supply to the Damietta Plant was, by its nature and purpose, a sovereign act by the Respondent under international law. It was also, of course, a political decision by the Respondent in the broadest sense. It was not a decision required by Egyptian law; and it was not a commercial or operational decision originating with EGAS. It was, in fact, a decision against EGAS' commercial interest, given the higher prices under the SPA and the lower prices for the subsidised Egyptian electricity sector. Nor was the decision the enforced result of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008 or the Egyptian revolution during 2011-2014: the decision would have been made without these events or their consequences, given the Respondent's earlier long-term policies on the development of new gas field, compounded by gas subsidies favouring domestic users, well established before 2010.\n\n9.139.\n\nAs regards the Respondent's undertaking by reference to Article 15 of the SPA, the Respondent's discrimination against the Damietta Plant conflicted with the definition of *force majeure* in Article 15.2, Sub-paragraph (A) of the SPA, precluding discriminatory treatment compared to \"any other present or future purchaser/s [sic] of LNG\".\n\n9.140.\n\nThe fact of such discrimination was established by the expert testimony from Mr Goncalves (of BRG) in this arbitration. He analysed four different categories of gas users in Egypt: (i) industrial plants; (ii) power plants; (iii) LNG exporters of Egyptian LNG; and (iv) pipeline exporters of Egyptian gas. He concluded that the curtailment of gas to the Damietta Plant began first, lasted longer and was the most severe.\n\n9.141.\n\nFrom a total of 58.8 Bcma supplied in 2012-2013, the power plants received 28.9 Bcma; industrial customers 14.8 Bcma; the Idku Plant 5.7 Bcma; and the Damietta Plant 0.3 Bcma.167 As regards LNG and Pipeline export curtailments from 2006 to 2011, the Damietta Plant's supply was curtailed by 60.5%, the Idku Plant by 6.6% and the pipelines by 22.7%.168\n\nBRG ER1, Figure 24, Annex B-16, with Annex B-3.\n\nBRG ER2, Technical Annex.\n\n9.142.\n\nDuring the same period, the Damietta Plant's supply of gas was curtailed by 96%, whereas foreign-owned industrial plants were curtailed by 15% to 34%; namely EFC (Netherlands) as to 28%, EBIC (Netherlands) as to 34%, Emethanex (Canada) as to 25%, and Lafarge (France) as to 15%.169 As to Egyptian-owned industries, there were no curtailments or only minor curtailments; namely Alexandria FC none prior to 2014, Misr FPC none before mid-2014, Helwan FC none prior to mid-2015; Misr BSC minor disruptions prior to late 2013, and SVC minor disruptions also prior to late 2013.170\n\nBRG ER1, Table 7.\n\nBRG ER1, Table 8.\n\n9.143.\n\nThe Respondent's conduct also conflicted with the exclusion from *force majeure*, under Article 15.3 of the SPA, of \"market conditions\" and suspensions of an indefinite period extending beyond *force majeure* situations.\n\n9.144.\n\nThus, by reason of these three factors, the Respondent is not entitled to relief from liability under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty based upon the proviso regarding *force majeure* subsumed by the letter dated 5 August 2000 from the Ministry of Petroleum.\n\n9.145.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, over these two phases of limited and non-supply of natural gas to the Plant, the Respondent's conduct failed to meet its obligations under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty, taking into account as a relevant factor the legitimate expectations generated by the Respondent's undertaking in the form of the Ministry of Petroleum's letter dated 5 August 2000, as described above. The Respondent's undertaking is the decisive tipping factor in establishing the Respondent's breach of Article 4(1) of the Treaty. In the Tribunal's view, it colours the Respondent's conduct as an exercise lacking good faith or, in the words of *Merrill v. Canada* (2010) conduct that was materially\"unjust\", \"discriminatory\" and \"unfair.\"\n\n9.146.\n\nIn the absence of such an undertaking, the Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant has established on the evidence before this Tribunal any other violation of Articles 3(1), 4(1), 4(2) or 4(5) of the Treaty. The Respondent's conduct (by itself and by EGAS attributable to the Respondent), absent this tipping factor, does not meet the exacting test for a violation of the FET standard, as decided in *Merrill v. Canada* (2010) and other legal materials cited by the Parties. In any event, having found the Respondent liable under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty on the basis of the Ministry's letter dated 5 August 2000, it would be otiose for the Tribunal to address these other claims by the Claimant: their grounds can add nothing material to the Respondent's liability under the FET standard under Article 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\n9.147.\n\n*(ii) Lost Dividends:* The Claimant claims a total principal sum of US$ 404,745,000 for injury in the form of \"Lost Dividends\" as a shareholder in EGAS resulting from the non-payment of tolling fees by EGAS to SEGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract. This loss was indirectly consequential (at last in in material part) upon EGAS' curtailment of feed gas to the Damietta Plant under the SPA. In principle, subject to issues of compensation considered later in Part X this Award, the Tribunal decides that this claim succeeds as regards a technical breach of the Respondent's undertaking (in the form of the Ministry of Petroleum's letter dated 5 August 2000) of the FET standard under Article 4(1) of the Treaty.\n\n*(iii) The Free Zone Claim* : The Claimant claims a total principal sum of US$ 107 million for injury suffered from the revocation of SEGAS' Free Zone status on 5 May 2008, by the Law No. 114.\n\n9.149.\n\nAs recited in Part V, SEGAS held a licence to operate \"as a private Free Zone Company\" under Egyptian Law, namely Law No. 8 of 1997 on Investment Guarantees and Incentives.171 Under Article 35 of Law No 8, profits and dividends of projects established in Free Zones \"shall not be subject to the provisions of Egyptian tax and regulations.\"172 SEGAS acquitted its licence on 9 December 2001.173\n\nInvestment Guarantees and Incentives Law No. 8 of 1997, [C-0109].\n\nInvestment Guarantees and Incentives Law No. 8 of 1997, [C-0109].\n\nDecision of the Director of GAFI No. 3336 of 2001 regarding a License for the Spanish Egyptian Gas Company (SEGAS) to Carry out its Activities in accordance to the Private Free Zone Regime, 9 December 2001, [R-0075].\n\n9.150.\n\nUnder Law No 114 of 2008, the Respondent revoked all Free Zone licences and tax exemptions for companies in the natural gas industry.174 As a result, SEGAS suffered losses from increased taxes and the Claimant, so it submits, suffered consequential losses of US$ 107 million.\n\nLaw No. 114 of 2008, regarding the Opening of Two Additional Funds in the General Budget of the Financial Year 2007/2008, [R-0080], Article 11.\n\n9.151.\n\nThe revocation of Free Zone licences did not target SEGAS. Such revocation was applied generally to licence holders, following a budgetary decision by the Respondent to increase national wages. SEGAS had no agreement with the Respondent or its agencies for stabilisation of the tax regime. There was no guarantee, under Egyptian law or the Treaty, that the tax regime in the zone would remain forever unchanged during the 25-year term of the SPA.\n\n9.152.\n\nAs decided by the ICSID tribunal in *El Paso v. Argentina* (2011),175 \"Such a standard of behaviour, if strictly applied, is not realistic, nor is it the [Treaty]'s purpose that States guarantee that the economic and legal conditions in which investments take place will remain unaltered *ad infinitum*.\" The UNCITRAL tribunal in *Encana Corp. v. Ecuador* (2006) came to a similar conclusion: \"In the absence of a specific commitment from the host State, the foreign investor has neither the right nor any legitimate expectation that the tax regime will not change, perhaps to its disadvantage, during the period of the investment.\"176\n\n*El Paso v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 31 October 2011, [CL-0075], Paragraph 350.\n\n*Encana Corp. v. Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN 3481, Award, 3 February 2006, [CL-0015].\n\n9.153.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the revocation of SEGAS' licence was not discriminatory or otherwise a breach of the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty or of Articles 3(1), 4(2) or 4(5) of the Treaty. The Respondent's undertaking in regard to the SPA by the Ministry's letter of 5 August 2015 to the Claimant did not extend to SEGAS's tax status. That status, subsequently acquired by a licence was independent from the supply of gas to the Damietta Plant under the SPA. In short, there was no \"legitimate expectation\" by the Respondent, still less SEGAS, that SEGAS's tax status would not be changed.\n\n9.154.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimant's Free Zone Claim under the Treaty incurred as a result of the revocation of SEGAS' tax status as a Free Zone company.\n\n(5) Summary of Decisions\n------------------------\n\n9.155.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, subject to further issues addressed in the following Parts of this Award, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant established the liability of the Respondent for breach of its obligations under the FET standard in Article 4(1) the Treaty, in regard to certain of its claims made by reference to Respondent's undertaking by its Ministry of Petroleum's letter dated 5 August 2000.\n\n9.156.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant established the liability of the Respondent for breach of its obligations under the FET standard in Article 4(1) the Treaty, absent the Respondent's said undertaking.\n\n9.157.\n\nThe Tribunal dismisses as to liability under the Treaty the Claimant's Free Zone Claim in the sum of US$ 107 million.\n\n9.158.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal thinks it unnecessary to address the Claimant's case under Articles 3(1), 4(2) and 4(5) of the Treaty, which cannot affect any of the decisions summarized above.\n\nPART X: THE COMPENSATION ISSUES\n-------------------------------\n\n(1) Introduction\n----------------\n\n10.1.\n\nIn this Part X of the Award, the Tribunal summarises the Parties' respective submissions and applies the legal principles applicable to an award of compensation under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty and international law. The Claimants advances four alternative case as to compensation, all of which are put in issue by the Respondent.\n\n10.2.\n\n*Primary Case* : As to its primary case, the Claimant claims compensation for the period from 2006 to 2015 in the total principal amount of US$ 3,219,458,000 (before interest). This amount comprises: (I) US$ 2,814,713,000 as \"Nominal Lost Cash Flows on Contractual Rights,\" *i.e.* incremental costs from the non-delivery of natural gas under the SPA; and (II) US$ 404,745,000 for \"Lost Dividends\" as a shareholder in SEGAS.1\n\nNavigant ER2, Page 72, Table 23 (incremental costs, lost profits and lost SEGAS dividends).\n\n10.3.\n\nThe Claimant's incremental costs under (I), against a \"but for\" delivery of natural gas from the Seller under the SPA totalling 1,312 trillion BTUs between 2006 and 2015, comprise: (i) US$ 678 million for increased operating costs from 547 trillion BTUs of gas delivered in Egypt; (ii) US$ 1,745 billion for increased costs to purchase 459 trillion BTUs replacement gas for gas not delivered in Egypt; (iii) US$ 613 million for 306 trillion BTUs for losses from 306 trillion BTUs of gas not delivered in Egypt and not replaceable by the Claimant; and (iv) US$ 107 million from the loss of SEGAS' Free Zone status, based on \"the nominal international damages claim of US$ 3.2 billion.\"2\n\nTr. D1 156:13-14.\n\n10.4.\n\nAs regards the latter claim for US$ 107 million, the Tribunal has decided that the Respondent is not liable under the Treaty for such claim. Accordingly, this claim is not considered as regards compensation in this Part X of the Award.\n\n10.5.\n\nAs to (i) increased operating costs, these comprised: (a) the cost of gas under the SPA; and (b) shipping expenses and losses.3\n\nNavigant ER2, Appendix C.1.4 (updated).\n\n10.6.\n\nAs to (ii) increased costs to purchase replacement gas, these costs resulted from prices generally higher than the costs of gas under the SPA.4 These costs are not advanced as a claim for lost profits but as \"direct damages.\"5 (They were originally incurred, in part, by UFGC as addressed below.)\n\nNavigant ER2, Appendices C.7.a, D.2 andF.1 (updated).\n\nTr. D1 149-152.\n\n10.7.\n\nAs to (iii) gas not delivered in Egypt and not replaceable, the losses are calculated by reference to the Claimant's increased unit costs resulting from non-deliveries of gas measured against the volume of gas which should have been delivered under the SPA.6\n\nTr.

D1 143-145.\n\n10.10.\n\n*First Alternative Case:* In its first alternative case, the Claimant claims compensation in the total principal amount of US$ 2,826,868,000 (before interest). This amount comprises: (i) US$ 2,422,123,000 as \"Nominal Lost Cash Flows on Contractual Rights,\" *i.e.* for the non-delivery of natural gas under the SPA (but here excluding \"lost profits\" in the amount of US$ 613 million); and (ii) the same US$ 404,745,000 for \"Lost Dividends\" as a shareholder in SEGAS.8\n\nNavigant ER2, Page 79, Table 25 (as updated).\n\n10.11.\n\n*Second Alternative Case:* In its second alternative case, the Claimant claims compensation in the total principal amount of US$ 2,580,991,000 (before interest). This amount excludes from the Claimant's primary case losses by UFGC, if not suffered by the Claimant under international law (contrary to the Claimant's submission).9\n\nNavigant, ER2, Page 78,Table 24.\n\n10.12.\n\n*Third Alternative Case:* In its third alternative case, the Claimant claims compensation in the total principal amount of US$ 2,418,036,000 (before interest). This amount is calculated by reference to the limiting terms of the SPA as to compensation for \"lost profits\" etc. It comprises: (i) US$ 2,013,291,000 as the Claimant's \"Lost Cash Flows\";10 and (ii) US$ 404,745,000 as the Claimant's \"Lost Dividends\" (as a shareholder in SEGAS). It excludes the Claimant's claim for US$ 107 million for loss of SEGAS' Free Zone status. It also excludes losses suffered by UFGC prior to June 2013; but it includes the Claimant's own \"incremental costs passed on by UFGC to UFG\" from June 2013 onwards in the amount of US$ 291,894,832.11\n\nNavigant ER2, Page 80, Table 26.\n\nNavigant ER2, Page 79,Table 25 (as updated) and Appendix C.1.4; as explained by the Claimant: Tr. D1,139 and 167-172.\n\n10.13.\n\nThe Claimant acknowledged that it is not entitled to \"double-recovery\" for amounts awarded in the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations. As it acknowledged in its written pleadings:\n\n*To the extent that UFG receives an award in the commercial arbitrations that provides damages sought in this arbitration, this Tribunal may deduct such an amount from its award in order to remove the possibility of double-recovery. Similarly, to the extent this Tribunal awards damages before the conclusion of the commercial cases, EGAS may seek an offset in any award issued by the commercial tribunals.*12\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 430 (Page 208), Footnote 762.\n\n10.14.\n\nThe Tribunal summarises the Parties' respective cases on compensation below. The Tribunal emphasises, again, that these summaries are necessarily abbreviations of the Parties' respective full cases on compensation.\n\n(2) The Claimant's Case\n-----------------------\n\n10.15.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant submits that it is entitled to full compensation, according to the principles established in the PCIJ's decision in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* (1928).13\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraphs 582-584; Cl Rep Merits, Paragraph 472 (Page 204); *Chorz\u00f3w Factory*, PCIJ Rep Series A No 17 (1928), [CL-0094], Paragraph 47.\n\n10.16.\n\nIn that case, the Permanent Court of International Justice expressed the general principle of compensation as follows: \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\" The Permanent Court of International Justice also noted that \"the compensation due [\u2026] is not necessarily limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession, plus interest to the day of payment.\"\n\n10.17.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* standard was adopted by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in *Amoco v. Iran* (1987):14\n\n*According to the Court in Chorz\u00f3w Factory, an obligation of reparation of all the damages sustained by the owner of expropriated property arises from an unlawful expropriation. The rules of international law relating to international responsibility of States apply in such a case. They provide for restitutio in integrum: restitution in kind, or if impossible, its monetary equivalent. If need be, 'damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution' should also be awarded.*\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 584, citing *Amoco v. Iran*, 15 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 189, Partial Award No. 310-56-3, 14 July 1987, [CL-0097], Paragraphs 189, 191-193.\n\n10.18.\n\nThe same standard was applied by the Tribunal in *MTD v. Chile* (2004)15 and in several other decisions.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraphs 585-588, citing *MTD v. Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Award, 25 May 2004, [CL-0011], Paragraph 238.\n\n10.19.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* standard of compensation has been applied with respect to treaty violations, other than expropriation. Specifically, it was applied to a violation of the obligation to provide full protection and security, as in *AAPL v Sri Lanka* :16\n\n*Both parties are equally in agreement about the principle, according to which, in case of property destruction, the amount of the compensation due has to be calculated in a manner that adequately reflects the full value of the investment lost as a result of said destruction and the damages incurred as a result thereof.*\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 586, citing *AAPL v. Sri Lanka*, ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Award, 27 June 1990, [CL-0098], Paragraph 88.\n\n10.20.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the decision in *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas v. Argentina* (2007), where the tribunal decided that it was generally accepted that \"regardless of the nature of the illegitimate measure, the level of damages awarded in international investment arbitration is supposed to be sufficient to compensate the affected party fully and to eliminate the consequences of the state's action.\"17\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 587, citing Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, [CL-0021], Paragraph 8.2.7,\n\n10.21.\n\nFinally, the Claimant cites the decision of the Annulment Committee in Azurix v. Argentina (2009), as determining that the Tribunal has a discretion in determining what approach it should take as to damages.18\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 588, citing Azurix v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Annulment Decision, 1 September 2009, [CL-0099], Paragraph 332.\n\n10.22.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the application of the Chorz\u00f3w Factory standard to the present case means that it is entitled to compensation representing the cash flows that the Claimant's investment would have generated had the Respondent not violated the Treaty by curtailing and then stopping the supply of gas to the Damietta Plant, and by depriving SEGAS of its status as a tax-free company in the Damietta Free Zone.19 In particular, the Claimant contends that it is entitled to compensation under the following headings:20\n\n(i) Lost cash flows arising from its failure to receive, and therefore inability to on-sell, gas to which it was entitled under the SPA from 2006 to 2015; and\n\n(ii) Dividends it would have received from SEGAS had the Damietta Plant received the gas it should have received under the SPA, with the EGAS and UFG Tolling Contracts, from 2006 to the end of 2014.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 590.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraphs 590-622.\n\n10.23.\n\nThe Claimant relies upon the expert report prepared by Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira (of Navigant) and the oral testimony of Mr Sequeira. These expert witnesses calculated that the Claimant's total damages from 2006 to 2015 amounted, on its primary case, to the total principal sum of US$ 3,219,458 (post tax, without interest). These expert witnesses made similar calculations on different hypotheses (resulting in different figures) for the Claimant's first, second and third alternative cases. For the Claimant's third alternative case, they calculated the total principal sum of US$ 2,418,036,000 (post tax, without interest).\n\n10.24.\n\nThe Claimant submits that its lost cash flows were sustained with respect to three different types of transactions it undertook to on-sell gas through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. First, the Claimant and its subsidiaries had long-term supply contracts in Spain with four further related companies (all subsidiaries of Gas Natural Fenosa or \"GNF\"), which it had intended to satisfy with gas from the Damietta Plant. Instead, the Claimant and its subsidiaries have had to buy more expensive gas in order to fulfill their existing supply obligations. They also had to reduce their on-selling commitments. Second, the Claimant and its subsidiaries sold gas to industrial consumers in Spain under one-year renewable contracts. Sales pursuant to these contracts had to be reduced. Third, the Claimant and its subsidiaries sold gas in the international market, which had to be stopped altogether.21\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 602.\n\n10.25.\n\nTo the extent that some gas was still produced by the Damietta Plant during the relevant period (2006-2015), that gas was more expensive for the Claimant, because the Damietta Plant ran less efficiently with reduced capacity, the Claimant had to make Toll-or-Pay payments to SEGAS under the UFG Tolling Contract when it could not satisfy its allotted capacities, and the Claimant incurred additional logistical costs.22\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 602.\n\n10.26.\n\nIn their expert testimony, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira concluded that, if the full volumes of gas required under the SPA had been provided by the Seller, the Claimant (with its subsidiaries) would have had additional cash flows from the sale of that gas in the amount of US$ 2,881 billion. This figure was reached by predicting the total income that the Claimant (with its subsidiaries) would have derived from sale of the full volumes of gas, and then subtracting the income that was actually earned, as well as the cost of operating expenses.23\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraphs 603-610.\n\n10.27.\n\nThe Claimant defends Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira's testimony. It was not \"speculative,\" contrary to the Respondent's assertion. It is based on tangible historical data showing the price that the Claimant was likely to have been able to sell the gas volumes in a \"but for\" scenario. When arbitration tribunals have criticised damages claims as being too speculative, they have referred to claims for future losses based on speculative predictions that the claimant company would make profits in the future, even though there was no evidence that the company had made profits in the past. The Claimant contends that the Respondent's criticism of Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira's report as being \"speculative\" is therefore inapposite.24\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 464-467 (Pages 222-223).\n\n10.28.\n\nThe Claimant also rejects the Respondent's other criticisms of Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira's testimony, submitting that most of those criticisms related to formatting matters. The Claimant notes that the few technical errors identified by the Respondent result in a reduction of only 1.3% in the compensation claimed by the Claimant.25\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 450 (Page 233).\n\n10.29.\n\nMr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira's assumptions in calculating the Claimant's income and operating expenses but for the Respondent's breaches, were as follows:\n\n(i) The volume of sales that would have been provided under the SPA but for the Respondent's breaches of the Treaty should be calculated without reference to the HOA and the Transient Agreement, because both agreements were only entered into in consequence of the Respondent's breaches of the Treaty;26\n\n(ii) The Claimant's operating costs would have been lower but for the Respondent's breaches of the Treaty, because (*inter alia*):27\n\ni. The price of purchasing gas from the Damietta Plant would have been lower than the price of purchasing gas on the international spot market;\n\nii. The per-unit cost of producing LNG at the Damietta Plant would have been lower had the Plant been operating at full capacity;\n\niii. If the Respondent had complied with obligations, the Claimant would not have had to make Toll-or-Pay payments under the UFG Tolling Contract;\n\niv. If the Respondent had complied with its obligations, then the Claimant (with its subsidiaries) would have been able to on-sell more gas by way of the three types of transactions set out above. As it was, the Claimant had to reduce each type of onsell to the extent possible. Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira refer to these as the \"unreplaced volumes\";28 and\n\nv. All increases in the gas prices that the Claimant and EGAS agreed in side letters and in the HOA amending the SPA would have occurred even if gas supplies had not been reduced. The Claimant asserts that this is a conservative assumption.29\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 604.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 606.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 607.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 608.\n\n10.30.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the losses suffered by its Spanish subsidiary (UFGC) are attributable to the Claimant because international tribunals routinely treat companies within the same group as comprising the same economic reality, when appropriate. The Claimant relies on the \"group of companies doctrine\" applied in Dow Chemical France (1982),30 where an arbitration agreement was extended to a non-signatory because \"irrespective of the distinct juridical identity of each of its members, a group of companies constitutes one and the same economic reality.\"31\n\nDow Chemical France & Ors v Isover St Gobain, ICC Case No. 4131, Interim Award, 23 September 1982, [CL-0210], Paragraph 136.\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 444-445 (Page 215).\n\n10.31.\n\nThe Claimant distinguishes the award in Gemplus v. Mexico (2010),32 which (so the Respondent submits) decided that a shareholder could not directly claim losses suffered by another company, even where its has ownership interests; and that its claim at most would be limited to demonstrable losses suffered to its shareholding in that other company. The Claimant submits that here the position is materially different, where the Claimant effectively owns and controls EGPC.33\n\nGemplus v. Mexico, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3 & ARB(AF)/04/4, Award, 16 June 2010, [CL-0135], Part XII, Paragraphs 12-50.\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 446-447 (Pages 215-216), citing Gemplus v. Mexico, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/3 and ARB(AF)/04/4, Award, 16 June 2010, [CL-0135], Part XII, Paragraphs 12-50.\n\n10.32.\n\nUFGC is 99.99% owned by the Claimant. It has no employees; and it is run entirely by the Claimant's employees who see it as a \"tool company.\"34 The Claimant is required by Spanish regulations to have its gas marketed in Spain through an entity separate from the members of the corporate group that participates in different activities. This is the reason why the Claimant sold the gas to UFGC.35 However, UFGC's activities form the cornerstone of the Claimant's business. Without its profits, the Claimant would not be a viable company.36 When the Claimant negotiated with the Respondent for the construction of the Damietta Plant and the supply of gas, the Respondent was always aware that the Claimant's purpose was to sell gas in Spain. The Claimant would not have entered into the negotiations but for this purpose. It is therefore appropriate to treat the Claimant and UFGC as functionally equivalent entities because, to fulfill that purpose, the Claimant necessarily had to sell gas through UFGC. In consequence, so the Claimant contends, it is appropriate to treat the Claimant and UFGC as part of the same economic reality, and for the latter's losses to be treated as the Claimant's losses for its claims against the Respondent.37\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 439 and 441-443 (Pages 212-215).\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 438-439 and 441-443 (Pages 212-215).\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 439 and 441 (Pages 212-213).\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 439 (Page 212).\n\n10.33.\n\nFurther, the Claimant contends that it is entitled to claim directly for UFGC's losses because it is contemplated in the SPA that the Claimant would be able to do so. Article 8.1 of the SPA specifically permits the Claimant to claim for \"third party's claims and penalties against [the Claimant].\" As the Claimant absorbed UFGC's additional costs by way of adjustments to transfer pricing and, from mid-2012 onwards, by directly compensating UFGC for its losses, then if UFGC really is to be treated as separate to the Claimant (as the Respondent submits), then UFGC is a \"third party\" and all of these losses are \"claims\" within the meaning of Article 8.1 of the SPA.38\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 443-444 (Page 230).\n\n10.34.\n\nAlternatively, the Claimant contends, its losses amounted to 99.99% of UFGC's losses.39\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 439 (Page 212).\n\n10.35.\n\nAlternatively, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira have calculated the amount that the Claimant directly lost in revenue, rather than the amount that UFGC lost in revenue. This calculation is based on the Claimant's submission that it always transferred any of UFGC's profits and losses to itself by way of its control of the transfer prices charged to UFGC for sales of gas. The transfer prices the Claimant charged to UFGC were consistently adjusted to maintain a consistent (and low) level of profits or losses in UFGC. Therefore, losses suffered by UFGC as a result of the curtailment of supply to the Damietta Plant were absorbed by the Claimant.40\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 449, 459 (Pages 216, 220) and 435 (Pages 227-228).\n\n10.36.\n\nMoreover, some of the replacement gas purchased on the international spot market, in order to replace the volumes of gas needed to satisfy UFGC's supply obligations, was purchased by the Claimant. Therefore, these losses were directly suffered by the Claimant.41\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 458-462 (Pages 220-222).\n\n10.37.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, from mid-2013, UFGC's losses were such that it the Claimant recognised that it needed to amend its contract with UFGC. It therefore executed an addendum which provided that it would compensate UFGC on a monthly basis for costs associated with the purchase of replacement volumes of gas. Thus, from mid-2013, all of UFGC's losses incurred by having to purchase more expensive gas, to replace the lost volumes from the Damietta Plant, were directly attributable to the Claimant.42\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 461-462 (Page 221) and 438 (Pages 228-229).\n\n10.38.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant responds to the Respondent's argument that its cash flow losses must be limited by the terms of the SPA. The Claimant says that this misconstrues its claim. It is a claim for breaches of the Treaty by the Respondent. It is not for breaches of the SPA by EGAS, even though the breaches of the Treaty also involved breaches of the SPA.43 The Claimant cites, in support of this distinction, the award in *Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v. Georgia* (2010).44\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 430-431 and 434 (Pages 207-209).\n\n*Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v. Georgia*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/05/18 and ARB/07/15, Award, 3 March 2010, [CL-0208], Paragraph 480.\n\n10.39.\n\nAs this Tribunal was constituted under the Treaty and not the SPA, the Claimant contends that the SPA's provisions do not provide the legal framework for determining compensation due from the Respondent under the Treaty.45\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 435 (Page 210).\n\n10.40.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent also misconstrues the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* test by seeking to put the Claimant in the position it would have been in had it made a claim under the SPA, not the position it would have been in had the Respondent not violated the Treaty.46\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 432 and 436-437 (Pages 207, 210-211); but see Paragraph 10.12 above.\n\n10.41.\n\nFurther, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira have calculated that, even applying the SPA's limitations on recoverable damages, the Claimant's losses from reduced cash flows amount to US$ 2,013,291,000.47 (This is the part of the Claimant's third alternative case on compensation, described above).\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 468 (Page 224).\n\n10.42.\n\nThese losses are calculated by reference to:\n\n(i) The Claimant's increased costs of lifting and transporting gas from the Damietta Plant (which were increased because the cost of processing gas remained relatively fixed but because the Claimant could not lift full quantities of LNG the lifting and transporting cost per unit increased);48 and\n\n(ii) The Claimant's increased costs of purchasing replacement volumes of gas from the international spot market.49\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 425-426 (Pages 224-225).\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 426 (Page 225); Cl Mem Merits, Paragraphs 593, 602 and 606.\n\n10.43.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it is entitled to claim these additional costs by reference to Article 8.1 of the SPA. Although Article 8.1 limits the amount of damages the Claimant can claim under the SPA to the value of 90% of gas volumes not supplied by EGAS to the Damietta Plant, that value is greater than the Claimant's losses. Therefore, Article 1 does not impose a cap on the Claimant's losses claimed in this arbitration.50\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 427-428 (Page 225).\n\n10.44.\n\nOn the basis of Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira's expert testimony, the Claimant contends that, as at 2015, its post-tax lost dividends from SEGAS arising from the Respondent's breaches of the Treaty, amount to US$ 303,559,000. Grossed up to account for the tax, the principal amount is US$ 404,745,000.\n\n10.45.\n\nAs to these lost dividends, the Claimant submits that SEGAS' only sources of income were Tolling Fees and Toll-or-Pay Fees, which are alternative fees that both the Claimant and EGAS were required to pay SEGAS under the EGAS and UFG Tolling Contracts. The Claimant contends that, from November 2012, EGAS stopped making Toll-or-Pay payments to SEGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract (even with respect to payments then already overdue); and that EGAS has not made any such payments since.\n\n10.46.\n\nA portion of EGAS' Toll-or-Pay payments for 2011, and the entire 2012, 2013 and 2014 Toll-or-Pay payments remain outstanding.51 This coincided with the complete stoppage of all gas supplies to the Damietta Plant, meaning that neither EGAS nor the Claimant were any longer required to pay Tolling Fees to SEGAS.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 614.\n\n10.47.\n\nIn the circumstances, EGAS' failure to make its Toll-or-Pay payments put SEGAS in financial jeopardy and rendered it unable to distribute any dividends, such that it distributed only limited dividends to the Claimant in 2011 and 2012. Moreover, so the Claimant contends, starting in 2008 and more frequently from 2012, SEGAS requested advance payments under the Tolling Contracts from its Tollers to meet its expenses (*i.e.*, EGAS and the Claimant). The Claimant made these advance payments; but EGAS has not.52\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 615.\n\n10.48.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the reduction in dividends paid by SEGAS was caused by the Respondent's breaches of the Treaty. Had the Respondent not curtailed the gas supply to the Damietta Plant, then EGAS would have been liable to pay Tolling Fees, rather than Toll-or-Pay Fees. If EGAS had paid Tolling Fees, then SEGAS would have been put in a financial position to distribute dividends to the Claimant.53\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 615.\n\n10.49.\n\nMr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira have calculated that, if the full volumes of gas to the Damietta Plant had been supplied (and if SEGAS' Free Zone company status had not been revoked), then the Claimant would have received US$ 252.3 million more in dividends from SEGAS.54 This conclusion was reached by calculating what SEGAS' income would have been, using the monthly tolling price under the Tolling Contracts.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraphs 619-622.\n\n10.50.\n\nThe Claimant submits that this is a conservative calculation because:55\n\n(i) It results in a lower amount than an alternative method, using the Tolling Contracts' provision for the tolling price to be revised at the end of each year to ensure an 11% return on equity to investors; and\n\n(ii) Although a higher monthly tolling price was agreed in 2012, which would have resulted in a greater than 11% return to investors, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira's calculations from 2012 are capped at an 11% return on equity.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraphs 620-621.\n\n10.51.\n\nThe Claimant contends that its claim for lost dividends cannot be curtailed by any limitations on damages contained in the SPA, because the SPA does not govern dividends paid out by SEGAS to its shareholders, including the Claimant.56\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 446 (Page 231).\n\n10.52.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's submission that the Claimant failed unreasonably to mitigate its losses.\n\n10.53.\n\nThe Claimant reduced its downstream commitments, where possible, in order to reduce the costs of buying more expensive replacement gas to fulfill those commitments, by searching for the cheapest possible replacement gas,57 by allowing supply contracts to expire and therefore reducing its market share in Spain,58 and by declaring *force majeure* to some of its customers in 2014.59 However, the Claimant's ability to do so was impaired by the Respondent's and EGAS' continual representations from 2006 to late 2013 that EGAS would meet its contractual commitments in future, including representations set out in various side-letters and amendments to the SPA.60\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 458 (Page 237).\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 454 and 459 (Pages 233 and 237).\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 454, 457 and 459 (Pages 233 and 236-237).\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 451-456 (Pages 233-235).\n\n10.54.\n\nIn these circumstances, it was reasonable for the Claimant to have waited until 2014 to declare *force majeure* on its downstream supply contracts, because of the doubts that existed over whether an unpredictable, fluctuating and insufficient supply of gas constituted a *force majeure* event.61\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 457 (Pages 236-237).\n\n10.55.\n\nThe Claimant has also requested an order that the Respondent pay pre-award and post-award interest, based on international commercial rates.62 The Claimant relies on three alternative interest calculations performed by Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira:63\n\n(i) The LIBOR + 2.5% rate (which the SPA applies to late payments), and a form of which international arbitral tribunals often apply;64\n\n(ii) The US Prime rate of interest + 2%, with the 2% addition to reflect the fact that the US Prime rate is lower than that broadly available to the market. A form of this rate is also used often by international arbitral tribunals;65 and\n\n(iii) The yield on the Respondent's sovereign bonds issued in US dollars, to reflect the fact that the Claimant is effectively an unwilling lender to the Respondent. As yields on US dollar denominated bonds of the Respondent were not available for 2006-2009, a US Prime rate + 2% was used for this period.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 623.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraphs 624-626.\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 462 (Page 239).\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraph 464 (Page 240).\n\n10.56.\n\nThe Claimant has requested that an award of interest be compounded.66 The Claimant contends that an award of compound interest is the generally accepted standard for compensation in international investment treaty arbitrations.67 In support of this proposition, it quotes from *Middle East Cement v. Egypt* (2002), *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas v. Argentina* (2007), and *Siag v.

D2 328ff.; ROS, Vol. V, Slides 1-28.\n\n10.62.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that a substantial portion of the damage of which the Claimant complains was suffered by its subsidiary, UFGC, which was the Claimant's Spanish subsidiary. The Claimant sold the gas processed by the Damietta Plant to UFGC, which then on-sold it to various Spanish customers.\n\n10.63.\n\nIt was UFGC, not the Claimant, that had contractual obligations to supply gas. Any lost cash flow suffered by UFGC as a result of being unable to on-sell gas, that it otherwise might have acquired, is a lost cash flow suffered by UFGC.\n\n10.64.\n\nThe Claimant's calculation of its damages is therefore incorrect. It is based on prices that UFGC would have charged to downstream customers, instead of the prices that the Claimant would have charged to UFGC.\n\n10.65.\n\nFurther, it was UFGC, not the Claimant, that actually purchased gas on the international spot market in order to fulfill its contractual obligations under its supply contracts. Therefore, it was UFGC, not the Claimant, that incurred the higher cost of that replacement gas.77\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 369; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 422-433.\n\n10.66.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, a claimant cannot directly claim losses suffered by another company in which it has an ownership interest.\n\n10.67.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the decision in Gemplus v. Mexico (2010),78 in which the ICSID tribunal decided:79\n\nThe Claimants' claims for compensation derive only from their status as investors with investments in the form of their respective minority shareholdings in the Concessionaire, as distinct from any claim by the Concessionaire itself. Perhaps inevitably, the Parties' submissions occasionally elided this important distinction, effectively treating the valuation of the Concessionaire's future profits (if any) as the relevant exercise for the assessment of compensation due to the Claimants. The exercise required of this Tribunal is, in contrast, the valuation of the Claimants' lost investments in the form of their shares in the Concessionaire and not, as such, the lost profits incurred by the Concessionaire under the Concession Agreement.\n\nGemplus v. Mexico, ICSID Case Nos. ARB(AF)/04/3 and ARB(AF)/04/4, Award, 16 June 2010, [CL-0135], Part XII, Paragraph 50.\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 371.\n\n10.68.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent contests the Claimant's attempt to rely on Gemplus v. Mexico (2010). The Respondent submits that the claimant in that case was allowed to recover damages to a company in which it held shares only on the basis that the shareholding was the investment protected under a BIT. That is not the case here in regard to UFGC.80\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraph 424.\n\n10.69.\n\nThe Respondent's Rejoinder also rejects the Claimant's attempt to rely on a \"single economic reality\" or \"group of companies doctrine\" to argue that UFGC's losses should be attributed to the Claimant. The Respondent contends that there is no relevant authority supporting the use of such a doctrine in a situation like the present case, where the subsidiary company that suffered losses was incorporated in a State that was not the respondent State.81\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraph 423.\n\n10.70.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent contends that arbitral decisions concerning the scope of private-party arbitration agreements are irrelevant to the question of attribution of damages under international law.82 The fact that Spanish regulations require a particular corporate structure is not relevant to deciding whether the Claimant should be entitled to recover losses that were actually suffered by a different entity.83\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraph 425.\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraph 426.\n\n10.71.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the only way that UFGC's losses can be relevant to calculating compensation for the Claimant, is if the Claimant contends that its damages arise from a loss of the value of its shareholding in UFGC. However, as the Claimant has not asserted a claim for such damages, nor submitted any evidence on it, this Tribunal cannot determine what such loss may amount to.84\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 371-372.\n\n10.72.\n\nOn the Respondent's case, the Claimant might also have made a claim for losses suffered as a result of its transactions with UFGC. However, the Claimant has failed to provide evidence relating to those transactions. It therefore cannot make such a claim.85\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 373.\n\n10.73.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's contention that it is entitled under Article 8.1 of the SPA to claim for losses suffered by UFGC as a \"third party\" within the meaning of that provision.86\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraph 431.\n\n10.74.\n\nThe Respondent contends that UFGC did not make any \"claims\" against the Claimant, but rather: first, that the Claimant agreed to make payments to UFGC as part of a commercial arrangement; second, that this agreement was driven by the allocation of lost profits, which are not recoverable under Article 8.1; and that, because the Claimant's transfer pricing was motivated by a desire to keep UFGC's profits and losses at a particular level, that transfer pricing cannot have been caused by any of the Respondent's actions.87 Moreover, the Respondent contends that the entitlement to losses for third party claims, under Article 8.1, does not apply if the third party claims were the result of *force majeure*, as in this case.88\n\nResp. Rej Merits, Paragraph 433(a), (c) and (d).\n\nResp. Rej Merits, Paragraph 433(b).\n\n10.75.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's alleged losses are too speculative and uncertain. It contends that Article 36(2) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, codifying customary international law, only allows compensation for assessable damage \"insofar as it is established.\"89 The Respondent also relies on the ILC Commentary to Article 36, explaining that \"[t]ribunals have been reluctant to provide compensation for claims with inherently speculative elements.\"90\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragragh 376, citing ILC Articles on State Responsibility, [CL-0064], Article 36(2).\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragragh 376, citing ILC Articles on State Responsibility, [CL-0064], 104, Comment (27).\n\n10.76.\n\nFurther, the tribunal in *Amocov. Iran* (1987)91 decided:\n\n*One of the best settled rules of the law of international responsibility of States is that no reparation for speculative or uncertain damage can be awarded.* [...] *It does not permit the use of a method which yields uncertain figures for the valuation of damages, even if the existence of damages is certain.*92\n\n*Amoco v. Iran*, 15 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 189, Partial Award No. 310-56-3, 14 July 1987, [CL-0097].\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 376; *Amoco v. Iran*, 15 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 189, Partial Award No. 310-56-3, 14 July 1987, [CL-0097], Paragraph 238.\n\n10.77.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira's testimony has failed to establish the Claimant's damages claim, because it contains errors, because its calculations were not made on the basis of documents (but on the basis of assumptions instructed by the Claimant's Counsel), and because it uses spreadsheets that are opaque, nearly incomprehensible, poorly supported, contain irrelevant information, and omit useful information and important calculations. The Respondent contends that there are numerous unexplained inconsistencies between the figures Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira stated they were using, and the actual figures used in their spreadsheets.\n\n10.78.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira's failure to substantiate figures used in their calculations, and to explain those calculations, means that the Claimant's attempt to quantify its damages is too uncertain to be the basis of any award by this Tribunal.93\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraph 377; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 434-444.\n\n10.79.\n\nFurther, so the Respondent contends, there are speculative elements to the Claimant's alleged damages. First, Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira have assumed that the Claimant or its subsidiaries would have been able to sell large volumes of gas in Spain and on the international market, had it not been for the reduction of supplies to the Damietta Plant. This is speculative, and not supported by the reality of the gas markets, which saw a drop in prices and demand during the relevant period. Second, because that demand for gas is speculative, it is also speculative for Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira to have assumed that SEGAS would have processed gas to the Damietta Plant's full capacity during the whole of the relevant period.94\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 378-379.\n\n10.80.\n\nAnother problem with Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira's testimony, according to the Respondent, is that they do not take into account price increases for natural gas agreed by the Claimant, in the HOA and the Transient Agreement. Having agreed to them, the Claimant cannot escape their terms.95\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraph 421.\n\n10.81.\n\nWith respect to the testimony of Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has not demonstrated a single instance of a supply contract under which the Claimant was obligated to sell gas at a price that did not reflect the price the Claimant actually paid for the gas. The Claimant's expert reports are presented in such a way that it is not possible to identify any such instances from those reports.96\n\nResp Rej Merits, 420-421.\n\n10.82.\n\nThird, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's entitlement to compensation is limited by the terms of the SPA. The Respondent submits that the Claimant's claims are necessarily linked to the SPA because the compensation it seeks is essentially the difference between (i) the SPA's contractual volumes and pricing and (ii) the volumes the Claimant contends it actually received and the prices it actually paid under the SPA.97 Moreover, the Claimant, having elsewhere argued that the Respondent and EGAS should be conflated, cannot now argue that the Respondent is not a party to the SPA and abandon the SPA for the purposes of calculating its compensation.98\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 380-383; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraph 414.\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraph 413.\n\n10.83.\n\nThe Claimant's legitimate expectations are also relevant to establishing the \"but for\" scenario. The Respondent contends that those expectations are necessarily defined and constrained by the terms of the SPA, because the volumes and prices on which the Claimant has based calculations are ones that were agreed as a package that included the SPA's limitations on liability.99\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraph 414.\n\n10.84.\n\nPut another way, the Claimant's legitimate expectations were that EGAS would comply with the SPA, and that compliance might be made either by providing the agreed-upon gas volumes or by paying the agreed-upon damages.100 In consequence, any compensation to the Claimant for non-delivery of gas under the SPA should not exceed the compensation the Claimant could have expected under the SPA.\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragragh 417.\n\n10.85.\n\nMoreover, Article 8.1 of the SPA sets a cap on damages at 90% of the contractual price of any gas not supplied, which was not taken into account in Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira's calculations.101\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 380-383; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 419-420 and 433(d).\n\n10.86.\n\nArticle 8.1 of the SPA also excludes any entitlement to consequential damages and loss of profits. The Respondent contends that this dooms the Claimant's argument that it is entitled to damages for both the unreplaced volumes of gas that it was unable to on-sell, and for the replaced volumes of gas on which the Claimant and its subsidiaries suffered losses by having to buy more expensive gas to meet downstream supply obligations. Both types of damages are \"lost profits.\" The Respondent contends that Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira have conceded that the claim for unreplaced volumes is a claim for lost profits.102\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 380-383; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 419-420.\n\n10.87.\n\nThe Respondent contests the Claimant's reliance on the decisions in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* (1928) and *Kadassopoulos and Fuchs v. Georgia* (2010) to argue that the SPA's limitations on recoverable damages do not apply to its claim. As these were cases concerning expropriation of property, the question of how to assess damages was completely different to the present case. Moreover, the Respondent contends that the tribunal in the latter case did consider any contracts to be \"relevant to the factual matrix which underpins [the] claims.\"103\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 415-416, citing Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v. Georgia, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/05/18 and ARB/07/15, Award, 3 March 2010, [CL-0208], Paragraphs 482 and 484 (brackets in original).\n\n10.88.\n\nFourth, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that it has mitigated any losses it suffered. The Respondent contends that, as the Claimant's downstream supply contracts were mainly with subsidiaries, it is unlikely that they would have refused to cooperate if the Claimant had requested reductions in supply commitments. The Respondent submits that the Claimant has not disclosed the downstream supply contracts, nor provided information about its relationship with downstream counterparties during the relevant period, such that the Claimant has not proved it would have suffered any penalty had it failed to meet its supply obligations.104\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 384-386; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 446 and 452.\n\n10.89.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant's business records show that its own management thought that it should have declared force majeure on its downstream supply contracts earlier than it did. By failing to do so until 2014, the Claimant failed to mitigate its losses.105\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 447-451.\n\n10.90.\n\nFurther, the Respondent contends that the Claimant had already purchased gas from Oman, which was available for the Claimant to use to meet its downstream supply obligations. Its failure to do so, and its purchase of more expensive gas on the international spot market instead, is an instance of its failure to mitigate losses.106\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 454-455.\n\n10.91.\n\nFifth, the Respondent attacks the amount of the Claimant's asserted losses as a result of reduced dividends paid from SEGAS. The Respondent contends that because there was a force majeure situation, EGAS was no longer obliged to continue supplying gas from either June 2012 (when that situation of force majeure arose) or from 24 February 2013 (when EGAS sent its second force majeure notice to the Claimant). From one of those times, any loss of dividends to be paid by SEGAS cannot have been caused by any breach by the Respondent of the Treaty; and therefore the Claimant is not entitled to these damages.107\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraph 456.\n\n10.92.\n\nSixth, the Respondent disputes the interest rates proposed by the Claimant, submitting that a more appropriate rate would be: (i) the US T-Bill rate; or (ii) LIBOR + 1%, to reflect the borrowing rate for companies like the Claimant.108\n\nResp CM Merits, Paragraphs 387-388; Resp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 461-462.\n\n10.93.\n\nLastly, the Respondent submits that any award of compensation to the Claimant should be reduced to account for the severe economic difficulties faced by the Respondent.109\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraphs 463-464.\n\n(4) The Tribunal's Analyses and Decisions\n-----------------------------------------\n\n10.94.\n\n*Introduction:* The Tribunal has determined that the Respondent has violated the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. Its liability under Article 4(1) derives from the Claimant's legitimate expectations based upon the Ministry of Petroleum's letter dated 5 August 2003 in regard to Article 21.1 of the SPA. The assessment of compensation therefore rests on the Respondent's violation of Article 4(1) of the Treaty. It does not rest upon the SPA itself.\n\n10.95.\n\n*Standard of Compensation:* The Treaty does not set out a standard of compensation to be applied in the case of any violations of the Treaty, save as regards expropriation under Article 6 of the Treaty. Expropriation is not alleged by the Claimant to have taken place, at least for the purpose of its present claims in this particular arbitration.\n\n10.96.\n\nIt follows that any compensation to be awarded by this Tribunal is to be decided by applying principles of customary international law, namely \"full reparation\" to wipe out, as far as possible, the consequences of the Respondent's international wrongs under the general principle long established in the PCIJ's judgment in *Chors\u00f3w Factory* (1928),110 as also confirmed by Articles 31 and 36 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.111\n\n*Chors\u00f3w Factory*, PCIJ Rep Series A No. 17 (1928), [CL-0094], Paragraph 47.\n\nILC Articles on State Responsibility, [CL-0064], Articles 31 and 36; *see also* ILC Articles on State Responsibility, [CL-0064], 91, Comment (3).\n\n10.97.\n\nArticle 36 of the ILC Articles provides:\n\n*1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution.*\n\n*2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.*\n\n10.98.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes the Institute of International Law's Resolution made in Tokyo: \"Legal Aspects of Recourse to Arbitration by an Investor Against the Authorities of the Host State under Inter-State Treaties\" of 13 September 2013. Article 13, paragraph 3, provides: \"[c]ompensation due to an investor for violation of the FET standard shall be assessed without regard to compensation that could be allocated in case of an expropriation, in accordance with the damage suffered by the investor.\"\n\n10.99.\n\n*Assessment of Compensation* : The Tribunal accepts that both Parties' expert witnesses on the compensation issues, Messrs Kaczmarek and Sequeira (of Navigant) and Mr MacGregor (of BDO), sought to assist the Tribunal in good faith, to the best of their professional abilities. Many of their disagreements resulted from a different appreciation of the factual evidence and different instructions from the Parties' counsel as to the legal and other non-expert issues. Where there exist relevant differences between these experts, save where otherwise indicated below, the Tribunal has preferred to be guided by the testimony of Messrs Kaczmarek and Sequeira.\n\n10.100.\n\nAs is now not unusual for an investor-State tribunal, this Tribunal is confronted with the awkward task of assessing compensation based on a multiplicity of factual, legal and expert issues, as to which the Parties and their experts come to very different figures. It is therefore necessary to explain at the outset the Tribunal's general approach to the assessment of compensation.\n\n10.101.\n\nThe assessment of compensation is rarely a science or an exercise of arithmetical precision by an arbitration tribunal. Complex factual, legal and expert issues of compensation, dividing the disputing parties and their expert witnesses, can require a margin of appreciation by a tribunal applying the wording of a treaty and international law. The required exercise can be therefore less than exact. For this case, the Tribunal refers to the general approach taken by international arbitration tribunals, as recorded in the ICSID awards in *Sistem v. Kyrgyz Republic* (2009),112*ADC v. Hungary* (2006),113 and *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela* (2014).114 The Tribunal has adopted that general approach to the present case.\n\n*Sistem v. Kyrgyz Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/1, Award, 9 September 2009.\n\n*ADC v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, [CL-0095], Paragraph 521.\n\n*Gold Reserve v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award, 22 September 2014, [CL-0040], Paragraph 832.\n\n10.102.\n\n*The Respondent's Undertaking:* As stated many times in this Award, the Claimant's claim for compensation is based on the Treaty under international law against the Respondent. It is not based on the SPA or under Egyptian law. Accordingly, without more, the Treaty and international law do not require the Tribunal to apply the SPA's contractual limitations on compensation for breach of the SPA by EGPC or EGAS, as if the Claimant's claim were making a contractual claim against its co-contractor, EGAS.\n\n10.103.\n\nSuch was the decision reached by the ICSID tribunal in its award in *Kardassopoulos* and *Fuchs v. Georgia* (2010):115\n\n480. The Tribunal recalls that the Claimants' claims are treaty-based. Therefore the relevant provisions for the purpose of both liability and quantum are contained in the treaties and, more broadly, international law. Whilst the JVA and Deed of Concession are relevant to the factual matrix which underpins those claims, the Tribunal has not been constituted under the provisions of the JVA nor the Deed of Concession to consider the Parties' contractual dispute. Article 12 of the JVA and Article 21 of the Deed do not, therefore, as such, govern the legal framework within which the Tribunal must consider the compensation owing to the Claimants for breach of the ECT and the BITs.\n\n481. This finding is without prejudice to a host State and an investor's ability to contractually limit the compensation which may be owed following an expropriation where a treaty is also in play. Indeed, the Tribunal is loathe to accept the categorical denial of such an arrangement *urged by the Claimants as a matter of law. [...]*\n\n*Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v. Georgia*, ICSID Case Nos. ARB/05/18 and ARB/07/15, Award, 3 March 2010, [CL-0208].\n\n10.104.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the tribunal's significant qualifications in these passages. Moreover, in the Tribunal's view, the facts of this case lead necessarily to a different conclusion.\n\n10.105.\n\nAs decided in Part IX above, the Respondent's international wrong derives from its undertaking in the letter dated 5 August 2000 from the Ministry of Petroleum to the Claimant. That undertaking was made in regard to the Seller's obligations under the SPA, pursuant to Article 21.1 of the SPA. In this sense, the Respondent's undertaking limited the compensation that might be owed following an international wrong under the Treaty to the compensation under the SPA as regards Article 4(1) of the Treaty. The Respondent was not a guarantor of the Seller's obligations under the SPA, still less a primary co-obligor. It would an odd result if, in such circumstances, the Respondent assumed a greater liability to pay compensation under the Treaty than the maximum liability assumed by the Seller under the SPA.\n\n10.106.\n\nHence, the Tribunal selects the Claimant's third alternative case on compensation as the appropriate methodology for assessing the compensation payable by the Respondent under the Treaty and international law, as summarised above at the beginning of this Part X. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant's primary case and its first and second alternative cases on compensation, as there also summarised.\n\n10.107.\n\nIn these circumstances, applying the \"but for\" test for causation, it follows that compensation for the Respondent's international wrong under the Treaty cannot exceed the Seller's obligations under the SPA. Those obligations, as to the Seller's liability for non-performance, are qualified (*inter alia*) by the limitations on recoverable compensation under the terms of the SPA.\n\n10.108.\n\nArticle 8.1[1] of the SPA provides that, for a breach of the obligation to deliver the stipulated quantity of gas, the Seller\n\n*shall be liable to Buyer for any damages, costs and/or expenses (to the extent permissible under Egyptian laws, but excluding consequential damages and loss of profits) arising from Seller's failure to supply, including (i) third party's claims and penalties against Buyer, (ii) costs, extra-costs, damages and expenses caused to the Complex arising from Seller's failure to supply, including operation and maintenance costs (expressed in USD per MMBTU), and capital investment costs (expressed in USD per MMBTU).*\n\n10.109.\n\nThe cap on damages as to 90% of undelivered gas provided by Article 8.1[2] of the SPA is not relevant to the Claimant's claims made by reference to Article 8.1[1]. Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira calculated the US$ value of this cap as US$ 3.04 billion, an amount in excess of the Claimant's total claims.116\n\nNavigant ER2, Paragraph 212.\n\n10.110.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to the SPA's other limitations on recoverable damages later below.\n\n10.111.\n\n*Loss of Profits:* As already noted above, the Claimant claims a total principal sum of US$ 2,013,291,000 for damages recoverable by reference to the SPA; namely \"Lost Cash Flows\" under its third alternative case on compensation. That amount excludes any \"loss of profits\" on the calculations made by the Claimant and its expert witnesses, Mr Kaczmarek and Sequeira. In the Tribunal's view, by reason of Article 8.1[1] of the SPA, the Claimant was correct in not here claiming \"loss of profits\" (as the Respondent contended).\n\n10.112.\n\n*SEGAS' Lost Dividends:* The Claimant also claims US$ 404,745,000 for \"Nominal Lost Dividends\" from the Claimant's majority shareholding in SEGAS.117 These losses were caused by two cumulative factors: (i) the failure of EGAS to pay fees due to SEGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract and (ii) the non-payment of dividends by EGAS to the Claimant owing to to SEGAS's precaurious financial condition, that were not solely caused by EGAS (*i.e.* including SEGAS' lost Free Zone status).\n\nNavigant ER2, Table 25 (updated).\n\n10.113.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, by reason of Article 8.1[1] of the SPA, the Claimant cannot here claim its nominal lost dividends unpaid by SEGAS, being \"consequential damages and loss of profits\" (as the Respondent contended).\n\n10.114.\n\nThe Tribunal is also required, as to the assessment of compensation, to take account of the ICC tribunal's award in the ICC arbitration between SEGAS and EGAS (as summarised above). As the ICC tribunal there decided, EGAS was not entitled to fees from EGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract by reason of SEGAS' absolute assignment of its contractual rights to HSBC. It must follow, as a matter of fact, that no such fees could be passed by EGAS through SEGAS to the Claimant in the form of dividends.\n\n10.115.\n\nAccordingly, in the absence of such fees being due to SEGAS under the EGAS Tolling Contract, it must follow that no such losses were incurred by the Claimant. The Respondent is not, of course, legally responsible for SEGAS' absolute assignment of its rights to HSBC under the Offshore Security Agreement.\n\n10.116.\n\n*UFGC:* As to UFGC, it is a Spanish company forming part of the Uni\u00f3n Fenosa group of companies. It is owned as 99.99% by the Claimant; and it is managed by the Claimant's employees, subject to the operational control of the Claimant. UFGC was formed by the Claimant for the specific purpose of allowing the Claimant to market gas in Spain, as required by regulatory provisions of Spanish law.118\n\nS\u00e1ez Ram\u00edrez WS2, Paragraphs 4 and 10.\n\n10.117.\n\nUnder the agreement between UFGC and the Claimant,119 UFGC's costs flowed through to the Claimant. UFGC's remitted receipts accounted for two thirds of the Claimant's revenue.120 As a wholly owned and integrated subsidiary, the operating costs and financial results of UFGC were consolidated into the Claimant's financial statements, so that any losses sustained by UFGC were directly reflected in the Claimant's financial statements.121 In legal and contractual terms, however, UFGC was a stranger, or third party, to the SPA.\n\nLiquefied Natural Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement between UFG and UFGC, 15 May 2005 (redacted), [C-0428].\n\nCl Rep Merits, Paragraphs 448-450; Conti WS, Paragraphs 23-25.\n\nNavigant ER1, Paragraphs 43-45.\n\n10.118.\n\nAs a factual matter, there is no doubt that losses sustained by UFGC were passed through and directly suffered as losses by the Claimant. As the Respondent's expert witness (Mr MacGregor) accepted, if the Claimant had to reimburse UFGC for its purchases from third parties (which UFGC otherwise would have purchased from the Claimant), the Claimant could claim damages under the SPA by reference to the extra costs incurred by UFGC.122\n\nBDO ER1, Paragraph 7.17.\n\n10.119.\n\nThe Tribunal can see no logical reason why the same result should not apply under the Treaty and international law. This is not a case of a claimant claiming as damages a loss or expense incurred by a company in which it has only a minority interest and no direct control over that company. In such circumstances, a minority shareholder may make a claim for the diminution in the value of its shareholding; but it cannot claim, even prorated according to the number of its shares, the damages suffered only by the company. Such a claim is not pleaded by the Claimant in this arbitration.\n\n10.120.\n\nMoreover, from June 2013 onwards, UFGC has in fact invoiced the Claimant on a monthly basis for extra costs incurred in its purchases of replacement gas, in place of the Claimant's sales of gas to UFGC. The Claimant has paid those invoices.123 The claim in respect of costs incurred to EGPC is made for the period from June 2013 onwards, during this invoicing period.124\n\nConti WS, Paragraph 26; Navigant ER1, Paragraph 205; UFGC-UFG Invoices under Amendment 10 2013-2015, [NAV-197].\n\nTr. D1 170.\n\n10.121.\n\nArticle 8.1 of the SPA imposes a liability on the Seller for the \"costs\" incurred by the Buyer from third parties. It follows that the Claimant's costs incurred and paid to UFGC would be recoverable from the Seller (EGAS) under the SPA and thus also recoverable from the Respondent under the Treaty.\n\n10.122.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant's third alternative case on compensation, as supported by Mr Kaczmarek and Sequeira, correctly includes the amount of US$ 291,894,831 as the Claimant's own \"incremental costs passed on by UFGC to UFG\" from June 2013 onwards.\n\n10.123.\n\n*The Free Zone Claim:* The Claimant claims a total principal sum of US$ 107 million for damages suffered from the revocation of SEGAS' Free Zone status in May 2008. The Tribunal has dismissed this claim, as to liability, in Part IX above. Hence, it is here unnecessary to address and decide the Parties' submissions as to compensation regarding the Claimant's Free Zone Claim. However, it is necessary to exclude this claim and related claims from the assessment of compensation, To the Tribunal's understanding, the Claimant has done so in calculating its third alternative case on compensation.\n\n10.124.\n\n*Mitigation:* The Claimant cannot claim compensation from the Respondent to the extent that the Claimant has failed unreasonably to mitigate its losss in accordance with international law. In the Tribunal's view, the legal test is based upon a reasonable and not an absolute standard, as confirmed by Comment (11) to Article 31 of the ILC Articles and Article 39 of the ILC Articles.\n\n10.125.\n\nArticle 39 of the ILC Articles provides:\n\n*In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by willful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.*\n\n10.126.\n\nMoreover, the test is to be applied as at the relevant time, without the benefit of hindsight. The legal burden of proving such unreasonableness in this arbitration rests upon the Respondent.\n\n10.127.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant should have terminated or suspended commitments to downstream buyers, if necessary using a defence of *force majeure* based on events in Egypt occurring from 2011 onward. Applied generally, such terminations and suspensions would have effectively closed down most, if not all, of the Claimant's business.\n\n10.128.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant can reasonably be required to have effectively closed down its business, in whole or in substantial part. Moreover, if it had done so, it is not obvious that the overall amount of its claims would be reduced, albeit perhaps differently formulated against the Respondent. It is even likely that the amount of these claims could have increased.\n\n10.129.\n\nFurther, Mr Conti (of the Claimant) testified that the Claimant did take steps to adjust its downstream sales, as follows:125\n\n*This imbalance between supply and sales forced us to restructure our downstream portfolio to accommodate the change. One measure we took was to reduce our sales volume downstream. Due to Egypt's breach we have reduced our sales volumes in Spain since 2011 by more than 40 percent overall and almost 50 percent in the industrial sector. We also had to adjust the type of customer we supplied. We had structured our downstream sales expecting that we would benefit from a lower, long-term sales price from EGAS, allowing us to charge lower prices to high-volume customers. By supplying high-volume customers at a lower price, we ensured that we could earn a profit and could also sell the entire 4.4 bcm we expected from Egypt. Now that we have to pay higher spot-market prices, we cannot continue to service the same type of customer and/or the same volumes - the prices are too low. Instead of supplying a limited number of high-volume industrial customers, we now must supply low-volume users to obtain a better downstream price. But because these are low-volume customers, we must reach agreements with a substantially higher number of individual customers to reach a volume, which, even if much lower, allows UFG to at least to keep a structural presence in the market and to optimize logistic parameters. So even though UFG has substantially reduced its industrial portfolio in terms of volume - by about half over the past few years -it has had to take on many more customers to reach that lower volume. While UFG used to supply about 170 customers in 2011 and 2012 (but supply a much higher volume), now it supplies about 370 customers.*\n\nThe Tribunal accepts the truth of this testimony. Mr Conti was not called by the Respondent for cross-examination at the Hearing.\n\nConti WS, Paragraph 17.\n\n10.130.\n\nAs also described by Mr Conti and assessed as at the relevant time, the Tribunal does not consider the Claimant's conduct unreasonable. In short, the Respondent did not prove its case on mitigation, as to which (as decided above) it bore the legal burden of proof.\n\n10.131.\n\n*ENI:* The Respondent complains that the Claimant purchased replacement gas from its parent company (ENI) and other affiliated companies, thereby leading to a possible \"windfall.\" The Claimant explained that these purchases were transactions made at arm's length, at average prices lower than those available from other unrelated companies. Overall, as Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Sequeira testified, the Claimant thereby reduced its losses, which would have been greater if it had purchased the same replacement gas from non-affiliated sellers.126\n\nNavigant ER1, Appendix 1; Navigant ER2, Page 29, Figure 3.\n\n10.132.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the other matters raised by the Respondent to support its allegation that the Claimant's compensation should be reduced for its unreasonable failure to mitigate its losses. The Tribunal rejects them all. As already indicated, the legal test for mitigation applies a reasonable standard at the relevant time, not a multitude of second-guesses made years applying an absolute standard to the Claimant's conduct with the benefit of hindsight. Moreover, it cannot be forgotten that the Claimant's predicament requiring such mitigatory conduct was caused by the Respondent's international wrong under the Treaty.\n\n10.133.\n\n*Conclusion:* In conclusion, for the several reasons stated above, by reference to the Claimant's third alternative case on compensation, the Tribunal assesses the compensation due from the Respondent to the Claimant in the total principal sum of US$ 2,013,071,000 (after tax, but before interest), as explained below.\n\n10.134.\n\nThe total amount of USS 2,013,071,000 comprises the amount of US$ 2,013,291,000 (as the Claimant's \"Lost Cash Flows\") that itself includes the amount of US$ 291,891,832 (as the Claimant's \"own incremental costs passed on by UGPC\" to the Claimant from June 2013 onwards). It is reduced by US$ 220 million, as described in Paragraph 10.9 above (as accepted by the Parties' experts).\n\n10.135.\n\nThis total amount of USS 2,013,071,000 does not include the Claimant's figure of US$ 404,745,000 (as the Claimant's \"Lost Dividends\" from SEGAS).That claim has been dismissed by the Tribunal.\n\n10.136.\n\nIt also does not include - the Claimant's claim for US$ 107 million for the loss of SEGAS' tax-free status in the Damietta Free Zone (not being a claim advanced under the Claimant's third alternative case on compensation and, in any event, a claim dismissed by the Tribunal).\n\n10.137.\n\nThe Tribunal also dismisses the Claimant's figures for its primary case on compensation, together with its first and second alternative cases on compensation, as summarised above.\n\n(5) Interest\n------------\n\n10.138.\n\nThere is no prescribed rate of interest in the Treaty. The Tribunal decides to use Three-Month LIBOR + 2.0% compounded quarterly as the appropriate rate for preaward interest. The Tribunal considers that rate to reflect a reasonable rate of interest applicable to the Project as an investment by the Claimant, in concordance with the principles in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* (1928) and Article 36 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. It is less than a commercial rate and the rate prescribed in the SPA, in recognition that the Respondent is a State and not a commercial party, liable under the Treaty and not under the SPA.\n\n10.139.\n\nAs regards the form of interest, as already indicated, the Tribunal decides to apply compound interest. In selecting compound interest, the Tribunal adopts the reasoning in the awards in *Compa\u00f1ia del Desarrollo v. Costa Rica* (2000) and *Gemplus v. Mexico* (2000).\n\n10.140.\n\nApplied to calculate pre-award interest, the Tribunal selects 1 January 2016 as the commencement date and the date of this Award as the end-date.\n\n10.141.\n\nAs to post-award interest, the Tribunal decides to apply the same rate of Three-Month LIBOR + 2.0% compounded quarterly, from the date of this Award until payment to the Claimant.\n\n10.142.\n\nIn the event of the Claimant receiving any monies under this Award, the Claimant is forever precluded from claiming against the Respondent or EGAS any compensation in respect of the same monies in any legal or arbitration proceedings against the Respondent, EGPC or EGAS, including the pending second CRCICA arbitration (899) between the Claimant and EGAS. The Tribunal records that the Claimant has undertaken in this arbitration, as stated in its written submissions and its submissions at the Hearing, that it will not make any attempt at \"double-recovery.\"\n\n(6) Summary of the Tribunal's Decisions\n---------------------------------------\n\n10.143.\n\nThe total principal sum of compensation to be paid by the Respondent is US$ 2,013,071,000 (after tax, but before interest).\n\n10.144.\n\nAs to pre-award interest to be paid by the Respondent on the said principal sum, from 1 January 2016 to the date of this Award, the rate is Three-Month LIBOR + 2.0% compounded quaterly.\n\n10.145.\n\nAs to post-award interest to be paid by the Respondent on the said principal sum, from the date of this Award until payment, the rate is Three-Month LIBOR + 2.0% compounded quarterly.\n\nPART XI: THE STAY/SUSPENSION ISSUES\n-----------------------------------\n\n(1) Introduction\n----------------\n\n11.1.\n\nIf the Tribunal were to decide that it had jurisdiction (as it has in Part VI above), the Respondent contended that the Tribunal should decline to exercise its jurisdiction, or at the minimum, order a stay (or suspension) of this arbitration pending the resolution of the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations.1\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 9-13 and 78-96.\n\n11.2.\n\nOn 22 December 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, reserving, for the time being, its decision regarding the Respondent's request for a stay of this arbitration.\n\n11.3.\n\nOn 4 March 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 addressing the two procedural issues of bifurcation and the stay of this arbitration. On the Respondent's application for a stay, the Tribunal requested that \"it continue to be informed on regular basis by the Parties of the progress made in the CRICCA [sic] and ICC arbitrations (insofar as it may be permissible for each of them to do so). For the time being, the Tribunal reserves its decision regarding the Respondent's stay application and makes no order for a stay of these arbitration proceedings.\"2\n\nPO5, Paragraph 3.11.\n\n11.4.\n\nThe Parties' respective positions on the stay are summarised below, taken from their written submissions. To a significant extent, at least as regards the ICC arbitration and the first CRCICA arbitration (896/2013), these submissions have only an historical value.\n\n(2) The Respondent's Case\n-------------------------\n\n11.5.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent submits that this Treaty arbitration comes on top of four arbitration proceedings initiated by the Claimant before different *fora*, namely the ICC and CRCICA.3 The Respondent submits that all these other arbitrations relate to a dispute that arose out of \"EGAS's alleged failure to supply the Damietta Plant with volumes of natural gas agreed under the Natural Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement.\"4 The Respondent contends that this Tribunal \"should decline to exercise jurisdiction or, at a minimum, stay [this arbitration] pending the resolution of the Contractual [ *i.e.* the CRCICA and ICC] Arbitrations pursued and prioritized by Claimant.\"5\n\nICC Arbitration No. 19392/MD/TO, CRCICA Arbitration No. 896/2013 and CRCICA Arbitration No. 899/2013; Resp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 9.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 9.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 12; Resp Rep Bif, Paragraph 73; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph 110.\n\n11.6.\n\nReferring to international tribunals' inherent power, discretion and pragmatic approach to decline jurisdiction or to stay proceedings when appropriate, the Respondent contends that such a power relies upon the principles of *lis pendens*, comity, collateral estoppel and *res judicata*. These principles ensure sound judicial administration, procedural efficiency and protection against abuses, conflicting decisions, double recovery and duplication of costs. According to the Respondent, this has been confirmed by several tribunals, as well as the International Law Associations' 2006 Recommendations on *Lis Pendens* and *Res Judicata* and Arbitration (the \"ILA Recommendations\").6\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 78, 86-87 and 90; Resp Rep Bif, Paragraphs, 68-71, Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph 108, citing *ILA Recommendations on Lis pendens and Res judicata and Arbitration*, Seventy-second International Law Association Conference on International Commercial Arbitration, Toronto, Canada, 4-8 June 2006, [RL-0050], Paragraphs 5-6; *Grynberg v.

United States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)12/1, Award, 25 August 2014, [RL-0047], Paragraphs 7.11 and 7.59; the Respondent further cites, among others, Professors Lowe and Shany who expressed statements to the same effect; Vaughan Lowe, *Overlapping Jurisdiction in International Law*, 20 Australian Year Book of International Law 191 (1999), [RL-0036], 202-203; and Yuval Shany, *Regulating Jurisdictional Relations Between National and International Courts* (Oxford University Press 2007), [RL-0040], 166.\n\n11.7.\n\nThe Respondent submits that these concerns are further underscored by the ICC partial award of May 2016, which decided that SEGAS did not have any rights under the EGAS Tolling Agreement.7\n\nResp Rep Jur, Paragraphs 101-104.\n\n11.8.\n\nIn support of its submissions, the Respondent refers to the decisions of the arbitral tribunal constituted under Annex VII of the UNCLOS in *The Mox Plant Case* (2003) and also the ICSID tribunal in *SPP v. Egypt* (1985). There both tribunals stayed their proceedings pending another court's ruling in a matter related to their respective dispute.8 The Respondent also refers to several investment treaty cases, in particular *SGS v. Philippines*, (2004), involving treaty and contract claims, where tribunals have stayed the proceedings pending the resolution of the contractual claim by a different forum.9\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 81-82 citing *The Mox Plant Case*, Order No. 3,24 June 2003, 42 ILM 1187 (2003), [RL-0041], Paragraphs 26-28; *SPP v. Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, Decision on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 27 November 1985, 106 ILR 512 (1997), [RL-0042], Paragraph 87.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 83, citing *SGS v.

Paraguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/9, Further Decision on Objections, 9 October 2012, [RL-0043], Paragraph 290.\n\n11.9.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant's common objective in the other arbitrations is to vindicate its contractual rights allegedly breached under the SPA, upon which its investment treaty claims before this Tribunal are predicated.10 Accordingly, this Tribunal should decline jurisdiction or stay this arbitration. Otherwise, it would be \"inappropriate or, at the very least, premature for the Tribunal to adjudicate Claimant's duplicative treaty claims.\"11\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraphs 84-92; Resp Rep Bif, Paragraph 72; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph 109.\n\nResp Obj Jur& Req for Bif, Paragraphs 91-92; Resp Rep Bif Paragraph 72.\n\n11.10.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent reiterates that if the Tribunal does not decline jurisdiction, it should stay the proceedings pending the outcome of the contractual arbitrations because:\n\n(i) In the CRCICA and ICC arbitrations, the tribunals upheld jurisdiction and several rounds of submissions and hearings on jurisdiction and admissibility took place, respectively.12 Hence, their outcome would assist this Tribunal in the determination of relevant factual and legal matters and would help avoid the duplication of costs and the risk of contradictory decisions;13\n\n(ii) A stay of this arbitration \"would not materially prejudice\" the Claimant.14 It was the latter's choice to \"prioritize the Contractual Arbitrations over the ICSID arbitration.\"15 That was further confirmed by the Claimant's acknowledgement that this ICSID arbitration and the Contractual Arbitrations are inseparable and \"inextricably linked\";16 and\n\n(iii) A stay of this arbitration is not barred by any other compelling reason given that the Claimant's contractual claims are granted due process in the Contractual Arbitrations and the enforceability of these commercial awards under the New York Arbitration Convention of 1958.17\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 92.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 95, Resp Rep Bif, Paragraph 69; Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph 107.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 93.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 93.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 93, referring to the Claimant's letter to the Tribunal of 23 September 2015, Page 3; *see also* Resp Rep Bif, Paragraph 69.\n\nResp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 94.\n\n(3) The Claimant's Case\n-----------------------\n\n11.11.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant opposes the Respondent's application for the dismissal or the stay/suspension of this arbitration. It invites the Tribunal to reject the application because: (i) the doctrines of *res judicata* and collateral estoppel do not warrant the dismissal of the Claimant's claims or any stay of these arbitration proceedings; (ii) the Respondent's reliance upon the doctrine of *lis pendens* is inapposite; and (iii) judicial comity and procedural efficiency require that these arbitration proceedings continue without any stay.18\n\nCl Rej Bif, Paragraphs 72-89.\n\n11.12.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent's arguments are flawed because they are based on the Respondent's mischaracterization of the Claimant's claims.\n\n11.13.\n\nThe Claimant contends that its contractual and treaty claims have different natures with different factual backgrounds.19 The Claimant submits that the Claimant is not a party to the ICC arbitration and that, in the current proceeding, \"[the Claimant] is seeking to engage *Egypt's international responsibility* for violations of the Spain-Egypt BIT. By contrast, in the Contractual Arbitrations, [the Claimant] and SEGAS are seeking to engage EGAS' *contractual liability* for breaches of the SPA, as amended by the Heads of Agreements and the Transient Agreement, and of the SEGAS [and UFG] Tolling Agreement.\"20\n\nCl Obj Bif, Paragraphs 102-103; Cl Rej Bif, Paragraph 77;Cl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 195-198.\n\nCl Obj Bif, Paragraphs 102-103 (emphasis in original); *see also* Cl Rej Bif, Paragraph 77; Cl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 195-198 and 206.\n\n11.14.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the existence of certain overlapping facts between these contractual and treaty claims does not mean that they are identical or constitute the same dispute. Thus, the same facts could give rise to distinct claims before different *fora*.\n\n11.15.\n\nThe Claimant submits that this has been generally known as the distinction between \"contract claims\" and \"treaty claims\" and widely recognized by investment treaty tribunals, *inter alia*, *SGS v. Pakistan* (2003) *Impregilo v. Pakistan* (2005) and *Toto v. Lebanon* (2009). The Claimant submits that these tribunals all refused to grant a stay of their proceedings.21\n\nCl Obj Bif, Paragraph 104; Cl Rej Bif, Paragraphs 82-88; Cl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 209-210, citing *SGS v. Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 6 August 2003, [CL-0062], Paragraph 186; *Toto v. Lebanon*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, 11 September 2009, [CL-0150], Paragraph 220.\n\n11.16.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent's reliance on *SGS v. Philippines* is unavailing, not only because it is an isolated and widely criticised case, but also because the circumstances were different from the current proceedings. The tribunal there had to address a breach of the treaty's umbrella clause which made the outcome of the contractual claim relevant for the determination of the treaty claim.22\n\nCl Rej Bif, Paragraph 84.\n\n11.17.\n\nThe Claimant dismisses the Respondent's argument that the ICC tribunal's partial award (deciding that SEGAS has no rights under the EGAS Tolling Contract) impacts the Claimant's claims in the present proceeding. It should not affect the Tribunal's jurisdiction since the Respondent failed to state any cogent reasons for its conclusion.23\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 193-194 and 197-198.\n\n11.18.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the Contractual Arbitrations will not have any material impact on this Tribunal's decisions. This Tribunal's jurisdiction should not be affected in the event that it decided that the Claimant's contractual and treaty claims have the same \"fundamental basis\" (which the Claimant restates that they do not).24\n\nCl Obj Bif, Paragraphs 107-109; Cl Rej Bif, Paragraphs 78 and 89.\n\n11.19.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the doctrine of *res judicata* only applies when there is an earlier and final decision by a tribunal or a court. It contends that the doctrine of collateral estoppel only applies when a particular fact or legal matter has been decided by a prior action between the same disputing parties. In the present proceedings, no decisions, let alone final ones, have been yet been rendered in the Contractual Arbitrations.25\n\nCl Rej Bif, Paragraphs 74-75.\n\n11.20.\n\nIn addition, given that the Claimant's claims in these Commercial Arbitrations are \"legally distinct\" from the claims before this Tribunal, \"it is therefore doubtful that an award in one of these cases could produce *res judicata* effect in the other case.\"26\n\nCl Rej Bif, Paragraphs 73-74.\n\n11.21.\n\nThe Claimant also contends that the Respondent's reliance on the *lis pendens* doctrine is inapposite. The \"triple-identity test\" applicable to *res judicata* should also be satisfied to warrant a stay based on *lis pendens*, which has been regularly recognized by international tribunals and scholars.27\n\nCl Rej Bif, Paragraph 76, citing *Azurix v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 December 2003, [CL-0133], Paragraph 88; *EDF International v.

Int'l 507 (2008), [CL-0156], 509.\n\n11.22.\n\nThe Claimant further refers to the ILA Recommendations which state that a tribunal's power to stay a proceeding should \"be [] exercised very sparingly.\" It also refers to the ILA Final Report of 2009 which states that *lis pendens* does not apply to \"supranational tribunals.\"28 Therefore, so the Claimant contends, this Tribunal should not \"subordinate its authority to that of private arbitral tribunals for reasons of alleged *lis pendens* that the latter tribunals had already found inapposite.\"29\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 201.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 201.\n\n11.23.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the ILA Recommendations state that the stay should not materially prejudice the party opposing the stay. Contrary to the Respondent's argument, the Claimant contends that granting a stay of this arbitration would add further delay in the adjudication of its claims. This would materially prejudice the Claimant's \"financial viability.\"30 Also, if this Treaty arbitration were to be stayed, some of the Claimant's damages claims that are only raised before this Tribunal would remain unresolved.31\n\nCl Rej Bif, Paragraphs 79 and 89; Cl Rej Jur, Paragraph 202.\n\nCl Rej Bif, Paragraphs 79;Cl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 207-208.\n\n11.24.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimant contends that the Respondent's arguments based on *res judicata* and *lis pendens* do not apply to the present case and, thus, do not justify a stay of this arbitration.32\n\nCl Rej Bif, Paragraph 77; Cl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 199-200 and 209.\n\n11.25.\n\nAs to the risk of double recovery raised by the Respondent, the Claimant contends that the risk of double recovery does not suffice to justify the granting of a stay of these proceedings, given the numerous ways developed by tribunals to prevent such a risk.33 Adding that it is not its intention to collect any double recovery, the Claimant states that in case such a risk were to occur, it would amend its claims for damages accordingly.34\n\nCl Rej Bif, Paragraph 86; Cl Rej Jur, Paragraphs 203-204, citing Camuzzi v.

There is therefore no question now of any stay or suspension of this arbitration to await the end-result of these two arbitrations.\n\n11.29.\n\nThe second CRCICA arbitration (899/2013) is pending. Its proceedings, once stayed, have resumed following the final award of the first CRICICA arbitration last December 2017. The Tribunal is not aware of the likely timetable for the end-result of this second CRICICA arbitration. Although hearings have been fixed for October and December 2018, that end-result may well be one or more years away.\n\n11.30.\n\nIn these circumstances, given also that the second CRCICA arbitration involves a different respondent (EGAS) from the Respondent in this arbitration, the Tribunal considers that it would be inappropriate to stay or suspend this arbitration to await a final award in the CRCICA arbitration. Although there are likely to be certain overlapping factual, expert and other issues between the arbitrations, any likely mischief would come from the risk of inconsistent decisions on similar issues and double-recovery of compensation by the Claimant.\n\n11.31.\n\nAs to the risk of inconsistent decisions, that is the inevitable consequence of the longstanding inability of consensual arbitration to address satisfactorily the problems of multi-party disputes. It is not cured by dismissals, stays or suspensions.\n\n11.32.\n\nAs to *res judicata*, the Tribunal considers that none of its decisions, orders or award can bind EGAS in the second CRCICA arbitration. There is insufficient privity between EGAS, the Claimant and the Respondent in these two separate arbitrations.\n\n11.33.\n\nAs to the risk of double-recovery by the Claimant in respect of the same losses claimed in this arbitration and the second CRCICA arbitration, the Tribunal has taken steps in this Award, in accordance with the Claimant's own stated unequivocal position, to ensure that this will not happen.\n\n11.34.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no cause to dismiss this arbitration, on account of the pending second CRCICA Arbitration.\n\n11.35.\n\nGiven the decisions in this Award, the Tribunal sees no risk of inconstancy or procedural difficulty arising from the pending HSBC Arbitration.\n\n(5) Summary of Decisions\n------------------------\n\n11.36.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal decides not to dismiss, stay or suspend this arbitration pending the end-result of the second CRCICA arbitration, as requested by the Respondent. Nor the HSBC Arbitration. Its application is therefore dismissed, together with all other grounds invoked by the Respondent in support such application.\n\nPART XII: THE COSTS ISSUES\n--------------------------\n\n(1) Introduction\n----------------\n\n12.1.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings, the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n12.2.\n\nOn the last day of the Hearing (11 March 2017), the Tribunal and the Parties discussed issues of costs. Having heard the Parties, the Tribunal directed the Parties to file their respective costs submissions simultaneously on 11 May 2017.1 The Parties subsequently agreed to extend the deadline to 17 May 2017. They filed their respective costs submissions on that date.\n\nTr. D6 1789.\n\n12.3.\n\nThe Parties agreed to forgo submitting arguments regarding the allocation of costs in their costs submissions and rely instead on their previous positions regarding costs, as pleaded in their respective claims for relief in their earlier submissions. The Parties similarly agreed to submit a table with their costs and fees, without supporting documentation.\n\n(2) The Claimant's Case\n-----------------------\n\n12.4.\n\nIn its submissions, the Claimant contends that the Respondent should bear in full the total arbitration and legal costs incurred by Claimant.2 In its costs submission of 17 May 2017, the Claimant submits that the fees and expenses incurred by UFG on an aggregated basis totalling US$ 12,407,199.71 are broken down in the table provided by the Claimant as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Entity | Fees | Expenses | *Total amount (US$)* |\n| UFG | N/A | 120,239.07 | 120,239.07 |\n| King & Spalding | 8,605,531.71 | 379,588.51 | 8,985,120.22 |\n| Christopher John Goncalves | 1,336,096.67 | 79,981.24 | 1,416,077.91 |\n| Gardner William Walkup, Jr. | 357,281.25 | 18,388.95 | 375,670.20 |\n| Navigant Consulting, Inc. | 1,413,376.99 | 26,242.32 | 1,439,619.31 |\n| Dr Kenneth Medlock | 70,473 | N/A | 70,473 |\n| Total | 11,782,759.62 | 624,440.09 | 12,407,199.71 |\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 638(d) (\"UFG respectfully requests that the Arbitral Tribunal: [...] Order Egypt to pay all costs and expenses of this arbitration, including ICSID's administrative fees, the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal, the fees and expenses of UFG's legal representatives in respect of this arbitration, and any other costs of this arbitration [\u2026].\"); *see also* Cl Rep Merits, Paragraph 473(d). UFG has asked for the same allocation of costs in the jurisdictional phase of this proceeding; Cl CM Jur, Paragraph 89(b) (\"UFG respectfully requests that the Tribunal: [\u2026] Order Egypt to pay all costs and expenses of the jurisdictional phase of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of UFG's legal representatives in respect of this phase and any other costs.\").\n\n12.5.\n\nThe Claimant submits that this amount does not include ICSID's administrative fees and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal.\n\n12.6.\n\nThe Claimant advances its claim on the basis of the Respondent's breaches of its obligations to the Claimant under the Treaty.3 The Claimant contends that other ICSID Tribunals have awarded claimants their costs and fees on this basis where the claimants have prevailed on their claims.4\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 637.\n\nCl Mem Merits, Paragraph 637; Wena v. Egypt, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award, 8 December 2000, [CL-0101], Paragraph 130; ADC v. Hungary, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2006, [CL-0095], Paragraphs 525-529; Siag v. Egypt, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Award, 1 June 2009, [CL-0013], Paragraph 630.\n\n12.7.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that while it seeks full recovery of its costs in the arbitration in general, it is also \"compelled to give a particular emphasis to the costs relating to [the Respondent's] corruption and illegality allegations, which are completely baseless and which have been unjustly imposed on UFG.\"5 The Claimant argues that the \"inordinate resources - in time and money - spent on Egypt's spurious allegation of corruption and illegality\", should weigh heavily in favour of full cost order against Egypt.6\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 128.\n\nCl Rej Jur, Paragraph 128.\n\n12.8.\n\nIn its costs submissions of 17 May 2017, the Claimant records that it has initiated three separate proceedings related to the Damietta Plant: two Cairo Regional Center proceedings, CRCICA Case 899/2013 and CRCICA Case 896/2013, and this arbitration. The Claimant's expert witnesses in this arbitration have also provided expert testimony in one or both of the CRCICA arbitrations. he Claimant submits that its Counsel and experts have used their best efforts to allocate fees and expenses to the appropriate arbitration. The Claimant represents that in no instance has any fee or expense been double-counted.\n\n12.9.\n\nIn its same submission, the Claimant also submits that the fees and expenses comprising its legal costs were necessary for the proper conduct of this arbitration and that their amounts are reasonable and appropriate given this arbitration's complexities and the amount in dispute. The Claimant also submits that all of these fees and expenses have been invoiced to the Claimant; and that the Claimant has paid them all, with the exception of the invoices for the month of March 2017, which the Claimant was still processing at the time of its costs submissions of 17 May 2017.\n\n(3) The Respondent's Case\n-------------------------\n\n12.10.\n\nIn its submissions, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to order the Claimant to pay all the costs of this arbitration, as well as the Respondent's legal costs and expenses in connection with this arbitration (including but not limited to its attorney's fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of its experts) on a full indemnity basis. The Respondent also claims interest on any costs awarded to it in an amount to be determined by the Tribunal.7\n\nResp Rej Merits, Paragraph 465(e); Resp CM Merits, Paragraph 389(e); Resp Obj Jur & Req for Bif, Paragraph 110(e); Resp Rep Jur, Paragraph 111(f).\n\n12.11.\n\nIn its costs submissions of 17 May 2017, the Respondent provides line items and then a total of costs incurred by the Respondent, totalling \u20ac1,386,951.25; $159,959.13; \u00a369,608.94 and EGP 666,345.40, broken down as follows:\n\nA.

The Respondent submits that in the absence of such an agreement or guidance, in accordance with the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules, the allocation of costs is left to the Tribunal's discretion.\n\n(4) The Tribunal's Analyses and Decisions\n-----------------------------------------\n\n12.14.\n\n*Legal Costs:* In the absence of agreement between the Parties or any provision in the Treaty otherwise, the Tribunal has a broad discretion in regard to the allocation and assessment of the Parties' legal costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal considers that the Claimant, as the successful party in this arbitration, should in principle recover its legal costs from the Respondent; and, conversely, that the Respondent, as the non-successful party in this arbitration, should in principle not recover its legal costs from the Claimant.\n\n12.15.\n\nThe Tribunal bases this decision on the 'loser pays' principle applied by the majority of ICSID tribunals to compensate a successful claimant for the expenses of bringing a meritorious claim against a respondent. Without such compensation, a successful claimant would be penalised for resorting to ICSID arbitration. In this case, the Tribunal can see no reason to depart from the general principle that a successful claimant should be reimbursed for its legal costs by an unsuccessful respondent. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal confirms that its decision is not based upon any desire to punish the Respondent for procedural misconduct or for perversely defending a meritorious claim. To the contrary, the Tribunal considers that both the Respondent and the Claimant (together with their respective Counsel) conducted this complex arbitration in good faith, without any impropriety.\n\n12.16.\n\nAs to the assessment of the Claimant's legal costs, such costs must be reasonable in amount and also reasonably incurred by the Claimant. For a case of this complexity and size, both substantive and procedural, the Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant's claim for legal costs fails to meet these tests - but for one factor. There is a marked discrepancy between the total legal costs claimed by the Claimant and the total legal costs claimed by the Respondent. It is not fully explained on the materials before the Tribunal. The Tribunal recognises that an ICSID arbitration is often more expensive for a claimant (who bears the burden of proving its claim) than for a respondent and that there are sometimes special factors in costing a law firm's services to a respondent State.\n\n12.17.\n\nTaking this factor partially into account, the Tribunal considers that US$ 10 million is a reasonable amount for legal costs reasonably incurred by the Claimant in this arbitration. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent shall reimburse the Claimant for its legal costs in the total amount of US$ 10 million.\n\n12.18.\n\n*Arbitration Costs:* The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount (in US$) to:8\n\nArbitrators' fees and expenses\n\nMr Veeder: US$ 156,865.41\n\nMr Rowley: US$ 128,055.09\n\nMr Clodfelter: US$ 184,076.64\n\nICSID's administrative fees: US$ 138,00.00\n\nDirect expenses (estimated):9 US$ 83,083.05\n\n*Total:*US$ 690,080.19\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat shall provide to the Parties a detailed Financial Statement of the case account once all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\nThis amount includes estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Award (courier, printing and copying).\n\n12.19.\n\nThese arbitration costs have been paid out of the advances totaling US$ 700,000.00 made by the Claimant to ICSID, following the Respondent's default on all requested advance payments to ICSID.10\n\nThe remaining balance shall be reimbursed by ICSID to the Parties in the same proportion to the payments advanced by them to ICSID; *i.e.* in this case to the Claimant only.\n\n12.20.\n\nIn accordance with the same principle applied above to the allocation of legal costs, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent shall reimburse the Claimant for its arbitration costs in the total amount of its advances to ICSID, namely US$ 700,000.00. The Claimant, however, shall give credit to the Respondent for any reimbursement of its advances by ICSID, whether by way of set-off against any sums due under this Award or otherwise.\n\nPART XIII: THE OPERATIVE PART\n-----------------------------\n\n13.1.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides and awards as follows (by a majority where marked thus \"\\*\"):\n\n13.2.\n\nJurisdiction and Admissibility:\\* As a matter of jurisdiction, the Claimant is a protected investor with a protected investment under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention, sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of ICSID and also the competence of the Tribunal to decide on their merits in this arbitration the Claimant's claims against the Respondent pleaded under the Treaty.\n\n13.3.\n\nAs a matter of admissibility,\\* the Tribunal decides that it may exercise such jurisdiction to decide on their merits the said claims pleaded by the Claimant in this arbitration.\n\n13.4.\n\nAs matters of jurisdiction\\* and admissibility\\*, the Tribunal decides to dismiss the Respondent's objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction and the exercise of such jurisdiction to decide on their merits the Claimant's said claims.\n\n13.5.\n\nCorruption:\\* On the evidential materials placed before this Tribunal, there was no corruption against the Claimant (including UFACEX) proven by the Respondent.\n\n13.6.\n\nNecessity: The Respondent did not prove the defence of necessity under customary international law, as expressed in Article 25 of the ILC Articles of Sate Responsibility.\n\n13.7.\n\nMerits:\\* The Respondent violated its obligations under the FET standard in Article 4(1) the Treaty, rendering it liable to the Claimant as regards its claims made by reference to Respondent's undertaking by its Ministry of Petroleum's letter dated 5 August 2000.\n\n13.8.\n\nCompensation:\\* In respect of its said liability under the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty, the total principal sum of compensation to be paid to the Claimant by the Respondent is US$ 2,013,071,000 (after tax, but before interest).\n\n13.9.\n\nPre-Award Interest: As to pre-award interest to be paid by the Respondent to the Claimant on the said principal sum, from 1 January 2016 to the date of this Award, the rate shall be Three-Month LIBOR + 2.0% compounded quarterly.\n\n13.10.\n\nPost-Award Interest: As to post-award interest to be paid by the Respondent to the Claimant on the said principal sum, from the date of this Award until payment, the rate shall be Three-Month LIBOR + 2.0% compounded quarterly.\n\n13.11.\n\nStay/Suspension: There shall be no stay or suspension of this arbitration pending the end-result of the second CRCICA Arbitration (or any other arbitration); and the Respondent's application is dismissed.\n\n13.12.\n\nLegal and Arbitration Costs:\\* As to costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Respondent shall pay to the Claimant its legal costs in the total amount of US$ 10 million; and as to arbitration costs the Respondent shall reimburse the Claimant in the sum of US$ 700,000 paid by the Claimant to ICSID (or such lesser sum as may be notified by the ICSID Secretariat to the Parties within 60 days of the date of this Award).\n\n13.13.\n\nMiscellaneous:\\* Save as hereinbefore expressly set out, all claims for relief made by each of the Parties are hereby dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision to Terminate the Stay of Enforcement of the Award", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2020-01-24T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision to Terminate the Stay of Enforcement of the Award\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn April 24, 2019, the Arab Republic of Egypt (\"**Egypt**\" or the \"**Applicant**\") filed a communication requesting the continuing stay of enforcement of the Award of August 31, 2018, in ICSID Case No. ARB/14/4 (the \"**Award**\") in a dispute between Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Gas S.A. (\"**UFG**\" or the \"**Respondent**\") and Egypt.\n\n2.\n\nAfter hearing the Parties on July 22, 2019, following two rounds of written presentations on the matter of the continuation of the stay, the Committee issued its Decision on the Applicant's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, dated October 18, 2019 (the \"**Stay Decision**\"), deciding as follows:\n\n(1) To continue the stay of enforcement of the Award of August 31, 2018, in ICSID Case No. ARB/14/4 pending a decision on the Application and subject to the conditions established in this Decision;\n\n(2) Within the period of 60 calendar days, the Applicant shall issue a financial security and provide a written undertaking in the terms established by the Committee in paragraphs 79 to 82 of this Decision, and submit a copy of both instruments to the Committee;\n\n(3) The decision on costs in relation to the Request for the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award is reserved until the conclusion of the annulment proceeding.\n\n3.\n\nIn paragraph 81 of its Stay Decision, the Committee instructed the Parties to liaise and agree on the modality and exact terms of the financial security established by the Committee. In addition, the Committee instructed the Parties to inform the Committee on the progress of their discussions within 15 calendar days following the notification of the Decision and, if no agreement could be reached on the exact terms of the financial security, to request further instructions from the Committee.\n\n4.\n\nBy letter of November 4, 2019, Egypt requested an extension of the 15-day deadline until November 15, 2019, which the Committee granted on November 5, 2019.\n\n5.\n\nOn November 15, 2019, Egypt informed the Committee that it had not yet been able to obtain the necessary approvals from the competent authorities to be able to make a decision regarding the terms of the financial security.\n\n6.\n\nOn November 18, 2019, UFG sent a letter pursuant to paragraph 81 of the Stay Decision, informing the Committee that no agreements could be reached on the exact terms of the financial security, and requesting further instructions from the Committee. In particular, UFG requested the Committee to:\n\na. Order Egypt to confirm in writing that it will comply with the Committee's Stay Decision by providing acceptable security in UFG's favor by December 17, 2019; and\n\nb. Require Egypt to state its position on the following five points: (a) the amounts of post-Award interest that Egypt must secure; (b) whether the security Egypt provides by December 17 will take the form of a bank guarantee or escrow account; (c) whether Egypt prefers to issue one or multiple bank guarantees or escrow payments; (d) the \"reputable international bank\" outside Egypt to be used for the financial security; and (e) the signatory of the written undertaking.\n\nFurther, UFG requested that in absence of a sufficiently meaningful response by Egypt with respect to the above matters the Committee proceed to order the modality and terms of the security according to UFG's proposal included in its letter.\n\n7.\n\nOn November 25, 2019, in response to the Committee's invitation to provide comments on UFG's letter of November 18, Egypt stated that \"[d]espite best efforts, Egypt has unfortunately not been able to obtain necessary approvals from the competent authorities for a decision regarding the conditions stated in the Committee's Stay Decision\". In addition, Egypt expressed certain disagreements with respect to UFG's post-Award interest calculation included in UFG's letter of November 18, 2019, in particular, with respect to the amount to be used as principal and the actual number of days to consider in the calculation. For demonstration purposes, Egypt provided an annex containing its calculation of post-Award interest from September 2019 until November 2020.\n\n8.\n\nOn November 27, 2019, in response to Egypt's comments of November 25, 2019, UFG requested that the Committee (i) issue an Order providing further guidance on the terms of security, and (ii) include a provision that permits the automatic lifting of the stay on enforcement should Egypt fail to provide security that complies with the Committee's directives by December 17, 2019. UFG expressed its disagreement with Egypt's calculation of the financial security in its letter of November 25, 2019, but declared it is amenable to adopting Egypt's calculations for the purpose of posting security in the Annulment proceeding, so long as Egypt posts security at least in the amount of US$ 200,165,770 by December 17, 2019.\n\n9.\n\nOn December 6, 2019, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2, denying UFG's request of November 27, 2019, absent a decision by Egypt's competent authorities regarding the conditions stated in the Stay Decision, and under the terms of that Decision. With respect to the Parties' disagreement on the post-Award interest calculation, the Committee directed the Parties to consider for the financial security the undisputed amount of post-Award interest, as calculated by Egypt in its November 25, 2019 letter, for the sole purpose of indicating the amount of the financial security and without prejudice to the positions the Parties may have in this matter.\n\n10.\n\nBy December 17, 2019, Egypt did not post any security nor did it provide a written undertaking as instructed by the Committee in the Stay Decision.

CONSIDERATIONS AND DECISION OF THE COMMITTEE**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Committee notes that it ordered a continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, subject to the conditions established in the Committee's Stay Decision of October 18, 2019. These conditions are that the Applicant shall, within 60 calendar days following notification of the Decision, issue a financial security and provide a written undertaking in the terms established in paragraphs 79 to 82 of the Decision. Accordingly, these two conditions had to be fulfilled by Egypt no later than December 17, 2019.\n\n16.\n\nThe Committee notes that Egypt did not comply with either of the conditions established under the Stay Decision by December 17, 2019, nor volunteered any explanation as to why it had not done so.\n\n17.\n\nIn response to the Committee's communications of December 27 and 31, 2019, requesting Egypt to inform about the status of the conditions and to present its comments on UFG's request of December 30, 2019 to immediately lift the stay of enforcement of the Award, Egypt stated on January 11, 2020 only that \"[d]espite its best efforts to obtain the necessary approvals from the competent authorities, the Arab Republic of Egypt has unfortunately not been in a position to meet the conditions stated in the Committee's Stay Decision of October 18, 2019.\" Egypt did not provide any further explanation nor request any further instructions as provided for in paragraph 81 of the Stay Decision. Egypt did not request any additional time in order to meet the conditions set by the Committee, either.\n\n18.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Committee concludes that, given that Egypt has not complied with the conditions for the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award set out in the Stay Decision of October 18, 2019, the stay of enforcement must consequently be terminated as requested by UFG.\n\n19.\n\nTHE COMMITTEE HEREBY DECIDES that, according to Rule 54(3) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, and as requested by UFG in its communication of December 30, 2019, the stay of enforcement of the Award in ICSID Case No. ARB/14/4 is terminated as of the date of notification of this Decision."}]}
