INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis Decision addresses the request of the Kingdom of Spain (\"**Applicant**\" or \"**Spain**\") for the continuation of the provisional stay of enforcement of the award rendered on August 2, 2019 in ICSID Case No. ARB/14/12 (\"**Award**\"), initiated by InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure GP Limited, European Investments (Mor\u00f3n) 1 Limited, European Investments (Mor\u00f3n) 2 Limited, European Investments (Olivenza) 1 Limited and European Investments (Olivenza) 2 Limited (\"**Respondents**\" in the annulment or \"**Infrared**\" and, together with the Applicant, the \"**Parties**\").\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n2.\n\nOn November 29, 2019, the Applicant filed an application for annulment of the Award (\"**Application**\"). The Application requested the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award (\"**Stay Request**\") pursuant to Article 52(5) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\") and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n3.\n\nOn December 5, 2019, the ICSID Secretary-General registered the Application and notified the Parties that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n4.\n\nOn February 21, 2020, the *ad hoc* Committee (\"**Committee**\") was constituted in accordance with\u00a0ICSID Arbitration Rules 6 and 53. Its members are: Jos\u00e9-Miguel J\u00fadice (Portuguese), President; Karim Hafez (Egyptian); and Yuejiao Zhang (Chinese). All members were appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council. Mr. Marco Tulio Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n5.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, the Committee fixed the written schedule regarding the Applicant's Stay Request. On that same date, the Committee proposed to hold a one-day hearing (with another day in reserve), for oral argument on the Stay Request, subject to the public health advisories of COVID-19.\n\n6.\n\nOn that same day, the Committee informed the Parties that it had decided to \"extend the provisional stay of enforcement of the award until it rules on such request after receiving the parties' submissions to that effect\".\n\n7.\n\nOn March 24, 2020, the Applicant filed a submission in support of the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award (\"**Stay Submission**\").\n\n8.\n\nOn April 15, 2020, the Committee held the first session with the Parties by video conference. During the session, the Parties confirmed their agreement that the Committee had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, and that they did not have any objections in this respect. The Parties also agreed on a number of procedural matters concerning the proceedings in the case, including the possibility of holding a virtual instead of an in-person hearing, due to COVID-19 health constraints.\n\n9.\n\nOn April 16, 2020, the Respondents filed observations on the Applicant's Stay Submission (\"**Response**\").\n\n10.\n\nOn April 23, 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO1**\") concerning procedural matters. Annex A of PO1 contained the Procedural Calendar agreed by the Parties and approved by the Committee. The Calendar provided for an \"online hearing on 29 and 30 June 2020 (to be confirmed by the Committee in consultation with the Parties by 21 May 2020)\".\n\n11.\n\nOn April 30, 2020, the Applicant filed a reply to Infrared's Response of April 16, 2020 (\"**Reply**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn May 14, 2020, the Respondents filed their rejoinder to the Applicant's Reply of April 30, 2020 (\"**Rejoinder**\").\n\n13.\n\nOn May 20, 2020, after receiving the last written submission on the Stay Request, the Committee consulted again with the Parties about holding a virtual hearing pursuant to Annex A of PO1.\n\n14.\n\nOn May 21, 2020, the Committee decided that a hearing would be held by video conference on June 29 and 30, 2020.\n\n15.\n\nOn June 22, 2020, a pre-hearing session between the Parties and the Committee was held by video conference to discuss any outstanding procedural, administrative, and logistical matters in preparation for the hearing. Participating were:\n\nMembers of the *ad hoc* Committee  \n- Prof. Jos\u00e9-Miguel J\u00fadice, President of the *ad hoc* Committee  \n- Dr. Karim Hafez, Member of the *ad hoc* Committee  \n- Prof. Yuejiao Zhang, Member of the *ad hoc* Committee\n\nICSID Secretariat :  \n- Mr. Marco Tulio Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor, Secretary of the Committee  \n- Ms. Ivania Fernandez, Paralegal\n\nOn behalf of the Applicant :  \n- Mr. Rafael Gil Nievas  \n- Ms. Mar\u00eda del Socorro Garrido Moreno\n\nOn behalf of the Respondents :  \n- Dr. Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Rueda Garc\u00eda  \n- Mr. Borja \u00c1lvarez Sanz\n\n16.\n\nOn June 26, 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 (\"**PO2**\") concerning the organization of the hearing.\n\n17.\n\nOn June 29 to 30, 2020, the Committee held a hearing on the Stay Request by video conference (\"**Hearing**\"). Participating in the Hearing were:\n\nMembers of the *ad hoc* Committee  \n- Prof. Jos\u00e9-Miguel J\u00fadice, President of the *ad hoc* Committee  \n- Dr. Karim Hafez, Member of the *ad hoc* Committee  \n- Prof. Yuejiao Zhang, Member of the *ad hoc* Committee\n\nICSID Secretariat :  \n- Mr. Marco Tulio Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor, Secretary of the Committee  \n- Ms. Ivania Fernandez, Paralegal  \n- Ms. Mayra Alejandra Rom\u00e1n, ICSID\n\nOn behalf of the Applicant :  \n- Mr. Rafael Gil Nievas  \n- Ms. Mar\u00eda del Socorro Garrido Moreno  \n- Mr. Luis Vacas Chalfoun  \n- Ms. Gloria de la Guardia Limeres\n\nOn behalf of the Respondents :  \n- Mr. Alberto Fort\u00fan Costea  \n- Prof. Miguel G\u00f3mez Jene  \n- Dr. Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Rueda Garc\u00eda  \n- Mr. Borja \u00c1lvarez Sanz\n\n18.\n\nAt the end of the Hearing, the Committee invited the Parties to file, by July 3, 2020, any additional request for document production.1\n\nHearing Tr., Day 2, 224: 13-15.\n\n19.\n\nOn July 3, 2020, each Party filed a request for the Committee to decide on the admissibility of new evidence. The Respondents' communication also proposed an undertaking related to guarantees of recoupment by the Applicant if the stay was not maintained and a situation of recoupment arose in the future.\n\n20.\n\nOn July 8, 2020, the Applicant objected to the Respondents' letter of July 3 because it \"goes beyond that Committee's authorization and includes a point 2 not related at all with the petition to incorporate documents to the record\". Consequently, the Applicant requested that:\n\n\"(1) That the paragraph 2 of the Infrared's Letter regarding an \"undertaking\" is completely dismissed and considered as non-presented.\n\n(2) Subsidiarily, that leave is given to the Kingdom of Spain to respond to the misleading paragraph 2 of said Infrared's Letter\".\n\n21.\n\nOn July 10, 2020, the Committee invited the Applicant to reply to the Respondents' letter of July 3 by July 15, 2020.\n\n22.\n\nOn July 15, 2020, the Applicant filed observations on the Respondents' letter of July 3, 2020. It first acknowledged that the Respondents had \"filed timely a document (the Letter) with a dual content: (1) petition to incorporate documents into the record; and (2) additional allegations regarding the stay of enforcement\". The Applicant then argued that \"those additional comments improperly made by InfraRed must be completely sidelined, as they are not only out of the scope of Tribunal [sic] suggestion but also because they do not respond to any request made by Infrared during the hearing\".\n\n23.\n\nOn July 21, 2020, the Committee informed the Parties that it had taken note of the Parties' communications (of July 3 and 15, 2020), and that it would determine in its Decision on the Stay Request whether and how to consider the content of such letters.\n\n24.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, the Parties jointly submitted the agreed revisions to the Hearing transcript.\n\n25.\n\nOn July 30, 2020, the Respondents informed the Committee that the Applicant had lodged on July 22, 2020 an application for revision of the Award (\"**Application for Revision**\"). In their view, \"the circumstances surrounding this request are certainly exceptional, given the fact that Spain's Application for Revision, on one hand, overlaps with its Application for Annulment and, on the other hand, confirms InfraRed's arguments. However, the Application post-dates InfraRed's last written submission and, as a result, it could not have been submitted earlier\".\n\n26.\n\nTherefore, the Respondents requested that the Committee:\n\n\"(i) accept InfraRed's request for leave to file into the record Spain's Application for Revision of July 22, 2020 together with this letter; (ii) order as soon as practicable the lift of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award; and (iii) order Spain to bear all costs resulting from its application for stay of the enforcement.\"\n\n27.\n\nOn July 31, 2020, the Applicant objected to the Respondents' request by arguing that:\n\n\"[i]n the same way as the *ad hoc* Committee strictly enforced the PO1 when required the Applicant to remove the InfraRed' s publicly available financial statements from the opening presentations in the stay of enforcement hearing, the *ad hoc* Committee must enforce the PO1 and directly and simply reject the InfraRed's Letter that contains confidential information.\"\n\n28.\n\nOn August 4, 2020, the Committee took note of the Parties' communications of July 30 and 31, 2020.\n\n29.\n\nOn August 7, 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 3 (\"**PO3**\") regarding the Parties' requests for new documents.\n\n30.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Applicant requested an extension until August 27 to file its submissions pursuant to PO3.\n\n31.\n\nOn August 11, 2020, the Committee granted the Applicant's request of August 10, 2020.\n\n32.\n\nOn August 27, 2020, the Parties filed the new documents and/ or submissions pursuant to PO3.\n\n33.\n\nIn its submission of August 27, 2020, the Applicant asked leave to submit a new legal authority - a decision of August 26, 2020 issued by an *ad hoc* committee in favor of maintaining the stay of enforcement of an award.\n\n34.\n\nOn August 28, 2020, the Committee invited the Respondents to comment on the Applicant's above request by September 3, 2020.\n\n35.\n\nOn September 2, 2020, the Respondents filed their comments on the Applicant's request of August 27, 2020.\n\n36.\n\nOn September 9, 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 4 (\"**PO4**\") regarding requests of the Parties not yet decided.\n\n37.\n\nOn September 10, 2020, the Committee declared the stay of enforcement phase closed.\n\n38.\n\n**Section III** of this Decision summarizes the Parties' positions on the Stay Request. **Section IV** sets out the reasons for the Committee's decision. The Committee's decision and orders are stated in **Section V**.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Parties' positions are briefly summarized below, which does not mean that the Committee has not analyzed all of the Parties' submissions and any other means of providing evidence, including as the case may be, exhibits, legal authorities and pleadings.\n\n**A. The Applicant's Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nIn its Application, the Applicant requests that:\n\n\"[i]n accordance with article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule (54)1,...that the Secretary General provisionally stays enforcement of the Award until the *ad hoc* Committee rules on such request. The Applicant also requests that the stay be maintained until the Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee is rendered\"2.\n\nApplication, \u00a7 73.\n\n41.\n\nIn its Stay Submission3, and then in its Reply, Spain requests that:\n\n\"[...] the stay of enforcement of the Award should be continued and maintained in effect, without security or other conditions, until the decision on the Annulment Application is rendered by the Committee in this proceeding\"4.\n\nStay Submission, \u00a7 27 (\"Spain respectfully submits that the stay of enforcement of the Award should be continued and maintained in effect until the decision on the Annulment Application is rendered by the Committee in this proceeding.\")\n\nReply, \u00a7 128.\n\n42.\n\nThe position of the Applicant is mostly detailed in its Stay Submission, in its Reply, and the Hearing's oral argument (\"**Hearing Opening**\" and \"**Hearing Rebuttal**\"). The Committee has summarized the Applicant's position accordingly.\n\n43.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the continuation of the stay, as requested, is the \"prevailing practice\"5 or \"general norm\"6, unless exceptional circumstances occur or whenever the Application is \"frivolous\" or \"improper\", which it argues is not the case here7.\n\nStay Submission, \u00a7 4.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*See* Stay Submission, \u00a7 4.\n\n44.\n\nEven if the continuation of the stay was not the 'general norm', the Applicant argues that the Application has been filed in good faith (which must be presumed8) because there are serious grounds for the annulment of the Award, and that the Respondents do not pass the test of \"clean hands\"9.\n\nApplicant's Hearing Opening (Presentaci\u00f3n), slide 23.\n\nStay Submission, \u00a7 5.\n\n45.\n\nFurthermore, the Applicant refers to a number of decisions, mostly from previous *ad hoc* committees, to reinforce its position10.\n\nStay Submission, \u00a7\u00a7 7-9.\n\n46.\n\nThe Applicant emphasizes its good faith and refers to the serious harm that may be caused to it in case of the expected annulment of the Award because of the risks of non-recoupment of the amounts unduly paid. The Applicant further asserts that even if the recoupment ends being possible, it would require huge costs and an excessive burden for it and the taxpayers in its territory11.\n\nStay Submission, \u00a7\u00a7 15-18.\n\n47.\n\nFinally, the Applicant concludes that if the Committee weighs the harm to the Parties, there would be no harm for the Respondents if the stay is maintained because (i) the Award ordered the payment of interest, (ii) the Applicant abides by his international obligation, and (iii) Spain is one of the higher ranked countries in the world in terms of GDP and a large European Union (\"**EU**\") economy12.\n\nStay Submission, \u00a7\u00a7 19-26.\n\n**1. The applicable legal standard**\n------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Committee has \"wide discretion\"13 to decide on the Stay Request, and that all the criteria (or legal standard) for the Committee to continue the stay the enforcement of the Award have been met14.\n\nReply, \u00a7 29.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 29.\n\n49.\n\nMoreover, the Applicants argue that its Application is:\n\n\"a) Well-grounded and serious, not frivolous or dilatory;\n\nb) There would be no prejudice or harm caused to Infrared if the stay is continued, as they would be richly compensated for any delay in payment by the accrual of interest if the annulment is denied;\n\nc) There is no history of non-compliance with international arbitral awards by the Kingdom of Spain or a risk of financial inability to pay the Award;\n\nd) There would be serious prejudice and harm caused to the Kingdom of Spain if the Award is enforced and paid and later annulled, since Spain faces the risk that it will not recover the amounts obtained by Infrared, and may have to pursue its own enforcement actions in multiple national courts if the money is not voluntarily returned;\n\ne) There would be serious prejudice and harm caused to the Kingdom of Spain if the stay were revoked and Infrared sought immediate payment and enforcement of the Award, requiring the European Commission (the \"**EC**\" or the \"**Commission**\") to carry out an assessment of the Award in its current form, whether it may be considered State Aid incompatible with the European Union's (\"**EU**\") single market \u2013 a determination that could be wholly unnecessary if the Award is annulled in this proceeding;\n\nf) In any case, the Kingdom of Spain offers its commitment in writing in this case, if the Award is not annulled in this proceeding, to seek the authorization of the EC to proceed with payment and will promptly pay it upon receiving such authorization\"15.\n\nReply, \u00a7 10.\n\n50.\n\nThe Applicant 'strongly' disagrees that the \"circumstances\" to be assessed by the Committee for a decision in favor of the stay must be \"compelling\", as the Respondents posit, which it alleges that it is not correct as a matter of law16.\n\nReply, \u00a7 6.\n\n51.\n\nThe Applicant also disagrees that the stay must be treated as an exceptional measure, which it considers \"plainly wrong\"17.\n\nReply, \u00a7 8.\n\n52.\n\nThe legal standard for the Applicant to obtain the permanent stay, as requested, shall be obtained taking into account \"[t]he sources of International Law... listed in the article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (\"**ICJ**\")\"18 and not judicial or arbitral decisions.\n\nReply, \u00a7 12.\n\n53.\n\nTaking into account those sources, including \"the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU\" (\"**TFUE**\") that forbids the payment of the Infrared Award until the EU Commission authorizes that payment\"19, the International Custom20 and the General Principles of Law, 'the suspension must be maintained'\"21.\n\nReply, \u00a7 14. See also Applicant's Hearing Rebuttal, slide 6: \"Payment to Infrared constitutes notifiable State Aid for the promotion of renewable energy in Spain and may distort competition or affect trade between Member States in the internal market\" and therefore \"[t]he Award exists but payment cannot be done without EU authorization without sanctions. Spain has already notified the Award to the EU\".\n\n\"The international custom (that is only created by the States) is to respect the sovereigns and to try to avoid international conflicts. To lift the stay would lead to an international conflict as the decision would go directly against the EU Law\" (Reply \u00a7 15). Applicant posit that \"[t]erminating the stay is not per se a violation of international law but terminating the stay on the basis of the \"*arguments*\" made by Infrared it is a violation of international law\" (Applicants' Hearing Rebuttal, slide 7, and slide 10-1 for the \"principle of State Sovereignty\").\n\nReply, \u00a7 15.\n\n54.\n\nThe criteria or legal standard for the Committee to decide to continue or lift a stay of enforcement under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2) are not provided by these two legal instruments.\n\n55.\n\nContrary to the Respondents' allegations, the ICSID system is therefore not self-contained, notably in relation to the issues at stake in this stay of enforcement request. But even, *quod no*, in a \"silo application of ICSID Convention, its [A]rticle 42 leads to application of the TFUE\"22.\n\nApplicants' Hearing Rebuttal, slide 7.\n\n56.\n\nThe Applicant further contends than in any event:\n\n\"ICSID *ad hoc* annulment committees have commonly considered a number of circumstances as relevant to the determination of whether to stay enforcement, including: (a) whether the annulment application is dilatory or frivolous; (b) the adverse consequences that may be caused to either party by the granting or denial of a stay of enforcement; (c) the risk of non-recoupment of the award, if it is paid and later annulled; and (d) the risk that the award may not be honored if the annulment application is unsuccessful\"23.\n\nReply, \u00a7 17. Other risks would be the reputational and damage to public/general interest (Applicants' Hearing Opening Statement - Presentaci\u00f3n), slide 22. Also slides 32 for General Interest and slide 33 for Reputational Damages.\n\n57.\n\nThis standard is acceptable for the Applicant under the ICSID Convention, provided that the Committee in exercise of its discretion does not apply an inexistent rule of the burden of the proof24 and does not request the relevant \"circumstances\" to be \"compelling\"25 or \"exceptional\", as the applicable rules (Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2)) make no mention to this admittedly higher threshold26.\n\nReply, \u00a7 14.\n\nThis expression is only used, as referred by the Applicant, in one decision - *Border Timbers v. Zimbabwe* - but to stress that the party opposing the stay should use a lower threshold, not having the burden to demonstrate *\"that there are 'exceptional circumstances' that require the lifting of the stay\"* (Reply, \u00a7 27).\n\nReply, \u00a7 18.\n\n58.\n\nThe Applicant asserts that \"[e]ven if the judicial decisions are not source of International Law, the prevailing practice of *ad hoc* annulment committees shows that stays have been granted in the vast majority of cases in which they have been requested\"27, which is relevant to confirm that the stay is for sure not exceptional (but also not \"automatic\"28) and does not require the existence of \"compelling\" circumstances.\n\nReply, \u00a7 19.\n\nReply, \u00a7 23.\n\n**2. Whether the circumstances require a stay**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Applicant cites in support of its position the decision in *Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/41)* providing that *:*\n\nArticle 52(5) does not indicate that one particular party bears the burden of establishing circumstances requiring a stay. It rather seems that establishing the existence of such circumstances is part of the Committee's discretionary power (...)29\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and **ANNEX-040**, \u00a7 53.\n\n60.\n\nHowever, the Applicant contends having met any burden of proof of the existence of \"circumstances\" that justify the stay to be maintained.\n\n61.\n\nThe Applicant asserts that the relevant circumstances that the Committee should consider when deciding whether to continue or lift the stay are the following: \"(i) whether the annulment application is frivolous or dilatory; (ii) whether the stay would cause adverse consequences or prejudice to either party; (iii) the risk of non-recoupment of the award if paid now and later annulled; and (iv) the risk of non-compliance if the annulment is not successful\"30.\n\nReply, \u00a7 36.\n\n62.\n\nIn the Applicant's view, these circumstances justify a decision of the Committee in favor of the stay, as\n\na) the Application is well grounded and not dilatory31 and this has been evidenced under the needed criterion of fumus boni juris32, which \"means that premature enforcement of the Award would be manifestly imprudent\"33.\n\nb) There are no adverse consequences to the Respondents, let alone evidenced harm34, all the alleged prejudices are hypothetical, as the Kingdom of Spain respects all her international obligations and \"[i]n the unlikely event the Award is not annulled, the Kingdom of Spain will seek the European Commission approval for the payment\"35, and the award adjudicates interest to compensate for the delay of eventual payment36. In any event, the risk of non-payment \"has not been found determinative by arbitral precedents. Even when such a risk has been found, ICSID annulment committees have granted stays of enforcements\"37.\n\nc) There is a serious risk of non-recoupment of the amounts38 as the Respondents provide no evidence of their solvability and, \"even in the hypothetical scenario of that solvency been proved, the risk of capital movements and raising of assets among their entities would continue to exist\"39. There is no equivalent solution to the existent protection of Respondents in the case of maintenance of the stay, as \"absolutely nothing would compensate Spain's hardship in this regard\"40, and therefore \"[t]he risk of non-recoupment for the Kingdom of Spain is higher than the risk of non-payment for Infrared\"41\n\nd) \"[T]he lift of the stay and the subsequent payment of this Award would mean for the Respondent (sic)... the violation of European regulation on Staid-aid,42 the Applicant is solvent and the ICSID systems admits the annulment request as a right and no negative inferences may result of the exercise of a right: \"Lawful ways of proceeding cannot constitute an open violation of anything and it is a lawful way of proceeding to oppose to enforcement when Spain has not been authorized by the European Commission to do the payment yet\"43 and requested already that authorization; if the authorization is not granted, lifting the stay \"could require recovery proceedings to be commenced against Infrared by Spain, consistent with its obligations under EU law\"44 or legal action from the Respondents \"seeking to overturn said determination\" and the Parties will be unnecessarily and inefficiently \"embroiled in legal battles\"45.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 38-46.\n\nReply, \u00a7 43.\n\nReply, \u00a7 44.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 48-69.\n\nReply, \u00a7 50.\n\nReply, \u00a7 51.\n\nReply, \u00a7 63.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 70-79.\n\nReply, \u00a7 72.\n\nReply, \u00a7 73.\n\nReply, \u00a7 78.\n\nReply, \u00a7 58 and \u00a7\u00a7 80-123.\n\nReply, \u00a7 66.\n\nReply, \u00a7 81.\n\nReply, \u00a7 82.\n\n63.\n\nThe lift of the stay \u2013 in the anticipated outcome of annulment of the Award - will create \"secondary damages\" to the Applicant (lack of compensatory interest, reputational and public/general interest damages not covered, distribution of the money paid/obtained through enforcement to shareholders of the Respondents46).\n\nApplicant's Hearing Opening Statement (Presentaci\u00f3n), slides 30-31 and slide 32 for General Interest Damages.\n\n64.\n\nAs far as EU constraints are concerned, the Applicant posits \u2013 as a strong argument in favor of the stay \u2013 that \"the TFEU, which sets out EU Member States' obligations with respect\u00a0to State Aid, is an international treaty which binds Spain and has, in intra-EU affairs, priority over the ICSID Convention and the ECT\"47.\n\nReply, \u00a7 103.\n\n65.\n\nThe Applicant stresses that \"[k]eeping the stay of enforcement during this annulment proceeding would avoid a conflict between Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU and Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.

The Respondents would suffer absolutely no harm by the continuation of the stay \u2013 they have only been able to allege a speculative and hypothetical menace\u2013 even if the Award survives annulment in its entirety\"55.\n\nReply, \u00a7 87.\n\n69.\n\nOn August 27, 2020, the Applicant referred to a decision of the *SolEs Badajoz GmbH v. Kingdom of Spain\u00a0(ICSID Case No. ARB/15/38) (\"**SolEs**\") ad hoc\u00a0committee*\u00a0that \u2013 against the trend of all the previous similar decisions related to the Kingdom of Spain \u2013 granted the maintenance of the stay of enforcement, and after the leave granted by the Committee, submitted into the record that decision56 that allegedly is considered as a good precedent for its case.\n\nAs authorized by PO4.\n\n**3. Whether security should be ordered**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe Applicant considers that the stay shall be maintained and it is not prepared to provide any special undertaking, as no risk actually exists for the Respondents in the allegedly improbable situation of the Award not being annulled and adequate compensation is granted by post-award interest as decided in the Award.\n\n71.\n\nThe post-award interest is allegedly \"in no way insufficient\"57 and there \"would be no injury even if it were 0%\"58, also because the \"[d]elay in receiving payment is a consequence of the *proper application* of the procedural guarantees of the annulment procedure, and the principle of legal certainty\"59.\n\nApplicant's Hearing Rebuttal, slide 3.\n\n*Enron Creditors Recovery Corporation (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3 (\"Because article 52(5) expressly provides that an award creditor's rights are subject to a stay in an *ad hoc* Committee considers that the circumstances so require, the postponement of the right to payment of the award caused by a stay cannot, by definition, per se constitute prejudice\"). Applicant's Hearing Rebuttal, slide 4.\n\nApplicant's Hearing Rebuttal, slide 4.\n\n72.\n\nThe Applicant refuses to admit, when asked by the Committee to comment on, the possibility of granting the stay conditioned upon Spain providing a payment undertaking (similar to what was requested in *NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. and NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/11)* (\"***NextEra***\")) within a certain period of time from the Committee's Decision on the Stay Request, during which Spain may try to obtain a declaration from the EU Commission not opposing the undertaking and the consequences related thereto, as in its opinion it would be \"bad law [that] should not be reproduced\"60; and the same occurs in relation to the possibility of granting the stay conditioned upon Spain issuing an irrevocable bank guarantee within a certain period of time from the Committee's Decision on the Stay Request, during which Spain may try to obtain a declaration from the EU Commission not opposing the issuance of the bank guarantee and the consequences related thereto.\n\nApplicant's Hearing Rebuttal, slide 19.\n\n73.\n\nThe Applicant alleges, against this possibility, that:\n\n(i) EU is not a party in this proceeding,\n\n(ii) To put the stay under condition subsequent depending on a third party is bad law,\n\n(iii) A decision as such is a kind of black mail to the EU to accept something regarding its own State Aid regime,\n\n(iv) The NextEra decision is not an example of good law: it even enters into internal competences of the states on who should authorize what.\n\n(v) [This is a] [b]ad transfer of commercial arbitration practices to investment arbitration\"61 and\n\n(vi) [These possibilities were met with \"[t]remendous surprise by these questions addressed to the Kingdom of Spain62.\n\nApplicant's Hearing Rebuttal, slides 19-20.\n\nApplicant's Hearing Rebuttal, slide 20.\n\n74.\n\nThe economic and financial situation of the Respondents, as demonstrated by their financial statements, is allegedly very poor and constitute an additional argument against lifting the stay: either the Respondents have no assets and emptied their balance and have no longer any assets, or had huge losses and for those reasons they are \"not going to be able to reimburse the amounts if the stay of enforcement is lifted\"63.\n\nApplicant's Request of July 3, 2020 to introduce new documents into the record (\"**Applicant's Request**\").\n\n75.\n\nAs far as the acceptance of a lift of the stay, the Applicant considers that it \"would need special guarantees [such as]:\n\na) affidavit by the Infrared parent Group CEO to repay and to do a public release apologizing for the damages to Spain\n\nb) determination of interests.

The Respondents' Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondents request that the continuation of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award be denied. They argue that the prevailing practice of ICSID *ad hoc* committees has been mischaracterized by the Applicant, that circumstances do not warrant a stay of enforcement of the Award, and that Spain is already a debtor and after more than 5 years it is clear that \"justice delayed is justice denied\"66.\n\nRespondents' Hearing Opening, slide 7.\n\n78.\n\nThe position of the Respondents is mostly detailed in their Response, the Rejoinder and their Hearing oral argument (\"**Hearing Opening**\" and \"**Hearing Rebuttal**\"). The Committee has prepared this summary of their position accordingly.\n\n79.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the Applicant has a long history of refusing to comply with international arbitral awards in similar situations. The Respondents further argue that \"filing actions for annulment forms part of Spain's calculated strategy for delaying and impairing to the extent possible its payment of ICSID awards as well as its compliance with international obligations\"67, and the Application is \"simply dilatory, frivolous and highly damaging\" for the Respondents68. The alleged obligation of notification of the EU Commission demonstrate the delay strategy, as \"[n]either Spain nor the European Commission has respected the deadlines and time periods regulatorily established to authorize payment of the InfraRed award (Spain's Annex 49 (R-392)\"69.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 2.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 3. In the same line, as alleged, the Kingdom of Spain lodged an Application for Revision of the Award (**CL-299**).\n\nRespondents' Hearing Opening, slide 13. See for the notification process, Respondents' Hearing Rebuttal, slide 5.\n\n80.\n\nContrary to the Applicant's Stay Submission, there is no rule, practice or tendency for an *ad hoc* committee to grant the stay of enforcement, which is the exception. The Applicant \"bears the burden of proving that compelling circumstances exist so as to require the continuation of the stay\" and the Kingdom of Spain \"has not discharged its burden and no such circumstances concur\"70.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 4.\n\n81.\n\nThe stay would harm the Respondents, as it will increase the risk of non-compliance with the Award, would allow the Applicant time to reallocate assets, and in any event the post-award interest (which are compensatory by nature) are not intended to and will not compensate adequately71.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 5 and Respondents' Hearing Rebuttal, slides 18-22.\n\n82.\n\nIf the Committee wishes to assess the balance of harm to the Parties, the Respondents allege that no harm exists for the Applicant because the immediate enforcement is no more than a natural consequence of the ICSID Rules72.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 6.\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondents also emphasize that all the previous requests from the Applicant for stay of enforcement have not been granted or were only accepted with stringent conditions73. They consider that it is noteworthy that \"Spain has remarkably avoided any reference to the recent four decisions that other *ad hoc* committees \u2015 hearing over Spain's applications for stay in substantially similar fact settings \u2015 have either rejected (i.e., *Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energ\u00eda Solar Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36)* (\"***Eiser***\"), *Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. and Energia Termosolar B.V. (formerly Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l. and Antin Energia Termosolar B.V.) v. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31)* (\"***Antin***\") and *Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV and others v. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/20)* (\"***Cube***\")) or conditioned the stay of enforcement upon a strict guarantee of payment (i.e., *NextEra*). In *NextEra*, the committee required Spain to undertake that it will (*inter alia*) unconditionally and irrevocably pay the pecuniary obligations imposed by the award following the notification of the decision on annulment, such that the award-creditor will be fully compensated, including interest, and would not need to engage in any action to recognize, enforce or execute the award\"74.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 7.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 3.\n\n**1. The applicable legal standard**\n------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondents consider that \"the remedy of annulment \u2015 coherently with the principle of finality of awards \u2015 is a narrow and exceptional one, limited to very exceptional circumstances\"75. As a consequence, the stay of enforcement being the exception and not the rule, the legal standard to be applied to this request is high: the Applicant has the burden of the proof76 (as mandated by the Article 54(4), of the ICSID Arbitration Rules77) that exceptional and \"compelling circumstances\" occur in a way that allow the Committee to exercise its discretion in accordance with the ICSID Convention and Rules78.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 12.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 18-22 for the alleged \"vast majority of ICSID decisions\" that rule as referred by the Respondents as compared with a single decision in favor of Applicant's viewpoint.\n\n\"[a] request [...] shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination\".\n\nResponse, \u00a7 14.\n\n85.\n\nTo support their point of view, the Respondents quote various *ad hoc* committees' previous decisions and Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, which states \"[t]he Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay the enforcement pending its decision [...].\" According to the Respondents, the expression \"may\" confirms that it is not mandatory and the expression \"require\" demonstrate that it is actually the stay which is the exception.79 They further argue that there is no presumption in favor of the stay request, quite the opposite80 and the expression \"require\" demands that the Committee applies a \"strict standard...following the interpretation given by other committees\" referred by the Respondents81.\n\nResponse, \u00a7\u00a7 13-16.\n\nSee *inter alia Antin,*\u00a7 62\u00a0(**CL-277**).\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 13.\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondents disagree with the Applicant as far as the trend of *ad hoc* committees to confirm the stay is concerned. They state that statistics are not a useful tool, as \"the discretion with which the ICSID Convention has entrusted this...Committee is not to be exercised based on statistics. Statistics might be relevant for other *non-adjudicatory* tasks (secretarial functions or *lege ferenda* reforms) but are certainly not one of the factors to assess, in this or any other case, whether to impose of a permanent stay\"82.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 24.\n\n87.\n\nIn any event, they consider that the trend \u2013 and not only in Spain-related decisions \u2013 favors exactly the opposite position and that all the Spain related cases were against the intentions of the State83.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 23-29.\n\n88.\n\nTherefore, the Respondents conclude that the circumstances must \"rise beyond the ordinary to reach the level that requires continuation of the stay\"84 and, quoting past *ad hoc* committee decisions of similar cases, some of them involving Spain, concludes that \"not any ordinary circumstance is sufficient\"85.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 15.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 16.\n\n**2. Whether the circumstances require a stay**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondents consider that the Applicant \"has not discharged its burden and no such circumstances concur\" that would allow the Committee to exercise its discretion in favor of granting the stay86.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 18.\n\n90.\n\nOn the contrary, the Applicant's previous behavior (not to comply with any award in similar ECT arbitration cases, and resorting always to annulment procedures under inexistent and frivolous grounds) show a pattern of lack of respect for its obligations with an alleged \"strategy [to] 'protect' seizable assets, relocating and transferring them through different jurisdictions\"87.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 19.\n\n91.\n\nWhen the Application is \"frivolous\", as it allegedly is in this case, it is necessary to go against the \"well-settled jurisprudence of ICSID committees holding that the decision whether to grant or deny the continuation of the stay should not consider the merits of the annulment application\"88.\n\nResponse, \u00a7\u00a7 20-21.\n\n92.\n\nThis would be enough to conclude that no circumstances \"require\" to decide in favor of the request. However, if this was not the case, the maintenance of the stay would cause unfair and relevant harm to the Respondents89.\n\nResponse, Section 3.1.\n\n93.\n\nThe harm is anticipated by the consequences of the Applicant's conduct, as it \"reveals its lack of commitment to abide by its international obligation to comply with ICSID awards\"90, and by its contention that \"the payment of the Award is contingent upon the European Commission's authorization\"91 which is a clear demonstration of Applicant's intention not to comply with the Award.\n\n*Idem*.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 22.\n\n94.\n\nAs a consequence, the Respondents harm will be inevitable as \"a permanent stay would relegate this party to an unfavorable position within the (increasingly) long line of ECT award-creditors against Spain\"92 that \"presently, hold ECT awards worth more than 1 EUR billion (only in damages) and are pursuing enforcement actions against Spain\"93.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 31.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 2.\n\n95.\n\nThe Respondents further argue that this situation \"has been considered a relevant factor to lift the stay by other ICSID committees, which held that said risk is not adequately addressed by payment of post-award interest\"94, as they are \"compensatory in nature (not punitive) and, hence, it cannot constitute a pretext to undermine the award's finality or impair the possibilities of immediate enforcement\"95.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 52.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 38.\n\n96.\n\nIn the Respondents' view, this argument relating to the post-award interest had been advanced by the Applicant in previous requests to stay the enforcement of awards, but to no avail, as decided by the competent *ad hoc* committees96, and correspond to the pattern of decision in other cases not involving Spain.\n\nResponse, \u00a7\u00a7 39-40.\n\n97.\n\nBut even assuming that a balance of harm should not necessarily be addressed by the Committee in favor of the Respondents for lifting the stay, the Respondents contend that the Applicant will suffer no harm if the permanent stay request is dismissed97.\n\nResponse, Section 3.2.\n\n98.\n\nThe Applicant considers its risks to be related with the EU rules and the non-recoupment98, but the Respondents posit that they are inexistent and/or irrelevant.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 35.\n\n99.\n\nIn relation to the EU, the Respondents argue that the risk is that \"Spain will not comply with the award but is otherwise irrelevant for the purposes of this decision\"99 and \"[t]he European Commission (EC) cannot decide whether an ICSID award is enforceable or not as a matter of international law\"100.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 35.\n\nRespondents' Hearing Rebuttal, slide 5.\n\n100.\n\nIn any event, the Respondents contend that \"Spain's alleged own 'conflict' with EU law101 is unrelated and irrelevant for the Committee to decide whether to lift the provisional stay. Said \"'conflict' (if any) would exist irrespective of the lifting or continuation of the stay. Therefore, this argument could never stand as a compelling circumstance requiring continuation of the stay of enforcement\"102, and this reasoning having already been applied by previous ad committees in similar cases related with Spain103.\n\n\"It would be unfair to stay the enforcement of the investor's award due to a legal conundrum of Spain's own creation (*Antin*, \u00a7\u00a7 75-77; *Cube*, \u00a7\u00a7 138-139) (Respondents' Hearing Opening Statement, slide 28).\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 56.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 57-59.\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondents posit that the \"EU institutions are subject to the rule of law\", \"EU law is not applicable to the case at hand\"104, and \"Spain stated before the European Commission that the payment of the award did not require prior authorization (Spain's Annex 048 (R-391), section 4.3)\"105. In practical terms, they consider that \"[t]he European Commission is assisting Spain: this review process by the EC of every award was created in a Decision on State Aid of November 2017 and formed part of a political decision against investment arbitration\"106.\n\n\"The application and binding force of the ICSID Convention is not contingent on the decisions that a European Court may adopt in relation to an internal decision on State Aid (see Micula UK Supreme Court Judgment, [2020] UKSC 5, https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2018-0177 html)\" (Respondents' Hearing Rebuttal, slides 7-9).\n\nRespondents' Hearing Opening, slides 35-36.\n\nRespondents' Hearing Rebuttal, slide 5.\n\n102.\n\nIn accordance with the Respondents position, there is also no risk \u2013 contrary to the Applicant's allegations \u2013 of non-recoupment of amounts that might be accessed through enforcement, as the \"InfraRed's Environmental Infrastructure portfolio, which is reflected at para. 6 of the Award\" and \"the funds within the environmental infrastructure portfolio form part of the INFRARED CAPITAL PARTNERS GROUP, which actively manages **over 200 infrastructure and real estate projects** in 30 countries **with USD 12 billion of equity under management** in private and listed funds\" (emphasis in the original)107.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 42 and Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 42-44 for the clarification of the InfraRed Group chart.\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondents further assert that \"Spain presents an improper comparison. The exercise is not to be done with the current financial situation of the InfraRed entities but with their situation after having collected the amounts due by Spain under the Award (EUR 28.20 million in damages, plus interest and legal costs \u2013 around EUR 33 million). There can be no doubt about the InfraRed entities' solvency after collecting the Award\"108.\n\nRespondents' Hearing Rebuttal, slide 13.\n\n104.\n\nMoreover, the Respondents contend that even if \"funds are distributed within the corporate group and this results in the claimant entities' insolvency or an impossibility to obtain reimbursement, there exist several legal remedies available to the Kingdom of Spain (setting aside of transactions, including rescission and claw-back actions in the context of insolvency, in this case, governed in principle by English law \u2013 *lex concursus*)\"109.\n\nRespondents' Hearing Rebuttal, slide 15.\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondents refer that, *quod no*, if there was a risk of non-recoupment \"in any event, as aptly concluded by other ICSID committees, the mere risk of non-recoupment after enforcement \u2015 absent situations where the respondents on annulment (and award-creditors) are \"*in financial distress or in the brink of insolvency*\"110 which is not the case \u2015 does not justify the continuation of the stay\"111.\n\n*Antin*, \u00a7 72 (**CL-277**).\n\nResponse, \u00a7 46 and Rejoinder, \u00a7 37.\n\n106.\n\nThe Respondents conclude that their position is reinforced by the fact that it is for domestic courts where the enforcement of the award is lodged to assess those risks112 and not for the Committee,113 and that those risks are \"a natural consequence of the enforcement regime created by the ICSID Convention\"114, to which Spain adhered.\n\nIn the cases of enforcement through domestic courts the *lex fori* applies and these courts are \"better placed to assess several of the circumstances alleged by Spain\" (Respondents' Hearing Opening, slides 19-21).\n\nResponse, \u00a7 47.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 48.\n\n**3. Whether security should be ordered**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Respondents argue as their primary position that, in light of the above reasons, the stay should be lifted by the Committee. However, if the Committee finds that circumstances beyond the ordinary exist that justify the stay to be maintained, then security must be requested from the Applicant as a pre-condition for not lifting the stay.\n\n108.\n\nIn the Respondents' view, the undertaking allegedly provided by the Applicant (to \"*seek authorization of the EC to proceed with payment and [...] promptly pay it **upon receiving such authorization\"*****115*****)*** is not a \"valid undertaking under the ICSID Convention in the present circumstances. It amounts to *no commitment at all* (Spain agrees to pay ***if** the EC so authorizes*)\"116 and as such, \"it offers *less* than what Spain is already obliged under the plain terms of Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention, which do not condition in any manner Spain's obligation to abide by the terms of final awards\"117.\n\nReply, \u00a7 10 (f) (emphasis in the original).\n\nRespondents' Hearing Rebuttal, slide 6 (\"It is very unlikely that the EC makes a declaration not opposing the payment undertaking or the issuance of a bank guarantee and the consequences related thereto because that would exceed its limited powers under EU State Aid law\") (emphasis in the original).\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 30.\n\n109.\n\nBeing so, in this allegedly unlikely scenario, \"Spain should be ordered to furnish an unconditional undertaking of payment of the Award, including interests and all other sums\"118, \"without needing to resort to any recognition, enforcement or execution proceedings\"119, and the Committee is empowered to order it. The Respondents refer for that purpose to the recent *NextEra ad ho*c committee decision120.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 31.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 32.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 33, quoting *NextEra*, \u00a7 102(a) and (b) (**CL-282)**\n\n110.\n\nThe Respondents argue that as \"Spain is bound to apply Articles 53-54 of the ICSID Convention and the provisional stay must be lifted unconditionally\"121, there is no justification for the Committee to condition the lifting of the stay to any undertaking from the Respondents including the inadmissibility of requesting from the Respondents the payment of any interest on the amounts recovered in case of total or partial annulment of the award or any other compensation of the Applicant's alleged additional damages, including reputational and public interest damages122.\n\nRespondents' Hearing Opening, slide 33.\n\nRespondents' Hearing Rebuttal, slides 23-24.\n\n111.\n\nIn the Respondents' view, requesting any undertaking from the Applicant is \"a waste of time\" because like in *NextEra,* \"Spain delayed the issuance of the undertaking as much as possible, even requesting an unnecessary translation of the Committee's [d]ecision123\". In that situation, \"[n]ot only Spain did not issue the requested undertaking, but it also issued a rude letter against the Committee's order by a non-duly-authorised signatory124\" and \"[c]onsequently, the stay was lifted\"125.\n\n*NextEra*, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 5 (**CL-297**)\n\n*NextEra*, \u00a7 9 (**CL-297**)\n\nRespondents' Hearing Opening, slides 37-8. See also *NextEra*, \u00a7 16 (**CL-297**)\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondents contend that \u2013 faced with the Applicant's refusal to deposit the amount awarded in an escrow account, which could be a solution126 - the only admissible possibility of maintaining the stay of the enforcement will be \"the issuance of an unconditional, firm and irrevocable bank guarantee by Wells Fargo at a branch located in the US in InfraRed's favor subject only to the issuance of the Decision on Annulment\"127 or, being \"more adequate if Spain would pay the sums of the award in an escrow account at a top-tier international bank (preferably where ICSID has accounts, i.e. Wells Fargo Bank, at a branch located outside the EU (e.gr., New York City); and subject only to the submission of the Decision on Annulment rejecting the Application of Annulment\"128.\n\nRespondents' Hearing Rebuttal, slide 18.\n\nRespondents' Hearing Opening Statement, slide 39.\n\n*Id.*\n\n113.\n\nIn the event that the Committee decides to lift the stay, the Respondents propose, as a guarantee in case that a recoupment might be a consequence of the final decision of the Committee, an \"undertaking executed by the Directors of InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure GP Limited whereby the company commits not to distribute to its shareholders any amounts collected from Spain under the Award. This could be executed in compliance with any relevant formalities existing under English law\" (the \"**Undertaking**\")129.\n\nRespondents' \"Request to introduce new documents into the record\" of July 3, 2020 (\"**Respondents' Request**\"), p. 5.\n\n114.\n\nThe Respondents posit that the financial statements of their parent companies \"show operating profits and net assets exceeding the amount of compensation awarded by the Tribunal\", that \"InfraRed Capital Partners (Management) LLP is the entity managing InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure General Partner (GP) Limited (i.e. one of the claimants) under the supervision of UK authorities and subject to UK accountancy rules, and that \"[p]ursuant to UK rules, the entity and the directors to the claimant will not be able to distribute or de-capitalize the claimant's entities pending annulment or they might incur in liabilities otherwise\"130.\n\nRespondents' Request, pp. 2-3.\n\n115.\n\nIn reply to the Applicant's arguments and criticism in relation to the Undertaking, the Respondents present a broader undertaking (\"**Broader Undertaking**\"). This new proposal is intended to reinforce the conditions to justify the lifting of the stay by providing that:\n\n\"In case the stay of enforcement of the Award [...] is lifted, and pending this annulment action (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/12 \u2013 Annulment), INFRARED ENVIRONMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE GP LIMITED undertakes not to transfer or distribute to any shareholder of the InfraRed Capital Partners Group or to any third party (including investors in the InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure fund) any amounts collected from the Kingdom of Spain under the Award. This undertaking would be executed in compliance with any relevant formalities existing under English law\"131.\n\nRespondents' August 27, 2020 comments, \u00a7 7.\n\n**IV. THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**A. The applicable legal standard**\n------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nFirst and foremost, the legal standard for a decision on the stay of enforcement of an award is defined by the applicable rules: Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n117.\n\nArticle 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\nThe Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.\n\n118.\n\nRule 54 of the Arbitration Rules further provides as follows:\n\n(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.\n\n(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.\n\n(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph\n\n(1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).\n\n(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) [for a stay or its modification or termination] shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.\n\n119.\n\nAccording to paragraph (4) of Rule 54 of the Arbitration Rules, a request \"shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations\". In this regard, the Committee first notes that it granted the Parties two rounds of written submissions on the Stay Request. Second, the Committee conducted a virtual Hearing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and listened carefully to the Parties' oral argument on whether or not to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award. Finally, the Committee provided the Parties with several opportunities to introduce new documents to the record in support of their positions, and to comment on their own documents and on the ones submitted by the other side. The Committee will now examine whether circumstances exist that require the continuation, modification or termination of the stay pursuant to Rule 54 of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n120.\n\nThe Parties appear to agree on some of the applicable legal standards that flow from these rules, namely that: \"(1) ICSID committees enjoy discretion to decide whether the stay should be lifted or continued\", and \"(2) Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention is open-ended in the sense that it does not limit or specify the circumstances to be taken into account by committees\"132. They also agree that the existence of \"(i) prejudice to the applicant if the continuation is not granted; (ii) prejudice to the award-creditor; and (iii) a dilatory or frivolous nature of the annulment application\"133, may be relevant for the Committee's decision.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 5.\n\n*Idem*.\n\n121.\n\nHowever, the Parties seem to disagree about whether \u2013 as the Respondents argue \u2013 the ICSID system is \"self-contained\"134, or \u2013 as suggested by the Applicant \u2013 the Committee must rule in accordance with Article 38 of the ICJ Statute135 and, as a consequence, take into account as legal sources \"the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), \"International Custom\" and the \"General Principles of Law\" to issue this decision on the stay of enforcement of the Award136.\n\nRespondents' Hearing Rebuttal, slides 26-33.\n\nReply, \u00a7 12.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 6.\n\n122.\n\nThe Committee is not persuaded that the ICSID system is 'self-contained', if by that expression it is meant that it exists in isolation from international law. However, it is a system in and of itself, in the sense that it is in the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules (and considering these legal instruments in their entirety137) that it is necessary to find the solution for any issue that a committee might face, notably the interpretation of the rules applicable to a given situation.\n\nTo reinforce its case, the Applicant refers to Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, to conclude that it \"leads to application of the TFUE\" (See *supra*, \u00a7 55), as the applicability of the TFUE has been agreed by the Parties. However, as explained below, this issue will be relevant and will be analyzed by the Committee when it will need to consider and decide the annulment request.\n\n123.\n\nIn the process of interpreting the applicable rules in this case, when necessary, it is possible to take into account the fact that the ICSID Convention is a treaty and, therefore, the rules for interpretation of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT** \") constitute a relevant legal instrument.\n\n124.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the Parties that, when applicable, the rules of the Energy Chart Treaty (\"**ECT\"**) are binding for the Committee.\n\n125.\n\nFor any decision subject to the ICSID Rules, as is the case, previous decisions issued by ICSID tribunals (and by other international arbitral tribunals) and, even more, by *ad hoc* committees, may be considered as useful guidance, in light of the absence of a system of legal precedents.\n\n126.\n\nAmong the decisions that may inspire the Committee in its analysis are those that emanate from other *ad hoc* committees in cases relating to similar requests and in which the Kingdom of Spain is a party. The expertise of those *ad hoc* committees is an additional reason to look to them for inspiration. However, they are far from reaching the same conclusions138. Even assuming the equivalent quality of the decisions and the same legal framework, it is demonstrated that this a fact specific matter in which inspiration from previous decisions, although useful, is not decisive to its outcome.\n\nIn three of the decisions (*Eiser*, *Antin* and *Cube*) the request for continuation of the stay was rejected, in another case (*NextEra*) it was granted with conditions (that the Kingdom of Spain was not able or willing to accept and therefore the final outcome was not to grant the continuation of the stay) and in the last and more recent case (*SolEs*) the continuation of the stay was granted without conditions attached.\n\n127.\n\nThe Committee also considers that it has discretion to resort to any other international legal instrument, whether or not a treaty, when it sees fit.\n\n128.\n\nHowever, the Committee is mindful that the stay of enforcement phase of this annulment proceeding is not the occasion to analyze other issues that are or may be central to a different phase of this proceeding.\n\n129.\n\nThis is the case of the discussion between the Parties as far as EU law is concerned. The Committee does not consider that issue relevant at this stage of the proceeding because it relates to the Application *per se.* To consider it at this stage would not only expose the Committee to the risk of prejudging, but also, and in any case, the issues between the Kingdom of Spain and the EC139 are a consequence of the Award, which will survive irrespective of the decision on the stay140. At stake in this phase is only the decision on whether to lift or to continue the stay of enforcement.\n\nAs detailed in *supra*, 49 e) and 62 d)\n\nThe \"conflict between Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU and Article 53 of the ICSID Convention\", as alleged by the Applicant (see *supra*, \u00a7 65), cannot be avoided, let alone decided, at this stage.\n\n130.\n\nAs previously mentioned, in practical terms, the Parties are mostly in agreement in relation to the applicable legal standard. The 'self-contained' debate, as already clarified, does not seem relevant for the Committee at this stage of the proceeding.\n\n131.\n\nThe Committee also notes that, in accordance with Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, it has discretion to decide \u2013 also by applying the rules of the burden of proof \u2013 to continue the stay if circumstances justify that outcome.\n\n132.\n\nThe Committee disagrees with the Applicant's statement that the rule of the burden of proof is 'inexistent'141. That rule is always applicable; what may be a matter for discussion is which party has the burden in any given situation, and this will be decided if and when appropriate by the Committee, under \"the normal approach to burden of proof\"142.\n\nSee *supra*, \u00a7 57. In subsequent statements, the Applicant seems to accept the Committee's actual position (See *supra*, \u00a7\u00a7 59-60).\n\n*Cube* (**CL-289)***,* \u00a7 124.\n\n133.\n\nNeedless to say, if the Committee considers that the Application is merely dilatory or frivolous, or if the request was not made in good faith, it would decide not to continue the stay, irrespective of any other issue143.\n\nAn opposite but equivalent situation could occur if the Respondents had \"unclean hands\" as initially alleged by the Applicant, but no evidence was provided, at this stage, that this was the case.\n\n134.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondents did not prove that the Application is merely dilatory or frivolous. That evidence, under the ICSID system, would always be very demanding, and the fact that in some situations (as occurs with the ECT cases against Spain) the request for annulment is repeatedly made, is of no relevance *per se*.\n\n135.\n\nThe repeated behavior of a State is even less relevant when \u2013 as it is the case \u2013 legal issues relating to the EU State Aid rules are the common ground raised in all these requests for annulment. This is not the time to analyze the validity of the Applicant's arguments. However, it is clear that this is a complex legal issue, and it would be inappropriate (and with serious consequence to the Rule of Law) to issue a decision on these arguments based on the theory that the constant use of a legal argument to request the annulment of awards would be *per se* evidence of dilatory, frivolous and/or bad faith of the party in question.\n\n136.\n\nAnd as far as good faith is concerned, the Committee did not find any reason to conclude that the Application was not made in good faith; quite the opposite, as the grounds presented for annulment are *prima facie* acceptable in accordance with any kind of rigorous benchmark.\n\n137.\n\nNot being frivolous, dilatory or against duties of good faith, the Committee determines that the abstract legal standard for any request relating to the continuation of the stay must be found taking into account the evidence as to the existence and degree of prejudice or harm to the Applicant, if the stay is lifted, and/or to the Respondents, if the stay is continued.\n\n138.\n\nFurthermore, as held by the *ad hoc* committee in *Antin* :\n\n\"the circumstances which should exist for a stay to be required must, at the very least, rise above those which are common to most stay applications. This is to avoid any presumption that a stay would be granted once there is an application for the annulment of an award. Such a presumption would be, in the Committee's mind, contrary to the language of the ICSID Convention, the recent jurisprudence of ICSID annulment committees, and the principle that ICSID awards should be final and binding\"144.\n\n*Antin* (**CL-277**), \u00a7 60.\n\n139.\n\nThe Committee follows this reasoning, as well as that resulting from the *Cube* committee, stating that \"there is no effective presumption either in favour or against continuation of a stay\"145.\n\n*Cube* (**CL-289**), \u00a7 127.\n\n140.\n\nFinally, statistics of previous decisions are not relevant, for such obvious reason that it is not worthwhile delving into them. It is enough to mention that none of the Parties \u2013 and both in a way tried to elaborate on this argument with the intention of taking advantage of what they understood as helping their case \u2013 was able to quote any legal authority to reinforce that bizarre theory.\n\n141.\n\nThe Committee's decision will therefore be dependent upon the evidence \u2013 or lack of \u2013 as to whether \"circumstances... require [the] stay enforcement of the award pending its decision\"146. The Committee will now proceed to analyze this issue.\n\nICSID Convention, Article 52 (5).\n\n**B. Whether circumstances require the stay**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nThe Parties developed thoughtful arguments about whether the \"circumstances\" for continuing of lifting the stay need to be 'compelling/substantial'.\n\n143.\n\nThe Committee does not find the Parties' formalistic discussion to be useful. In its view, the point is much simpler and straightforward. Arbitration Rule 54 (4) provides that \"[a] request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) [for a stay or its modification or termination] shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination\". This is the guidance for the Committee when deciding whether to continue or lift the stay of enforcement.\n\n144.\n\nTherefore, the solution results from the answers to three questions:\n\n(1) Is there any circumstance that may require the Committee to decide in favor of the stay of the enforcement?\n\n(2) If the answer is \"yes\", then what is the balance of harms between the two abstract solutions (to lift or not to lift the stay)?\n\n(3) If there is possible harm relating to each of the abstract solutions, is there a possible practical solution capable of minimizing the risks of actual or probable harm?\n\n**1. Is there any circumstance that may require the Committee to decidein favor of the stay of the enforcement?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nThe Parties have been adamant in defense of their positions.\n\n146.\n\nFor the Applicant, continuing the stay creates no harm to the Respondents and, in any case, they are protected from any possible harm by the fact that post-award interest has been awarded to them by the Tribunal. However, not continuing the stay will cause damage to the Applicant, such as losses, reputational harm, possible conflict with the EU and, above all, risks of non-recoupment of any amounts that might be recovered through enforcement proceedings by the Respondents because they are on the brink of bankruptcy and those monies can be easily transferred to entities that control the Respondents or to third parties.\n\n147.\n\nThe Respondents' position is the opposite. They insist on the applicability of the burden of proof rule and state that the Applicant did not provide any evidence of harm. And if, *quod non,* the Committee concludes that harm might ensue, it cannot be construed as a compelling or even relevant circumstance that would be robust enough to impair the immediate enforceability of the award in accordance the ICSID Rules. In any event, the domestic courts where enforcement of the award will be sought are much better prepared to deal with issues of risk, such as, allegedly, the risk of non-recoupment.\n\n148.\n\nThe Committee is prepared to accept, in the abstract, that an unlikely situation may occur, in which the enforcement of an award will not cause harm to the party against which enforcement is sought \u2013 but this is clearly not a common situation and is not the case in this proceeding.\n\n149.\n\nAnd this is even more evident, considering the mere fact that the Award may be annulled by this Committee (this would not be the first case that an *ad hoc* committee has done so, even with similar awards against the Applicant), and this has a potential of harm that cannot be downgraded to the point of irrelevance. However, many of the circumstances mentioned by the Applicant do not actually relate to enforcement but are rather a consequence of the award under the ICSID framework147.\n\nThis is the case with the issues relating to the European Union, the costs for the Applicant if obliged to litigate in different jurisdictions and even the reputational damage and the effects for the public interest of an enforcement action, as all these issues are a consequence derived from the Award and it is the ICSID system \u2013 to which the Kingdom of Spain adhered \u2013 that generate with a certain degree of automatism the abovementioned potential of harm.\n\n150.\n\nNotably, this is the situation of the EU State Aid argument. As stated in *Antin*148 (where reference to *Eiser* is also made) \"stay would not resolve any of the conflicts that the Applicant purports to face. If the stay is subsequently lifted, the conflicts return\". In the same vein, the *Cube* committee held that: \"the arguments raised by Spain in support of its submission that it faces conflicting obligations under EU and international law, appear to go to the heart of this annulment proceeding and would require the Committee to consider facts and circumstances that pertain to the merits of the dispute\". The Committee agrees with this reasoning and notes that it corresponds to the findings of the committees in *Eiser*, *Cube*, *NextEra* and *SolEs*, irrespective of their various solutions as far as the stay of enforcement is concerned.\n\n*Antin* (**CL-277**), \u00a7 75.\n\n151.\n\nThese and any other circumstances materialized as an automatic consequence of the Award and the proceeding to annul it, are not to be considered by the Committee as a \"circumstance\" pursuant to and for the purposes of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n152.\n\nHowever, one issue that may be considered as a \"circumstance\" to be taken into account is the risk of non-recoupment, for the Applicant, of the amounts that might be recovered by the Respondents if the Committee decides to annul the Award, and whether in this case, this \"circumstance\" \"rise[s] above those which are common to most stay applications\"149.\n\n**C-277**, \u00a7 60.\n\n153.\n\nContrary to the situation in *Cube,* where \"Spain would have to provide more specific information and evidence about the risk of non-payment\"150, which did not occur, at least to the satisfaction of that committee, and as \"it is not for Cube and Demeter positively to prove their financial good-standing\"151, in this case the issue has been discussed and the Committee considers it was provided with enough evidence to reach its own conclusions.\n\n**CL-289**, \u00a7 130.\n\n*Idem*.\n\n154.\n\nThe Applicant even emphasized that the situation may depend on the relevant facts, as evidenced, when stating that \"[w]hile *SolEs* has laid great emphasis on the *Eiser*, *Masdar*, *Antin*, and *NextEra* cases as supporting its argument that the stay should be lifted, Spain argues that these cases ought to be distinguished from the present case, where the award creditor's only relevant asset is on the verge of insolvency\".152\n\nSee *SolEs*, \u00a7 25.\n\n155.\n\nThe analysis of the Respondents' financial statements and the organizational chart of the InfraRed Group, demonstrate that, for a number of reasons, the financial and economic situation of the Respondents is not good enough to assure that risks of non-recoupment will not materialize in the future.153\n\nIn a way, the Respondents attribute that situation to the conflict with the Applicant. This might or not be the case; however, for the purposes of the recoupment risk this is irrelevant, also because the Respondents did not provide evidence of causation to the satisfaction of the Committee.\n\n156.\n\nThe Respondents do not refuse the accuracy of that conclusion. In attempting to convince the Committee that the risk may be minimized, they not only submitted the Undertaking and a Broader Undertaking, but stated that their parent companies \"show operating profits and net assets exceeding the amount of compensation awarded by the Tribunal\"154.\n\nRespondents' letter of July 3, 2020 (tab related to the slide 15).\n\n157.\n\nIn the same vein, the Respondents contend that InfraRed Capital Partners (Management) LLP is the entity managing InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure General Partner (GP) Limited (*i.e.* one of the claimants) under the supervision of UK authorities and subject to UK accountancy rules and that \"[p]ursuant to UK rules, the entity and the directors to the claimant will not be able to distribute or de-capitalize the claimant's entities pending annulment or they might incur in liabilities otherwise\"155.\n\n*Idem*.\n\n158.\n\nThe Committee, after analyzing the financial statements submitted for of all those entities, agrees with the Parties' positions: in case of a decision in favor of lifting the stay, without conditions or undertakings, the risk of non-recoupment is strong enough to be considered a \"circumstance\" as defined and for the purposes of Article 52 (5) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n159.\n\nHowever, if undertakings are provided under which the \"parent companies\" (InfraRed Partners LLP and InfraRed Capital Partners (Management) LLP) are called by the Respondents to provide a valid guarantee, the risks of non-recoupment will become irrelevant taking into account the sound financial statements of those entities and the fact as referred by the Respondents, and already quoted above, that they \"show operating profits and net assets exceeding the amount of compensation awarded by the Tribunal\"156.\n\nRespondents' letter of July 3, 2020.\n\n160.\n\nThe Committee \u2013 based on the evidence provided157 - reaches this conclusion after analyzing the Respondents' financial statements and the organizational chart of the InfraRed Group, and also taking into account all the Parties' arguments, including those made in their post-hearing applications. It is evident that \u2013 as correctly stated by them \u2013 the Respondents' financial situation will strongly improve if the allocated compensation, as decided by the Tribunal, is recovered. However, this argument misses the point, because if, in a later phase of the annulment proceeding, the Committee decides in favor of the relief sought by the Applicant and some monies have been recovered by the Respondents, an issue of non-recoupment might arise.\n\nIn *Antin*, \u00a7 73*,* no evidence was provided of financial distress or of risks of insolvency, and a similar conclusion has been reached in *Cube* **(CL-289**), \u00a7 130.\n\n161.\n\nHowever, seen from the Respondents' point of view, this circumstance is not relevant to the point of justifying the continuation of the stay of enforcement, because the fact that time would pass without the possibility of enforcement is not compensated by the adjudicated post-award interest. And the Committee considers that the Respondents are correct when they state that the post-award interest is \"compensatory in nature (not punitive) and, hence, it cannot constitute a pretext to undermine the award's finality\"158. The Committee agrees with *Antin's* and *Eiser's* reasoning in relation to interest (even if, contrary to *Antin*159, it concludes that in this case, there is evidence of harm for both parties that reaches a material level of risk) that payment of post-award interest is to \"compensate for the deprivation of the principal until payment of the award, but they are not directly related to the issue of enforcement of the award\"160.\n\nSee *supra*, \u00a7 95.\n\n*Antin*, \u00a7 81.\n\n*Antin*, \u00a7 81.\n\n162.\n\nThe provisional conclusion arising from the above is that the risk of non-recoupment, if the Committee decides to annul the Award, must be considered a \"circumstance\" that may \"require\" a decision in favor of continuing the stay of the enforcement until the final decision on the Application.\n\n163.\n\nHowever, a decision to continue the stay of enforcement will harm the Respondents and this risk is not covered by the existent post-award interest. The Committee agrees here with the reasoning and decisions of other *ad hoc* committees about this matter161.\n\n*Antin*, \u00a7 82.\n\n164.\n\nThe Committees needs therefore to assess the balance of harms, which will be done in the following section.\n\n**2. What is the balance of harms between the two abstract solutions (to lift or not to lift the stay)?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Respondents insist that to continue the stay will necessarily generate harm for them, which they conclude is more than sufficient \u2013 in the balance of evidenced harms to the Parties \u2013 for the Committee to conclude in favor of lifting the stay, as the Respondents' harm will be much higher than that of the Applicant. The Committee considers, however, that the balance of harms must be analyzed and applied taking into account that the Committee has already reached the provisional conclusion that the risk of non-recoupment will be *per se* and in the abstract a \"circumstance\" that may \"require\" the stay of enforcement.\n\n166.\n\nThe Committee agrees that it is true that enforcement immediately after the award is issued is \"a natural consequence of the enforcement regime created by the ICSID Convention\"162. This results from Article 53 (1) of the ICSID Convention163. However, this argument misses the point. What is here at stake is not the discussion of whether it is a \"natural consequence\", but rather whether within a request for annulment of an award, and more specifically in a decision to lift or not to lift the stay of enforcement, it is also \"natural\" to take into account the possible harm of the non-recoupment. And the Committee considers it is possible to include this matter in the analysis of the balance of harms.\n\nResponse, \u00a7 48.\n\n\"The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention... Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Convention\".\n\n167.\n\nThe Committee considers that the harm to the Respondents is mostly financial, as, for the foreseeable future, the Kingdom of Spain will be in a position to pay the amount due under the Award, beyond any doubt, if it is not annulled. It is true that the number and value of pending awards is not minor, but the amount of yearly income of the Kingdom of Spain is in excess of \u00ac 300 billion.\n\n168.\n\nThe financial harm to the Respondents may have economic consequences, if it materializes. However, the Award may be considered, as of its notification to the Parties, as an asset of the Respondents, regardless of whether or not the stay is lifted. Therefore, the harmful effects pertain mostly to liquidity, which in any case may also have economic repercussions.\n\n169.\n\nThe harm to the Applicant is mostly economic because if the non-recoupment comes about, it will affect the value of the Applicant's assets and not only its liquidity. However, as the reasoning already presented confirms, this will correspond to a minor fraction of the assets of the Applicant, and even trivial if compared with her yearly income.\n\n170.\n\nThe Committee's conclusion, based on this analysis, is that the balance of harms would allow the Committee to decide in favor of not lifting the stay, if no solution arises under which it will be possible to cancel or at least strongly limit the risk of non-recoupment of any amounts received by the Respondents following the enforcement of the Award, in a case of annulment.\n\n171.\n\nIf some conditions may be found that will strongly limit the abovementioned risk of non-recoupment, the balance of harm tips in favor of lifting the stay, not only because of the balance of risks will change accordingly, but also because not lifting the stay is the exception to the rule164. As a matter of fact, in the ICSID system, the enforceability of awards has been organized in a way that is not subject to the limits and constraints of the other available ISDS systems, such as the other possibilities of dispute resolution under the ECT.\n\nSee among others, *Cube* (**CL-289**), \u00a7121.\n\n172.\n\nHowever, it is a known fact that enforcement against sovereign states is not an easy task, if not for other reasons, because of their immunity. And the Committee is strongly convinced \u2013 taking into account the calendar agreed with the Parties and its duties of efficiency \u2013 that it is highly probable that the final decision on the Application will be notified within less than one year of this Decision, which is to be also taken into account.\n\n173.\n\nIn theory, there is a solution that might be feasible to minimize the risks for both Parties, under which the stay would not be lifted if the State was prepared to provide some undertaking, as decided by the *NextEra ad hoc* committee165. However, that solution did not materialize because, faced with that option or the alternative of the *ad hoc* committee lifting the stay, the Kingdom of Spain did not react, as it probably concluded that the harm of accepting the *ad hoc* committee solution would be worse than that of the lifting of the stay. That conclusion was not based upon a willful intention to refuse to accept the ruling of the *ad hoc* committee, but rather was a consequence of the alleged legal constraints relating to the EU regulations.\n\nSee *NextEra*.\n\n174.\n\nIn this proceeding, it was also clear that the Applicant \u2013 if confronted with the same dilemma \u2013 would take the same option166.\n\nSee *supra*, \u00a7\u00a7 71-72.\n\n175.\n\nThis option of the Kingdom of Spain puts into perspective the harm to be caused by the lifting of the stay when compared with the current risk relating to the EU. But this risk is not to be assessed at this stage of the proceeding, as mentioned above167.\n\nSee *supra*, \u00a7 129.\n\n176.\n\nAs such, the decision to be taken by the Committee on the Stay Request will also need to take into account the issue of the existence and implementation of a solution that might minimize the harm for both Parties, under an optimization analysis.\n\n177.\n\nIt is clear that the Applicant will not (or may not) accept a solution along the lines of *NextEra*, due to the EU constraints and allegedly because a \"[d]elay in receiving payment is a consequence of the *proper application* of the procedural guarantees of the annulment procedure, and the principle of legal certainty\"168.\n\nApplicant's Hearing Rebuttal, slide 4.\n\n178.\n\nIrrespective of this argument, the fact is that *NextEra* demonstrated (and this proceeding confirmed169) that no reasonable undertaking will be provided to the Committee by the Applicant, and a commitment to request authorization from the EC to pay would clearly not be provided170.\n\nSee *supra*, \u00a7\u00a7 71-72.\n\nAs referred in *supra*, \u00a7 49 f).\n\n179.\n\nThe Committee will now analyze that possibility from the opposite viewpoint, that of lifting the stay with conditions capable of minimizing the risks of non-recoupment.\n\n**3. Is there a possible practical solution capable of minimizing the risksof actual or probable harm to the Parties?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Committee finds that it is possible to lift the stay provided it imposes certain conditions on the Respondents. The Committee also notes that while this possibility is within the Committee's discretion, the Respondents themselves suggested that the Committee lift the stay pursuant to certain conditions, and even proposed the Undertaking171 and the Broader Undertaking172.\n\nSee *supra*, \u00a7 113.\n\nSee *supra*, \u00a7 115.\n\n181.\n\nThe minimization of risks for both Parties in a given situation would usually be the outcome of a correct optimization of their positions and intentions. In the case at hand, the Applicant wishes to remove entirely the risk of non-recoupment of monies received by the Respondents through enforcement. The Respondents wish to have the possibility, without any strings attached, to start enforcement proceedings against the Kingdom of Spain without the need to wait for the end of the annulment proceedings with the Committee's Decision on Annulment.\n\n182.\n\nIt is impossible to give to each Party all of what they want. However, it is possible to find a solution that considers the Applicant's concerns, on the one hand, and takes into account the wishes of the Respondents, on the other hand. It is in this context that it is adequate to construct the best available solution.\n\n183.\n\nIn sum, this solution will be implemented in a way that leads to the lifting of the stay, as the Respondents prefer, but protects the Applicant against the relevant risk of non-recoupment (by strongly minimizing it) with strings attached as conditions to lift the stay. If, after a certain period of time, the Respondents are not willing or able to provide adequate security, as defined by the Committee and to its satisfaction, the consequence will be that the balance of harms shifts into a riskier situation of harm to the Applicant, as the \"circumstance\" of the risk of non-recoupment will then \"require\" the continuation of the stay until the Decision on Annulment.\n\n184.\n\nThe Committee will analyze below the various reasonable conditions available to it as forms of security.\n\n**C. Whether security should be ordered**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nThe Committee starts the analysis of the most appropriate security to be provided by looking at the Undertaking and the Broader Undertaking proposed by the Respondents. This is so because the mere fact that the Respondents are willingly prepared to provide these forms of security as a condition for lifting the stay favors the option of starting the analysis here.\n\n186.\n\nThis decision of the Respondents may be relevant, as the lack of any similar commitment was a factor that brought the *SolEs* committee to decide in favor of the continuation of the stay; quoting this decision, \"SolEs, however, does not give any further evidence on its planned used of the award sums should the Award be enforced, arguing that *the applicable ICSID provisions impose no obligation on SolEs Badajoz to demonstrate that circumstances require the lifting of the stay*\"173.\n\n*SolEs*, \u00a7 62.\n\n187.\n\nAs a consequence, that committee concluded that \"there is a real likelihood that the sums paid to SolEs under the Award would be distributed to the investors of SolEs's parent funds\". This would not be the case here because of the Respondents' Undertaking and Broader Undertaking.\n\n188.\n\nIn a nutshell, the Respondents proposed the Undertaking to be \"executed by the Directors of InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure GP Limited whereby the company commits not to distribute to its shareholders any amounts collected from Spain under the Award. This could be executed in compliance with any relevant formalities existing under English law\"174.\n\nRespondents' Request of July 3, 2020, p. 5.\n\n189.\n\nConfronted with the Applicant's arguments regarding the Undertaking, the Respondents proposed a Broader Undertaking, as follows:\n\n\"not to transfer or distribute to any shareholder of the InfraRed Capital Partners Group or to any third party (including investors in the InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure fund) any amounts collected from the Kingdom of Spain under the Award. This undertaking would be executed in compliance with any relevant formalities existing under English law\"175.\n\nRespondents' comments of August 27, 2020, \u00a7 7.\n\n190.\n\nPrior to the above commitments being proposed, the Applicant requested that certain conditions in relation to any possible decision by the Committee in favor of lifting the stay of enforcement be considered, and these are still useful for the Committee's analysis: \"(a) affidavit by the Infrared parent Group CEO to repay and to do a public release apologizing for the damages to Spain, (b) determination of interests. Not only 2% but to cover indirect damages too, (c) escrow in Spain\"176.\n\nApplicant's Hearing Rebuttal, slide 27.\n\n191.\n\nThe Committee notes that the Respondents' Broader Undertaking proposed conditions that expand and clarify that not only would dividends not be paid, but also that nothing would be transferred or distributed \"in any way to any shareholder of the InfraRed Capital Partners Group or to any third party (including investors in the InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure fund)\".\n\n192.\n\nThis proposal goes in the (right) direction of optimization of avoiding or minimizing both Parties' risks and potential harms. However, this is not enough to convince the Committee that the balance of harms will be adequately achieved, as it does not cover the possibility of actions by third parties under which one or all the Respondents \u2013 unwillingly \u2013 may be ordered by a court of law or any other empowered entity to pay to a creditor amounts already due.\n\n193.\n\nIn the same vein, the Committee considers that the Applicant's reference to a possible commitment by \"the Infrared parent Group CEO to repay\" any amounts received by the Respondents through enforcement (in spite of this being presented before the Broader Undertaking) may make sense. The Committee believes that any commitment should be presented by the parent companies, represented by the CEO or by anybody vested with the adequate powers for that purpose, as defined in accordance with the applicable law.\n\n194.\n\nHowever, the other conditions suggested by the Applicant are not useful, let alone necessary, and therefore they are not accepted by the Committee. The reason for this is that they are irrelevant as far as the risks of recoupment are concerned (\"a public release apologizing for the damages to Spain\"), even if damages might occur and/or are excessive and therefore not balanced (\"determination of interests. Not only 2% but to cover indirect damages too\" and \"escrow in Spain\").\n\n195.\n\nUnder these circumstances, as a condition for lifting the stay, it is necessary for the Respondents to obtain and provide security additional to that offered by the Broader Undertaking. This additional security must be appropriate to safeguard a potential situation where one or all the Respondents are obliged to pay unwillingly to any entity \"amounts collected from the Kingdom of Spain under the Award\", by court decision or equivalent. In anticipation of that event and in relation to the actual amounts paid, the \"parent companies\" of the Respondents (InfraRed Partners LLP and InfraRed Capital Partners (Management) LLP) must grant directly to the Applicant unconditional security, whereby they undertake to automatically repay \u2013 in the event of the annulment of the Award \u2013 and within a short period of time, the equivalent amounts that, unwillingly or not, have been transferred by any or all the Respondents to any entity.\n\n196.\n\nThe undertakings that will condition the lifting of the stay must be drafted by the Respondents in a way that will respect the applicable laws governing those undertakings and submitted for the discretionary approval of the Committee, after giving the Applicant an opportunity to provide its observations.\n\n197.\n\nIf the drafts of any of the undertakings are not submitted within a reasonable time period for approval by the Committee, the Committee will not lift the stay of enforcement. The same consequence will arise if the Respondents do not provide, within the deadline to be determined by the Committee, all the signed, legalized and/or certified undertakings as finally approved by the Committee.\n\n198.\n\nThe Committee considers that 60 calendar days, counted from the notification to the Parties of this Decision, is a reasonable period of time to receive the drafts for its approval, as referred above, and also for receiving all the signed, legalized and/or certified undertakings, also as referred above. In the latter case, the deadline will be counted from the notification of the approved final drafts.\n\n**V. DECISION AND ORDERS**\n--------------------------\n\n199.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Committee:\n\na. Decides that the stay of enforcement of the Award should be lifted provided that the Respondents comply with the following by December 31, 2020:\n\n(i) undertake not to use, and not to transfer or distribute to any shareholder of the InfraRed Capital Partners Group or to any third party (including investors in the InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure fund and/or to entitle any third party funder rights to collect), any amounts collected from the Kingdom of Spain under the Award. This undertaking shall be submitted in draft form to the Committee for its approval. Before doing so, the Committee will grant the Applicant an opportunity to comment on it. The undertaking will be valid and enforceable until the Decision on Annulment (if the Application is denied) or until the total recoupment of any collected amounts (if the Application is upheld), and must be executed in compliance with any relevant formalities existing under English law; and\n\n(ii) provide an undertaking from their parent companies - InfraRed Partners LLP and InfraRed Capital Partners (Management) LLP-, assuming a guarantee in favor of the Applicant if for any reason the Applicant may not obtain the total recoupment of any amounts collected from the Kingdom of Spain by the Respondents under any enforcement proceedings, immediately after the Respondents being ordered to return those amounts to the Kingdom of Spain by the Committee in case of future annulment of the Award. This undertaking shall be submitted in draft form to the Committee for its approval. Before doing so, the Committee will grant the Applicant an opportunity to comment on it. The undertaking will be valid and enforceable until the Decision on Annulment (if the Application is denied) or until the total recoupment of any collected amounts (if the Application is upheld), and must be executed in compliance with any relevant formalities existing under English law.\n\n(iii) If the Respondents are not willing or able to provide the above undertakings by December 31, 2020, the stay of enforcement of the Award should be continued unconditionally until the conclusion of the annulment proceeding.\n\nb.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns an application for annulment submitted by the Kingdom of Spain (\"**Application for Annulment**\") of the award rendered on August 2, 2019 (\"**Award**\") in the arbitration proceeding ICSID Case No. ARB/14/12 (\"**Arbitration\"**).\n\n2.\n\nThe Applicant is the Kingdom of Spain (\"**Applicant**\" or \"**Spain**\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondents on Annulment are InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure GP Limited, European Investments (Mor\u00f3n) 1 Limited, European Investments (Mor\u00f3n) 2 Limited, European Investments (Olivenza) 1 Limited and European Investments (Olivenza) 2 Limited (\"**InfraRed**\" or \"**Respondents**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Applicant and InfraRed are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**\", and individually referred to as a \"**Party**.\" The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn November 29, 2019, the Applicant filed the Application for Annulment, requesting the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award (\"**Stay Request**\") pursuant to Article 52(5) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\") and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n6.\n\nOn December 5, 2019, the ICSID Secretary-General registered the Application for Annulment and notified the Parties that, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n7.\n\nOn February 21, 2020, the *ad hoc* committee was constituted in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 6 and 53. Its members are: Jos\u00e9-Miguel J\u00fadice (a national of Portugal), President; Karim Hafez (a national of Egypt); and Yuejiao Zhang (a national of China) (\"**Committee**\"). Mr. Marco Tulio Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n8.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, the Committee fixed the written schedule regarding the Applicant's Stay Request. On that same date, the Committee proposed to hold a one-day hearing (with another day in reserve), for oral argument on the Stay Request, subject to the public health advisories of COVID-19.\n\n9.\n\nAlso on March 12, 2020, the Committee informed the Parties that it had decided to \"extend the provisional stay of enforcement of the award until it rule[d] on such request after receiving the parties' submissions to that effect.\"\n\n10.\n\nOn March 24, 2020, the Applicant filed a submission in support of the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award (\"**Stay Submission**\").\n\n11.\n\nOn April 15, 2020, the Committee held the first session with the Parties by video conference. During the session, the Parties confirmed their agreement that the Committee had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, and that they did not have any objections in this respect. The Parties also agreed on a number of procedural matters, including the possibility of holding a virtual instead of an in-person hearing, due to COVID-19 health constraints.\n\n12.\n\nOn April 16, 2020, the Respondents filed observations on the Applicant's Stay Submission (\"**Stay Response**\").\n\n13.\n\nOn April 23, 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"**PO1**\") concerning procedural matters. Annex A of PO1 contained the Procedural Calendar agreed by the Parties and approved by the Committee. The Calendar provided for an \"online hearing on 29 and 30 June 2020 (to be confirmed by the Committee in consultation with the Parties by 21 May 2020).\"\n\n14.\n\nOn April 30, 2020, the Applicant filed a reply to the Respondents' Stay Response (\"**Stay Reply**\").\n\n15.\n\nOn May 14, 2020, the Respondents filed their rejoinder to the Applicant's Stay Reply (\"**Stay Rejoinder**\").\n\n16.\n\nOn May 20, 2020, after receiving the last written submission on the Stay Request, the Committee consulted again with the Parties about holding a virtual hearing pursuant to Annex A of PO1.\n\n17.\n\nOn May 21, 2020, the Committee decided that a hearing would be held by video conference on June 29 and 30, 2020.\n\n18.\n\nOn June 22, 2020, a pre-hearing session between the Parties and the Committee was held by video conference to discuss any outstanding procedural, administrative, and logistical matters in preparation for the hearing. Participating were:\n\nMembers of the Committee\n\n- Prof. Jos\u00e9-Miguel J\u00fadice, President  \n- Dr. Karim Hafez, Member  \n- Prof. Yuejiao Zhang, Member\n\nICSID Secretariat:\n\n- Mr. Marco Tulio Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor, Secretary of the Committee  \n- Ms. Ivania Fernandez, ICSID\n\nOn behalf of the Applicant:\n\n- Mr. Rafael Gil Nievas  \n- Ms. Mar\u00eda del Socorro Garrido Moreno\n\nOn behalf of the Respondents:\n\n- Dr. Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Rueda Garc\u00eda  \n- Mr. Borja \u00c1lvarez Sanz\n\n19.\n\nOn June 26, 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 2 (\"**PO2**\") concerning the organization of the hearing.\n\n20.\n\nOn June 29 to 30, 2020, the Committee held a hearing on the Stay Request by video conference (\"**Stay Hearing**\"). Participating in the Stay Hearing were:\n\nMembers of the *ad hoc* Committee\n\n- Prof. Jos\u00e9-Miguel J\u00fadice, President  \n- Dr. Karim Hafez, Member  \n- Prof. Yuejiao Zhang, Member\n\nICSID Secretariat:\n\n- Mr. Marco Tulio Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor, Secretary of the Committee  \n- Ms. Ivania Fernandez, ICSID\n\nOn behalf of the Applicant:\n\n- Mr. Rafael Gil Nievas  \n- Ms. Mar\u00eda del Socorro Garrido Moreno\n\nOn behalf of the Respondents:\n\n- Mr. Alberto Fort\u00fan Costea  \n- Prof. Miguel G\u00f3mez Jene  \n- Dr. Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Rueda Garc\u00eda  \n- Mr. Borja \u00c1lvarez Sanz\n\n21.\n\nAt the end of the Stay Hearing, the Committee invited the Parties to file any additional request for new evidence by July 3, 2020.1\n\nStay Hearing Tr., Day 2, 227: 13-15.\n\n22.\n\nOn July 3, 2020, each Party filed a request for the Committee to decide on the admissibility of new evidence. The Respondents' communication also proposed an undertaking related to guarantees of recoupment by the Applicant if the stay was not maintained.\n\n23.\n\nOn July 8, 2020, the Applicant objected to the Respondents' letter of July 3, 2020, because it \"goes beyond that Committee's authorization and includes a point 2 not related at all with the petition to incorporate documents to the record.\" Consequently, the Applicant requested:\n\n\"(1) That the paragraph 2 of the Infrared's Letter regarding an \"undertaking\" is completely dismissed and considered as non-presented.\n\n(2) Subsidiarily, that leave is given to the Kingdom of Spain to respond to the misleading paragraph 2 of said Infrared's Letter.\"\n\n24.\n\nOn July 10, 2020, the Committee invited the Applicant to reply to the Respondents' letter of July 3 by July 15, 2020.\n\n25.\n\nOn July 15, 2020, the Applicant filed observations on the Respondents' letter of July 3, 2020. It first acknowledged that the Respondents had \"filed timely a document (the Letter) with a dual content: (1) petition to incorporate documents into the record; and (2) additional allegations regarding the stay of enforcement.\" The Applicant then argued that \"those additional comments improperly made by InfraRed must be completely sidelined, as they are not only out of the scope of Tribunal [sic] suggestion but also because they do not respond to any request made by InfraRed during the hearing.\"\n\n26.\n\nOn July 17, 2020, Spain filed its Memorial on Annulment (\"**Memorial**\"), together with Exhibits R-0393 to R-0398; Legal Exhibits RL-0148 to RL-0178, and the Legal Opinions of Prof. Ricardo Gosalbo Bono, Prof. Eduardo Demetrio Crespo and Messrs. Jos\u00e9 Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Rozas and Sixto A. S\u00e1nchez Lorenzo.\n\n27.\n\nOn July 21, 2020, the Committee informed the Parties that it had taken note of the Parties' communications (of July 3 and 15, 2020), and that it would determine in its decision on the Stay Request whether and how to consider the content of such letters.\n\n28.\n\nOn July 22, 2020, the Parties jointly submitted the agreed revisions to the Stay Hearing transcript.\n\n29.\n\nOn July 30, 2020, the Respondents informed the Committee that the Applicant had lodged, on July 22, 2020, an application for revision of the Award (\"**Application for Revision**\"). In their view, \"the circumstances surrounding this request are certainly exceptional, given the fact that Spain's Application for Revision, on one hand, overlaps with its Application for Annulment and, on the other hand, confirms InfraRed's arguments. However, the Application post-dates InfraRed's last written submission and, as a result, it could not have been submitted earlier.\" Therefore, the Respondents requested that the Committee:\n\n\"(i) accept InfraRed's request for leave to file into the record Spain's Application for Revision of July 22, 2020 together with this letter; (ii) order as soon as practicable the lift of the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award; and (iii) order Spain to bear all costs resulting from its application for stay of the enforcement.\"\n\n30.\n\nOn July 31, 2020, the Applicant objected to the Respondents' request of July 30, 2020 by arguing that:\n\n\"[i]n the same way as the ad hoc Committee strictly enforced the PO1 when required the Applicant to remove the InfraRed' s publicly available financial statements from the opening presentations in the stay of enforcement hearing, the ad hoc Committee must enforce the PO1 and directly and simply reject the InfraRed's Letter that contains confidential information.\"\n\n31.\n\nOn August 4, 2020, the Committee took note of the Parties' communications of July 30 and 31, 2020.\n\n32.\n\nOn August 7, 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 3 (\"**PO3**\") regarding the Parties' requests to introduce new documents to the record.\n\n33.\n\nOn August 10, 2020, the Applicant requested an extension until August 27 to file its submission pursuant to PO3.\n\n34.\n\nOn August 11, 2020, the Committee granted the Applicant's request of August 10, 2020.\n\n35.\n\nOn August 27, 2020, the Parties filed the new documents and/or submissions pursuant to PO3.\n\n36.\n\nOn August 27, 2020, the Applicant requested the Committee's leave to submit a new legal authority.\n\n37.\n\nOn August 28, 2020, the Committee invited the Respondents to comment on the Applicant's above request by September 3, 2020.\n\n38.\n\nOn September 2, 2020, the Respondents filed their comments on the Applicant's request of August 27, 2020.\n\n39.\n\nOn September 9, 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 4 (\"**PO4**\") regarding the requests of the Parties not yet decided in PO3.\n\n40.\n\nOn September 10, 2020, the Committee declared the stay of enforcement phase closed.\n\n41.\n\nOn October 22, 2020, the European Commission (\"**EC**\") filed an application for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party in the annulment proceeding (\"**EC Application**\"). The EC requested the Committee to allow it to file written *amicus curiae* submissions, have access to the documents filed in the case, and attend the hearing and present oral arguments.\n\n42.\n\nOn October 27, 2020, the Committee invited the Parties to submit comments on the EC's Application.\n\n43.\n\nOn October 27, 2020, the Committee issued its *Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award* (\"**Decision on Stay**\"). The Committee decided to lift the stay of enforcement of the Award provided that the \"Respondents comply with the following by December 31, 2020:\n\n(i) undertake not to use, and not to transfer or distribute to any shareholder of the InfraRed Capital Partners Group or to any third party (including investors in the InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure fund and/or to entitle any third party funder rights to collect), any amounts collected from the Kingdom of Spain under the Award. This undertaking shall be submitted in draft form to the Committee for its approval. Before doing so, the Committee will grant the Applicant an opportunity to comment on it. The undertaking will be valid and enforceable until the Decision on Annulment (if the Application is denied) or until the total recoupment of any collected amounts (if the Application is upheld), and must be executed in compliance with any relevant formalities existing under English law; and\n\n(ii) provide an undertaking from their parent companies -InfraRed Partners LLP and InfraRed Capital Partners (Management) LLP-, assuming a guarantee in favor of the Applicant if for any reason the Applicant may not obtain the total recoupment of any amounts collected from the Kingdom of Spain by the Respondents under any enforcement proceedings, immediately after the Respondents being ordered to return those amounts to the Kingdom of Spain by the Committee in case of future annulment of the Award. This undertaking shall be submitted in draft form to the Committee for its approval. Before doing so, the Committee will grant the Applicant an opportunity to comment on it.

THE RELIEF REQUESTED BY SPAIN**\n--------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe relief sought by Spain in its Memorial is the following:2\n\n\"a) Annul the Award in its entirety under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, on the grounds that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers in entering into the matter and conferring international protection on those who are not entitled to do so by coming to the Tribunal without clean hands;\n\nb) Annul the Award in its entirety under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, on the grounds that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by completely and utterly disregarding the application of international *ius cogens* and conferring protection on those who had acted on the basis of deceit and fraud in their investment process;\n\nc) Annul the Article 52(1)(e) Award in its entirety because the Award lacks any expression of reason for determining that the installed capacity is less than 50MW, thereby accepting the Claimants' misleading and fraudulent statement without justification;\n\nd) Annul the Award in its entirety under Article 52(1)(e) for lack of expression of reason, since the reasons given by the Tribunal for covering installed capacity of less than 50MW are manifestly insufficient, inadequate and openly contradictory;\n\ne) Annul the Award in its entirety under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, on the grounds that the Tribunal clearly exceeded its powers in rejecting the intra-EU objection and in hearing a dispute between an EU Member State and claimants from another EU Member State for which neither the United Kingdom nor the Kingdom of Spain had given its consent;\n\nf) Annul the Award in its entirety under Article 52(1)(e) for failure to express the reasons why it considers that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear a dispute between an alleged investor from an EU Member State and an EU Member State;\n\ng) Annul the Award in its entirety under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, on the grounds that the Tribunal clearly exceeded its powers by disregarding the application of applicable international law, including the ECT itself, and completely disregarding the application of all EU law;\n\nh) Annul the Award in its entirety under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, for failure to express the reasons why it disregards the application of applicable international law, including the ECT itself, and why it disregards the application of all EU law altogether\n\ni) Annul the Award in its entirety under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, on the ground that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers by making a manifestly incorrect application of the applicable law to be taken into account in assessing legitimate expectations;\n\nj) Annul the Award in its entirety under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention for failure to state the reasons for deciding on the date of the investment;\n\nk) Annul the Award in its entirety under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, for failure to state reasons in the findings on liability which determine that there are serious deficiencies in the Award as to the interpretation of how Article 10(1) of the ECT should be applied;\n\nl) Annul the Award in its entirety under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention for giving contradictory reasons concerning the expectations of Claimants regarding the immutability of the regulatory framework under which they made their investment and in the alleged violation thereof;\n\nm) Annul in part the Award under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, insofar as it relates to the determination of Damages, insofar as there is a clear failure to state reasons to understand the assessment made by the Tribunal, including the date of the investment and the date of valuation;\n\nn) Annul the Award under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, on the ground that the Tribunal committed a manifest error of assessment by awarding damages contrary to its findings on quantum;\n\no) Annul the Award in its entirety under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, for serious breach of essential procedural requirements in that the Tribunal committed multiple procedural violations concerning the evidentiary activity and the evaluation of evidence developed in the Arbitration;\n\np) Annul the Award in its entirety under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention for repeated failure to state reasons in relation to the evidentiary activity and the evaluation of the evidence developed in the Arbitration\n\n306. The Kingdom of Spain considers that the consideration by it of the facts described in this Memorial as constituting a certain ground for the annulment of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention does not prevent the *ad hoc* Committee from annulling the Award on the grounds that such facts constitute a ground for annulment different from Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6305-306.\n\n95.\n\nThe relief sought by Spain in the Reply and in the PHB is the following:3\n\n(1.)

SUMMARY OF SPAIN'S SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nSpain based its Memorial on Article 52(1)(b), (d) and (e) of the ICSID Convention, alleging:\n\n\"a. Manifest excess of powers and failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(b) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, respectively, as the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction in respect of a claim brought by European Union (\"EU\") corporations against an EU Member State. There was not only an excess of powers, but also a failure to state adequate reasons and open contradictions in the statements in the Award [\u2026];\n\nb. Manifest excess of powers and failure to state reasons, pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, respectively, as the Kingdom of Spain alleged and duly proved that the Claimants committed a gross fraud in their investment by accessing through false and fraudulent statements to subsidies to which they were not entitled [\u2026];\n\nc. Manifest excess of powers and failure to state reasons, pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) and Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, respectively, because, under Article 10(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty the Court's determination of liability for breach of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") was inconsistent and contradictory, unreasonable and unfounded. It failed to apply the appropriate law, in particular, the EU State Aid Law [\u2026];\n\nd. Manifest excess of powers and failure to state reasons, in accordance with Article 52 (1) (b) and 52 (1) (e) of the ICSID Convention [\u2026] as if EU law is understood to have been applied (quod non) there is a misapplication of the applicable law since the assessment of legitimate expectations must include whether a grant is lawful under the law applicable to the dispute, and under national law [\u2026];\n\ne. Failure to state reasons in accordance with Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention to the extent that in determining whether an investor might have a legitimate expectation the minimum required of an investment arbitration tribunal is that it reasonably determines when the investment should be deemed to have been made and what the valuation date is so as to be able to analyze the expectations it might have at that date and quantify the \"damage\", [\u2026] the Tribunal condemns the Kingdom of Spain to pay millions of euros for the breach of InfraRed's expectations without having justified the date of its investment and the date of valuation;\n\nf. Failure to state reasons, pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, because the Tribunal's determination of damages was inconsistent and contradictory, unreasonable and without foundation;\n\ng. Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention for: (i) allegedly obliterating the evidence presented by the Kingdom of Spain without assessing it, (ii) for allegedly shifting the burden of proof and making the Kingdom of Spain \"prove its innocence\", by determining that \"any non-existent or non-produced document is contrary to its interests\"; and (iii) by failing to \"analyze the evidence submitted, the existing case law in Spain on the changeability of subsidies within the principle of reasonable return, the outcome of the hearing and to make even the slightest reference to the evidence or the transcripts of the hearing, thereby substantially infringing the Kingdom of Spain's right of defense.\"4\n\nMemorial, \u00b63.\n\n97.\n\nSpain claimed that the Award has \"several omissions, inherent contradictions and conclusions based on invalid or null premises,\"5 in relation to jurisdiction, liability and the quantification of damages. Spain further asserted that the Award was \"primarily based on an [a]ward now annulled,\"6 and that all these alleged violations result in the \"breach of fundamental rules of procedure\" affecting Spain's rights of defense and fair trial.7\n\nMemorial, \u00b65.\n\nMemorial, \u00b65.\n\nMemorial, \u00b65.\n\n98.\n\nIn addition, in the Reply, Spain argued that it was exercising its right to request the annulment and not the appeal of the Award.\n\n99.\n\nIt reiterated that its submission of the \"manifest excess of powers\" standard was in line with all the precedents that have applied and analyzed Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and alleged that it had not waived its rights under the ICSID Convention.8\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b616-35.\n\n100.\n\nContrary to InfraRed's interpretation limiting this ground for annulment beyond what is permitted by the ICSID Convention, the Applicant argued in the Reply that it had submitted \"a very wide range of precedents to support the invoked grounds for annulment.\"9\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 40-42.\n\n**A. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT**\n-----------------------------\n\n101.\n\nSpain pointed to InfraRed's investments in solar thermal plants (Olivenza 1 and 2 and Mor\u00f3n 1 and 2, jointly the \"**Plants**\"), indicating that this took place \"on an undetermined date.\" Spain complained that the Award did not specify the reason for taking the \"28 July 2011\"10 as the date of the investment.11\n\nRL-0116, Previous Annex-001, *InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure GP Limited and Others v. The Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/12, Award, August 2, 2019, p. 7.\n\nMemorial, \u00b633.\n\n102.\n\nSpain argued that the Tribunal relied only on footnote 8 of the Award that referred to page 4 of the Quantum Brattle Report.12 But that page 4 of the Quantum Brattle Report \"says nothing about the date of the investment.\"13 It also argued that the Award incorrectly made reference to \"an alleged 2010 agreement\", \"indicating that the fact that '*de facto'* had not legally binding effects under Spanish law or that the exchanges were part of a larger consultative process required by Spanish administrative law is not decisive for this arbitration.\"14\n\nMemorial, \u00b633.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b633 and 35.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 34 quoting Award, \u00b6 427.\n\n103.\n\nSpain asserted that regarding jurisdiction, the Award \"wrongly and unfairly rejected the intra-EU objection.\"15 On liability, Spain recalled the position of the Parties that InfraRed expected a stable regulatory regime. \"Stable\" meaning \"no change in the RD 661/2007.\"16 Spain argued that there was no commitment of stabilization, and that the legitimate expectations must be objective and derived from specific circumstances at the time of the investment,17 and in any case, the host state has the right to review its regulatory regime to respond to serious economic factors such as the financial crisis and tariff deficit issue, and \"no subsidy regime could be expected to be maintained in the EU, which would be openly opposed to the legal system of State aid.\"18\n\nMemorial, \u00b636.\n\nMemorial, \u00b637.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b637-38.\n\nMemorial, \u00b638.\n\n104.\n\nIt further argued that the Award erred in referring to the *Eiser* award which had been annulled. The Applicant indicated that the Award \"justifies the 'legitimate expectations' and the alleged breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment [\"**FET**\"] requirement on the basis of non-existent of contradictory and inconsistent criteria [\u2026] without even entering into an analysis of EU law and its application to the case.\"19\n\nMemorial, \u00b642.\n\n105.\n\nSpain quoted the Tribunal's decision that there was no legitimate expectation of a freeze of the Original Regulatory Framework20 with regard to the remuneration system, nor the enactments. Spain considered that the Tribunal contradicted itself when it indicated that \"the essence of the breach does not consist of a reasonable rate of return variation, but in frustration of Claimants legitimate expectation that the Mor\u00f3n and Olivenza plants would be protected from revisions from the regulated tariff, the market price plus premium\"21, as well as the limits of RD 661/2007.22\n\nMemorial, \u00b645 quoting Award, \u00b6537.\n\nMemorial, \u00b645 quoting Award, p. 543.\n\nMemorial, \u00b645.\n\n106.\n\nThe Memorial further stated that despite the use of the DCF valuation method, the Tribunal \"dispenses with the application of regulatory risk principles and the illiquidity discount;\" this aspect generated a dissenting opinion on damages.23 The Applicant indicated that the Award did not include reasons affecting the calculation on damages, which merits an annulment on this point under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.24\n\nMemorial, \u00b646.\n\nMemorial, \u00b647.\n\n107.\n\nSpain requested the annulment of the Award on three grounds provided in Article 52(1), namely: (b), (d) and (e) of the ICSID Convention.25 Spain's position will be summarized in the following section.\n\nMemorial, \u00b649.\n\n**B. MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS**\n--------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nSpain submitted the following claims for annulment under the manifest excess of powers ground:\n\n\"1. By disregarding and failing to apply international *jus cogens* by granting protection to Claimants who came to the Tribunal without clean hands, because Claimants had committed a significant fraud on their investment by acceding to subsidies to which they had no rights through false and fraudulent statements, they were prevented from being protected internationally;\n\n2. By going beyond its jurisdiction in contravention of EU law which prevents a company incorporated in an EU country from having a claim against an EU Member State (intra-EU objection);\n\n3. By violating Article 10(1) TEC [26]by assuming jurisdiction and granting protection to the Claimants in an inconsistent manner, not applying the appropriate law, in particular, the EU State Aid Law;\n\n4. If EU law is deemed to have been applied (*quod non*), there is an incorrect application of the applicable law and a total failure to assess the Spanish legal system applicable to investors, which qualifies as manifestly exceeding their powers.\"27\n\nThe Committee prefers to refer to the Energy Charter Treaty as \"ECT\", and therefore any reference by a Party to \"TEC\" corresponds to the same treaty.\n\nMemorial, \u00b650.\n\n1. Introduction\n---------------\n\n109.\n\nIn relation to the standards of interpretation of the grounds for annulment, Spain's position is that Article 52(1)(b) is breached when a tribunal exceeds its powers initially granted by the parties' consent, when the tribunal omits to apply the appropriate law, or when the tribunal exceeds or lacks jurisdiction, or rules on a matter in which it does not have jurisdiction.28\n\nMemorial, \u00b652.\n\n110.\n\nBy quoting the decision from the committee in *Soufraki*, Spain explained its position that misapplication implies a \"serious and consequential misinterpretation or misapplication of the correct law, which no reasonable person (*bon p\u00e8re de famille*) could accept.\"29 In Spain's view, the Committee should review \"what the court has claimed to have done [and] what the Tribunal actually did in its effective reasoning\"30 meaning that there might be situations in which, despite the correct application of the law, a manifest excess of powers may still exist if it is evidenced that the Tribunal \"did not effectively apply the principles it had recognized.\"31\n\nMemorial, \u00b654 quoting RL-0086, Previous Annex-004, *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No ARB/02/7, Decision of the Ad hoc Committee on the Application for Annulment, June 5, 2007, \u00b6 86.\n\nMemorial, \u00b655.\n\nMemorial, \u00b655.\n\n111.\n\nMoreover, the reference to \"manifest\" is to be understood as being demonstrated if it is \"easy to understand.\"32 Spain also argued33 that a \"manifest excess of powers\" occurs when the Tribunal disregards the applicable law, or its misinterpretation or misapplication of the law is \"so gross or egregious that it substantially amounts to a failure to apply the correct law.\"34\n\nReply, \u00b648.\n\nMemorial, \u00b653.\n\nRL-0086, Previous Annex-004, *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v.

Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for Annulment of the Award, June 29, 2010.\n\n112.\n\nSpain quoted the committee in *Iberdrola v. Guatemala* to say that \"the Committee should review what the court has actually analyzed and argued [\u2026] The mere assertion by the court that it was applying the relevant law, or the absence of it, is not sufficient to decide on the matter\"35*.* It further argues that the *Kl\u00f6ckner I v. Indonesia* committee's decision conveyed the same idea.\n\nMemorial, \u00b655, quoting *Iberdrola Energ\u00eda v. Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/5, Decision on the Application for Annulment, January 13, 2015, \u00b6 97.\n\n113.\n\nSpain then indicated that in the *Sempra* committee's decision the fact that \"the Tribunal has not conducted its review on the basis that the applicable legal standard is found in Article XI of the BIT\" was emphasized,36 and in *Amco I*, the tribunal did not apply Indonesian law to the calculation of damages.37\n\nMemorial, \u00b659 quoting *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2010, \u00b6 209.\n\nMemorial, \u00b658.\n\n114.\n\nSpain also referred to the *Enron* committee decision when it determined that \"the Tribunal did not in fact apply Article 25(1)(a) of the Articles on State Responsibility (or, more precisely, the customary international law that that provision reflects), but instead relied on an expert opinion on an economic issue\"38 to exemplify a case of excess of powers. It further mentioned the *Venezuela Holdings* annulment committee that found that the court \"had not applied the correct law, nor had it given reasons.\"39\n\nMemorial, \u00b661 quoting *Enron*, Decision on the Application for Annulment dated July 30, 2010, \u00b6 377.\n\nMemorial, \u00b663, quoting *Venezuela Holdings B.V. and others v.

Ecuador* annulment committee that partially annulled that award for an inadequate award of compensation and indicated that the reasoning in that decision was applicable to the analysis of the present Committee.40 Spain quotes this decision to state that \"excess of powers can be committed both by overreach and by default\"41 and considers that to accept jurisdiction when it has not is clearly a manifest excess of powers,42 as is the case with intra-EU disputes. She argued that the present case merited the annulment on its entirety and only in the alternative \"should it be partially annulled and corrected.\"43\n\nMemorial, \u00b666.\n\nMemorial, \u00b665 and RL-0153, *Occidental Petroleum Corporation &amp; Occidental Exploration and Production Company v.

Manifest excess of powers by conferring protection to investors with unclean hands and by disregarding the application of international ius cogens and conferring protection on those who had acted on the basis of deceit and fraud in their investment process\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nIn its submission, Spain indicated that there is concurrence with the grounds of annulment. It explained that the \"doctrine of clean hands restricts the exercise of a right in cases where the person invoking it has acted in bad faith, fraudulently or illegally,\"44 and that it constitutes a general principle of international law applicable to every investment and every claim.45\n\nMemorial, \u00b669.\n\nMemorial, \u00b671.\n\n117.\n\nIn the *Plama* case, the tribunal stated that despite the fact that the Energy Charter Treaty (\"**ECT**\") did not make explicit reference to the \"conformity of the investment with a particular law\" this factor did not mean that the \"ECT covers all kinds of investment, including those contrary to the domestic or international law.\"46 Spain held that the *Plama* case is \"identical to the InfraRed case in which the Claimants made conscious misrepresentations to benefit from a subsidy system to which they would not have been entitled without that misrepresentation.\"47\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 71, quoting RL-0018, *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, August 27, 2008, \u00b6138.\n\nMemorial, \u00b675.\n\n118.\n\nSpain further argued that this reasoning synthesized the idea of clean hands and was applicable to the InfraRed case.48According to the Applicant, Article 27 of the 1997 Law49 required as an \"essential condition\" that to be eligible under RD 661/200750, the facilities had an \"installed capacity [not] exceeding 50 MW\"51. Under the Applicant's view, InfraRed committed severe misrepresentations by declaring that \"its installed capacity was 50 MW, although it was considerably higher.\"52 By doing such \"misrepresentations\", and according to Professor Demetrio Report (\"**Demetrio Report**\")53 InfraRed incurred in two criminal offenses: (i) subsidy fraud, and (ii) a crime of falsehood in a public document.54\n\nMemorial, \u00b674.\n\nR-0003, Law 54/1997 of 27 November 1997 on the Electricity Sector.\n\nR-0062, Royal Decree 661/2007 of 25 May 2007.\n\nMemorial, \u00b676 quoting RL-0157, *Nextera Energy Global Holdings BV and Nextera Energy Spain Holdings BV v.

By not matching them, a fraud and misrepresentation of the real installed capacity was committed in order for InfraRed to benefit illegally from a privileged subsidy regime to which it was not entitled.\"61\n\nReply, \u00b683.\n\n123.\n\nSpain also claimed that the Tribunal \"did not elaborate on the matter and merely made reference to the *Eiser* award, which has been annulled.\"62\n\nReply, \u00b651.\n\n124.\n\nContrary to InfraRed's submission, Spain contended in its Reply that the issue of clean hands was essential during the proceeding to the extent that it was raised as a preliminary question before going into the merits in section VI.A of the Award.63 The effect of having a capacity higher or lower than 50MW was central to the proceeding,64 and Spain demonstrated that the capacity was higher and that the Claimants had fraudulently altered the nameplate indicating the installed capacity.65\n\nReply, \u00b659.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61.\n\nAward, pp. 327-331.\n\n125.\n\nSpain further added that it never waived this argument,66 and the proof of this was that some of the relevant awards on the theory of \"clean hands\", such as the *Plama v. Bulgaria* award, were included in the record.67\n\nReply, \u00b665.\n\nReply, \u00b668.\n\n3. Manifest excess of powers by not accepting the intra-EU objection and hearing a dispute between claimants from an EU Member State and an EU State\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nSpain argued that the Tribunal did \"exceed its powers by going beyond its jurisdiction\"68 when hearing a case between a company from an EU Member State and a Member State, breaching EU law. Spain quotes the report of Professor Gosalbo (\"**Gosalbo Report**\")69 to explain why the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear the InfraRed claim.\n\nMemorial, \u00b687.\n\nThe Gosalbo Report has been submitted on the record of this proceeding with the Memorial.\n\n127.\n\nContrary to InfraRed position, previous awards in similar cases, are not relevant, as \"the real sources of international law are (a) the Conventions; (b) the International Custom and (c) the General Principles of Law\"70 and therefore \"judicial decisions are not source of public international law.\"71 And what is more, the \"parrot effect\" had allowed more recent judicial decisions to reproduce blindly what others have decided previously, although erroneously.72\n\nMemorial, \u00b691.\n\nMemorial, \u00b690; Spain's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n\nMemorial, \u00b690; Spain's PHB, \u00b6 48.\n\n128.\n\nSpain argued that the principle of primacy of EU law, stated in Declaration 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"**TFEU**\")73, mandates that \"within the EU, the Member States have decided that, for the purposes of self-organization and as a necessary precondition for their integration, EU law should apply to intra-Community matters, while international conventions remain in force for relations with third countries.\"74\n\nR-0006, Previous Annex-044, EU Treaty, Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and Charter DD.FF.

Komstroy*.88\n\nTo the contrary, InfraRed by letter of August 3, 2021, called the attention of the Committee to the decision rendered by the *ad hoc* committee in the annulment proceeding of the award rendered in *Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l. and Energia Termosolar BV (formerly Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0 r.l. and Antin Energia Termosolar BV) v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31). The Decision was rendered on July 30, 20211 and made public on August 2, 2021, through *IA Reporter* (*https://www.iareporter.com/articles/100-million-eur-antin-v-spain-award-withstands-annulment-shortly-after-the-european-commission-lodges-investigation-into-the-underlying-award/**).*\n\nThe Committee has been made aware of the judgement by a letter from Spain, received on September 10, 2021.\n\n134.\n\nSpain considered that \"the issues analysed by the EU Court of Justice in the *Moldova v. Komstroy* Judgment go to the very core of a particularly relevant ground for annulment raised by the Kingdom of Spain: that the Tribunal manifestly lacked jurisdiction for this intra-EU case and therefore committed a manifest extralimitation.\"89\n\nSpain letter received by the Committee on September 10, 2021.\n\n135.\n\nSpain also quoted from the above judgement the CJEU's clear conclusion that there never was an offer to arbitrate made by Spain to intra-EU investors: \"Article 26(2)(c) ECT must be interpreted as not being applicable to disputes between a Member State and an investor of another Member State concerning an investment made by the latter in the first Member State.\"90\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n136.\n\nSpain also posited that the Tribunal did not analyze all the rules of interpretation provided for in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"), arguing that the only good faith interpretation of the VCLT would deny the possibility of an intra-EU arbitration of the basis of the ECT,91 and merely stated that there was no disconnection clause. It also misapplied Article 1(3) of the ECT and the transfer of competences from states to the EU, which therefore resulted in an \"inappropriateness of the application of the Article 26 ECT to the intra-EU disputes.\"92\n\nSpain's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 38-47.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6104; Spain's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6102-114.\n\n137.\n\nIn a subsidiary way, Spain argued that if Article 26 ECT was deemed to cover intra-Community disputes, such interpretation would conflict with EU law, and that conflict must be resolved in favor of EU law.93\n\nMemorial, \u00b6105.\n\n138.\n\nSpain quoted the *Achmea* Judgement to indicate that \"the EU Treaties have always prohibited EU Member States from offering to settle investor-state disputes within EU before international arbitration tribunals\"94 and this prohibition includes multilateral agreements such as the ECT. However, according to Spain, the Tribunal refused to give proper value to the *Achmea* Judgement.95\n\nMemorial, \u00b6107.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6108.\n\n139.\n\nThe principle of primacy of EU law operates as conflict rule under international law, meaning that \"ECT cannot be applied in intra-Community relations,\"96 as in the present dispute, that concern \"purely intra-EU relations and does not involve any third country or its investors.\"97 Spain's position is that Article 26 ECT is not applicable and could not have led to a valid arbitration agreement.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6111; Spain's PHB, \u00b6\u00b684-87.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6111.\n\n140.\n\nIn conclusion, Spain argued that the Award should be annulled pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention because the Tribunal exceeded its power by declaring jurisdiction in an intra-EU dispute.98\n\nMemorial, \u00b6114; Reply, \u00b6\u00b652-56.\n\n141.\n\nIn addition, Spain insisted in the Reply that it was \"not using this procedure as an appeal or re-arbitrating the dispute.\" Spain was \"not asking this Committee to correct the Tribunal's incorrect understanding of the disputed measures or of the concept of reasonable profitability in the Spanish regulation of the Electricity Sector.\"99The Applicant was simply \"asking this Committee to determine whether the Tribunal declared its jurisdiction beyond what it was entitled to under international law.\"100\n\nReply, \u00b698.\n\nReply, \u00b698.\n\n142.\n\nSpain reiterated that the Tribunal incurred in this ground by omitting the fact that according to ECJ \"there is no possibility of investment arbitration between a company of a EU Member State and a Member State.\"101 The Applicant stated in the Reply that the fact that previous tribunals have ruled similarly to the Award was not a serious argument against what InfraRed defended.102 As indicated by Spain, Article 25 of the ECT recognized the primacy of EU law,103 and therefore, in accordance with the conflict rule in the TFEU, Article 26 of the ECT could not be applied in intra-EU relations.104 In other words, the Award did not recognize the primacy of EU law. The European Commission, in its *amicus curiae* brief, submitted as authorized by the Committee by PO 5, sided with Spain and stated that \"the Arbitral Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by finding that the intra-EU application of the ECT was compatible with the EU Treaties, and that the findings of the CJEU in *Achmea* did not apply to the ECT.

It has disregarded the findings in paragraphs 159 to 166 of Commission Decision SA.40348. As set out above at paragraph 82, that Decision is manifestly part of the law to be applied by the Arbitral Tribunal.

Manifest excess of powers by disregarding the applicable law: EU law must be applied to the merits of the dispute\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nSpain alleged that on the merits there were also grounds of annulment since the Tribunal also exceeded its powers by disregarding the application of EU law.108 By pointing to the Article 38 ICJ Statute, Spain argued that it necessarily led to the application of EU law and the TFEU provision related to state aid,109 which had not been considered by the Tribunal.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6115.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6118.\n\n146.\n\nIn addition, Spain argued that EU regulations on state aid were part of international custom applicable to EU Members, and that the Tribunal did not apply this source of international law. Instead, the Tribunal considered that EU state aid law was not \"relevant to the analysis of whether the Spain violated a specific commitment made to the CSP sector,\"110 manifestly exceeding its powers.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6122 quoting Award, \u00b6443.\n\n147.\n\nAccording to Spain, the Tribunal's analysis violated the ECT itself, ignoring other international treaties and Article 38 of the ICJ Statute, as Article 26(6) of the ECT indicates that arbitral tribunals should consider in their decisions \"Treaties and applicable rules of international law in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules of international law.\"111 Spain posited that \"the Award openly violates this rule and indicates that EU law is 'largely irrelevant', when the ECT indicates that the 'applicable rules of international law' must be applied.\"112 In sum, the Tribunal omitted the application of the TFEU and of the EU state aid rules relevant for the decision.113 Therefore, by denying the value of the EU treaties, the Tribunal exceed its powers.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6126.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6127.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6128.\n\n148.\n\nSpain reiterated in its Reply that according to Article 38 of the ICJ Statute the autonomy and primacy of EU law must be respected internationally.114 This practice has been followed by EU Member States and the entire international community regarding the interrelationship between international treaties and EU law,115 reflecting that EU law and the EU and the Member States have disconnected from international conventions in favor of EU law for intra-EU matters, providing for many examples. This disconnection is precisely an external aspect of the autonomy and primacy of EU law in regulating intra-EU matters, also confirmed by the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ECT,116 and constitutes a practice that has been respected not only by Member States but also by third States.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 169-173.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 175-192; Spain's PHB, \u00b6\u00b670-74.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 192; Spain's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 177-187.\n\n149.\n\nSpain argued that this practice must also be respected by arbitration tribunals, which cannot act outside and contrary to the first source of international law or ignore EU law. Nonetheless, Tribunal described EU law in the Award as highly irrelevant, thereby underlining the fact that the Award itself must necessarily be annulled because it disregards the applicable law.117\n\nReply, \u00b6194-197.\n\n150.\n\nAlso in its Reply, Spain explained that there is an *opinio juris* on the autonomy and primacy of EU law,118 there is a practice by EU Member States of respecting the EU legal regime on state aid as part of the core of the EU and \"must be considered \"highly relevant\" as, for example, the *BayWa* award does.119\n\nReply, \u00b6 198-210.\n\nSee RL-0236, *BayWa r.e. renewable energy GmbH and BayWa r.e.

Manifest excess of powers by making a manifestly incorrect application of the applicable law in assessing legitimate expectations.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nIn a subsidiary way, Spain alleged that in case it is considered that EU law has been applied by the Tribunal, \"this would have resulted in a grotesque and incorrect application of EU law that should lead to the annulment of the Award\"120 because, the \"aid schemes for renewables should have been notified to the European Commission and they were not,\"121 and this implies that \"under EU law, there was no legitimate expectation that this subsidy would remain petrified.\"122 Therefore, by disregarding state aid regulations, the Tribunal also incurred in a manifest excess of power.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6133.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6134.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6135.\n\n152.\n\nSpain recalled in the Reply that the Spanish subsidy scheme that InfraRed invoked in the Arbitration was set up in accordance with Directive 2001/77123. Therefore, in accordance with the state aid guidelines and pursuant to Article 4 of this Directive, the subsidies were state aid, which had to be communicated to and approved by the European Commission.124\n\nR-0066, Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 27 September 2001.\n\nReply, \u00b6 228.\n\n153.\n\nLike in *BayWa v. Spain,*125 the original regime of RD 661/2007 was illegal as it had not been communicated to the EC. It is common practice that no one can expect to consolidate a result that was not authorized by law at the time of the investment.126\n\nRL-0185, *BayWa r.e. renewable energy GmbH and BayWa r.e.

With manifest disregard for the TFEU, both as law and as fact, the Award indicated that this \"right\" to petrification of subsidies did exist.127\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6225-227.\n\n155.\n\nIn the PHB, Spain added that the \"basis upon which the Arbitral Tribunal decided to hold Spain liable for its failure to comply with its obligations under the ECT is meritless, as according to the applicable law, under no circumstances there could be any 'legitimate expectations' to the continuance of the disputed subsidies for more than two decades, given that according to applicable EU state aid law they could be amended at whatever moment to adjust not only to the domestic law, but also, and even more relevant, to this special EU legal regime on State Aid.\"128\n\nSpain's PHB, \u00b6208.\n\n156.\n\nTherefore, by \"manifestly misapplying EU law in both respects,\" Spain argued that the Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers for the purposes of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.129\n\nReply, \u00b6238.\n\n6. Manifest error of assessment by awarding damages contrary to its findings on quantum\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nSpain argued that there was a clear contradiction in terms of liability and damages, and that without justification the Tribunal adopted the DCF calculation proposed by Brattle rejecting the alternative solution by Accuracy.130\n\nMemorial, \u00b6247.\n\n158.\n\nSpain further stated that the Award \"completely dispenses with the application of regulatory risk principles and the illiquidity discount,\"131 and quoted the dissenting opinion of Professor Pierre-Dupuy in footnote 782 of the Award.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6248.\n\n159.\n\nThis position has been repeated and developed in the Reply, in which Spain stated that \"The Kingdom of Spain continues to maintain that there is an indisputable inconsistency between the award's decision on damages and the damages actually calculated, which constitutes a ground for annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, or as the case may be, under Article 52(1)(b) of that Convention.\"132\n\nReply, \u00b6429.\n\n160.\n\nSpain stated that, \"as the case may be,\" the alleged facts might also constitute a manifest excess of powers that justifies the annulment of the award, under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.133\n\nReply, \u00b6429.\n\n**C. FAILURE TO STATE REASONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nIn relation to the ground of failure to state reasons, in Article 52(1)(e), Spain argued that the Tribunal \"failed to provide express, adequate and sufficient reasons concerning (1) the applicability of EU law, (2) the conclusions of the Court regarding the installed capacity of the plants, (3) the date of the investment, (4) the findings of the Court regarding liability, (5) and the quantification of the damages.\"134\n\nMemorial, \u00b6139.\n\n1. Introduction\n---------------\n\n162.\n\nSpain explained at the outset the scope and content of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention and its relationship with Article 48(3) of the same instrument. For that purpose, it indicated that annulment committees have \"uniformly established\" that Article 48(3) and 52(1)(e) require that the ruling allows the reader \"to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B*.*\"135 It further quotes *Amco I* to clarify that \"supporting reasons must be more than a matter of nomenclature and must constitute an appropriate foundation for the conclusions reached through such reasons\".136\n\nMemorial, \u00b6141 quoting RL-0124, Previous Annex-016, *Maritime International Nominees Establishment (MINE) v.

Argentina* committee, stated that \"the task of the *ad hoc* committees under Article 52(1)(e) is to determine whether there is a comprehensive and consistent reasoning on the part of the tribunal.\"137 Equally relevant is the need to ensure that parties are able to understand a ruling, as the *Tidewater* committee recognized,138 and the *Soufraki* committee clarified that \"insufficient and inadequate reasons lead to [\u2026] annulment.\"139\n\nMemorial, \u00b6142.\n\nMemorial 143 quoting *Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v.

Failure to state reasons as to why the Award disregards the application of EU law, both in the determination of lack of jurisdiction (to hear a dispute between an alleged investor from a EU Member State and a EU Member State) of the Tribunal, and to the merits\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n166.\n\nSpain argued that there is a concurrence of the grounds of annulment because, as explained, during the Arbitration it argued that EU law was applicable, affecting both jurisdiction and the merits.142 However, the Tribunal \"does not answer these questions and the few observations it makes, are manifestly contradictory.\"143\n\nMemorial, \u00b6151.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6151.\n\n167.\n\nIn Spain's view the Tribunal contradicted itself when it recognized that EU is \"an undeniable part of the body of international law\" but at the same time declared that \"the provisions of EU law are neither dispositive nor relevant to the resolution of the questions raised\" in the present dispute.144\n\nMemorial, \u00b6157 quoting the Award, \u00b6272; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 357-358.\n\n168.\n\nSpain reiterated in its PHB that the Award did not address the issue of primacy of EU law over the ECT. Nor did it address the topic of which treaty would be considered more favorable to the investors of the investment, as per Article 16 of the ECT.145 Nor it examined why the ECT should be considered more favorable than the regime of EU law.146 Specifically, Spain argued that \"the ECT was ratified by Member States and the EU on the understanding that the ECT would not apply to intra-EU controversies and that the principle of the primacy of EU law was going to be accepted and respected as customary it has been respected in the international order.\"147 Therefore, the primacy of the EU was a conflict rule with priority over Article 16 of the ECT.148\n\nSpain's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 5-17.\n\nSpain's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 84-92.\n\nSpain's PHB, \u00b627.\n\nSpain's PHB, \u00b697.\n\n169.\n\nSpain posited that the Tribunal \"rejects the application of EU law as 'highly irrelevant' without giving any justification.\"149 In this aspect, Spain quoted paragraph 443 of the Award that states that \"[t]he Tribunal is prepared to accept that remuneration under the Special Scheme may have been considered as 'State aid'\", the purpose of which is to provide investors with a reasonable rate of return. But this is not relevant to the analysis of whether Spain violated a specific commitment made to the CSP sector*.*\"150\n\nMemorial, \u00b6153.\n\nAward, \u00b6443.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal did not explain \"why it understands that there is 'no indication' that the subsidy scheme [\u2026] could be changed.\"151\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6160, 161.\n\n171.\n\nAfter declaring that EU law was applicable, the Award rejected the application of the TFEU and its Articles 107 and 108 and the state aid scheme152 without justification. In Spain's words, \"a mere reading of the Award, denotes that the Tribunal did not give sufficient reasons in the terms required by Article 52(1)(e),\"153 and particularly regarding its change on the priority of sources in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6163.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6165.\n\n172.\n\nSpain further argued that there is a lack of reasoning as to why the EU rules on state aid and the EC Decision should not be taken into account,154 despite the Parties' arguments on this issue, which the Tribunal decides in the \"operative part of the Awards by downgrading the very international law that the Tribunal declares applicable to the category of 'highly irrelevant.'\"155 Therefore, the Award falls into the annulment ground of Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6166.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6167.\n\n173.\n\nSpain reiterated in its Reply that there was concurrence of grounds for annulment under Articles 52(1)(b) and 52(1)(e) of the Convention. On one hand, the Tribunal's conclusion disregarding EU law, including EU's international treaties, constitutes a \"manifest overreaching.\" On the other hand, the lack of reasons and explanatory grounds is also a ground for annulment.156\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6221, 238-239.\n\n3. Failure to state reasons, or reasoning that is insufficient, inadequate and contradictory, in the determination of installed power\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nSpain reiterated that the installed capacity was a key issue because if the installed capacity of the Olivenza 1 and Mor\u00f3n Plants were above the 50 MW threshold, they did not \"comply with the condition of access to the RRE\"157 and therefore, the installation would have unduly benefited from the special aid scheme. As explained in a report submitted by Spain in the Arbitration, \"the actual installed or nominal power or capacity of both Olivenza 1 and Mor\u00f3n CSP plants are certainly higher than 50 and 49.9 MW respectively*.*\"158 Spain argued that, despite this submission, and the fact that InfraRed did not provide a similar report as recognized by the Tribunal, it limited itself to making reference to the *Eiser* award.159\n\nMemorial, \u00b6173.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6179 quoting R-0384 Previous Annex-021, Report by Professor Casanova, Engineer, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, November 2016. Quoted in the hearing itself, R-0398 presentation \"Fundamental Facts\", slide 111.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6181.\n\n175.\n\nSpain further argued that, since *Eiser* was annulled in its entirety, it must be concluded that any reason supported by that award should be irrelevant in relation to the obligation vested in the Tribunal to state the reasons of its decision, including the reasons presented to conclude that the installed power was equal or less than 50MW.160\n\nMemorial, \u00b6183.\n\n176.\n\nIn addition to that, Spain argued that the Award also falls into this ground because of the absence of adequate reasons to proceed from point A to point B when \"it is stated that plants are remunerated on the basis of net production.\"161 In Spain's words the Tribunal assumed that the literal wording of Article 20 of RD 661/2007 supported this idea. However, \"nowhere in this provision it is stated that plants are remunerated on the basis of net production,\"162 and what it is indicated is that \"special system installations may incorporate into the system all the net electrical energy produced.\"163 Therefore, it is not clear how the Tribunal reached the conclusion that \"plants should be remunerated according to net production\"164 or why the \"net power\" variable was the most important.165\n\nMemorial, \u00b6187.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6188.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6189.\n\n177.\n\nSpain argued that paragraphs 335 and 329 of the Award were in clear contradiction. First, in paragraph 335 the Tribunal indicated that the experts seemed to be in agreement regarding the controversial technical concepts, in particular, the definition of \"gross installed power\", and \"installed power,\" and \"that installed power is generally lower than gross installed power as a result of the energy used by the equipment inside the plant, which extracts its electricity directly from the turbine.\"166\n\nMemorial, \u00b6190.\n\n178.\n\nHowever, in Spain's words, this assertion did not reflect Spain's expert opinion, reflected in paragraph 329, in the following terms:\n\n\"The Respondent's expert is of the opinion that the installed power of the plants exceeds 52.2 MWe. To arrive at this conclusion, Mr Casanova appears to have worked backwards from \"the net power discharged into the grid of the two plants in dispute, which he said is \"generally around 49.8 MWe\". Expert report on installed power, 30 November 2016, p. 32.\"\n\n179.\n\nIt was not possible for Spain's expert to consider that the installed power of the plants exceeds 52.2 MW \"as a consequence of differentiating this concept from that of net power discharged into the grid.\"167 Spain asserted that despite the doubts expressed by Spain as to the \"reliability of the contents of the type plates of the respective generators,\" it rejected the claims and assumed the reasoning of the *Eiser* award168 that does no longer exist.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6192.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6194-199.\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal left unresolved the issue of the veracity of the nominal power on the nameplates, and whether such nominal power corresponds to the concept of installed power expressed by the legislator.169\n\nMemorial, \u00b6199.\n\n181.\n\nIn the alternative, Spain argued that the conclusion that the capacity was less than 50MW lacked adequate grounds because Article 20 of RD 661/2007 does not indicate that net power is the most important variable.170 In addition, by stating that the experts where in agreements with regards to the concepts when they were not, the Tribunal contradicted itself without providing reasons for such assertion.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6200.\n\n182.\n\nSimilarly, in the Reply, the Applicant reiterated that the Award failed to provide reasons regarding the issue of the \"installed capacity,\" and given that this question was not addressed with its own reasoning but by full referencing to the reasoning of the *Eiser* award, the Award meets this ground of annulment.171\n\nReply, \u00b6367.\n\n183.\n\nRegarding the alleged inconsistency between paragraphs 329 and 335 of the Award, the Applicant argued that, even accepting InfraRed\u00b4s position that paragraph 329 referred to a question of installed power and gross power, and paragraph 335 to the question of installed power and net power, there was a flagrant absence of reasons with which to resolve the question of the overweighting of the plants, as there is no way showed the reasons why it could be concluded that when the legislator refers to 'installed power' in the terms in which it does in Articles 27 and 30(4) of the LSE it is referring to net power and not to gross power.172\n\nReply, \u00b6374.\n\n4. Failure to state reasons in relation to the decision of the date of the investment\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nSpain presented an additional ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(e) for the Award's failure in providing reasons for setting July 28, 2011 as the date of the applicant's investment.173\n\nMemorial, \u00b6202.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to this date \"without any reference to or analysis of the doubts raised by [sic] Spain regarding the reasons why InfraRed would have preferred to invest in 2011 instead of 2008 when [\u2026] the risks were mostly technical.\"174\n\nMemorial, \u00b6209.\n\n186.\n\nSpain argued that the Tribunal relied only on footnote 8 of the Award that referred to page 4 of the Quantum Brattle Report,175 but that page 4 of such report \"says nothing about the date of the investment.\"176\n\nMemorial, \u00b633.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b633 and 35.\n\n187.\n\nIn its Opening Statement, Spain explained that \"the fund tried to invest in these plants in 2008, when the project was starting; whereas, very surprisingly, it was not until 2011 when the investment was made. Spain complained and found illogical that InfraRed refrained from investing in those plants in 2008, when the plan[t]s were just at the promotional stage and the risk was mainly technical, and decided to invest almost four years later, when the risk was much bigger. However, the Tribunal arrives directly to this conclusion, to this date of July 28th, 2011, without any reference to Respondent's doubts regarding the reason why InfraRed would have preferred to invest in 2011 rather than in 2008.\"177\n\nHearing Tr., Day 1, 13:57, lines 1-14.\n\n188.\n\nThis lack of analysis of Spain's arguments causes the annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(e) of ICSID Convention.\n\n5. Failure to state reasons for the Award in the conclusion on liability, in particular regarding the ECJ standard provided in Article 10(1) of the ECT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nAccording to Spain's position, in determining the scope of Article 10(1) ECT, in paragraphs 343-456 and 365-366 of the Award, the Tribunal stated that the frustration of a legitimate expectation \"implies, per se, a breach of the provisions of Art. 10(1) FTE, but only to the extent that such breach constitutes 'unfair and inequitable treatment.'\"178\n\nMemorial, \u00b6214.\n\n190.\n\nSpain argued that the Award \"does not express the *iter* that lead to such conclusion, nor does it express on which sources or hermeneutic criteria, of those provided for in the Vienna Convention it is relying for that purpose.\"179\n\nMemorial, \u00b6215.\n\n191.\n\nIn any event, according to Spain, the provisions of Article 10 ECT \"are extremely general and in no case can be considered as more favourable than the provisions of the EU law.\"180 In its PHB, Spain highlighted that tribunals differ on the imprecise definition of FET in the ECT, showing that EU law provided a more favorable regime181 to investors.\n\nSpain's PHB, \u00b698.\n\nSpain's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 93-101.\n\n192.\n\nHowever, in spite of Spain's explanations \"since the very beginning of the arbitration why the EU law was more favourable than the ECT, [\u2026] this has not even been addressed by the Award.\"182\n\nSpain's PHB, \u00b699.\n\n193.\n\nSpain insisted that \"it was not simply disagreeing with the Tribunal's decision, as indicated by InfraRed in its Counter-Memorial, but was asking that \"the Committee confirm whether the Award presented \"sufficiently pertinent reasons\"183 for concluding that Spain had breached Article 10(1) of the ECT.\"184\n\nRL-0164, *Amco Asia Corporation, et al. v.

Expression of contradictory reasons in the alleged violation of the Claimants' expectations about the stability of the Original Regulatory Framework\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nRegarding InfraRed's expectations about stability of the Original Regulatory Framework, Spain quoted paragraph 427 of the Award and asserted that \"it is surprising and contradictory that the Court rushes to recognize the value of the alleged agreement as a legally relevant fact,\"185 but at the same time the Award also omitted to weigh it against other facts, such as the later normative changes made by Spain prior to InfraRed's investment.186\n\nMemorial, \u00b6217.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n196.\n\nTherefore, Spain concluded that when the Award opts for crystallizing the legitimate expectations of InfraRed, it is contradictory by relying on \"constant jurisprudence of an arbitrary nature to sustain the scope of the ECJ not limited to non-discrimination, and to forget, however, all the jurisprudence emanating from the Spanish Supreme Court,\"187 as well as regulatory changes which had been declared in conformity with the law by the courts of justice in Spain, even before InfraRed's investment.188\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n197.\n\nSpain also pointed to paragraph 436 of the Award in which the Tribunal stated that there was no evidence \"between 29 December 2010 and 23 June 2011 that contradicts the reasonableness or legitimacy of the expectation.\"189 Spain argued that, contrary to the Tribunal's finding, it provided evidence in this respect by submitting in its Counter-Memorial an analysis of jurisprudence by the Supreme Court related to the incentive system and regulatory changes before Claimants' investment,190 in particular the Ruling of 25 October 2006 that stated that \"the changes in remuneration do not contradict the principles of legal certainty and legitimate expectations\" as long as the principle of reasonable profitability is respected.191\n\nMemorial, \u00b6219.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6222.\n\n*Ibid.*, citing R-0077, Judgment of the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of 25 October 2006 (Rec. 12/2005).\n\n198.\n\nSpain further highlighted that the Tribunal contradicted itself on paragraph 371 indicating that the \"jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court\" was included in its reasoning, when in fact Spain had demonstrated that this was not the case.192 Therefore, the statement that the Tribunal did not find evidence before the date of the investment which contradicted InfraRed's expectations was inadmissible.193\n\nMemorial, \u00b6226.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6227.\n\n199.\n\nSpain further alleged a failure to state adequate reasons in relation to the alleged violation of Claimants' expectations about the stability of the Original Regulatory Framework. Spain pointed out a contradiction between paragraphs 366 and 427 of the Award. It said that while paragraph 366 recognized that \"stability\" does not amount to a \"limitation on a state sovereignty in the absence of the specific manifestation of consent by the host state\"194, paragraph 427 \"recognizes the alleged agreement as a legally relevant fact,\" without explaining how the press release from the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce, and subsequent resolutions of December 2010 would prevail over the \"normative and jurisprudential antecedents\" reiterated and produced \"since a decade\" before the investment.195\n\nMemorial, \u00b6232.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6233.\n\n200.\n\nTherefore, Spain argued that the \"shortcomings in the reasoning of the Award with regard to the ECJ principle in Article 10(1) ECT are obvious\"196 and constitute grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6242.\n\n201.\n\nIn the Reply, the Applicant argued that it was not simply disagreeing with the Tribunal's decision, as indicated by InfraRed in its Counter-Memorial, but was asking that the Committee confirm whether the Award presented sufficiently pertinent reasons197 for concluding that Spain had breached Article 10(1) of the ECT.198\n\nRL-0164, *Amco Asia Corporation, et al. v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on the Application for Annulment, May 16, 1986, \u00b6 43.\n\nReply, 376-377.\n\n202.\n\nIt reiterated that it was not turning this annulment into a sort of appeal or second instance199 but rather, highlighted in the Reply \"the numerous essential aspects in which the Tribunal either does not give reasons, or the reasons it does give are incoherent if not contradictory, affecting the legitimacy of the proceedings and of the Award.\"200\n\nReply, \u00b6381.\n\nReply, \u00b6 381-385.\n\n203.\n\nSpain further added in the Reply that \"there is no way of knowing the specific evidence by which the [Tribunal] concludes that the FET standard is unrelated to discrimination, and inextricably linked to the frustration of legitimate expectations.\"201 Thereby, the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its finding that Spain infringed the ECT.202\n\nReply, \u00b6385.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6384-400.\n\n7. Failure to state reasons when calculating damages\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nIn addition to the already invoked lack of justification as to why the Tribunal adopted the DCF calculation,203 the Applicant in its Reply argued that there was lack of reasoning in the Award in relation to the regulatory risk and the illiquidity discount applied, having a significant impact on the quantum (the object of this ground for annulment). Therefore, there was a serious breach of the fundamental rule of procedure concerning the burden of proof in relation to a number of assumptions which had an impact on the Tribunal's decision on the quantification of damages. Those hypotheses or assumptions (analyzed in the previous plea) related to management fees and the value of the debt.204\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6247-250.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 401-402.\n\n205.\n\nAfter pointing to several parts of the exhibits, the Applicant asserted in its Reply that the Tribunal adopted Brattle's position without considering that the position by Accuracy was objectively supported by external sources.205\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6416-425.\n\n206.\n\nThe Applicant highlighted in its Reply that \"the fact that one member of the Tribunal refers to evidentiary documents in the record that contradict the unsupported opinion of the rest of the Tribunal shows that there is a clear lack of reasoning for adopting Brattle's position and discarding Accuracy's position on regulatory risk and the illiquidity discount.\"206\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 426-428.\n\n207.\n\nThe Applicant reiterated in the Reply its position that there was an indisputable inconsistency between the Award's award of damages and the damages actually calculated, and that constituted a ground of partial annulment under Articles 52(1)(e) and (b) of the Convention.\n\n8. Failure to state reasons in relation to the evidentiary activity and the evaluation of the evidence developed in the Arbitration\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nIn particular, Spain argued that paragraphs 321-456, and in particular paragraphs 406-456 of the Award, included no more than \"very scarce reference to the evidentiary activity developed in the oral hearing [\u2026] since only a couple of aspects of the statements of one of the witnesses are mentioned.\"207\n\nMemorial, \u00b6268.\n\n209.\n\nAs an example, Spain mentioned that Mr. Carlos Montoya's testimony was not used when the Tribunal evaluated the standard of the ECJ.208 Similarly, the Tribunal rarely referred to the testimony of Mr. Santiago Caravantes.209 Those testimonies have been \"completely obliterated\" in the Award.210\n\nMemorial, \u00b6269.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6270.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6273.\n\n210.\n\nSpain \"insist[s] that it is not that the Tribunal has analyzed the content of their documents and statements and decided to give them more or less credibility in the face of other evidence; it is that the Award has simply been written as if they did not exist. And it does not seem far-fetched to say that the first requirement of the right to be heard is that at least a minimal value be placed on the evidence offered in defense.\"211\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n211.\n\nSpain reiterated in its Reply that its Application for Annulment under Convention Article 52(1)(d) is that \"this plea be upheld on the basis of a failure to assess the evidence provided by the Kingdom of Spain,\"212 not on determining the application of this legal standard as claimed by InfraRed213 in the sense that \"the evidence presented by both parties must necessarily be given the same weight or value.\"214\n\nReply, \u00b6272.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n212.\n\nThe Applicant alleged that it had carried out an enormous amount of evidentiary work, and the serious anomaly of the contested Award is found in paragraphs 321-456, and in particular in paragraphs 406-456. The anomaly was flagrant because, although the Award contained the reasoning for Spain's declaration of international liability, if analyzed impartially, there was a complete absence of an exhaustive and conclusive analysis of the evidence provided by Spain. Such analytical activity is unavoidable to ensure due respect for the essential principles of procedure, the infringement of which is complained of in this annulment proceeding. In that regard, the Applicant emphasized that it was not merely complaining of the improper assessment of the evidence but of the absolute failure to assess it.215\n\nReply, \u00b6284.\n\n213.\n\nSpain argued in the Reply that the discretion of the Tribunal in assessing the evidence did not allow for violations of essential rules such as the right to be heard or the rule on the burden of proof.216 As an example of its position, the Applicant quoted paragraph 438 of the Award to say that the Tribunal's duty was not to accept or reject the Parties' theses, but to verify them, in light of the evidence provided.217 However, the Applicant alleged that the Tribunal, on the basis of its own conclusions on one of the key issues in this case, such as the existence or not of specific remuneration commitment for the Mor\u00f3n and Olivenza plants, concluded that no further evidence was necessary to assess the international liability of Spain.218\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6285-289.\n\nReply, \u00b6290.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6291-296.\n\n214.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal opted for the \"reversal of the burden of proof in relation to the due diligence issue\" in spite of the fact that it \"establishes the need to subject InfraRed to a stricter standard of due diligence than other cases in confluence with the nature of the sector in which they invested and their expectations regarding the main source of income (*i.e.*, government subsidies).\"219\n\nMemorial, \u00b6287.\n\n**D. SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Introduction\n---------------\n\n215.\n\nSpain argued that according to Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention \"a deviation is serious if a party is deprived of the protection afforded by the relevant procedural rule.\"220 Similarly, a \"procedural rule is fundamental if it refers to the essential fairness that must govern all proceedings and is included within the standards of 'due process' required by international law.\"221\n\nMemorial, \u00b6252.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n216.\n\nIt emphasized that the \"right of a party to be heard\" included the right of a party to present arguments and evidence, within an \"comparative equal opportunity.\"222 It stressed that right to be heard was infringed when a party did not have the opportunity to \"respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other party.\"223 Spain further made reference to the decisions of other annulment committees, such as in *Pey Casado v. Chile*.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6254.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6257.\n\n217.\n\nSpain stated that the unjustified refusal by a tribunal of a party's request for the production of documents is also an example of a violation of the right to be heard, in particular when the tribunal concludes that evidence was absent in the case, \"after refusing to produce the documents.\"224\n\nMemorial, \u00b6259.\n\n218.\n\nSpain reiterated in its Reply the existence of a serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure and cited four awards that had recognized this ground of annulment.225Also, Spain argued that the Tribunal committed a series of breaches in relation to the assessment of evidence in the underlying proceeding.226 Notably, it erred in applying the basic procedural principle of the burden of proof and concluded that the absence of legal due diligence by Claimants was irrelevant to the issue of legitimate227 expectations.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6247-258.\n\nReply, \u00b6259.\n\nReply, \u00b6260.\n\n2. The breach of the basic principle of the burden of proof and the right of Spain to be heard\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nSpain's argument was that the Tribunal breached the fundamental right to be heard regarding (a) the infringement of the burden of proof of evidence in the proceedings, (b) the violation of the rules on the burden of proof with the regard to the Spanish Supreme Court decisions. and (c) the illegal shifting of the burden of proof in favor of InfraRed.\n\n220.\n\nRegarding point (a), Spain pointed that paragraph 451 of the Award contained \"both a serious lack of valid grounds and a serious breach of essential procedural rules\" concerning the rules on the absence of evidence and the principle of consistency.228\n\nMemorial, \u00b6276.\n\n221.\n\nSpain added that InfraRed has the burden of demonstrating that \"the Original Regulatory Framework would remain stable (*i.e.* immutable) throughout the life of the plants.\"229 But the absence of any \"regulatory due diligence\" shows that InfraRed did not have the basis to allege a legitimate expectation in that regard.230 However, the Tribunal \"justifies Claimants' mere belief as a basis for their legitimate expectations.\"231\n\nMemorial, \u00b6278.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6279.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n222.\n\nInstead, in paragraph 447 of the Award, the Tribunal reversed the burden of proof and goes as far as stating that \"investors in regulatory projects do not need to due diligence and that this must have positive consequences for them.\"232\n\nMemorial, \u00b6282.\n\n223.\n\nAccording to Spain, \"the negligent behavior of InfraRed in evading its duty to inform itself before its investment, seeking the Due Diligences that were necessary to get to know and properly understand the risks of the Spanish regulatory framework can in no way serve to exonerate it from liability.\"233\n\nMemorial, \u00b6284.\n\n224.\n\nIn addition to that, Spain argued that any due diligence would have informed InfraRed of the jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court. However, the Award valued this \"lack of regulatory Due Diligence\" as a justification to have \"a position completely contradictory to that of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence.\"234 Spain argued that the Tribunal allegedly did not give value to the Supreme Court's doctrine and yet \"it does give positive value to the lack of regulatory Due Diligence\", seriously violating the procedural rules.235\n\nMemorial, \u00b6286.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n225.\n\nIt further argued that the Tribunal reversed the burden of proof in relation to the due diligence obligation, and this was contrary to the stricter standard of due diligence declared by the Tribunal and to which InfraRed was subject to.236\n\nMemorial, \u00b6287.\n\n226.\n\nMoreover, in the Reply, Spain also considered evidence on damages and management costs.\n\n227.\n\nThe Applicant posited in the Reply that the Tribunal\u00b4s conclusion accepting InfraRed\u00b4s assertion of an alleged absence of evidence of Accuracy\u00b4s position constituted a serious breach of the rules of procedure.237 First, the Award acknowledged that there was a discrepancy between the experts as to the amount of the costs for running the Plants.238 Next, the Tribunal underlined the fact that InfraRed's expert (Brattle) provided documentation in their first report that contradicted their own position by showing that the management costs were around 1% of the value of the asset under management.239\n\nReply, \u00b6308.\n\nReply, \u00b6297; Award, \u00b6590.\n\nReply, \u00b6298; RL-0116, *InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure GP Limited and Others v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/12, Award, August 2, 2019, \u00b6591.\n\n228.\n\nAccuracy had already stated in their First Economic Report that Brattle included \u20ac5 million of fixed management costs that were not supported, and that it was therefore incumbent on Brattle to explain the nature of these costs, as well as the fact that they were fixed regardless of the value of the asset under management.240 Spain had already made her arguments regarding the nature of these costs, as \"they are commissions behind which there is no real service.\"241 It was therefore clear that the burden of proof of Brattle's hypothesis (fixed and equal management costs for both scenarios) was on InfraRed.242\n\nReply, \u00b6300 quoting R-0403, First Economic Report by Accuracy, \u00b6659-660.\n\nR-0404, Respondent's Comments on the Joint Model Amount, 4 December 2017, \u00b651.\n\nReply, \u00b6302.\n\n229.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal stated that according to Brattle, it was up to Accuracy to demonstrate that the management costs were variable and that they were therefore reduced as a result of the Measures, and the Tribunal agreed with that argument.243\n\nReply, \u00b6303.\n\n230.\n\nThe Applicant submitted that, (i) it should be recalled that it is the Tribunal itself that \"'notes' [\u2026] that 'the documents cited in support of Brattle's first expert report on quantum refer to management fees as a percentage (generally 1% of the portfolio value or net asset value)'\",244 and (ii) that it argued that Brattle's experts had stated that \"the management costs have no bearing on quantum, since Brattle's DCF presumed that management costs remained unchanged after the enactment of the Measures at issue.\"245\n\nReply, \u00b6304 quoting Award, \u00b6591.\n\nReply, \u00b6306.\n\n231.\n\nHowever, the Arbitral Tribunal acknowledged, on the other hand, that by changing the management cost alternator in the Joint Model from Brattle's option to Accuracy's option, the damage is reduced by \u20ac2.5 million because Accuracy's position assumes that \"'management costs dropped as a result of the enactment of the Measures at issue.\"246 And that [InfraRed] 'say[s] no evidence whatsoever was adduced to support such an assumption'. And the Tribunal conclude[d] that it 'agrees with the Claimants and will therefore switch the 'Management Costs' toggle included in the Joint Model to the value 'Brattle.'\"247\n\nAward, \u00b6593.\n\nReply, \u00b6307 quoting Award, \u00b6594.\n\n232.\n\nSpain highlighted that it was the very evidence of Brattle's experts contemplated by the Tribunal in paragraph 591 of the Award (Exhibit BQR-74) that supported Accuracy's position. Therefore, the Tribunal's conclusion accepting InfraRed's assertion of an alleged absence of evidence of Accuracy's position constituted a serious breach of the rules of procedure.248\n\nReply, 308.\n\n233.\n\nThe impact of correcting the management cost alternator in the Joint Model to Accuracy's position (based on the only objective evidence available) is a reduction in damages of \u20ac2.6 million (from \u20ac28.2 million to \u20ac25.6 million).249\n\nReply, \u00b6309.\n\n234.\n\nRegarding the value of the debt, the Applicant pointed to paragraphs 314-317 and the analysis of the Award in this regard and concluded that the Tribunal ignored the explanations provided by Accuracy in determining the debt to be applied in the Joint Model.250 The Applicant considered that \"should the Joint Model be corrected by choosing the Accuracy option ('Face Value') instead of the Brattle option ('Estimated Market Value') the impact would be a reduction of \u20ac1 million.\"251\n\nReply, \u00b6318.\n\nReply, \u00b6319.\n\n235.\n\nRegarding point (b), Spain argued that \"it is not true that Spain has not proved that a minimally more exhaustive analysis would have led to a different understanding of the regulatory framework.\"252 There is contradiction in the Award that, in one hand, it recognized that \"changes in the system would be expected,\"253 but on the other hand disregarded the constant jurisprudence of the Supreme Court that indicated that \"it was not possible to have the expectation of an immutability of the system.\"254 In Spain's view, \"a minimally exhaustive analysis\" of how the Spanish Courts applied the Electricity Sector Legislation would lead to a different understanding than the one used by InfraRed to plead its case.255\n\nMemorial, \u00b6291.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6293.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6294.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n236.\n\nSpain argued that the Tribunal ignored the principle of hierarchy of norms by granting two administrative decisions issued by Directorate-General for Energy Policy and Mines \"the value of establishing commitments that cannot be opposed to the literal content of subsequent legal rules,\"256 because \"administrative acts\", that lack legal value, cannot be equated to \"legal norms\", as the case of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence demonstrated.257\n\nMemorial, \u00b6296.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n237.\n\nThe fact that the Tribunal did not find evidence before December 2010 and June 2011 that contradicts the expectation of immutability of the Spanish regulatory framework in the area of renewable energy, is the result of ignoring \"abundant and constant jurisprudence issued by Spanish Courts.\"258\n\nMemorial, \u00b6297.\n\n238.\n\nTherefore, and in sum, as argued in the Reply, on the basis of considering that \"the December Resolutions\" constituted a specific commitment of the Spain vis-\u00e0-vis the PSC Sector, the Tribunal concluded that no specific legal due diligence should be considered as relevant to the formation of the investors' legitimate expectations.259 To exempt InfraRed from the burden of proof, on the basis of the assumption that the presence of the December Resolutions in the proceedings, it was sufficient to determine the content and scope of its legitimate expectations is tantamount to denying the defense or the right to be heard.260\n\nReply, \u00b6261.\n\nReply, \u00b6262.\n\n239.\n\nThe Tribunal's failure to require legal due diligence to confirm the scope and content of the expectations claimed by InfraRed revealed a breach of the rules on the burden of proof, relevant to argument (c) mentioned above, insofar as it relieved InfraRed of this burden on the basis of an issue that is disputed between the Parties, and which is precisely one of the key issues in the case.261\n\nReply, \u00b6263.\n\n240.\n\nSpain contended that the Award suffered from anomalies due to the \"scarce reference to the evidentiary activity developed in the oral hearings [\u2026] regarding the existence or not of a breach of the ECJ.\"262\n\nMemorial, \u00b6268.\n\n241.\n\nFinally, Spain argued that there was a lack of impartiality towards Spain, also a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention, based on the alleged findings in favor of one the Parties without corresponding factual support.263\n\nMemorial, \u00b6303.\n\n**V. THE RELIEF REQUESTED BY INFRARED**\n---------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nThe relief sought by InfraRed in the Counter-Memorial is the following:\n\n(i) \"Issue a Procedural Order whereby it decides that (i) Spain was barred from introducing evidence in the annulment action that should have been introduced in the Arbitration and therefore, the expert reports of Prof. Demetrio, Prof. Rozas, and Prof. Gosalbo should not be accepted into the record; and\n\n(ii) Spain is precluded from submitting a quantum expert report with its second memorial; and (ii) on the annulment, render a Final Decision dismissing Spain's request for annulment of the Award and ordering Spain to pay InfraRed's legal fees and all annulment costs (including Committee members' fees, ICSID fees and all related expenses) incurred in these proceedings.\"264\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6252.\n\n243.\n\nThe relief sought by InfraRed in the Rejoinder and their PHB is the following:\n\n\"(i) Dismissing Spain's request for annulment of the Award; and\n\n(ii) Ordering Spain to pay InfraRed's legal fees and all annulment costs (including Committee members' fees, ICSID fees and all related expenses) incurred in these proceedings.\"265\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6268, and InfraRed's PHB, \u00b6160.\n\n**VI. SUMMARY OF INFRARED'S SUBMISSIONS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nInfraRed argued that the Tribunal did not commit any violation that may amount to grounds for annulment under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.266\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b61-3.\n\n245.\n\nInfraRed argued that the Application for Annulment constitutes a \"*de novo review*\" of the merits of the dispute as well as of the jurisdictional objection based on EU law, which was dismissed by the Tribunal.267 InfraRed alleged that \"Spain uses this annulment action to bring up new arguments and defenses that Spain never put forward before the Tribunal,\"268 and that mischaracterized the regulatory framework of renewable energies.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b64.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 5.\n\n**A. SUMMARY OF THE DISPUTE AND THE AWARD**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, InfraRed indicated that \"Spain provides a partisan and incomplete description of the regulatory framework in place when InfraRed invested in Olivenza 1 and Mor\u00f3n 1 and 2 (the 'Plants') in 2011 ('Original Regulatory Framework').\"269 In describing the regulatory framework, InfraRed alleged that the Award identifies its main features and also considered the remuneration of the \"Special Regime.\"270\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b615.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b616.\n\n247.\n\nIn response to Spain's argument that \"the electricity sector also requires consideration of the rules that EU imposes on State aid,\"271 InfraRed contended that \"Spain ignored the Tribunal's conclusion that the regulatory measures and Purported Agreement were not to be assessed or analyzed under any EU law perspective, which was not at stake in the Arbitration.\"272\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 17 quoting Memorial, \u00b69.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b617.\n\n248.\n\nSpain asserted that the Tribunal concluded that none of the documents referred to by Spain in relation to state aid had any specific impact on the regulatory measures at issue in the Arbitration.273 On that point, InfraRed stated that Spain did not demonstrate a conflict between the Original Regulatory Framework relied on by InfraRed and EU law.274\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n249.\n\nInfraRed posited that the Tribunal also held that Spain avoided describing the very extensive, clear and specific assurances of legal stability of the Original Regulatory Framework given to the CSP Plants under a number of statutory provisions, exchanges of official communications, and all kinds of unilateral declarations for a number of275 years.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b618. Award, \u00b6\u00b640-41,\n\n250.\n\nMoreover, InfraRed added that the Tribunal dismissed the argument that RD-L 9/2013276 maintained the principle of \"reasonable return\"277 and instead stated that the new method of remuneration based on an \"efficient\" standard frustrated InfraRed's legitimate expectations.278 The Award also concluded that Spain did not \"maintain\" the expected return for investors promised under the Original Regulatory Regime.279\n\nDefined by InfraRed as Royal Decree-Law 9/2013, of July 12, adopting urgent measures to ensure the financial sustainability of the electric system, see Counter-Memorial, p. v.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b619.\n\n*Ibid*., quoting Award, \u00b6453.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b620.\n\n251.\n\nFurther, InfraRed argued that Spain \"mischaracterized\" the findings of the Award when it claimed that \"the return promised under the Original Regulatory Framework were maintained after the enactment of the Disputed Measures,\"280 because the Tribunal on that point determined that there was uncontradicted evidence that showed that \"Claimants relied on the values of the regulated tariff and of the pool plus premium.\"281\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n252.\n\nRegarding the jurisdictional issue, InfraRed's position was that the \"wrong\" rejection of the intra-EU objection, as Spain contended, \"would not be enough to annul the award under the ICSID Convention.\"282 InfraRed added that \"the Committee does not have any power to redo or rewrite the reasoned opinion of the arbitrators\"283 and that it \"should limit itself to review if the Tribunal resolved the objection and provided reasons to reach its conclusions.\"284\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b621.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n253.\n\nInfraRed rejected Spain's allegations regarding liability and the allegation that the Tribunal decided \"on the basis of non-existing or contradictory and inconsistent criteria.\"285\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b623, quoting Memorial, \u00b642.\n\n254.\n\nInfraRed referred to the findings of the Tribunal in the Award in relation to the documents that served to establish the legitimate expectations, including the \"Purported Agreement\", the waiver letters, the December resolutions, and the enactment of RD 1614/2010.286\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b624, quoting Award, \u00b6410, referencing C-0193t for the \"Purported Agreement\", C-0264t and C-0265t for the letters of waiver, C-0266t and C-0267t for the December Resolutions, C-0050t for the enactment of RD 1614/2010.\n\n255.\n\nIn InfraRed's words, the Tribunal concluded that \"a more thorough due diligence would not have alerted InfraRed of the impeding enactment of the measures\"287, in particular, the Tribunal found that InfraRed \"reasonable expected\" that the CSP Plants would benefit from the \"tariffs, premium and lower and upper limits*,*\"288 defined under the RD 661/2007 for the entire operational lifetime.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b624.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n256.\n\nInfraRed indicated that there were three elements of the Original Regulatory Framework that remained unchanged during the operational life of the Plants.289 It also argued that there is *res judicata* on the issue of the installed power since the Tribunal concluded that Spain had not \"substantiated [\u2026] its defense\" that the capacity was more than 50MW.290\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b625.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b628.\n\n257.\n\nIn conclusion, InfraRed posited that the Tribunal undertook \"a detailed analysis of the issues at stake on the merits and states the reasons leading to its conclusion that Spain had breached its FET obligation [\u2026].\"291\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b629.\n\n258.\n\nOn damages, InfraRed argued that the reduction of the damages claimed by InfraRed's primary claim for compensation demonstrated that the Tribunal \"did not accept InfraRed's evidence\", and that it conducted a careful analysis.292 Followed by a \"Joint Model\" submitted by Spain's and InfraRed's quantum experts,293 the Tribunal concluded that the DCF was an appropriate method and provided reasons in support of that conclusion.294\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b630.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b631.\n\n259.\n\nInfraRed stated that, although the Tribunal took most of the assumptions in the model suggested by InfraRed's quantum expert, it also reduced InfraRed's but-for scenario by incorporating Spain's production scenario (\"Bank Case\") into the Model.295 Furthermore, InfraRed added that the Tribunal awarded pre-award interest at 2% but rejected InfraRed's claim regarding the tax gross-up.296 Therefore, InfraRed rejected Spain's claims that there was any inconsistency with the calculation of damages.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b632.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b633.\n\n**B. THERE ARE NO GROUNDS TO ANNUL THE AWARD**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nInfraRed argued that none of the grounds for annulment had been demonstrated, and, thereby rejects each of the allegations raised by Spain, namely that the Tribunal (i) did not manifestly exceed its powers, (ii) did not fail to state reasons in the Award; and (iii) respected all fundamental rules of procedure.297\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b637.\n\n261.\n\nInfraRed argued that \"Spain disregards [the] difference between appeal and annulment,\"298 attempting to introduce new evidence on the merits which is forbidden under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention. The result of a successful application for annulment is the invalidation of the original decision whereas the result of an appeal is its modification.299 This meant that the Committee may not amend or replace the Award with its own decision, both in respect of jurisdiction or the merits, and can only choose between leaving the original decision intact or declaring it void.300 Furthermore, InfraRed alleged that the Committee is only concerned with the legitimacy of the process rather than the substantive correctness.301\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b639-42; Rejoinder, \u00b620-22.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b619; InfraRed's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 5-14.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b619.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b640 (ii); InfraRed's PHB, \u00b67.\n\n262.\n\nMoreover, since Spain submitted new claims that were never raised during the Arbitration, the Committee \"should dismiss\" those arguments without further consideration,302 and since Spain did not raise the claims of \"clean hands\" during the proceedings, the Committee should bar Spain from addressing the Award on that basis.303\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b642-43.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b645.\n\n263.\n\nInfraRed considered that the Application for Annulment reiterated some of the arguments that were rejected by the Tribunal, such as the issue of EU state aid law, the intra-EU objection and Spain's breach of legitimate expectations.304 However, the Committee is confined to declare the annulment under the grounds of Article 52(1) of the Convention and not to review the merits of the decision.305\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b646.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n264.\n\nSpain submitted in the annulment proceedings three expert legal reports dealing with different issues, such as the Gosalbo Report, addressing the intra-EU objection; the Demetrio Report, addressing the illegality of the investment; and the Rozas and S\u00e1nchez expert report (\"**Rozas Report**\"), addressing the \"clean hands\" issue.306 Not one of these reports had been presented in the Arbitration and they address issues that were not presented to the Tribunal. This contradicts PO1 in which the Committee instructed the Parties to \"primarily refer to the evidentiary record of the arbitration proceeding\", indicating that \"it does not expect to receive new witness statements or expert reports, leaving apart exceptional circumstances.\"307 InfraRed submitted that \"Spain failed to provide such 'exceptional circumstances,'\"308 and did not explain why the submission of the experts should be authorized in the annulment proceeding.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b647.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b650.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n265.\n\nFurthermore, InfraRed considered that the expert opinions are irrelevant \"in the context of annulment actions as it is well established that *ad hoc* committees should only review the record before the Tribunal,\"309 otherwise the annulment proceeding would \"become inefficient,\" and \"consume extraordinary resources.\"310 Therefore, InfraRed requested the Committee to issue a procedural order declaring the expert reports inadmissible.311\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b651; Rejoinder, \u00b619.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b652.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b653.\n\n**C. THERE ARE NO GROUNDS TO ANNUL THE AWARD ON THE BASIS OF MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWER**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nRegarding the excess of power allegations, InfraRed contended that such allegations do not show any kind of \"excess of power:\"312\n\n\" (i) [T]he Tribunal reached the same conclusion as another 28 investment tribunals313 that have been faced with the same intra-EU objection argument; (ii) the Tribunal extensively explained why EU law should not be applied to the merits of the dispute; and (iii) as we have repeated several times in this Counter-Memorial, Spain should be estopped from bringing a new defense regarding the illegality of InfraRed's investment whereas Spain explicitly accepted the legality of InfraRed's investment in the Arbitration.\"\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b655.\n\nInfraRed, in the same Counter-Memorial, \u00b677 mentions a different figure.\n\n267.\n\nIn its submission, InfraRed asserted that Spain was seeking a reconsideration of the Award and was \"challenging the assessment of the legal and factual evidence,\"314 replicating the same arguments presented during the Arbitration.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b657.\n\n268.\n\nRegarding the EC's *amicus* brief, InfraRed requested the Committee to \"give no weight to the Commission's highly partisan and disruptive intervention,\"315 adding that \"the Commission is a partisan ally of the Applicant in their joint crusade to dismantle (at any cost) the existing architecture of the investor-state arbitration system.\"316\n\nInfraRed Comments to EU Commission's Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b63.\n\nInfraRed Comments to EU Commission's Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b66.\n\n269.\n\nInfraRed contended that the Commission \"attempts to introduce matters into these annulment proceedings that the Committee cannot revisit or review under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"317\n\nInfraRed Comments to EU Commission's Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b67.\n\n270.\n\nIt is also argued that the Commission treats annulment as an appeal, and that in \"[i]n every published annulment decision to date, ad hoc committees have stressed [the] distinction\"318 between appeal and annulment, holding that \"where an appeal is concerned with legitimacy of the process of decision and its substantive correctness, an annulment proceeding under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention is only concerned with the legitimacy of the process.\"319\n\nCL-328, Schreuer, C., Malintoppi, L., Reinisch, A., &amp; Sinclair, A. (2009). *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Article 52, \u00b613.\n\nInfraRed Comments to EU Commission's Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b610.\n\n271.\n\nFinally, InfraRed considered that \"under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, an error in the application of the law is not considered a ground for annulment.\"320\n\nInfraRed Comments to EU Commission's Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b620.\n\n1. \"Excess of power\" must be self-evident and an error in the application of the law is not a ground for annulment\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nInfraRed further argued that under the \"excess of power\" ground, the Applicant has the burden of showing that the Tribunal \"fail[ed] to exercise its jurisdiction or fail[ed] to apply the law agreed upon the parties.\"321\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b659.\n\n273.\n\nInfraRed's position is that pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention, the excess of powers must be 'manifest,' meaning \"obvious, self-evident and substantially serious.\"322 It refers to other committees' decisions that have confirmed that a manifest excess of powers will only exist \"where the action in question is clearly capable of making a difference to the result of the case.\"323\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b661.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b662.\n\n274.\n\nInfraRed contented that a decision on jurisdiction may trigger the annulment of an award only when that decision is \"unreasonable\"324 and cited to *Fraport v. Philippines* and *UAB v. Latvia.* Therefore, the Committee should examine the Application for Annulment \"in light of the evidence and submissions which were before the Tribunal and not on the basis of new evidence.\"325\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b663.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n275.\n\nInfraRed added that the incorrect application or interpretation of the law cannot give rise to annulment.326 They quoted a passage of *Amco v. Indonesia* establishing that \"the law applied by the Tribunal will be examined by the ad hoc Committee, not for the purpose of scrutinizing whether the Tribunal committed errors in the interpretation of the requirements of applicable law or in the ascertainment or evaluation of the relevant facts to which law has been applied.\"327\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b664-65; Rejoinder, \u00b632 (ii).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b665, quoting *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on the Application by Parties for Annulment and Partial Annulment of the Arbitral Award of May 16, 1986, and the Application by Respondent for Annulment of the Supplemental Award, dated December 17 ,1992, \u00b67.8.\n\n276.\n\nIn their Rejoinder, InfraRed argued that Spain twisted the applicable legal standard for establishing a manifest excess of powers. According to InfraRed, for an award to be annulled, the \"excess of powers\" must be \"manifest,\" in other words, \"where the action in question is clearly capable of making a difference to the result of the case.\"328\n\nRejoinder, \u00b632 quoting Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 61, 62.\n\n277.\n\nTherefore, regarding the allegation of an excess of powers for (i) granting protection to InfraRed despite its alleged unclean hands, (ii) rejecting the Intra UE-objection, (iii) misapplying EU law to the merits of the dispute, InfraRed reiterated its position that Spain did not demonstrate any relevant arguments to rebut the reasoning of the Tribunal on these aspects.329 The decision to reject the application of EU law followed a pattern already stablished by arbitral tribunals in similar cases.330\n\nRejoinder, \u00b623.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b626, 29-30.\n\n2. Spain's arguments related to the intra-EU objection cannot lead to the annulment of the Award\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nInfraRed argued that the fact that other 28 investment tribunals have similarly ruled that the ECT and its Article 26(1) apply within the EU, and that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear the dispute between the Parties, shows that the Tribunal was aligned with those tribunals' conclusions.331\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b667.\n\n279.\n\nAs posited by InfraRed, there is no \"parrot effect\" as indicated by Spain, quite the contrary - as the fact that many other tribunals decided always rejecting the intra-EU objection demonstrates that the Tribunal \"did not act manifestly exceeding its powers\" and that its conclusion was not \"unreasonable.\"332\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b668.\n\n280.\n\nIn any case, InfraRed asserted that Spain's allegation would not lead to an excess of power under Article 52(1)(b) since \"(i) deference should be given to the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction and (ii) Spain has failed to prove that the alleged excess of power was 'manifest.'\"333\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b669.\n\n281.\n\nInfraRed added that the tribunal could not be considered \"unreasonable\" when several Arbitral Tribunals had reached the same conclusion in similar proceedings regarding the intra-EU objection.334 When the Award was issued, the decisions on \"*PV Investors*, *Charanne*, *RREEF*, *Isolux*, *Eiser*, and *Novenerg\u00eda*, had already dismissed the intra EU objection under similar grounds to those that the Tribunal advances in the Award.\"335\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b674.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b676.\n\n282.\n\nSimilarly, 21 other decisions rendered before and after the InfraRed Award also rejected the intra-EU objection.336 The fact that 32 arbitral tribunals had rejected the intra-EU objection is highly relevant since it was evidence that the Tribunal did not act \"manifestly exceeding its powers.\"337 There is evidence that \"to date not a single tribunal has accepted Spain's intra-EU objection.\"338\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b677. The reference date is November 2020.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b675.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b677. The reference date is April 2021.\n\n283.\n\nIn InfraRed's position, the Committee should give deference to the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction and quoted in support of its arguments the decisions from the committees in the *Azurix v. Argentina* and *Enron v. Argentina* cases.339\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b680.\n\n284.\n\nThe allegations from Spain that the Tribunal did not consider the rules of interpretation in Article 31 of the VCLT, or that it merely indicated that there is no disconnection clause in the ECT, or that it allegedly ignored the July 2019 EU Council communication from 21 Member States340 are inaccurate.341 The Tribunal analyzed the ordinary meaning and context of the term \"*Area*\" from Article 26(1), to conclude that it meant \"the territory under the state's sovereignty\" or \"the territory under the sovereignty of the member states of such REIO,\"342 which InfraRed argued was not manifestly arbitrary or unreasonable.343\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b683 quoting the Application on Annulment, \u00b618 and \u00b6104.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b683.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b684.\n\nInfraRed's PHB, \u00b6\u00b631-46.\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal also analyzed the context of the same Article 26 highlighting that it provided that \"even in case of conflict with another treaty to the extent that the ECT is 'more favourable to the Investor or the Investment,'\"344 and that Spain \"had the burden of demonstrating that the EU legal system provides a method to resolve Claimants' dispute with Spain that is 'more favourable' to the investors than the one provided at Article 26(1) ECT\", which it did not.345\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b686 quoting Award, \u00b6264.\n\nAward, \u00b6264.\n\n286.\n\nTherefore, InfraRed considered that all the declarations from Prof. Gosalbo in its report should be disregarded.346 It pointed to exhibits CL-359 and CL-360 to contradict Gosalbo's opinion.347\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b687.\n\nInfraRed's Rejoinder on Annulment of the Award, April 30, 2021, \u00b672.\n\n287.\n\nFurthermore, the absence of a disconnection clause between the ECT and EU treaties confirmed the Contracting Parties' intention to apply Article 26(1) of the ECT to intra-EU disputes.348 On this point InfraRed argued that Spain mischaracterized the findings of the Tribunal because it did not conclude that \"in the absence of a disconnection clause, [it] cannot conclude that the EU's ratification of the ECT replaces the consent given individually by each EU Member State to the ECT.\" To the contrary, the Tribunal remarked that its conclusion regarding the absence of a disconnection clause would have been different \"if the EU members states that signed the January Declarations would have withdrawn from the ECT or activated the procedure for amending the ECT.\"349 In its PHB, InfraRed highlighted that the Tribunal confirmed that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ECT showed that the EU failed to include a disconnection clause in the treaty.350\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b688.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b689, Award, \u00b6272.\n\nInfraRed PHB's, \u00b6\u00b6 21-29.\n\n288.\n\nRegarding the argument related to the July 2019 Declaration, InfraRed argued that this communication was not relevant because, as the Tribunal recognized, \"they were not adopted within the EU legal order and are not EU legal instruments.\"351 Therefore, the Tribunal concluded that \"they cannot have an interpretative effect on the content of EU law regarding investment protection and treaties concluded, inter alia, between EU member states.\"352 Although Spain disagrees, it did not show a manifest excess of353 power.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b691.\n\nAward, \u00b6269.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b691.\n\n289.\n\nIt further added that the Tribunal resolved that \u00a8the principle of the primacy of EU law in intra-EU relations is not binding upon the Tribunal, and at any rate, does not exclude the application of the ECT to intra-investment disputes,\"354 and Spain did not bring any relevant argument in its Memorial in this respect.355\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b692-93.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b694.\n\n290.\n\nInfraRed considered that the *Achmea* Judgment did not invalidate the Parties' agreement to arbitrate under the ECT. It alleged that Prof. Gosalbo \"glosses over an important fact: *Achmea* never mentions the ECT,\"356 the BIT at issue in *Achmea*, was a completely different type of treaty applying only to EU parties and applying a different body of law than the ECT.357\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6100.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6100.\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal confirmed that with regard to this issue, \"the ECJ [\u2026] has not taken so far any position as to the applicability of its judgement in the *Achmea* case to arbitration tribunals jurisdiction of which is based on the ECT.\"358 Therefore, Spain could not claim that *Achmea* also applies to a \"multilateral treaties such as the ECT\"359 and less that the Tribunal did not give the proper value to this decision. In any case, InfraRed argued, Spain failed to demonstrate how the *Achmea* Judgment could retroactively invalidate an agreement entered before that decision was rendered, especially given the reliance of investors, such as InfraRed, on an international arbitral dispute resolution mechanism.360\n\nAward, *\u00b6* 269 (emphasis added).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6101.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6103.\n\n292.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, InfraRed again posited that Spain did not prove beyond \"uncertainty\" or \"doubt\" that the Tribunal manifestly exceed its jurisdiction.361\n\nRejoinder, \u00b676.\n\n293.\n\nInfraRed also considered irrelevant the judgement of the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union, issued in the Case *C-741/19. Republic of Moldova v Komstroy*, as it alleges, among other arguments, that \"the question on the intra-EU applicability of the ECT does not form part of the question posed by the French court, nor of the CJEU's response\", that \"the judgment shows that the intra-EU issue is far from obvious or self-evident [\u2026] and demonstrates that the Tribunal's decision, rendered in line with the totality of previous resolutions that dismissed the objection, was at least reasonable and defensible\", that \"the Committee does not have the power to reconsider the merits of Spain's intra-EU objection de novo with or without the newest judgment\", and that the \"judgment cannot undermine the application of Articles 16 and 46 ECT. Neither the EU nor certain EU Member States have the power to modify the ECT by themselves as a matter of international law, let alone with retroactive effects to decisions rendered years earlier.\"362\n\nInfraRed's letter to the Committee dated September 16, 2021.\n\n294.\n\nFurthermore, InfraRed considered that Spain failed to explain why the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 26(6) was unclear or unreasonable as required by Article 52(1)(b) of ICSID Convention. Contrary to Spain, the Tribunal applied the VCLT when interpreting Article 26(6) ECT. Similarly, Spain did not rebut the Tribunal's finding that the absence of a disconnection clause between the ECT and EU treaties confirmed the contracting's Parties intention to apply Article 26(1) to intra-EU disputes.363\n\nRejoinder, \u00b677.\n\n295.\n\nAlso, Spain did not prove why paragraph 272 of the Award (stating that there is no incompatibility between EU law and ECT provisions) is unclear or unreasonable.364 InfraRed also considered that the case law quoted by Spain (*Vivendi I* and *MHS*) did not support its allegations.365 With all the above arguments, InfraRed concluded that Spain did not prove that the Tribunal's decision about the intra EU-objection was \"unreasonable\" as required under Article 52(1) (b).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b680.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b681.\n\n296.\n\nIn order to rebut Prof. Gosalbo allegations, InfraRed pointed to the expert declarations from Priet Eeckout, Prof. of EU law and former *r\u00e9f\u00e9rendaire* of the ECJ who indicates that \"[t]he objections in the *Achmea* Judgment against intra-EU arbitration are expressly confined to bilateral agreements between Member States which have not been concluded by the EU; they therefore do not extend to the ECT.\"366\n\nRejoinder, \u00b687, quoting CL-359, \u00b611 (emphasis in the original).\n\n297.\n\nRegarding the application of Article 26 of the ECT to intra-EU disputes, Prof. Eeckhout considers that \"[e]ven if the Achmea Judgment were to extend to the ECT, that would not preclude intra- EU arbitration under the ECT. The validity of Article 26 ECT under international law would not be affected, nor would its interpretation and effect.\"367 Prof. Eeckhout further states that Article 26(6) is not relevant to issues concerning the dispute settlement clause of Article 26 of the ECT.368\n\nRejoinder, \u00b688, quoting Reply, \u00b677.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b689.\n\n298.\n\nInfraRed submitted that under Article 16(2) of the ECT, the contracting parties to the ECT, including the EU, specifically and explicitly agreed that previous or subsequent treaties that they enter into with each other shall not be construed to derogate from any provision in Part III (\"Investment Promotion and Protection,\" including the substantive protections) or Part V (\"Dispute Settlement\") of the ECT, where a provision is more favorable to the Investor. Therefore, Article 26 ECT, which was more favorable to an investor, should prevail over EU law,369 and Spain's submission that EU law has \"primacy\" over the ECT lacks support.370\n\nRejoinder, \u00b691; InfraRed's PHB, \u00b6\u00b667-99.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b691-92.\n\n299.\n\nRegarding the value of the EC's communication and the 2019 January Declarations, InfraRed reaffirmed that they \"have no bearing on the interpretation of the ECT.\"371\n\nRejoinder, \u00b693 quoting CL-359, Prof. Piet Eeckhout's Declaration in *Masdar Solar &amp; Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain*, US District Court for the District of Columbia, June 24, 2019, \u00b612 (iii), p. 6.\n\n300.\n\nAs a conclusion, InfraRed posited that there was no issue of jurisdiction that would limit or impede the Tribunal from hearing a ECT case between a Member State of the UE and a company from another EU State, and therefore in accordance with Article 52(1)(b) of ICSID Convention there was no evidence of excess of powers (let alone manifest) on the decision of this jurisdictional objection.\n\n3. The Tribunal did not exceed its powers when applying international law to the dispute\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nRegarding the applicability of EU state aid Law, InfraRed considered that the Committee should disregard this new argument372 because the Gosalbo Report was not presented during the Arbitration and the Committee should avoid litigating new legal arguments included in Gosalbo Report.373 The fact that Spain disagreed with the Tribunal does not make the Award annullable.374\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6106.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n302.\n\nWhen the Tribunal determined that EU law was not relevant to the analysis of InfraRed's legitimate expectation,375 the Tribunal clarified that this determination did not infringe the autonomy of the EU and its legal order.376 In any case, InfraRed alleged that this ground should be \"manifest\" to lead to the annulment of the Award.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6107.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6108.\n\n303.\n\nInfraRed submitted in the Rejoinder, that Spain could not argue that the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law since the Tribunal in fact considered the application of EU law but determined that it was \"highly irrelevant.\"377\n\nRejoinder, \u00b69.\n\n304.\n\nInfraRed considered that Spain was unable to explain why the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law. InfraRed highlighted that the Tribunal noted that \"the provisions EU law are not dispositive nor even relevant to resolve the issues raised by this dispute,\"378 and that this was perfectly consistent with the fact that the application of the ECT was sufficient to adjudicate the dispute.379 InfraRed added that the case law cited by Spain did not favor its position.380\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 101 quoting Award, \u00b6258.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 101.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 105-109.\n\n305.\n\nThe references to Article 38 of the ICJ Statute were inapposite, as the reference to Article 103 of the United Nations Charter, state practice and the principle of autonomy of EU law over domestic law. In the context of investment claims under ECT, those rules and Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU, related to EU law on state aid, were irrelevant, in InfraRed's position.381\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6111; InfraRed's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6100-122.\n\n306.\n\nIn addition, InfraRed considered that Spain's position was unclear in that EU law fell within the wording of \"principles of international law\" or under the reference to \"applicable rules\" that Article 26 ECT provides for. In paragraph 207 of its Reply, Spain concludes that \"Autonomy and primacy of EU law are applicable international custom\"382 but in paragraph 214 of the Reply, it criticized the disregard of EU state Aid Law.383 Therefore, it was unclear on what international custom it relied. That the principle of autonomy and primacy of EU law could qualify as 'international custom' is highly doubtful but the allegation that EU state aid law is an international custom was utterly wrong.384\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6112 quoting Reply, \u00b6207.\n\nRejoinder \u00b6112 quoting Reply, 204.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6112.\n\n307.\n\nInfraRed concluded that the applicable law in this case was the ECT and not EU law, and the Tribunal's finding that Spain breached Article 10 of the ECT could not be annulled for failing to apply proper law.385 If anything, InfraRed added, the EU law should be treated as a fact.386\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6117.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6120.\n\n4. The Tribunal correctly applied the proper law in assessing the legitimate expectations and in any case a misapplication of the law does not constitute a manifest excess of power\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nIn its reply to the argument raised by Spain that even in the case the Tribunal were understood to have applied EU law, it resulted in an incorrect application of the law, InfraRed considered that Article 52(1) is not warranted in cases of an alleged misapplication of the proper law - not even if a \"gross misapplication\" occurred387 -because all the Committee must do is to assess whether the Tribunal correctly identified the applicable law and applied it, which it did.388\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6121.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6112.\n\n309.\n\nInfraRed therefore disagrees with Spain's subsidiary argument that \"there has been a gross misapplication of EU law\", and that \"the assessment of legitimate expectations should include a verification of whether the promised subsidy is lawful under the law applicable to the dispute and in accordance with national law.\"389\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6121, Reply, \u00b6215, Section V.A.4.\n\n310.\n\nInfraRed argued that neither Article 107 nor Article 108 TFEU established any obligation on private companies because these were directed to Member States.390\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6125.\n\n311.\n\nAlso, the fact that Spain had failed to give notice to the EC about the remuneration scheme is not attributable to InfraRed,391 but more importantly, the regime under which InfraRed invested has never been declared illegal.392\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6125, 126.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6127.\n\n312.\n\nFor all these reasons, InfraRed concluded that Spain failed to prove that the Tribunal acted manifestly outside the scope of its mandate in its jurisdictional analysis and in its determination of the applicable law. Therefore, there was no basis to annul the Award under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.393\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6130.\n\n5. InfraRed is entitled to international protection\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nInfraRed considered that the arguments about the misrepresentation of the installed capacity,394 and the lack of jurisdiction of the Tribunal for \"falsehood in a public document\" and therefore the allegation that InfraRed had no clean hands to appear before the Tribunal are false and, in any case, were never raised during the Arbitration.395\n\nApplication for Annulment, \u00b638; Memorial, \u00b675.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6114.\n\n314.\n\nSpain failed to show any excess of powers and was attempting to reopen the debate since \"the Tribunal concluded that: (i) the term 'installed capacity' in Article 27(1) of the EPA 1997 should be read as 'net output', and (ii) InfraRed's CSP Plants net output was always equal or lower to 50MW.\"396\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6120.\n\n315.\n\nIn InfraRed's position, Spain never evidenced that InfraRed's conduct in relation to the installed capacity constituted a crime397 during the Arbitration. It argued that the Award gave \"significant weight to the fact the Spanish National Commission of Energy (CNE) recognized in its own documents that the installed capacity was under 50MW.\"398\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6121; InfraRed's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6140-147.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6121.\n\n316.\n\nInfraRed argued that Spain had not submitted any new factual argument related to the alleged misinterpretation of the installed capacity and was now repeating the arguments that the Tribunal dismissed in the Award.399 Therefore, there was no basis to annul the Award under 52(1)(b) of ICSID Convention because Spain, by not raising the illegality argument during the Arbitration, \"has explicitly waived it.\"400\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6121-125; Rejoinder, \u00b637, 38.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6116; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39, 40-43.\n\n317.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, InfraRed further argued that if Spain considered that InfraRed committed a criminal offense it should have raised this issue at the very beginning of the proceeding, according to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention.401 In any case, InfraRed considered that Spain should have submitted a final judgment issued by a competent court condemning InfraRed for such a criminal offense,402 but failed to do so.403 The proceedings referred by Spain are not even within the first stages in a criminal proceeding, meaning that \"no criminal proceedings have been initiated in relation to the facts alleged by the State attorneys.\"404\n\nRejoinder, \u00b641, 44.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b645.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b646.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b648.\n\n318.\n\nInfraRed also emphasized that it had not been formally charged or under investigation, \"at the moment, there is no indication of a potential criminal liability for InfraRed that could arise from the complaint filed.\"405\n\nRejoinder, \u00b649 and ff., 56.\n\n319.\n\nRegarding Prof. Demetrio's opinion, InfraRed contended that this report was based on wrong assumptions, insofar as its starting point being a biased interpretation of the concept of \"installed power\" which is not shared by InfraRed and was not shared by the Tribunal.406\n\nRejoinder, \u00b658.\n\n320.\n\nInfraRed also explained how the elements of the alleged crimes of subsidies fraud, and falsifying documents were not demonstrated by Spain,407 to conclude that the \"clean hands\" theory and the accusation of illegality were unsupported.408\n\nRejoinder, \u00b660-62.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b664.\n\n321.\n\nWith regard to the installed capacity, InfraRed considered that the Tribunal reasoned its findings and concluded that the determination of this concept is (i) based on the interpretation of the term \"installed capacity\" at Article 27 of the EPA 1997, (ii) the *Eiser* award was not a basis for the determination of the installed capacity.409 For these reasons, InfraRed argued that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers in granting protection to the investment.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b667.\n\n322.\n\nInfraRed concluded that even if the Award had not decided that the installed capacity was compatible with the threshold for accessing the benefits, the alleged facts would never correspond to a criminal behavior and therefore there are no grounds for annulment.\n\n**D. THERE ARE NO GROUNDS TO ANNUL THE AWARD ON THE BASIS THAT THE TRIBUNAL FAILED TO STATE REASONS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nRegarding the challenge for the failure to state reasons Spain argued that Article 52(1)(e) is \"inherently related\" to the requirement in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention that an award \"shall state\" the reasons upon which it is based.410 InfraRed indicated that these provisions referred to a high standard and Spain had failed to discharge that burden.411\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6127.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6127; Rejoinder, \u00b613.\n\n324.\n\nThe Award did not fail to state reasons because the Tribunal stated its reasoning with regard to: (i) the discussion over the installed capacity, (ii) the applicable law, (iii) the interpretation of Article 10(1) ECT, (iv) the interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment under Article 10(1) ECT, and (v) the findings on damages.412\n\nRejoinder, \u00b612.\n\n325.\n\nAfter presenting a short summary of the stages of the original procedure,413 InfraRed stated that the Award was issued \"unanimously\" by the three arbitrators except for a single footnote (footnote 782 by Prof. Dupuy) about damages. InfraRed considered that the Award \"processes the Parties' allegations and the awards and decisions invoked by each side in order to provide its detailed reasoning and findings.\"414\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6131.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6132.\n\n326.\n\nInfraRed signaled in the Rejoinder that Spain's Reply had \"apparently dropped three of the reasons it argued for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\" The Reply no longer submitted that the Tribunal would have allegedly failed to express adequate and sufficient reasons concerning (i) its decisions on the date of investment, (ii) the decision not to apply EU law when deciding its jurisdiction, and (iii) its conclusion to adopt the DCF methodology.415\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6206.\n\n1. The standard of proof under Article 52(1)(e) is particularly high, and as long as reasons have been stated, even if incorrect or unconvincing, an award cannot be annulled\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nSince the grounds of annulment are to be evidenced with a high standard, InfraRed posited that Spain should have demonstrated that the Award's reasoning is \"contradictory, frivolous, incomprehensible or completely absent\" and that such defect is \"manifest\" on the face of the Award itself. The manifest factor requires that the award contains no reasons at all for a particular finding.416\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6135.\n\n328.\n\nIn addition to that, InfraRed's submission indicated that \"the duty to state reasons refers only to a minimum requirement. It does not call for tribunals to strain every sinew in an attempt to convince the losing party that the decision was the right one.\"417\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6136.\n\n329.\n\nInfraRed argued that Spain conceded that a tribunal is only required to state reasons for its conclusions in a manner that is sufficient to allow the committee \"to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B*.*\" However, Spain failed to note that said reasons \"do not need to be explicitly stated as long as the reader can understand the decision reached by the tribunal.\"418 Consequently, Spain's allegations did not satisfy such standard.419\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6137 quoting CL-337.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6143.\n\n330.\n\nInfraRed also contended in the Rejoinder that Spain misinterpreted the applicable legal standard and that the Award contained reasons that went well beyond the minimum requirement of reasoning required of ICSID tribunals.420\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6204.\n\n2. The Tribunal justified its decision on the rejection of the intra-EU objection, and on the application of international law (to jurisdiction and the merits)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nInfraRed turned then to demonstrate that the Tribunal justified its decision on the rejection of the intra-EU objection and on the application of international law.421 Regarding the jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal justified why it rejected it by making reference to:422\n\n\"(i) all the relevant arguments raised by Spain (which are exactly the same arguments that Spain tries to re-litigate in this Annulment proceeding) and InfraRed; (ii) the reasoning of those ECT tribunals that, before InfraRed, had rejected this objection in similar circumstances (*PV Investors*, *Charanne*, *RREEF*, *Isolux*, *Eiser*, *Wirtgen v. Czech Republic* and *Novenergia*); (iii) and gave a detailed analysis of why it decided to reject the intra-EU objection, also explaining why the March 2018 CJEU *Achmea* Judgment or the 2019 January Declarations did not change the Tribunal's affirmation of its jurisdiction under the ECT and the ICSID Convention. The last step of the Tribunal's reasoning is contained at paras. 256 \u2013 274 and is perfectly understandable as well as consistent.\"\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 146-147.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6147, citing Award, pp. 57-70, 64-68, 68-74 and 256-274.\n\n332.\n\nIn paragraphs 148 to 151 of its Counter-Memorial, InfraRed summarized the main findings from the Tribunal regarding the EU law and other EU-related declarations, and concluded that Spain \"did not prove, as required under Article 52(1)(e) ICSID Convention, that the reasoning of the Tribunal when rejecting the Intra-EU objection was 'contradictory, frivolous, or incomprehensible.'\"423 It added that as in the other 28 cases, the tribunals that had addressed the \"Intra-EU\" issue to date had rejected it,424 proving that the Tribunal's reasoning was not frivolous.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6153.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6153. In \u00b677 of the Counter-Memorial a different figure is mentioned.\n\n333.\n\nRegarding the EU state aid law claim, InfraRed considered that the Tribunal justified why it decided not to apply EU state aid rules for the purposes of assessing InfraRed's legitimate expectations,425 and recollected Spain's arguments on this matter.426\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6155.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6156.\n\n334.\n\nThe Tribunal reasoned that \"neither EU, nor Spanish domestic law (or the Supreme Court decisions) are to be used to assess whether a state has breached its international treaty obligations.\"427 In this regard, the Tribunal added that EU state law aid rules were \"not relevant to the analysis of the issue as to whether Respondents violated a specific commitment tendered to the CSP sector,\"428 and that \"the content and interpretation of EU law and regulations is largely irrelevant to resolve the merits of the present dispute.\"429\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6157; InfraRed's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6124-132.\n\nAward, \u00b6 443.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6158 quoting Award, \u00b6 444.\n\n335.\n\nFinally, InfraRed held that even if the Committee considered that EU law and EU state aid rules were to be applied to the merits of the dispute, the reality was that the reasoning of the Tribunal fully satisfied the standard under Article 52(1)(e).430\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6159.\n\n336.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, InfraRed also considered that the Tribunal justified why it decided not to apply EU state aid rules for the purposes of assessing InfraRed's legitimate expectations.431\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6208.\n\n337.\n\nInfraRed considered that the Tribunal in effect justified its decision on the application of international law, and consequently why it decided not to apply EU state aid rule for the purposes of assessing InfraRed's legitimate expectations.432 The Tribunal reasoned that neither EU, nor Spanish law (including the Supreme Court decisions) are to be used to assess whether a state has breached its international treaty obligations.433\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6216.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6210 quoting paragraph 411 of the Award.\n\n338.\n\nIn their PHB, InfraRed argued that EU law does not form part of the law applicable to an ECT dispute and therefore no conflict of applicable rules between the ECT and EU law could arise under Article 26(6) ECT, and even if this were the case, Article 26(6) ECT could incorporate EU law as a 'rule' or 'principle of international law,' EU law is not lex posterior, Article 30 VCLT could not be applicable to a situation where the parties to the international treaty are not the same, the subject matters are different and Article 16 ECT (which is the *lex specialis*) provides for a rule of conflict in favor of Article 10 ECT (Part III ECT) and Article 26 ECT (Part V ECT).434 Moreover, Article 46 ECT and Article 25(1) ICSID Convention further provide limits to the denial of InfraRed's claim against Spain.435\n\nInfraRed's PHB, \u00b6\u00b647-63.\n\nInfraRed's PHB, \u00b6\u00b664-66.\n\n339.\n\nA similar argument was raised by InfraRed regarding the installed capacity issue. Spain's argument that the Tribunal only based its reasoning on the *Eiser* award was without merits. The Tribunal concluded in its decision on Spain's Application for Revision that \"even if the Eiser Award 'had never existed', it is manifest that both the reasoning and the conclusions with respect to the installed capacity issue as articulated in the Award would remain unaffected.\"436\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6208 quoting CL-375-ENG, *InfraRed v. Kingdom of Spain*, Decision on Claimant's objection under ICSID Rule 41(5) to Respondent's Application for Revision, March 8, 2021, \u00b6 75.\n\n3. The Tribunal reasoned its decision regarding the determination of installed power\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nRegarding the determination of the installed power capacity, InfraRed submitted that the Tribunal duly assessed Spain's allegations on the installed capacity of the CSP Plants,437 and assessed all the evidence from the expert reports filed by the Parties,438 and the report issued by *Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a* (the Spanish electricity grid operator) that confirmed that the net output of the Plants was 50 MW or less.439\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6164.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6166.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6167.\n\n341.\n\nInfraRed argued that the Tribunal explained why it attached little evidentiary value to other documents submitted by Spain, including the Garrigues report and the turnkey contracts of the Plant.440 Similarly, Spain failed to prove that the reasoning of the Tribunal for determining that the installed capacity was equal to or less than 50MW was \"contradictory, frivolous, or incomprehensible\" as required by Article 52(1)(e).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6169-70.\n\n342.\n\nIn response to Spain's argument that the Tribunal used inconsistent arguments to conclude that the \"net power\" was an important element to ascertain the installed capacity, InfraRed contended that the Tribunal did not incur in any contradiction and that paragraph 189 of Spain's Memorial did not point to any contradiction in the Award itself*,*441 but manifested a mere disagreement with the Tribunal's assessment of the evidence.442\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6172.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6173.\n\n343.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, InfraRed added that in order to prove the Award failed to state reasons, it is required to prove that the award contains no reasons at all for a particular finding that is indispensable to apprehend the tribunal's reasoning.443 To support this InfraRed quoted the *Enron v. Argentina* decision and the committee in *Kl\u00f6ckner* to support its statement that the arbitrators do not have to deal with all of the parties' arguments. In this regard, the Tribunal was not required to comment on all arguments of the Parties in relation to the Plant's installed capacity. The Tribunal was required to state reasons for its decision that the Plants had less than 50MW capacity, but not necessarily the reasoning behind it.444\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6222.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6226.\n\n4.

During the arbitration, Spain confirmed in writing, not once, not twice, but multiple times, that the date of InfraRed's investment was July 28, 2011.

The Tribunal reasoned its conclusions on liability\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nIn relation to liability, regarding the scope of the FET standard in the ECT,448 InfraRed contended that Spain ignored the Tribunal's reasoned conclusions about (i) the legal standard applicable under Article 10(1) of the ECT in assessing a host State FET obligation, and (ii) the reasons why Spain breached InfraRed's legitimate expectations.449\n\nMemorial, \u00b6185.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6187.\n\n348.\n\nInfraRed emphasized that the Tribunal devoted more than 10 pages to analyze the standard governing the FET providing a detailed analysis of the meaning of FET in line of the *jurisprudence constante.*450 The Tribunal held that \"the FET obligation is a distinct standard linked (among others) to the legitimate expectations of investors\" and that contrary to Spain's assertions, it \"is not limited to non-discrimination.\"451\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6189.\n\nAward, \u00b6 365.\n\n349.\n\nRegarding the legitimate expectation of stability, InfraRed pointed to the Tribunal's decision in paragraph 365 establishing that the Tribunal \"does [] accept and agree with Respondent's position to the effect that a legitimate expectation of stability (*i.e.* immutability) can only arise in the presence of a specific commitment tendered directly to the investor or industry sector at issue.\"452\n\nAward, \u00b6366.\n\n350.\n\nInfraRed submitted that the Tribunal interpreted Article 10(1) of the ECT under the VCLT453, and in any case, the reasons behind the Tribunal's reasoning \"do not need to be explicitly stated as long as the reader can understand the decision reached by the tribunal*.*\"454 InfraRed argued that \"here, as all throughout the Award,455 the Tribunal took into consideration the Articles of the VCLT to analyze the content of Article 10(1) of the ECT, even if it did not explicitly mention them in its analysis.\"456\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6190.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6190.\n\n*See* e.g., Award, \u00b6\u00b6346, 358, 365, 366.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6190 and 191, with case law regarding similar definition and scope of the FET standard.\n\n351.\n\nIn any case, Spain's allegations will not lead to the annulment of the Award, because the Tribunal gave a detailed explanation of its interpretation of the FET and thus the Award is not annullable.457 In addition, and it appears very clear in the Award that the \"several standards of protection for investors in the energy sector\" contained in Article 10(1) ECT are much more favorable to them than the protection afforded by EU law.458\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6195.\n\nInfraRed's PHB, \u00b6\u00b695-97.\n\n352.\n\nInfraRed also argued that the Award did not contradict itself on liability. First, regarding the value that Tribunal provided to the \"Purported Agreement\" and the reasons for its comparison with other facts such as the normative changes before InfraRed investment and Supreme Court decisions, the Tribunal explained why the Spanish Supreme Court jurisprudence was irrelevant in the Arbitration459 and, as stated in *Impregilo,* there was no requirement for arbitral tribunals to indicate in an award the reasons why some types of evidence were more credible than others.460\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6199.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6199.\n\n353.\n\nInfraRed stated that \"inadequate reasons\" cannot lead by themselves to the annulment of the Award. Therefore, even if Spain's interpretation of Article 44.1 of the RD 667/2007 was correct (*quod non*) the latter will not lead to the annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICISID Convention.461\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 200-203.\n\n354.\n\nSimilarly, in the Rejoinder, InfraRed reiterated that the Tribunal reasoned its findings in relation to Article 10(1) of the ECT in more than 30 pages in the Award, where it (i) summarized the Parties' positions, (ii) cited the relevant recent awards that had addressed that matter, and (iii) provided a detailed analysis of its conclusions.462 It also devoted pages to the analysis of the standard governing the assessment of the FET clause under the ECT.463\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6234, quoting Award, \u00b6\u00b6 99-132.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6234, quoting Award, \u00b6\u00b6 100-110.\n\n355.\n\nRegarding legitimate expectations, InfraRed considered that the existence of the *Eiser* award was not relevant for the analysis of the present case. In its view, \"What is relevant is that, when the Tribunal issued its decision, the *Eiser* award (among others) was a relevant precedent which served as basis for the Tribunal's decision. In that regard, it is also worth noting that the *Eiser* award was annulled for reasons which are wholly unrelated to the tribunal's analysis of the FET standard under the ECT or its applications to the fact of that case.\"464\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6235 (ii).\n\n356.\n\nInfraRed highlighted that the Award, in paragraph 365, concluded that pursuant to *jurisprudence constante* the scope of the FET obligation is not limited to non-discrimination and that the FET obligation was rather a distinct standard linked to the legitimate expectations of investors as assessed on the facts of the case.465\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6239.\n\n357.\n\nIn addition, InfraRed considered that the Tribunal never made the statement that it would examine the \"jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court\".466 The phrase that Spain quoted comes from the Award's summary of the *Charanne* award and cannot be attributed to the Tribunal.467\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6243.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6243 quoting Award, \u00b639.\n\n358.\n\nSimilarly, regarding the 2010 Agreement, InfraRed argued that Spain omitted to cite the beginning of the sentence that confirms that the Tribunal considered the Purported Agreement as a fact (and not as a \"legally\" binding source of obligations as Spain seemed to allege).468 In the same line, Spain's argument that the Tribunal omitted to give an in-depth treatment to the evidence did not constitute grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).469 Therefore, the Tribunal did not have to explain why it preferred to rely on certain evidence and not on the documents Spain believes to be more relevant so this allegation for annulment should be dismissed.470\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6245.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6246.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6250.\n\n359.\n\nFor InfraRed \"the key point is that Article 10 of Energy Charter Treaty as well as the provisions of Part III of the Energy Charter Treaty on investment protections were the only legal provisions that the Tribunal had to review and apply for the purposes of finding if Spain had breached its international obligations,\"471 as allegedly the Tribunal did in paragraphs 272 in its entirety, 411, 443, 444, and the rest of the pages in the Award referring to Article 10 of the ECT.\n\nHearing Tr., Day 1, 15:12, lines 8-14.\n\n360.\n\nIn accordance with InfraRed's position, \"the Tribunal's decision on why it is not necessary to apply EU law is perfectly reasoned. The Tribunal considered Spain's allegations about the directives, about other references to EU law, but the Tribunal concluded that those specific references were not relevant to resolve the issues raised by this dispute.\"472\n\nHearing Tr., Day 1, 15:12, lines 18-24.\n\n6. The Tribunal reasoned its findings on damages\n------------------------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nInfraRed argued that Spain's position that there are inconsistencies in terms of liability and damages, that those are without merits and stressed that Spain was seeking annulment under this ground not because there were inconsistencies in the Award's reasoning of damages, but because it disagreed with the conclusions reached by the Tribunal.473 InfraRed stated that the \"Tribunal used the DCF Joint Model developed by Spain's and InfraRed's experts and chose to include some of the parameters suggested by Spain, such as the 25 operation life time of the plants and the reduction of Brattle's but for scenario by assuming Spain's production scenario based on the Bank Case.\"474\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6204.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6205.\n\n362.\n\nIn any case, there were no grounds for annulment because as long as the reasons have been stated, even if incorrect, unconvincing or non-exhaustive, the award cannot be annulled under Article 52(1)(e).475 Furthermore, \"Spain's anticipated intent to submit additional expert report together with its Reply on Annulment, InfraRed wants to point out that Spain cannot raise new arguments or submit new evidence.\"476\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6206.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6208.\n\n363.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, InfraRed mentioned that Spain considered that the Tribunal omitted to consider Accuracy's position regarding (i) the risk of higher premium of the Disputed Measures, and (ii) the point about the fact that the InfraRed's holdings became more difficult to sell after the Measure at issue.477 InfraRed noted that the Tribunal explicitly mentioned in the Award that \"in coming to th[e] conclusion [about the regulatory risk and the illiquidity discount] the Tribunal has carefully reviewed the opinion and the methodology of the Accuracy experts and of the Brattle experts.\"478 Contrary to Spain479, InfraRed considered that nothing in *TECO* or *Pey Casado* decisions suggested that \"insufficient\" and \"inadequate\" reasons can lead, by themselves, to the annulment of an award.480\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6252.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6252 quoting Award, \u00b6 580.\n\nReply, \u00b6 345.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6263.\n\n364.\n\nFor all of the reasons set forth above, InfraRed argued that there was no basis to annul the Award under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. Spain had not discharged its burden to prove that the Award is unreasoned. Rather, InfraRed had shown that the Award includes detailed reasons and was consistent.\n\n**E. THERE ARE NO GROUNDS TO ANNUL THE AWARD ON THE BASIS OF A SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n365.\n\nInfraRed submitted that Spain mischaracterized what can be considered as a \"serious departure\" under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.481\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6211.\n\n1. Spain avoids mentioning some important nuances of the legal standard under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n366.\n\nInfraRed disagreed with Spain on what constituted a \"departure\" from such rules in the present case.482 There was no departure from the right to observe rules if an applicant disagreed with the Tribunal's conclusion reached after the analysis of the evidence.483\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6216.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6217.\n\n367.\n\nThere may be a \"departure\" from the right to be heard and to be treated equally, as Spain explained, (i) when a party cannot present all relevant arguments and evidence,484 or (ii) when a party does not have the opportunity to respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other.485 Contrary to Spain's argument, however, the right to be heard did not mean to accord the same weight to the evidence provided by both parties.486\n\nMemorial, \u00b6256.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6257.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6219, Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6268-274, 295-298.\n\n368.\n\nInfraRed added that for establishing a departure of a fundamental rule of procedure during the arbitration, it was required that the party raise its objection during the Arbitration, particularly at the hearing.487 And Spain never argued, during 6 years of Arbitration, that the Tribunal had infringed its due process rights.488\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6221.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6221; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b611 and 134.\n\n369.\n\nIn no case Spain proved that the Award departed from fundamental rules of procedure and even less so that any alleged departure could be \"serious\". InfraRed argued that Spain misinterpreted the scope of this standard because it required (i) the existence of actual material prejudice, and (ii) a showing that the violation has caused \"substantially different result\" in the case.489 None of these factors had been demonstrated in Spain's submissions.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6224.\n\n2. The InfraRed Tribunal did not depart from any fundamental rule of procedure\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n370.\n\nSpain also contended that the Award suffered from one anomaly due to the \"scarce reference to the evidentiary activity developed in the oral hearings [\u2026] regarding the existence or not of a breach of the ECJ.\"490 However, the fact that Spain's application is directed to the Tribunal's \"judgement\" of the evidence presented by Spain, is not a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d).\n\nCounter-Memorial\u00b6 268, citing Memorial \u00b6268.\n\n371.\n\nRegarding the alleged Tribunal's lack of reference to the testimonies of Mr. Montoya and Mr. Caravantes, InfraRed contended that the Tribunal referred several times to those testimonies in the Award and during the hearing491 with multiple questions from the Tribunal. In addition to that, InfraRed argued that \"tribunals do not have to indicate in an award the reasons why some types of evidence are more credible than others.\"492\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6230.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6231-233.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal did not ignore Spain's evidence but simply used its \"discretion\" to evaluate the evidence of the case,493 and therefore InfraRed considered that Spain's application was \"just a petition for revision and reconsideration of the conclusion that the Tribunal reached from Mr. Caravantes and Mr. Montoya witness statements.\"494\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6233.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6234.\n\n373.\n\nAbout the shift on the burden of proof alleged by Spain495 on the issue of the due diligence to know the regulatory framework in which the investment was made, InfraRed considered that the Tribunal never reversed the burden of proof by offering a \"positive effect to the lack of Due Diligence.\"496 In its submission InfraRed argued that the Tribunal after considering Spain's arguments, came to the conclusion that \"a more thorough due diligence would not have alerted Claimants to the imminent enactment of the Measures in Question.\"497\n\nApplication for Annulment, \u00b660; Memorial, \u00b6281.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6236.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6236 quoting Award, \u00b644.\n\n374.\n\nInfraRed considered that the fact that Spain did not persuade the Tribunal with its allegation that a more exhaustive due diligence would have led to a different understanding, could not be a violation of any fundamental rule of procedure.498\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6237; Rejoinder, \u00b6146.\n\n375.\n\nSimilarly, InfraRed was of the position that the Tribunal did not ignore the Spanish Supreme Court judgements but disagreed with Spain's position as to their relevance, shown in paragraphs 439-441 of the Award.499 The Tribunal explicitly mentioned the case law of the Supreme Court when analyzing the due diligence that InfraRed performed,500 and considered that they were not relevant to the analysis of InfraRed's legitimate expectations.501 Therefore, it is evident that the Award did not depart from a fundamental rule of procedure.502\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6238.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6239.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6240.\n\nCounter-Memorial, 241.\n\n376.\n\nInfraRed argued that, contrary to Spain,503 the Tribunal did consider other relevant evidence in the proceeding. It devoted four pages to summarize all the evidence that Spain submitted in order to convince the Tribunal that Spain did not breach InfraRed's legitimate expectations.504 Furthermore, InfraRed argued that \"it is settled that a Tribunal does not have an obligation to make a reference in the Award to each piece of evidence.\"505\n\nMemorial, \u00b6295.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6245.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6246.\n\n377.\n\nContrary, to Spain's argument506, InfraRed submitted that the Tribunal's reasoning on legitimate expectations was not based mainly upon the December Resolutions:507\n\n\"A plain reading of the Award shows that after analyzing all the evidence in the record, the Tribunal concluded, among others, that several evidence including the (i) the Purported Agreement, (ii) the waiver letters, and (iii) the enactment of RD 1614/2010 gave rise to a legitimate expectation that Spain would not adopt any changes to the Original Regulatory Regime. Still, this argument from Spain would in no case lead to any departure of a fundamental rule of procedure.\"\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 296.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 247.\n\n378.\n\nFor these reasons, InfraRed argued that the Award must be confirmed.\n\n379.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, InfraRed reiterated that under Article 52(1)(d), the Committee may scrutinize whether the procedure was conducted according to basic rules of procedure. InfraRed further asserted that because ICSID tribunals have wide discretion on this matter, annulment committees are not tasked with reevaluating the weight accorded by the tribunal to the evidence submitted by the parties.508 InfraRed quoted *Vivendi v. Argentina*, *Dogan v. Turkmenistan* and *Caratube v. Kazakhstan* in support of its argument.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6153.\n\n380.\n\nThus, InfraRed considered that the argument regarding the standard of burden of proof should be left to the discretion of the Tribunal because they are responsible for assessing the probative value of evidence in the case.509\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6151.\n\n381.\n\nIn addition to that, InfraRed considered that in any case the Tribunal's weighing of the evidence did not seriously depart from any fundamental rules of procedure. The Tribunal distributed the burden of proof in accordance with the most basic due process principles.510\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6157-158.\n\n382.\n\nInfraRed considered that the Tribunal based its findings of a reasonable and legitimate expectation of stability on: (i) the Waiver Letters, (ii) the December 2010 Resolutions, (iii) Article 4 of RD 1614/2010, (iv) Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007, (v) the press release issued by Spain on July, 2010, (vi) the press release issued by the Council of Ministers on December 3, 2010, (vii) public remarks by Spain's Secretary of State for Energy in July 2010, (viii) public remarks from Spain's Minister of Energy, and numerous emails exchanged between Protermosolar and Industry Ministry.511\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6159.\n\n383.\n\nIt further added that when the Tribunal became convinced that the December resolutions were the \"clear expression of a specific commitment*,*\"512 the burden of proof was shifted to the Spain to prove otherwise. However, as the Tribunal explained513 when considering Spain's arguments and evidence, the analysis of Spain's evidence confirmed that \"even a more thorough due diligence would not have alerted Claimants of the impending enactment of the Measures at Issue, in particular that the 'tariffs, premiums and lower and upper limits' would be modified or altogether rescinded even for the CSP plants that were registered in the Pre-allocation Register, such as the Mor\u00f3n and Olivenza 1 plants.\"514\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6160.\n\nAward, \u00b6447.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6160, quoting Award, \u00b6447.\n\n384.\n\nInfraRed considered that the Tribunal confronted the Claimant's evidence with Spain's arguments and evidence, including the experts and witness testimony as shown in paragraphs 412-447.515\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6161.\n\n385.\n\nInfraRed further considered that Spain did not provide evidence that of a \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" with the decision about the quantification of damages, nor it has provided evidence that the alleged departure caused an actual \"material prejudice\" and a \"substantially different result\" in the case.516\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6172 (emphasis in the original).\n\n386.\n\nInfraRed contended that Spain was accorded with a full, fair and comparatively equal opportunity to rebut claims and submit evidence relating to the effect of management costs and value of the debt.517 However, Spain raised this argument in the annulment procedure, the late nature of the claim evidence that the Tribunal never departed from a rule of procedure.518\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6174.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6175.\n\n387.\n\nThe Tribunal evaluated the expert's arguments along with the comments to the Joint Model. Regarding certain points the Tribunal chose Accuracy's position and on other issues the Tribunal sided with the Brattle's view.519\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6177.\n\n388.\n\nInfraRed argued that the reference to the *TECO v. Guatemala* case, is not applicable to the present case since in that case the Committee decided to annul the award because the tribunal introduced the concept of unjust enrichment in the award, even though none of the parties had ever argued the concept of unjust enrichment.520\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6178.\n\n389.\n\nFurthermore, InfraRed considered that the management costs and the value of the debt costs were \"minor points among a myriad of disagreements between the experts on damages\" and that \"[t]he Parties barely discussed these points in their pleadings,\" and their experts devoted only a few paragraphs in their respective reports to explain that.521 InfraRed considered that \"despite their almost trivial nature, the Tribunal expressly and fully addressed both issues in the Award.\"522\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6180.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6181, citing Award, \u00b6\u00b6520, 590-595.\n\n390.\n\nRegarding the management costs the Tribunal adopted the Brattle's thesis, which was conservative and, supported by third-party data, expert testimony and witness testimony.523 Regarding the value of the debt, InfraRed contended that contrary to Spain's submission, the Tribunal evaluated the Joint Model and the economic effect of adopting one position or another.524 But that did not mean, in InfraRed's position, that the Tribunal was obliged to explain the impact of adopting Brattle's position, since an ICSID tribunal is not obliged to do this,525 and failing to make such a comment does not result in an actual \"material prejudice\" or a \"substantial different result.\"526\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 182-189.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6191.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6192.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n391.\n\nIn addition to that, InfraRed argued that it was not true that the Tribunal ignored the explanations that Accuracy provided in determining the debt to be applied in the Joint Model, \"the truth is that Accuracy provided no such explanation.\"527\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6193.\n\n392.\n\nTherefore, in the Rejoinder, InfraRed argued that the Tribunal's conclusions on every point raised by the Parties demonstrate that the Tribunal did not breach Spain's right to a fair trial and to be heard and Spain did not demonstrate a *'*serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure' according to Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.528\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6165.\n\n393.\n\nIn addition, in the Rejoinder, InfraRed claimed that the Award did not violate Spain's right to be heard. At every stage of the arbitral proceedings, Spain was afforded a full, fair and equal opportunity to present its case, defenses and evidence regarding the claims it decided to make. It also had the opportunity to rebut and was always informed of all claims brought by InfraRed. Therefore, the Tribunal afforded Spain with due process and, specifically with full rights to be heard at every stage of the arbitral proceedings.529 The *Fraport* case was not similar to the present case.530 Similarly, InfraRed considered that Spain's line of argument regarding the connection between *Pey Casado*, the decision in *TECO* and *Caratube* was impossible to understand.531\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6138.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6139.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6142.\n\n394.\n\nThis was the case with the fact that \"the Tribunal devotes four pages to summarize all the evidence that Spain submitted in order to convince the Tribunal that Spain did not breach InfraRed's legitimate expectations (*i.e.*, the same amount of pages that the Tribunal devoted to summarize InfraRed's evidence to that regard).\"532\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6245.\n\n395.\n\nInfraRed agreed that \"the Tribunal did not mention in the Award each of the more than 1300 legal and factual exhibits, annexes to 10 expert reports or specific facts included in the 6 witness statements,\"533 and that it is settled that a tribunal does not have an obligation to make a reference in the award to each piece of evidence.534\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6246.\n\n396.\n\nIn conclusion, InfraRed considered that the Tribunal did not breach Spain's right to be heard and that the allegation should be dismissed.\n\n3. Spain's allegation of lack of impartiality is devoid of any basis\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n397.\n\nFinally, regarding the allegations of impartiality raised by Spain,535 InfraRed considered those allegations as not \"serious,\" and that the Committee should not waste any time on this unjustified statement.536 Similarly, there was no \"departure\" from such as rule because Spain has not adduced any evidence that proves a manifest lack of independence and impartiality on the part of the Tribunal.537 Therefore, Spain challenges under Article 52(1)(d) for an alleged \"departure\" from a \"fundamental rule of procedure\" should be disregarded.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6304.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6250.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n398.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, InfraRed argued that Spain had abandoned its very serious accusation relating to an alleged \"lack of impartiality and unequal treatment\" by the Tribunal,538 and that such accusation is one the most serious accusations a party can raise against an arbitral tribunal, the fact that Spain had decided to exclude this ground from its Reply demonstrated that the annulment petition is based on frivolous arguments.539\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6132.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n**VII. ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n----------------------------------\n\n**A. THE NATURE OF ANNULMENT PROCEEDINGS AND THE POWERS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n399.\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention governs the duties and limits of an *ad hoc* committee called to decide an annulment request. The interpretation of this article is not very complex for a number of reasons. First, this provision is clear in its content: the ICSID system is generally considered to be self-contained as noted in the \"Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016\" (**Updated Background Paper**).540 While the Updated Background Paper is not binding on this Committee, it is nevertheless a useful tool to which both Parties refer to in support of their positions.\n\nRL-0118, Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID May 5, 2016.\n\n400.\n\nSecond, the Parties do not disagree on what is a cornerstone of ICSID arbitration: that annulment proceedings cannot be construed as an appeal against an award, but rather as a solution to avoid illegal awards to survive in the international community.541 The Committee considers that in the process of drawing a line between annulment and appeal, it is worthwhile to look for inspiration in leading scholars, as is the case of Prof. Schreuer when he explains that \"annulment deals only with the legitimacy of the decision-making process, not its merits\"542 and that \"[i]n every published annulment decision to date, ad hoc committees have stressed this distinction.\"543\n\nAs it has been put in RL-0118, \u00b672, \"it does not provide a mechanism to appeal alleged misapplication of law or mistake in fact\".\n\nCL-328, Schreuer, C., Malintoppi, L., Reinisch, A., &amp; Sinclair, A. (2009). *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, Article 52, \u00b674.\n\nCL-328, Schreuer, Article 52, \u00b613.\n\n401.\n\nThird, prior decisions and awards have no precedential value in international arbitration. However, it is common practice for arbitrators to take into account those decisions when interpretating the applicable substantive or procedural rules. This is obvious and more so in investment arbitration, let alone ICSID arbitration, not only due to the fact that it is rather common that issues such as those of jurisdiction and interpretation of BIT's and MIT's are very similar, but also because for reasons of transparency and others, awards and decisions are publicly available.\n\n402.\n\nEach arbitration is unique, and hence, it is not possible to extrapolate from general concepts of law a solution that will fit into each and every situation. The same argument applies to similar decisions issued by prior arbitral tribunals and *ad hoc* committees, even more so when it is possible to find decisions that reach incompatible conclusions.\n\n403.\n\nNevertheless, it is generally accepted, and proposed by both Parties here, to look for jurisprudence that faced issues similar to those at stake, mostly in this case coming from other *ad hoc* committees.\n\n404.\n\nThe Committee is of the opinion that its powers are limited544 by the ICSID Convention (and the ECT) as \"the annulment is a limited remedy.\"545 As such, it cannot extend its powers to look at the Award as a decision to be amended, which would be possible under a different system having with an appeal tribunal.\n\nRL-0118, \u00b674.\n\nCL-328, *MINE*; Schreuer, Article 52, \u00b613 using the expression \"the narrow confines of annulment\".\n\n405.\n\nThis means that members of *ad hoc* committees must refuse the \"temptation\" of looking to ICSID awards as if they could enter into the shoes of the arbitrators to reassess facts and law and to \"recreate\" a solution that eventually might be considered by them as a better outcome for the case. The committees cannot \"review the awards' findings for errors of fact or law.\"546\n\nCL-328, Schreuer, Article 52, \u00b613.\n\n406.\n\nThis risk \u2013 as any risk \u2013 is part of the human condition. But for decades, *ad hoc* committees, as if applying an almost unanimous rule, have not deviated from their duties, nor will this Committee do it. This practice is an inspiration and also an element to take into account in the exercise of the duties vested upon the Members of the Committee.\n\n407.\n\nThe intention of the drafters of the ICSID Convention has been \"to reconcile finality of the award with the need to prevent flagrant cases of excess of jurisdiction and injustice.\"547 This intention has been implemented under the Convention by conferring to annulment committees \"a limited scope of review which would safeguard against 'violation of the fundamental principles of law governing the tribunal's proceedings.'\"548\n\nRL-0118, \u00b69.\n\nRL-0118, \u00b671.\n\n408.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee concludes that \"there is no presumption either in favour of or against annulment.\"549 In the same vein, when interpretating the grounds for annulment, \"there is compelling support for the view that neither a narrow nor a broad approach is to be applied.\"550\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS**\n--------------------------------\n\n1. Interpretation of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submission*\n-----------------------\n\n410.\n\nThe Applicant considers that a tribunal exceeds the powers initially granted to it by the parties' consent when the tribunal omits to apply the appropriate law, or when the tribunal exceeds its jurisdiction, or rules on a matter in which it does not have jurisdiction.551 Also, the reference to \"manifest\" is to be understood as being demonstrated that it is \"easy to understand.\"552\n\nMemorial, \u00b652 and RL-0118, \u00b687.\n\nReply, \u00b648.\n\n411.\n\nSpain also argues553 that a \"manifest excess of powers\" occurs when the Tribunal disregards the applicable law, or its misinterpretation or misapplication of the law is \"so gross or egregious that it substantially amounts to a failure to apply the correct law.\"554\n\nMemorial, \u00b653.\n\nRL-0086, Previous Annex-004, *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v.

Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for Annulment of the Award, June 29, 2010.\n\n412.\n\nAccording to Spain, a \"manifest excess of powers,\" occurs when a tribunal commits \"a serious and consequential misinterpretation or misapplication of the correct law, which no reasonable person (*bon p\u00e8re de famille*) could accept,\" and it \"must be distinguished from a simple error - even a serious error - in the interpretation of the law.\"555\n\nMemorial, \u00b654, quoting RL-0086, Previous Annex-004, *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v.

Ecuador* to state that \"excess of powers can be committed by both overreaching and underreaching,\"556 and considers that to accept jurisdiction when a tribunal has not is clearly a manifest excess of powers,557 as is the case with intra-EU disputes.\n\nMemorial, \u00b665\n\nReply, \u00b629.\n\n414.\n\nIn its Memorial and Reply, Spain refers to sections of the Award in which it alleges that Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention was breached. Each one of these specific situations will be analyzed below.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n415.\n\nThe Respondents consider that Spain is seeking a reconsideration of the Award and \"challenging the assessment of the legal and factual evidence\"558 by replicating the same arguments presented during the Arbitration.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b637.\n\n416.\n\nThe Respondents also state that the alleged violation of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention is built into the disregard of the difference between appeal and annulment, also through the introduction of new evidence on the merits which is forbidden under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.559\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b639-42; Rejoinder, \u00b620-22.\n\n417.\n\nThe Respondents also posit that, in accordance with the ICSID Convention, any \"excess of powers\" by a tribunal must be \"manifest,\" that is, obvious, self-evident, clear, and substantially serious. In addition, \"excess of powers\" will only exist \"where the action in question is clearly capable of making a difference to the result of the case.\"560\n\nInfraRed PHB, \u00b69.\n\n418.\n\nThe Respondents' rebuttal to each of Spain's alleged excess of powers will be analyzed below.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n419.\n\nIn a holistic view of the \"manifest excess of powers\" as ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee emphasizes the relevance of the \"manifest\" criterion.\n\n420.\n\nAs referenced in the Updated Background Paper, in the Legal Committee 1964 meeting, a proposal to have the term \"manifest\" omitted from the ICSID Convention draft was defeated.561\n\nRL-0118, \u00b619-20.\n\n421.\n\nIt follows that not any kind of evidenced excess of powers would be enough to conclude that a violation of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention might occur. Therefore, the Committee will first analyze each one of the invoked grounds of excess of powers, and if it concludes that excess of powers occurred, the Committee will then analyze whether this was \"manifest.\" On the interpretation of the \"manifest\" condition for the relevance of an evidenced excess of powers, the Committee does not accept Spain's position that any excess \"easy to understand\" is manifest, as this does not correspond to the best interpretation of that condition taking also into account \"the narrow confines of annulment.\"562\n\nCL-328, Schreuer, Article 52, \u00b613.\n\n422.\n\nQuite the opposite, the Committee favors the dominant trend of committees that have been called to apply Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention under which to be 'manifest,' the excess needs to be obvious, self-evident, make a difference for the outcome of the case and not be based in new evidence.563\n\nSee RL-0086, Previous Annex-004EN, *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v.

Manifest excess of powers by conferring international protection to investors with unclean hands and by disregarding the application of international *ius cogens* and conferring protection on those who acted on the basis of deceit and fraud in their investment process\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submission*\n-----------------------\n\n425.\n\nSpain posits that \"the exercise of a right in cases where the person invoking it has acted in bad faith, fraudulently or illegally\"568 must be restricted and that this constitutes a general principle of international law.\n\nMemorial, \u00b669.\n\n426.\n\nAccording to Spain, the invoking party (InfraRed) exercised rights without \"clean hands\", because Article 27 of the 1997 Law569 required as an \"essential condition\" that to be eligible under RD 661/2007,570 the facilities had an \"installed capacity [not] exceeding 50 MW.\"571 Under the Applicant's view, InfraRed committed \"severe misrepresentations\" by declaring that \"its installed capacity was 50 MW, although it was considerably higher.\"572\n\nR-0003, Law 54/1997 of 27 November 1997 on the Electricity Sector.\n\nR-0062, Royal Decree 661/2007 of 25 May 2007.\n\nMemorial, \u00b676, quoting RL-0157, *Nextera Energy Global Holdings BV and Nextera Energy Spain Holdings BV v.

Spain referred to Article 26(6) ECT, Article 42 of the ICSID Convention and Article 38 of the ICJ Statute to conclude that there was \"an absolute prohibition on benefiting from illicit and fraudulent acts.\"573 Therefore, InfraRed and its \"bad faith in investment violates the most elementary principles of international law.\"574\n\nMemorial, \u00b683.\n\nMemorial, \u00b684.\n\n428.\n\nSpain also posits that the Tribunal based its conclusion in relation to the installed capacity examined in the *Eiser* award, which was annulled,575 therefore must be considered as non-existent.\n\nSee \u00b6123 above.\n\n429.\n\nIn light of the above, Spain concludes that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim because of the unclean hands of InfraRed. Therefore, the Committee must annul the Award \"on the ground that essential principles of international law and *jus cogens* had not been applied.\"576\n\nMemorial, \u00b686; Reply, \u00b650.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n430.\n\nInfraRed requests the Committee to dismiss the clean hands defense because of the following reasons.\n\n431.\n\nFirst, Spain is barred from invoking that doctrine, even if *quod non* it is applicable, because it was not addressed in the Arbitration and only presented in the annulment proceedings based on the Rozas Report, which was inadmissible in accordance with PO1.577\n\nSee \u00b6264 above.\n\n432.\n\nSecond, Spain failed to show any excess of powers and is attempting to reopen the debate since \"[t]he Tribunal concluded that: (i) the term 'installed capacity' in Article 29(1) of the EPA 1997 should be read as 'net output', and (ii) InfraRed's CSP Plants net output was always equal or lower to 50MW.\"578\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6120.\n\n433.\n\nSpain never proved during the Arbitration that InfraRed's conduct in relation to the installed capacity constituted a crime579 and the Award gave \"significant weight to the fact the Spanish National Commission of Energy (CNE) recognized in its own documents that the installed capacity was under 50MW.\"580\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6121.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n434.\n\nInfraRed also posits that the elements of the alleged crimes of subsidies fraud and falsification of documents were not demonstrated by Spain,581 and the accusation of illegality was unsupported.582\n\nRejoinder, \u00b660-62.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b664.\n\n435.\n\nTherefore, InfraRed concludes that even if the Tribunal had not decided that the installed capacity was compatible with the threshold for accessing the benefits, the alleged facts would never correspond to a criminal behavior.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n436.\n\nThe clean hands doctrine was not addressed by Spain \u2013 at least not in a direct way, able to be understood by the Tribunal - in the Arbitration. It has been evidenced that the arguments and legal opinions (Rozas Report and Demetrio Report) filed in the annulment proceedings could have been presented before to benefit from the opportunity of being addressed in the Award,583 as all the elements for the alleged applicability of the clean hand's doctrine were present. This would have been enough to conclude that Spain is barred from the possibility of invoking now the \"clean hands\" *exceptio.* The Rozas Report shares that same view,584 without prejudice to the possibility of the Committee being able to analyze the facts under a different approach.\n\nThis has been confirmed by Professor Sanchez (co-author of the Rozas Report) when answering to a question of the President (Hearing Tr., 16:08, lines 5-12) and Professor Demetrio (Hearing Tr., Day 2, 15:14, lines 1-5).\n\n\"In light of the Award of August 2, 2020, it follows that the Kingdom of Spain did not raise a preliminary objection relating to the lack of jurisdiction of the Centre or of the tribunal's competence based on the unlawful or fraudulent conduct of the Claimants, and that such a circumstance cannot be invoked in the application for annulment\" (Rozas Report \u00b656), which has been confirmed by Professor Sanchez, co-author of the Rozas Report, answering to a question of the President at the Final Hearing: \"What I'm saying there, obviously it's not mentioned, but the premise is that when you make a request for annulment, you can't introduce any new facts or new arguments. The only thing we know is the Award: that's what we base our opinion on\" (Hearing Tr., Day 2. 16:06, lines 19-23.\n\n437.\n\nEven if this was not the case, an independent Tribunal assessing the available evidence and discussions between qualified counsel, after a very clear and grounded analysis, reached a conclusion on the installed capacity that was opposite to the one advocated by Spain.585 This means that InfraRed's behavior was at least admissible as in no way the elements of the alleged crimes of subsidies fraud and falsification can be taken for granted, let alone considered demonstrated.\n\nThis has been confirmed by Professor Demetrio at the Hearing when asked by Counsel to InfraRed: \"Q. The Tribunal dismissed such alternative scenario of damages because the Tribunal understood that the plants were not inadmissible under the special regime, right? A. That's what I understand. Q. Thank you\" (Hearing Tr., Day 2, 14:33, lines 13.17).\n\n438.\n\nIn any event, the Committee admitted to the record the legal opinions submitted by Spain because they were not considered \"experts reports\" for the purposes of PO1. Accordingly, Professor Demetrio (author of the Demetrio Report) testified in the Hearing. The Committee concludes that the issues of criminal behavior were debatable, even if the facts presented by Spain as assumptions for the Demetrio Report were demonstrated, which was not the case.\n\n439.\n\nAs admitted by Professor Demetrio in the Hearing, the rule of the presumption of innocence is part of Spain's legal regime and no criminal court has ever declared that InfraRed committed the crimes of subsidies fraud and falsification of documents. It has also been evidenced that the Plants received from Spain remuneration that they would not be entitled to receive if the assumptions presented by Spain for the Demetrio Report were correct.586\n\nHearing Tr., Day 2, 14:35, lines 1-19.\n\n440.\n\nIt has also been established that, in accordance with Spanish Criminal Law, the crime of subsidy fraud must be committed willfully (with *dolo*).587 The alleged falsification of the nameplate in the installation may be relevant, not as element of the crime of falsification, but rather because \"it might lead to a misapplication of something, in terms of the concurrent crime, this falsity is instrumental. According to the legal doctrine, and since this is a commercial document, as such it would not be considered as a crime under the typification of subsidy fraud.\"588\n\nHearing Tr., Day 2, 14:35, lines 21-5 and 14:37, lines 1-6. See also Hearing Tr., 14:33, lines 15-22.\n\nProfessor Demetrio, Hearing, Day 2, 14:50, lines 8-16. However, in the same Day 2, 14:56, lines 8-19 Professor refers that in spite of being instrumental of the subsidy fraud crime, the alleged falsification of the nameplate must be considered autonomously as a crime.\n\n441.\n\nThe Committee does not agree with Spain's argument on the effect of the annulled *Eiser* award. It appears that the conclusions of this award in relation to the issue of installed capacity were taken into account by the Tribunal in the Award. However, not as a precedent (which does not exist as such in international arbitration) but rather as a legal authority (which also include scholarly opinions) and the Committee does not agree with the proposition that the annulment of the *Eiser* award for reasons not related \u2013 even remotely \u2013 with the issue of the installed capacity, could have as a consequence the annulment of the Award, even if this was relevant for the clean hands argument, which is not the case.\n\n442.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request as presented by the Applicant.\n\n3. Manifest excess of powers by rejecting the intra-EU objection and hearing a dispute between an EU Member State and claimants from another EU Member State to which neither the United Kingdom nor Spain consented\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submission*\n-----------------------\n\n443.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Tribunal \"exceed[ed] its powers by going beyond its jurisdiction\"589 when hearing a case between a company from an EU Member State and a Member State, breaching EU law.\n\nMemorial, \u00b687.\n\n444.\n\nSpain also posits that the principle of primacy of EU law, stated in Declaration 17 of the TFEU,590 mandates that \"within the EU, the Member States have decided that, for the purposes of self-organization and as a necessary precondition for their integration, EU law should apply to intra-Community matters, while international conventions remain in force for relations with third countries\"591 and that the EU has followed a practice to regulate intra-Community affairs through its internal legislation.592 Such practice began with \"the decision of the EUJ in the *Van Geend* &amp; *Loos* case593 which established the principle of autonomy of EU law and was confirmed by the judgment of the EUJ *Costa/ENEL*594 which declared the principle of the primacy of EU law to be beyond doubt.\"595 Spain referred also to the *Achmea* Judgment596 which states that \"Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU are to be interpreted as prohibiting a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor of one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an Arbitral Tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.\"597 This was reiterated by the Declaration Achmea598-and, more recently by the judgement of the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union of September 2, 2021, issued in the Case *C-741/19.

Komstroy* Judgment go to the very core of a particularly relevant ground for annulment raised by the Kingdom of Spain: that the Tribunal manifestly lacked jurisdiction for this intra-EU case and therefore committed a manifest extralimitation.\"600\n\nSpain letter received by the Committee on September 10, 2021.\n\n446.\n\nSpain also extracts from the judgment the CJEU's conclusion that there never was an offer to arbitrate made by Spain to intra-EU investors because \"Article 26(2)(c) ECT must be interpreted as not being applicable to disputes between a Member State and an investor of another Member State concerning an investment made by the latter in the first Member State.\"601\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n447.\n\nSpain posits that the Tribunal did not analyze all the rules of interpretation provided for in Article 31 of the VCLT, arguing that a good faith interpretation of the VCLT would deny the possibility of an intra-EU arbitration of the basis of the ECT,602 and merely stated \u2013 wrongly \u2013 that there was no disconnection clause in the ECT, without which the States members of the EU and itself could not withdraw from the ECT. Spain further notes that the Tribunal misapplied Article 1(3) of the ECT and the transfer of competences from States to the EU, which therefore resulted in an \"inappropriateness of the application of the Article 26 ECT to the intra-EU disputes.\"603\n\nSpain's PHB, \u00b6\u00b6 38-47.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6104.\n\n448.\n\nIn a subsidiary way, Spain argues that if Article 26 of the ECT was deemed to cover intra-Community disputes, such interpretation would conflict with EU law, and that conflict must be resolved in favor of EU law.604\n\nMemorial, \u00b6105.\n\n449.\n\nSpain argues that the Award should be annulled under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention because the Tribunal exceeded its powers by finding jurisdiction in an intra-EU dispute,605 when it was not entitled to do so under international law.606\n\nMemorial, \u00b6114; Reply, \u00b6\u00b652-56.\n\nReply, \u00b698.\n\n450.\n\nThe EU Commission made similar arguments in its *amicus curiae* brief. The Commission alleges that \"[a]s '*guardian'* of those Treaties, the Commission has a particular interest in avoiding any conflict between ICSID awards based on the Energy Charter Treaty (\"ECT\") and EU law.\"607\n\nEU Commission Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b62.\n\n451.\n\nFor that reason, the Commission states that \"upon proper interpretation of the ECT and the ICSID Convention, no conflict between those treaties and EU law exists.\"608\n\nEU Commission Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b63.\n\n452.\n\nThe Commission also cites to *BayWa v. Spain* and *Vattenfall v. Germany,* concluding that these tribunals had \"recognize[d] that judgments of the Court of Justice of the EU (\"CJEU\") are binding upon EU Member States and intra-EU arbitral tribunals established under the ICSID Convention as a matter of public international law.\"609\n\nEU Commission Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b66.\n\n453.\n\nThe Commission assumes that \"the arbitral tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers, by deciding that it had jurisdiction, whereas up-on proper interpretation of Article 26 ECT and proper application of the conflict rule of primacy and Article 41 VCLT, it should have declined jurisdiction.\"610\n\nEU Commission Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b613.\n\n454.\n\nThe Commission accords high relevance to the fact that the \"CJEU has decided that EU law constitutes public international law applicable between EU Member States\" and that its \"case-law is binding on arbitral tribunals.\"611\n\nEU Commission Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b619.\n\n455.\n\nThe Commission also gives importance to the \"primacy\" and \"autonomy of the EU legal order\" and based on these principles posits that under Articles 267 and 344 of TFEU, the need to always assure \"uniform interpretation and application of EU law\" is served \"by prohibiting Member States from creating, in relation to any matter implicating EU law, dispute settlement mechanisms other than those set out in the EU Treaties.\"612\n\nEU Commission Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b6\u00b622-23.\n\n456.\n\nAs far as the ECT is concerned, the Commission gives high ground to the fact that it was \"only\" the European Commission that \"invited other States to negotiate the European Energy,\"613 that \"ECT specifically recognises the EU as REIO\",614 which has consequences as far as the ECT concept of \"Area\" is concerned,615 that \"[i]t was never the intention of the EU Member States (or indeed the EU itself) to modify or replace those internal rules by an international treaty such as the ECT\"616 and that \"the context in which the ECT came about described in this section clearly indicates that it was not intended to bind the Member States *inter se.*\"617\n\nEU Commission Amicus

Curiae Brief, \u00b642.\n\n457.\n\nIn accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT, regarding the ordinary meaning of the terms used \"in their context and in light of [the treaty's] object and purpose\" \"there is no reason to conclude that the terms of the ECT require an interpretation of Article 26 ECT in such a way that it is found to apply intra-EU.\"618\n\nEU Commission Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b6\u00b639 and 46.\n\n458.\n\nThe Commission emphasizes that, contrary to the Award's findings, there is no need for a disconnection clause to conclude that an arbitral tribunal under the ECT has no jurisdiction to adjudicate intra-EU disputes.619\n\nEU Commission Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b6\u00b650-56.\n\n459.\n\nTherefore, the Commission concludes that the Tribunal erred in the Award by not giving legal relevance under the VCLT to internal decisions of the EU, to the rulings of the TFEU, to the Commission Communication of 19 July 2018 on the Protection of intra-EU investment,620 and to the Declaration of the Member States of 15 January 2019 on the legal consequences of the *Achmea* Judgment and on investment protection in the European Union.621\n\nEU Commission Amicus Curiae Brief,

reject the application of EU law followed a pattern already established by other arbitral tribunals in similar cases,622 and that the fact that 32 tribunals reached the same conclusion623 (and \"to date not a single tribunal has accepted Spain's intra-EU objection\"624) is clear evidence that the Tribunal was not unreasonable in its conclusion and, in any event, Spain failed to prove that the alleged excess of powers was \"manifest.\"625\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b626, 29-30.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b675.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b677.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b669.\n\n461.\n\nInfraRed posits that Spain's conclusions that the Tribunal did not consider the rules of interpretation of Article 31 of the VCLT, or that it merely indicated that there is no disconnection in the ECT, or that it allegedly ignored the July 2019 EU Council from 21 Member States626 are inaccurate.627\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b683 quoting the Application on Annulment, \u00b618 and \u00b6104.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b683\n\n462.\n\nInfraRed alleges that the Tribunal analyzed the ordinary meaning and context of the term \"*Area*\" from Article 26(1), to conclude that it meant \"the territory under the state's sovereignty\" or \"the territory under the sovereignty of the member states of such REIO\",628 which InfraRed argued was not manifestly arbitrary or unreasonable.629\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b684.\n\nInfraRed's PHB, \u00b6\u00b631-46.\n\n463.\n\nThe Tribunal also analyzed the context of the same Article 26 highlighting that it provided that \"even in case of conflict with another treaty to the extent that the ECT is \"more favourable to the Investor or the Investment,\"630 and that Spain \"had the burden of showing that the EU legal system provides a method to resolve Claimants' dispute with Spain that is 'more favorable' to the investors than the one provided at Article 26(1) ECT\", which it did not.631\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b686 quoting Award, \u00b6264.\n\nAward, \u00b6264.\n\n464.\n\nInfraRed argues that Spain mischaracterized the findings of the Tribunal in relation to the absence of a disconnection clause in the ECT, as the Tribunal remarked that this conclusion would have been different \"if the EU members states that signed the January Declarations [had] withdrawn from the ECT or activated the procedure for amending the ECT.\"632\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b689; Award, \u00b6272.\n\n465.\n\nRegarding the argument related to the July 2019 Declaration, InfraRed contends that this communication was not relevant because, as the Tribunal recognized, \"they were not adopted within the EU legal order and are not EU legal instruments.\"633\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b691.\n\n466.\n\nIt is the opinion of InfraRed that in relation to the *Achmea* Judgment, the Tribunal concluded that \"the ECJ [\u2026] has not taken so far any position as to the applicability of its judgement in the *Achmea* case to arbitration tribunals jurisdiction of which is based on the ECT.\"634 Therefore, InfraRed alleges that Spain could not claim that *Achmea* also applies to \"multilateral treaties such as the ECT\"635 and less that the Tribunal did not give the proper value to this decision.\n\nAward, *\u00b6*269 (emphasis added).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6101.\n\n467.\n\nInfraRed also considers irrelevant the judgment of the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union, issued in the Case *C-741/19. Republic of Moldova v Komstroy*, as it alleges, among other arguments, that \"the question on the intra-EU applicability of the ECT does not form part of the question posed by the French court, nor of the CJEU's response\", that \"the judgment shows that the intra-EU issue is far from obvious or self-evident [\u2026] and demonstrates that the Tribunal's decision, rendered in line with the totality of previous resolutions that dismissed the objection, was at least reasonable and defensible\", that \"the Committee does not have the power to reconsider the merits of Spain's intra-EU objection de novo with or without the newest judgment\", and that the \"judgment cannot undermine the application of Articles 16 and 46 ECT. Neither the EU nor certain EU Member States have the power to modify the ECT by themselves as a matter of international law, let alone with retroactive effects to decisions rendered years earlier.\"636\n\nInfraRed letter to the Committee, dated September 16, 2021.\n\n468.\n\nFurthermore, InfraRed considers that Spain failed to show why the Tribunal's interpretation of Article 26(6) of the ECT was unclear or unreasonable as required by Article 52(1)(b) of ICSID Convention, and it stated that the Tribunal applied the VCLT when interpreting Article 26(6) of the ECT.\n\n469.\n\nInfraRed also mentions that Spain did not prove why paragraph 272 of the Award (stating that there is no incompatibility between EU law and ECT provisions) is unclear or unreasonable, as required under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n470.\n\nAs a rebuttal to Prof. Gosalbo's allegations, InfraRed points to the expert declarations of Priet Eeckout, who indicates that \"[t]he objections in the *Achmea* Judgment against intra-EU arbitration are expressly confined to bilateral agreements between Member States which have not been concluded by the EU; they therefore do not extend to the ECT.\"637\n\nRejoinder, \u00b687, quoting CL-359, \u00b611 (emphasis original from the text).\n\n471.\n\nFinally, InfraRed submits that under Article 16(2) of the ECT, the contracting parties to the ECT, including the EU, specifically and explicitly agreed that previous or subsequent treaties that they entered into with each other shall not be construed to derogate from any provision in Part III (\"Investment Promotion and Protection,\" including the substantive protections) or Part V (\"Dispute Settlement\") of the ECT, where a provision is more favorable to the investor. Therefore, Article 26 of the ECT, which was more favorable to an investor, should prevail over EU law,638 and Spain's submission that EU law has \"primacy\" over the ECT lacks support.639\n\nRejoinder, \u00b691; InfraRed's PHB, \u00b6\u00b667-99.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b691-92.\n\n472.\n\nIn relation to the *amicus curiae* brief submitted by the EU Commission, InfraRed requests the Committee to \"give no weight to the Commission's highly partisan and disruptive intervention.\"640\n\nInfraRed Comments to EU Commission's Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b63.\n\n473.\n\nInfraRed alleges that \"the arguments raised by the Commission (which are based on the interpretation of EU law, *Achmea* and Articles 267 and 344 TFEU) go to the substance of the failed intra-EU objection and not to the question of whether, in establishing jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT, the InfraRed Tribunal *manifestly exceeded its powers.*\"641\n\nInfraRed Comments to EU Commission's Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b69.\n\n474.\n\nInfraRed also posits that \"[t]he Commission cannot appeal the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction seeking to simply substitute the Tribunal's sound and reasonable interpretation of international law and the ECT by adding or amending the ECT jurisdictional requirements based on inapposite EU law considerations.\"642\n\nInfraRed Comments to EU Commission's Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b612.\n\n475.\n\nAccording with InfraRed comments, the Commission \"has failed to address the core issue on annulment (*i.e.*, whether the Tribunal's establishment of jurisdiction was unreasonable) (*quod non*). Rather, the Commission has focused on presenting old and new substantive arguments in support of the failed notion that (i) Article 26 of the ECT requires the Tribunal to determine its jurisdiction on the basis of EU law (as opposed to international law)\".643\n\nInfraRed Comments to EU Commission's Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b615.\n\n476.\n\nFrom InfraRed's point of view, the issues raised by the *amicus curiae* submission \"have been finally and conclusively adjudicated by the Tribunal and [\u2026] are tangential (if not irrelevant) to the issue at stake before the Annulment Committee which, once again, is whether the establishment of jurisdiction was a manifest excess of power, in the sense that it was unreasonable.\"644\n\nInfraRed Comments to EU Commission's Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b615.\n\n477.\n\nInfraRed argues that it was not unreasonable (or a manifest excess of powers, for that matter) that the Tribunal \"right or wrong\" (and \"under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, an error in the application of the law is not considered a ground for annulment\"),645 came to the conclusions, shared by 21 Spanish ECT awards rendered before and after the InfraRed Award that have rejected the intra-EU objection,646 that \"the wording of Article 26(1) ECT confirmed that the Arbitral Tribunal had jurisdiction over all disputes (i) between a contracting party (*i.e.*, Spain) and investors of another contracting party (*i.e.*, a UK national), (ii) relating to an investment of the latter in the \"Area\" of the former (*i.e.*, InfraRed's investments in Spanish territory), and (iii) concerning an alleged breach of the obligations of the former (*i.e.*, Spain) under Part III ECT.\"647\n\nInfraRed Comments to EU Commission's Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b6\u00b620 and 211.\n\nInfraRed Comments to EU Commission's Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b616, note 22: RL-0157EN, *Nextera Energy Global Holdings BV and Nextera Energy Spain Holdings BV*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/11, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum Principles, March 12, 2019, \u00b6357; CL-263, *Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.\u00e0.r.l.and Antin Energia Termosolar B.V. v.

Therefore, the plain meaning of Article 26 ECT does not support the exclusion of intra-EU claims; (ii) that the principle of primacy of EU law is not applicable in these cases; and (iii) that EU law, and in particular Article 344 TFEU or the Achmea decision cannot bind non-European states that enter into international treaties with EU member states.\"648\n\nInfraRed's Comments to EU Commission's Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b616\n\n479.\n\nTherefore, InfraRed concludes that there is no issue of jurisdiction that would limit or impede the Tribunal of hearing a ECT case between a Member State of the UE and a company from another EU State, and therefore in accordance with Article 52(1)(b) of ICSID Convention there is no evidence of excess of powers (let alone manifest) on the decision of this jurisdictional objection.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n480.\n\nThe topic to be analyzed now by the Committee is one of the most discussed in investment arbitration, as demonstrated by the numerous awards and committees' decisions that addressed arguments presented mostly in arbitration cases under ECT, related with the alleged primacy of EU law and lack of jurisdiction of any arbitral tribunal to adjudicate a conflict between an EU Member State and an investor from another EU Member State.\n\n481.\n\nThe Committee is inclined to think that any argument or reasoning that might be called upon in favor of each of the positions in confrontation has been developed and is accessible. In this case, they were presented by the Parties in a way that is clear and exhaustive.\n\n482.\n\nFor this simple reason, it would be probably impossible for the Committee to innovate in its decision, were it its intention, which it is not. The Committee is addressing an Application for Annulment of the Award for alleged breaches of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, now for excess of powers in a matter of jurisdiction and afterwards in relation to other points of that article.\n\n483.\n\nThe issue at stake in this section of the Decision is whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it held that it had jurisdiction to hear this ECT case.\n\n484.\n\nThe Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers.\n\n485.\n\nThe mere fact that in many \u2013 actually all \u2013 similar ICSID arbitration cases the tribunals decided in favor of their own jurisdiction (and that all the *ad hoc* committees decided against that ground of annulment) is obviously an important fact. This does not mean that this Committee is not free to decide otherwise, if this was the conclusion reached, if not for other reasons, then because there is no rule of precedent applicable in this situation.\n\n486.\n\nIt is true that the Award refers as one of the elements that assisted the Tribunal to reach its conclusion the \"*constant jurisprudence* on this issue,\"649 an expression that in spite of the reference in the Award that the jurisprudence is not \"binding\" on the Tribunal, might wrongly suggest a system of mandatory precedents.\n\nAward, \u00b6 274. See also \u00b6 260: \"The Tribunal cannot, however, overstate the importance of the long record of recent arbitral awards or partial awards which disposed of the intra-EU jurisdictional objections and maintained the jurisdiction of the respective ECT tribunals. In the Tribunal's view, these form an arbitral *jurisprudence constante* which, short of binding this Tribunal, provides nonetheless a persuasive, reasoned and documented analytical framework that the Tribunal endorses and adopts without the need to spell it out in detail below\".\n\n487.\n\nProbably with this in mind, Spain tried to downgrade the relevance of this fact calling it a \"parrot effect\", as the tribunals \"just reproduce what others say without really digging into the substance, a fact that perpetuates the errors of those decisions.\"650\n\nMemorial, \u00b690.\n\n488.\n\nThe Committee does not see the need of deciding whether the \"constant jurisprudence\" is nothing more than an inadmissible \"parrot effect\" or whether each of the tribunals and committees reached similar conclusions after a rigorous analysis of the facts and the law, in spite of being convinced that sophisticated and qualified adjudicators act with professional responsibility and not reproducing without analysis or criticism what they have read elsewhere.\n\n489.\n\nThe Committee considers that in this Section, it is basically necessary to deal with one question: whether the Tribunal's decision to uphold its jurisdiction may be construed as a manifest, obvious, self-evident situation of excess of powers for the purposes of Article 52(1)(b) of ICSID Convention.\n\n490.\n\nThe conclusion is in the negative. It is possible to argue \u2013 as Spain does and the EU Commission supports in its *amicus curiae* brief \u2013 that all the decisions contrary to Spain's opinion are wrong as a matter of law. But even in that hypothetical case, the threshold has not been met.\n\n491.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the *ad hoc* committee in *Amco I v. Indonesia* holding that: \"[f]ailure to apply such law, as distinguished from mere misconstruction of that law would constitute a manifest excess of power on the part of the Tribunal and a ground for nullity under Article 51(1)(b) of the Convention.\"651\n\nRL-0164, *Amco Asia Corporation, et al. v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on the Application for Annulment, May 16, 1986, 1 ICSID REPORTS 509 (1993), \u00b6 23.\n\n492.\n\nIt is debatable whether the Award was correct as a matter of interpretation of the applicable law. In a different section of this Decision, the Committee will return to this issue. But in this moment and with regard to the jurisdictional issue, it is clear that there was no failure to apply the law, and only if this was an appeal, would it eventually be possible to assess whether it was correctly or wrongly applied.\n\n493.\n\nIt is understandable that the EU Commission, as \"guardian\" of the European Union Treaties,652 fights with the instruments at its disposal \u2013 such as *amicus curiae* briefs \u2013 to convince tribunals and committees that its interpretation of EU law and other EU decisions favors its idea of the relevant duties it is vested with. The Committee respects and appreciates its \"guardian\" effort, which is helpful for the Decision.\n\nEU Commission Amicus Curiae Brief, \u00b62.\n\n494.\n\nHowever, even admitting that its interpretation is correct beyond any doubt and that all of the other possible interpretations are wrong \u2013 which under the circumstances seems excessive to the Committee \u2013 a political and administrative body such as the Commission, even with powers to act at the legislative level, cannot impose to tribunals or courts its own way of interpreting the applicable law and regulations regarding their jurisdiction.\n\n495.\n\nThe Tribunal, under its mandate, analyzed and decided on matters of international law and considered adequately the arguments presented now by the EU Commission, as they are actually similar to those presented by Spain in the Arbitration. Its conclusions are debatable and an appeals court could eventually overturn the decision.\n\n496.\n\nHowever, the Committee does not find that the Award fails the test of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention as there is no manifest excess of powers when the Tribunal refused to decline its jurisdiction and the solution was not in itself unreasonable.\n\n497.\n\nThese are the main reasons why the Committee considers that it is not relevant to address in detail the arguments presented by Spain and by the Commission, such as the issues of interpretation of the alleged rule of the primacy of EU law or of Article 16 ECT and specifically in relation to the term \"Area,\"653 the relevance or not of a disconnection clause654 and the issue of which law (ECT or EU law) is the most favorable investment protection system.655\n\nSpain PHB, \u00b67 and \u00b6\u00b6102 and following.\n\nSpain PHB, \u00b6185.\n\nSpain PHB, \u00b69.\n\n498.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to the alleged competence of the ECT ratification by the EU and its member-states656 or the Declaration 17 of the Lisbon Treaty,657 or \"the holdings of the *Achmea* Decision\"658 or other subsequent similar decisions, the interpretation of the Article 10 (i), (ii) and (iii) of the ECT659 or of Article 27 of the VCLT660 and the applicability of Article 107 and 108 of the TFEU to the legitimate expectations issue.661\n\nSpain PBH, \u00b6\u00b634 and 37.\n\nSpain PHB, \u00b654.\n\nSpain PHB, \u00b662.\n\nSpain PHB, \u00b693\n\nSpain PHB, \u00b6188 and following.\n\nSpain PHB, \u00b6199 and following.\n\n499.\n\nIf, *quod non*, the issue of the primacy of the EU, as alleged by Spain and supported by the Commission, were to be analyzed as the Tribunal did in the Award, even then the Committee would not follow Spain's argument, as its decision related thereto was not made in a \"manifest excess of powers.\"\n\n500.\n\nThe Committee considers \u2013 following the *Eskosol v. Italy* tribunal \u2013 that \"the EU Treaties are not general international law displacing all other sub-systems of international law; rather, they exist side-by-side with other sub-systems, including those created by various multilateral treaties. The ECT is one such other sub-system of law, and it vests authority in arbitral tribunals such as this one.\"662\n\nCL-0389, *Eskosol S.P.A. In Liquidazione v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Decision on Italy's Jurisdictional objection based on inapplicability of the ECT to Intra-EU disputes, May 7, 2019, \u00b6 181.\n\n501.\n\nAs far as the issue of the \"Area\" is concerned, if the Committee reached the conclusion that it could address it on grounds of possible excess of powers by the Tribunal, which is not the case, even then the conclusion would be the same as the Committee would side with the Tribunal on its interpretation of the applicable rules of the ECT663 as its finding seem adequate to the Committee, if not for other reasons because the conclusions in spite of being debatable are not unreasonable, obvious and self-evident.\n\nAward, \u00b6263.\n\n502.\n\nA similar situation relates to the alleged lack of a disconnection clause in the ECT and the meaning of the \"*travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*\" of this Treaty. Even if \u2013 *quod non* \u2013 it could be considered that the Tribunal's decision contained in paragraph 271 of the Award could be subject to the scrutiny of the Committee as a possible violation of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention based on excess of powers, the Committee would side with the Tribunal on the relevance of a lack of a disconnection clause in the ECT, based on the known factual circumstances, and would reach a decision on annulment request that would be the same as the one resulting from the lack of manifest excess of powers to annul the award, even if it was a wrong decision.\n\n503.\n\nNotably, each and every one of the arguments presented by Spain and the Commission failed to convince the Committee that the Tribunal exceeded its powers, let alone manifestly.\n\n504.\n\nThe Committee \u2013 in spite of being aware that there is no applicable system of precedents \u2013 also considers as a relevant fact the unanimous pattern of tribunals and committees favoring the dismissal of the intra-EU jurisdictional objection in similar cases. As a matter of fact, it defies common sense to admit that all those adjudicators were not able to discern the arguments against jurisdiction, and even more, manifestly exceeded their powers when deciding in an unreasonable way.\n\n505.\n\nIn any event, as already mentioned, the Committee considers that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to adjudicate and therefore Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention has not been breached.\n\n506.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request as presented by the Applicant.\n\n4. Manifest excess of powers by disregarding the applicable international law, including the ECT itself, and by disregarding the application of the entire EU law\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submission*\n-----------------------\n\n507.\n\nSpain considers that even if the Committee concludes \u2013 as it occurs \u2013 that there is no lack of jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the Award cannot be annulled for excess of powers under those grounds, still the primacy of EU law and its applicability surface as grounds for annulment because the Tribunal also exceeded its powers by disregarding the application of EU law.664\n\nMemorial, \u00b6115.\n\n508.\n\nSpain considers that Article 38 of the ICJ Statute is applicable and, like EU law, it must be applied in accordance with Article 26(6) of the ECT, in which case EU state aid rules, including the TFEU provision related to state aid,665 would be mandatory. This was not considered by the Tribunal, in Spain's opinion.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6118.\n\n509.\n\nIn addition, Spain posits that EU regulations on state aid were part of customary law applicable to EU Members, and the Tribunal also did not apply this source of international law. In contrast, Spain argues that the Tribunal considered that EU state aid law was not \"relevant to the analysis of whether [the] Spain violated a specific commitment made to the CSP sector\"666 and because of that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6122 quoting Award, \u00b6443.\n\n510.\n\nSpain also considers that the autonomy and primacy of EU law must be respected internationally667, and it is actually respected by the international community regarding the interrelationship between international treaties and EU law,668 as it is accepted that the EU and the Member States have disconnected from international conventions in favor of EU law for intra-EU matters.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 169-173.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 175-192; Spain's PHB, \u00b6\u00b670-74.\n\n511.\n\nSpain argues that this practice must also be respected by arbitration tribunals, which cannot act outside and openly in contrary to the first source of international law, the Article 38 of the ICJ Statute, or ignore EU law. Despite this, the Award described EU law as \"highly irrelevant\", thereby underlining the fact that the award itself must necessarily be annulled because it disregards the application of the applicable law.669\n\nReply, \u00b6194-197.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n512.\n\nInfraRed's arguments against the jurisdictional objections are also part of its line of argumentation in relation to the lack of disconnection of the ECT by EU State Members and the EU itself.\n\n513.\n\nMore specifically regarding the applicability of EU state aid law, which InfraRed considers a new argument670 put forward in the annulment proceedings by the Gosalbo Report, it contends that the Committee should disregard it. It is clear that Spain disagreed with the Tribunal but that does not make the Award annullable.671\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6106.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n514.\n\nAccording to InfraRed, the Tribunal considered and therefore respected EU law, only decided that it was \"highly irrelevant\"672 to the analysis of InfraRed's legitimate expectations,673 and its decision did not infringe the autonomy of the EU law and its legal order.674 In any case, InfraRed alleges that this ground should be \"manifest\" to annul the Award.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b69.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6107.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6108.\n\n515.\n\nInfraRed considers that Spain was unable to show why the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law. InfraRed highlights that the Tribunal noted that \"the provisions EU law are not dispositive nor even relevant to resolve the issues raised by this dispute,\"675 and that this was perfectly consistent with the fact that the application of the ECT was sufficient to adjudicate the dispute.676\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6101 quoting Award \u00b6258.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6101.\n\n516.\n\nInfraRed adds that the case law cited by Spain did not favor its position.677 The references to Article 38 of the ICJ Statute were inapposite, as was the reference to Article 103 of the United Nations Charter, state practice and the principle of autonomy of EU law over domestic law. InfraRed further contends that in the context of investment claims under the ECT, those rules and Articles 107 and 108 of the TFEU are irrelevant.678\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6105-109.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6111.\n\n517.\n\nIn addition, InfraRed considers that Spain's position was unclear in that EU law fell within the wording of \"principles of international law\" or under the reference to \"applicable rules\" of Article 26 ECT. In paragraph 207 of its Reply, Spain concludes that the \"[a]utonomy and primacy of EU law are applicable international custom\"679 but in paragraph 214 of the Reply it criticizes the disregard of EU state aid law.680 Therefore, it is unclear what international custom it relied on. That the principle of autonomy and primacy of EU law could qualify as \"international custom\" is highly doubtful. But the allegation that EU state aid law is an international custom is utterly wrong.681\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6112 quoting Reply, \u00b6207.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6112 quoting Reply, \u00b6204.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6112.\n\n518.\n\nInfraRed concludes that the applicable law in this case is the ECT and not EU law, and the Tribunal's finding that Spain breached Article 10 of the ECT could not be annulled for failing to apply the proper law.682 If anything, InfraRed adds, EU law should be treated as a fact.683\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6117.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6120.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n519.\n\nThe Committee refers to its decision above when interpretating Article 52(1)(b) of ICSID Convention in relation to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which is directly applicable to the issue under analysis. Reference is also made to the unanimous position of legal authorities, as agreed by the Parties, that *ad hoc* committees are not appeal bodies.\n\n520.\n\nBasically, Spain posits that the Tribunal should have decided that the EU state aid regulations are relevant to the outcome of the case, and being so, the Tribunal should have dismissed the case. This is so because she considers that InfraRed's request directed at the Tribunal is illegal, as allegedly the request for the approval by the EU of the state aid had not been presented by Spain to the Commission and, therefore, the subsidy system was not approved in accordance with EU law and regulations. As a consequence, the state aid was and is illegal, and no legitimate expectations of InfraRed could have been formed based on an illegality.\n\n521.\n\nWhat is, therefore, at stake is actually a disagreement with the Award on the merits. The Committee understands that in certain situations it would be entitled to address a decision on the merits, but only when it is manifest, obvious and self-evident that the decision failed to apply the law, when applicable. Instead, as is the case, the Tribunal considered that the issue at stake was not affected by a specific law, which means that the law would be considered to be applied if it was relevant, but the Tribunal concluded that it was not.\n\n522.\n\nIt is true that the EU state aid rules are part of Spain body of law, and this is not a matter of discussion between the Parties. This is a situation which occurs with many other rules of law not taken into account by the Tribunal, as they were not relevant for its decision.\n\n523.\n\nThis was the reasoning of the Tribunal, as it considered that the legitimate expectations of InfraRed are protected and must be compensated, irrespectively of the state aid regimen. For the Tribunal, the \"Purported Agreement\" and other relevant facts were not to be assessed or analyzed under any EU law perspective and they must be treated as relevant facts for the purposes of the assessment of legitimate expectations:\n\n\"The Tribunal is not inclined to analyse the Purported Agreement as a source of binding contractual obligations under Spanish law, but rather as a legally cognizable fact, and in particular, as evidence of a representation by Respondent to maintain some of the elements of the Original Regulatory Regime for some CSP plants that satisfied certain administrative requirements.\"684\n\nAward, \u00b6427.\n\n524.\n\nIt is clear that the Award considered relevant that a \"legally cognizable fact\" was evidenced and should be accepted under the Tribunal's discretion and reached the conclusion that \"the text of Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 and of Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 must be read in the legislative and regulatory context of the time. Thus contextualized, these provisions suggest that Respondent intended to shield CSP plants registered on the Pre-allocation Register from future revisions of the tariffs, premiums and lower and upper limits that were in effect when Claimants invested.\"685\n\nAward, \u00b6418.\n\n525.\n\nAs a consequence, the legitimate expectations were not born from the state aid regimen but rather from representations and compromises unilaterally made by Spain towards investors, notably the Respondents.\n\n526.\n\nThe Committee, after its deep analysis of the Award, agrees that \"[a] plain reading of the Award shows that after analyzing all the evidence in the record, the Tribunal concluded, among others, that several evidence including the (i) the Purported Agreement, (ii) the waiver letters, and (iii) the enactment of RD 1614/2010 gave rise to a legitimate expectation that Spain would not adopt any changes to the Original Regulatory Regime.\"686\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6247.\n\n527.\n\nIt is certainly debatable whether the state aid law and regulations are irrelevant or not for the outcome of the case, and even whether legitimate expectations may derive from a State's set of compromises that might be considered illegal for not being pre-dated by an EU decision on state aid.687\n\nEven this assumption is debatable, as the alleged non-authorized state aid was a responsibility of Spain (that opted for not notifying it) and until now the subsidies have not been considered illegal (see Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6125-127).\n\n528.\n\nSome may consider that the \"legally cognizable facts\" were born from a state aid regimen that was illegal because it had not previously analyzed and authorized by the Commission, which might provoke illegitimacy.\n\n529.\n\nIt is even possible to conclude that Spain should not renounce, through the \"legally cognizable facts\", to its sovereign right to review its regulatory regime to respond to serious economic factors, such as the financial crisis and tariff deficit issue, or any others.\n\n530.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal concluded that Spain's behavior \u2013 being construed as a renunciation or not \u2013 was clear in the sense of providing as incentive for investments on alternative energy production a compromise of maintaining a stability framework, and that from a legal standpoint a violation of legitimate expectations occurred and therefore compensation is due.\n\n531.\n\nIn view of all these facts and arguments, only an appeal body could go deeper into the merits, but not a committee understanding that the \"annulment deals only with the legitimacy of the decision-making process, not its merits.\"688\n\nCL-328, Schreuer, Article 52, \u00b6 74.\n\n532.\n\nThe Committee considers that it is not debatable that in any case subject to any dispute resolution system, under any substantive applicable law, the tribunals or courts cannot and will not take into account all the laws and regulations in force in a given jurisdiction, when they are not relevant for the decision.\n\n533.\n\nTechnically, and from a legal standpoint, the Tribunal's reasoning confirms that it considers that a compensation is due under the violation of a Spain's representation and commitment. And the fact that theoretically Spain could not be allowed to grant stability by the \"Purported Agreement\" and other \"legal cognizable facts\" \u2013 in spite of EU never apparently trying, let alone obtaining, to reach a decision and implement it against Spain on those basis \u2013 has not been considered relevant and therefore the EU state aid rules were just legally considered irrelevant in the situation at stake.\n\n534.\n\nAdditionally, the mere fact that the issue is controversial and the Tribunal's findings related thereto were neither innovative nor unsupported would be enough for this Committee to disregard an allegation of \"manifest excess of powers\", as no manifest, obvious, self-evident situation of excess of powers existed.\n\n535.\n\nAs a consequence, those same findings may not originate the annulment of an award for excess of powers.\n\n536.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request as presented by the Applicant.\n\n5. Manifest excess of powers by misapplying the applicable law to be taken into account in assessing legitimate expectations.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submissions*\n------------------------\n\n537.\n\nIf the Committee decides \u2013 as it is the case \u2013 that the above requests for annulment are dismissed, Spain subsidiarily alleges that in case it is considered that EU law has been applied by the Tribunal, \"this would have resulted in a grotesque and incorrect application of EU law that should lead to the annulment of the Award.\"689\n\nMemorial, \u00b6133.\n\n538.\n\nSpain posits that the \"aid schemes for renewables should have been notified to the European Commission and they were not,\"690 and this implies that \"under EU law, there was no legitimate expectation that this subsidy would remain petrified.\"691 Therefore, by disregarding state aid regulations the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6134.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6135.\n\n539.\n\nSpain argues that the Award should have considered that, under EU law, without authorization, state aid is illegal, and this position was extensively debated in the Arbitration.\n\n540.\n\nAs a consequence, Spain alleges that the Award shall be annulled because the Tribunal \"manifestly misapply[ied] EU Law and [\u2026] had manifestly exceeded its powers for the purposes of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\"692\n\nReply, \u00b6238.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n541.\n\nInfraRed considers that Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention is not warranted in cases of an alleged misapplication of the proper law, not even a \"gross misapplication,\"693 -all the Committee must do is to assess whether the Tribunal correctly identified the applicable law and applied it, which it did.694\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6121.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6112.\n\n542.\n\nInfraRed therefore disagrees with Spain's subsidiary argument that \"there has been a gross misapplication of EU law\", and that \"the assessment of legitimate expectations should include a verification of whether the promised subsidy is lawful under the law applicable to the dispute and in accordance with national law.\"695\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6121, Reply, \u00b6215, Section V.A.4.\n\n543.\n\nInfraRed posits that neither Article 107 nor Article 108 TFEU established any obligation on private companies because they are directed to Member States.\n\n544.\n\nAlso, the fact that Spain had failed to give notice to the EC about the remuneration scheme is not attributable to InfraRed.696 But more importantly, the regime under which InfraRed invested has never been declared illegal.697\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6125, 126\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6127.\n\n545.\n\nFor all these reasons, InfraRed concludes that Spain failed to prove that the Tribunal acted manifestly outside the scope of its mandate in its jurisdictional analysis and in its determination of the applicable law. Therefore, there is no basis to annul the Award under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.698\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6130.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n546.\n\nThe Committee, once more, considers that the arguments put forward by Spain in relation to EU state aid law and regulations are misguided when presented to a committee constituted under the ICSID Convention and empowered to decide under Article 52 of said Convention, as they were eventually adequate for the analysis and decision of an appellate body, which it is not the case.\n\n547.\n\nIn a nutshell, Spain considers that the fact that the subsidies had not been notified by Spain, let alone authorized by the EU, is enough to conclude that the promised remuneration is illegal and therefore no legitimate expectations could materialize from an illegality.\n\n548.\n\nThis argument may be sound or not. The Tribunal might have erred in the way it applied the law in the Award. But the Committee considers that errors of tribunals \u2013 even if they were manifest and obvious, which does not seem to be the case as too many tribunals and committees were not convinced in similar situations \u2013 are outside the scope of the annulment system of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n549.\n\nAs stated above, the decision of the Tribunal in relation to the relevance of legitimate expectations, is based on the position that there is no \"manifest excess of powers\" when \u2013 even if, *quod non*, as a matter of law it might be wrong \u2013 the excess is not unreasonable, obvious and self-evident. The Committee considers that this is not the case, as the relevance of legitimate expectations may not be dependent on whether there is a situation of legality, as far as the EU state aid rules had been or not respected by Spain.\n\n550.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee considers that it is not relevant to address in detail the arguments presented by Spain and the Commission, such as the issues of interpretation of the EU state aid regime and legal issues of whether \"[the] right to fair and equitable treatment, [the] 'legitimate expectations', and [the] right not to be expropriated under Articles 10(1) and 13(1) of the ECT\"699 were or not violated by Spain.\n\nSpain PHB, \u00b6138.\n\n551.\n\nIn any event, the Committee reaffirms its conclusion that the interpretation of the EU state aid regime is not a matter of divergence between the Parties and the Tribunal. The divergence lies \u2013 as analyzed above \u2013 on whether or not legitimate expectations may be generated by Spain's representations and commitments, and also whether its violation creates a duty to compensate if allegedly Spain breached its duties to request and be authorized by the Commission to implement RD 661/2007, RD 1614/2010 and other rules related to tariff remuneration and its stability.\n\n552.\n\nHowever, and given the reasons set forth above, the Committee considers that, under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, it is not empowered to annul the Award based on the interpretation that the Tribunal made of the legal framework. The same applies to evidence of the existence and the conditions for the validity of legitimate expectations and the duty of compensation if a breach is also evidenced, under international law and ECT.\n\n553.\n\nA similar reasoning applies to the alleged rights to FET and to not be expropriated.\n\n554.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request as presented by the Applicant.\n\n6. Manifest excess of powers by awarding damages contrary to its findings on quantum\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submissions*\n------------------------\n\n555.\n\nSpain argues that there was a clear contradiction in terms of liability and damages, and that the Tribunal adopted DCF calculation proposed by Brattle, rejecting the Accuracy alternative solution, without justification.700\n\nMemorial, \u00b6247.\n\n556.\n\nSpain further states that the Award \"completely dispenses with the application of regulatory risk principles and the illiquidity discount,\"701 and quoted the dissenting opinion of Professor Pierre-Dupuy in footnote 782 of the Award.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6248.\n\n557.\n\nIn its Reply, Spain states that these alleged facts might also constitute a manifest excess of powers that justifies the annulment of the award, under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, which has been reiterated in the Reply's petitum.702\n\nReply, \u00b6430.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n558.\n\nInfraRed does not analyze directly this annulment request based on manifest excess of powers related to the award of damages, allegedly related to the findings on quantum. However, from the analysis undertaken regarding the request based on the alleged failure of the Tribunal to state reasons, it is possible to conclude that InfraRed disagrees with Spain position.\n\n559.\n\nSpecifically in relation to Professor Dupuy's position, it considers that it is irrelevant, but \"in any case, even if the Tribunal's reasons were wrong (quod non), and the opinion given my Pierre Marie Dupuy was right (quod non), the latter could not lead to the annulment of the Award.\"703\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6265.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n560.\n\nSpain does not elaborate on the annulment request related to quantum and damages, as being a situation of manifest excess of powers. The Committee understands that restraint, as it does not seem to be possible to consider the alleged fact that the conclusion on damages was not in accordance with the findings in the matter of quantum to be a \"manifest excess of powers\", adequate to ground the annulment of the Award - let alone the circumstance that Prof. Dupuy disagreed (as expressed in footnote 782 of the Award) with the other members of the Tribunal conclusions in relation to damages. This could only be considered a possible situation of failure to state reasons, which has been invoked and will be dealt in the next chapter of this Decision.\n\n561.\n\nIn any case, the Committee does not find any evidence of manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal related to this request. As a matter of fact, what the Tribunal did in relation to assessing the damages and deciding on quantum was to take into account mostly the expert reports and their comments and answers in the hearings and to reach its conclusions following the standard practice of any tribunal or court of law.\n\n562.\n\nWhat apparently causes Spain's reaction and request is, therefore, not an excess of powers, let alone \"manifest\", but rather a disagreement in relation to the Tribunal's findings and the alleged failure to state reasons for its decision, issues that are not related to manifest excess of powers, which in any event has not been evidenced.\n\n563.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request as presented by the Applicant.\n\n**C. FAILURE TO STATE REASONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n1. Interpretation of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submissions*\n------------------------\n\n564.\n\nSpain proposes that in accordance with Articles 48(3) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, *ad hoc* committees have \"uniformly established\" that it is necessary that the reasons stated by a tribunal allow the reader \"to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B*.*\"704\n\nMemorial, \u00b6141 quoting *MINE*, \u00b6 5.09.\n\n565.\n\nBy quoting *Sempra v. Argentina* committee, Spain argues that \"the task of the *ad hoc* committees under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention is to determine whether there is a comprehensive and consistent reasoning on the part of the tribunal.\"705 Equally relevant is the need to ensure that the parties are able to understand a ruling, as the *Tidewater v. Venezuela* committee recognized.706 In this sense, the *Soufraki v. UAE* committee clarified that \"insufficient and inadequate reasons lead to the annulment of a judgement.\"707\n\nMemorial, \u00b6142.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6143, quoting *Tidewater Investment SRL and Tidewater Caribe, C.A. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Decision on Annulment, December 27, 2016, \u00b6\u00b6164-165.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6144.\n\n566.\n\nSpain also posits that Articles 48(3) and 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention impose an obligation on any tribunal to deal with \"the issues, arguments and evidence presented\" and therefore, \"failure to deal with certain relevant evidence or facts\" amounts to a failure to state reasons as a ground for annulment.708\n\nMemorial, \u00b6149.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n567.\n\nInfraRed agrees with Spain that any award has to include conclusions that are sufficient to allow the committee \"to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B*.*\" However, InfraRed considers that Spain fails to note that said reasons \"do not need to be explicitly stated as long as the reader can understand the decision reached by the tribunal.\"709\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6137 quoting CL-337.\n\n568.\n\nInfraRed also contends that the failure to state reasons, in accordance with Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, is \"inherently related\" to the requirement contained in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention that an award \"shall state\" the reasons upon which it is based710 and needs to be addressed by a committee with a high standard, and Spain has failed to discharge that burden.711\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6127.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6127; Rejoinder, \u00b613.\n\n569.\n\nInfraRed posits that Spain should have demonstrated that the Award's reasoning is \"contradictory, frivolous, incomprehensible or completely absent\" and that such defect is \"manifest\" on the face of the Award. The manifest factor requires that the award contain no reasons at all in relation to a particular finding.712\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6135.\n\n570.\n\nThe Award did not fail to state reasons since the Tribunal stated its reasoning with regard to: (i) the discussion over the installed capacity, (ii) the applicable law, (iii) the interpretation of Article 10(1) ECT, (iv) the interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment under Article 10(1) ECT, and (v) the findings on damages.713\n\nRejoinder, \u00b612.\n\n571.\n\nInfraRed highlights that the Award was issued \"unanimously\" by the three arbitrators, except for a single footnote (footnote 782 by Prof. Dupuy) about damages.

However, during one of the Legal Committee's meetings, it was decided to remove the parties' discretion in this regard and, as a consequence, the discretion was also removed from the ground for annulment.\"716\n\nR-0118, Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID May 5, 2016, \u00b624.\n\n575.\n\nThe Updated Background Paper provides that \"[t]he drafting history of the Convention concerning annulment based on a failure to state reasons does not provide further guidance as to when such a failure has occurred, nor does the Convention specify the manner in which a Tribunal's reasons should be stated.\"717\n\nR-0118, \u00b6102.\n\n576.\n\nIt is also relevant to take into account718 that \"*ad hoc* [c]ommittees have explained that the requirement to state reasons is intended to ensure that parties can understand the reasoning of the Tribunal, meaning the reader can understand the facts and law applied by the Tribunal in coming to its conclusion.\"719 It is also stated that the \"correctness of the reasoning or whether it is convincing is not relevant.\"720\n\nR-0118, \u00b6105.\n\n\"*MINE*, \u00b65.09 (\"the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law\"); *Vivendi I*, \u00b664; *Wena*, \u00b681; *Transgabonais*, \u00b688; *El Paso*, \u00b6220; *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7*, \u00b664; *Iberdrola*, \u00b6124; *Lemire*, \u00b6277; *Libananco*, \u00b6192; *Occidental*, \u00b666; *Tulip*, \u00b6\u00b698, 104; *Total*, \u00b6267; *Dogan*, \u00b6\u00b6261-263; *Micula*, \u00b6\u00b6136, 198; *Lahoud*, \u00b6131; *TECO*, \u00b6\u00b687, 124.\n\n\"*Kl\u00f6ckner I*, \u00b6129; *MINE*, \u00b6\u00b65.08 & 5.09; *Vivendi I*, \u00b664; *Wena*, \u00b679; *CDC*, \u00b6\u00b670 & 75; *MCI*, \u00b682; *Fraport*, \u00b6277; *Vieira*, \u00b6355; *Caratube,* \u00b6185; *Impregilo*, \u00b6180; *SGS*, \u00b6121; *Iberdrola*, \u00b6\u00b676-77; *Lemire*, \u00b6278; *Occidental*, \u00b666; *Tulip*, \u00b6\u00b699, 104; *EDF*, \u00b6328; *Total*, \u00b6271; *Micula*, \u00b6135; *TECO*, \u00b6124.

One of the cornerstones of any adjudicator's decision, which may be even more relevant in investment protection arbitration because consent to arbitrate by States is a politically scrutinized issue, lies in the objective possibility of the parties understanding clearly the decisions, even if they are not happy with the outcome or finally prepared to admit that they were wrong in their arguments.\n\n579.\n\nBut the Committee also notes that this ground for annulment cannot be abused or employed in such a way as to allow the Committee to re-examine the case, as if were an appellate body. The line that separates \"failure to state reasons\" and disagreement with the reasons presented by the tribunal (as the losing party would prefer a different reasoning aimed to reach a more favorable decision) is thin, but that line exists, and an *ad hoc* committee may never decide as if these were a continuum without real separation.\n\n580.\n\nIt is also true that the committees have a degree of discretion as far as to the tracing of that line is concerned.\n\n581.\n\nAs a general conclusion, the Committee will scrutinize carefully each one of the specific alleged grounds and \u2013 as the Parties propose726 \u2013 will always take into account as a first approach to be developed, when necessary, that \"the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law.\"727\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6159 and 327.\n\n*MINE*, \u00b65.09.\n\n582.\n\nFinally, as a general remark, the Committee does not agree with InfraRed when it argues s that Spain \"apparently dropped three of the reasons it argued for annulment under Article 52(1)(e)\"728 in Spain's Reply, namely that the Tribunal would have allegedly failed to express adequate and sufficient reasons concerning (i) its decisions on the date of investment, (ii) the decision not to apply EU law when deciding its jurisdiction, and (iii) its conclusion to adopt the DCF methodology.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6206.\n\n583.\n\nFirst, the mere fact that Spain did not reaffirm its position in its Reply as expressed in the Memorial, could not by itself and without additional facts that neither exist nor have been presented, allow this conclusion.\n\n584.\n\nSecond, in relation to the Tribunal's decision on the date of investment, Spain reaffirms its argument at the Hearing,729 with a change to the relief sought related thereto in the Reply and maintained in its PHB to a request of partial annulment, instead of full annulment.730 The Committee will address this issue below.\n\nSpain's Opening Statement PPT, slides 5 and 91.\n\nReply, \u00b6430, o); Spain's PHB, \u00b6209, o).\n\n585.\n\nThird, the Tribunal's decision not to apply EU law when deciding on its own jurisdiction has been reaffirmed at the Hearing731 and in the PHB,732 and the Committee analyzed and decided it above.733\n\nSpain Opening Statement PPT, slides 5 and 82.\n\nSpain's PHB, \u00b6\u00b611-92, 209, h).\n\nSee section VII.\n\n586.\n\nFinally, regarding the Tribunal's decision to adopt the DCF methodology, it is true that apparently Spain opted for not developing the arguments presented in the Memorial. However, if not for other reasons, to avoid the risk of not analyzing and deciding on all the issues, the Committee will address it below.\n\n2. Failure to state reasons for determining that the installed capacity was less than 50MW, thereby accepting the Claimants' misleading and fraudulent statement without justification, and provision of \"manifestly insufficient, inadequate and blatantly contradictory reasons\" for supporting installed capacity of less than 50MW\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submissions*\n------------------------\n\n587.\n\nAs previously explained, Spain posits that the installed capacity was a key issue because if the installed capacity of the Olivenza 1 and Mor\u00f3n Plants were above the 50 MW threshold, they did not \"comply with the condition of access to the RRE\"734 and therefore, the installation would have unduly benefited from the special aid scheme.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6173.\n\n588.\n\nAs such, Spain posits that the Award shall be annulled because the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its decision regarding this issue.\n\n589.\n\nFirst, because the Tribunal limited itself to making reference to the *Eiser* award as the grounds for its decision735 and such award was annulled in its entirety. Therefore, being that award inexistent, there are no reasons stated in the Award.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6181.\n\n590.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal \"stated that plants are remunerated on the basis of net production\"736 and for that conclusion assumed that the literal wording of Article 20 of RD 661/2007 supported this idea. However, as \"nowhere in this provision it is stated that plants are remunerated on the basis of net production\",737 it is not clear how the Tribunal reached the conclusion that \"plants should be remunerated according to net production\"738 or why the \"net power\" variable was the most important.739\n\nMemorial, \u00b6187.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6188.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6189.\n\n591.\n\nThird, Spain argues that paragraphs 335 and 329 of the Award were in clear contradiction. In Spain's view there was a flagrant absence of reasons with which to resolve the question of the overweighting of the plants subject to this arbitration, as they in no way showed the reasons why it could be concluded that when the legislator refers to \"installed power\" in the terms in which it does in Articles 27 and 30(4) of the LSE it is referring to net power and not to gross power.740 In addition, by stating that the experts were in agreement with regard to the concepts when they were not, the Tribunal contradicted itself without providing reasons for such assertion.\n\nReply, \u00b6374.\n\n592.\n\nThe Tribunal also allegedly left unresolved the issue of the veracity of the nominal power on the nameplates, and whether such nominal power corresponds to the concept of installed power expressed by the legislator.741\n\nMemorial, \u00b6199.\n\n593.\n\nIn the alternative, Spain argues that the Tribunal's conclusion that the capacity was less than 50MW lacked adequate grounds because Article 20 of RD 661/2007 does not indicate that net power is the most important variable.742\n\nMemorial, \u00b6200.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n594.\n\nInfraRed submits that the Tribunal duly assessed Spain's allegations on the installed capacity of the CSP Plants,743 all the evidence from the Parties' expert reports,744 and the report issued by *Red El\u00e9ctrica de Espa\u00f1a* (the Spanish electricity grid operator) that confirmed that the net output of the Plants was 50 MW or less.745\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6164.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6166.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6167.\n\n595.\n\nInfraRed also develops arguments aimed to highlight the Tribunal's reasoning in relation to the issue at stake and argues that Spain failed to prove that the reasoning of the Tribunal for determining that the installed capacity was equal to or less than 50MW was \"contradictory, frivolous, or incomprehensible\", as required by Convention Article 52(1)(e).\n\n596.\n\nInfraRed mentions that there was no contradiction between paragraph 329 (Spain's expert testimony) and paragraph 335 (the Tribunal's analysis of the evidence taken at the hearing, including the conference between both experts).746\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6175\n\n597.\n\nInfraRed posits that in paragraph 335 of the Award, the Tribunal explained that \"both experts agreed that the 'gross installed capacity' is measured 'at the terminals of the generator inside the plant' and that the 'net installed capacity' is 'generally lower than the gross installed capacity as a result of power used by the equipment inside the plant, which draws its electricity directly from the turbine.'\"747 InfraRed highlights that the Tribunal made reference to the Transcript (Day 4) in note 439 where the experts agreed on those notions.748 Therefore, Spain had not sustained any flaw in the Tribunal's reasoning and her claims under Article 52(1)(e) must fail.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6176.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6176.\n\n598.\n\nFinally, InfraRed argues that in order to prove that the Award failed to state reasons, it is required to prove that the Award contains no reasons at all for a particular finding that is indispensable to understand the tribunal's reasoning. InfraRed quotes *Enron v. Argentina* and *Kl\u00f6ckner v*. *Cameroon* to support its statement that arbitrators do not have to deal with all of the parties' arguments.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n599.\n\nThe issue of the installed capacity, as alleged, does not respect the line between failure to state reasons and disagreement with the reasons that have been stated.\n\n600.\n\nAs implicitly accepted by Spain, the reference to the conclusions of the *Eiser award* \u2013 were it not for its annulment \u2013 would be in itself part of the reasoning on the issue of installed capacity. As rightly highlighted by Spain in a number of other occasions, investment treaty awards (and all others, for that matter) do not constitute mandatory precedents, and therefore, when quoted they may be treated just as legal authorities among others, probably more useful as their approach is more fact specific oriented.\n\n601.\n\nThe *Eiser* award has been annulled for reasons not related with the interpretation of the various concepts related with the \"installed capacity\" criterion, and therefore the Committee does not see any valid argument against taking its analysis into account as inspiration and subsequent inclusion in the Award as a way of stating reasons.\n\n602.\n\nEven if this was not admissible, and therefore the reasons incorporated by way of some sort of reference to the *Eiser* award could not be acceptable, abundant evidence exists pointing to the fact that the reasoning of the Tribunal was not limited to those references and the additional reasoning was clear enough to allow this Committee to confirm that it was able \"to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B.\"\n\n603.\n\nIt is more than obvious that Spain disagreed with the interpretation of the Tribunal in relation to the \"installed capacity\" issue and it is not difficult for this Committee to admit that whether the Tribunal may have committed an \"error of fact or of law\" may be debatable.\n\n604.\n\nHowever, even if the Committee considers that it was entitled to enter into that analysis, its conclusion would be evident: that analysis would be for an appellate entity and not for an *ad hoc* committee, for the reasons abundantly explained in this Decision and clearly corresponding to the highly dominant interpretation of the limited powers vested in annulment committees, a position with which the Committee agrees.\n\n605.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request as presented by the Applicant.\n\n3. Failure to state reasons as to why the Award disregards the application of the applicable international law, including the ECT itself, and why the Award disregards the application of the entire EU law altogether\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submission*\n-----------------------\n\n606.\n\nSpain posits that the Tribunal rejects the application of EU law as \"highly irrelevant\" without giving any justification.749\n\nMemorial, \u00b6153.\n\n607.\n\nIn Spain's view, the Tribunal contradicts itself when it recognized that EU law is \"an undeniable part of the body of international law\", but at the same time declared that \"the provisions of EU law are neither dispositive nor relevant to the resolution of the questions raised\" in the present dispute.750\n\nMemorial, \u00b6157 quoting the Award, \u00b6272; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6357-358.\n\n608.\n\nAs a consequence, after declaring EU law applicable, the Award rejected the application of the TFEU and its Articles 107 and 108 and the state aid scheme751 without justification, and this lack of reasoning on why the EU rules on state aid and the decision of the EC should not be taken into account,752 despite the Parties' arguments on this issue, constitutes a \"manifest overreaching\" and the lack of reasons and explanatory grounds are both grounds for annulment.753\n\nMemorial, \u00b6163.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 166.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6221, 238-239.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n609.\n\nInfraRed posits that the Tribunal justified its decision on the rejection of the intra-EU objection with adequate reasoning by making reference to many arguments.\n\n610.\n\nAs way of example, InfraRed calls the attention of the Committee to the following: \"(i) all the relevant arguments raised by Spain [\u2026]; (ii) the reasoning of those ECT tribunals that, before InfraRed, had rejected this objection in similar circumstances [\u2026]; (iii) and [\u2026] a detailed analysis of why it decided to reject the intra-EU objection, also explaining why the March 2018 CJEU *Achmea* Judgment or the 2019 January Declarations did not change the Tribunal's affirmation of its jurisdiction under the ECT and the ICSID Convention. The last step of the Tribunal's reasoning is contained at paras. 256 \u2013 274 and is perfectly understandable as well as consistent.\"754\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6147, citing Award, pp. 57-70, 64-68, 68-74 and 256-274.\n\n611.\n\nMore than that, InfraRed argues that Spain \"did not prove, as required under Article 52(1)(e) ICSID Convention, that the reasoning of the Tribunal when rejecting the Intra-EU objection was 'contradictory, frivolous, or incomprehensible'\"755 and it made also reference to 28 other cases where the tribunals addressed the \"Intra-EU\" issue and rejected it.756\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6153.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6153.\n\n612.\n\nFinally, InfraRed argues that even if the Committee considers that EU law and EU state aid rules were to be applied to the merits of the dispute, the reality was that the reasoning of the Tribunal fully satisfied the standard under Article 52(1)(e)757 and therefore this objection would in any case be irrelevant.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6159.\n\n613.\n\nInfraRed also considers that the Tribunal in effect justified its decision on the application of international law, and consequently why it decided not to apply EU state aid rule for the purposes of assessing InfraRed's legitimate expectations.758 The Tribunal reasoned that neither EU, nor Spanish law (including the Supreme Court decisions) are to be used to assess whether a state has breached its international treaty obligations.759\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6208.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6210, quoting Award \u00b6411.\n\n614.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, InfraRed adds that in order to prove that the Award failed to state reasons, it must be evidenced that the award contains no reasons at all for a particular finding that is indispensable to apprehend the tribunal's reasoning, which Spain was not able to do.760\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6222.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n615.\n\nThe Committee concludes that the Intra-EU objection as a whole and the issue of the relevance or not of the TFEU and its Articles 107 and 108 and the state aid scheme for the outcome of the case, was analyzed in detail by the Tribunal, as highlighted by InfraRed. The reasoning is clear and there is no contradiction between that analysis and the conclusions reached by the Tribunal.\n\n616.\n\nIn a nutshell, when assessing the alleged breach of application of the ECT rules Spain considers applicable, the Tribunal concluded that the EU rules on state aid and any other rules that Spain tried to advance against the invoked legitimate expectations were not relevant. This was clearly understandable and the Committee understood the reasons presented to justify that conclusion.\n\n617.\n\nOnce more, Spain's position is that the Tribunal's conclusions should be the opposite as no relevant legitimate expectations could exist based on the alleged facts and, in any case, it was impossible to conclude that, in accordance with EU law, legitimate expectations could be relevant in an illegal situation as far as state aid in EU is concerned.\n\n618.\n\nThe Committee notes that the issue of the relation between the EU state aid rules and the legitimate expectations of InfraRed could \u2013 at least theoretically \u2013 be decided differently by the Tribunal. However, as explained above, this Committee is not an appellate body.\n\n619.\n\nAs quoted by Spain,761 the *Sempra v. Argentina* committee considered that \"frivolous, perfunctory or absurd arguments\" by a tribunal' may well be subject to annulment\"762 even if reasons are presented, as it seems obvious that these hypothetical situations may be materially construed as failures to state reasons.\n\nMemorial \u00b6142.\n\nRL-0117, *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for Annulment of the Award, June 29, 2010, \u00b6167.\n\n620.\n\nHowever, when nothing of the sort occurs, as it is the case with the Award, a committee cannot annul an award for failure to state reasons.\n\n621.\n\nThe Committee finds that the Award is comprehensible, and it is possible to go \"from point A to point B\" in the Tribunal's reasoning.\n\n622.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Committee considers it not relevant to address once more in detail the arguments presented by Spain and the Commission in relation to the rejection of the applicability of EU law, due to its irrelevance in addressing the legitimate expectations and the state aid EU rules.\n\n623.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request as presented by the Applicant.\n\n4. Failure to state reasons in the findings on liability which determine that there are serious deficiencies in the Award as to the interpretation of how Article 10(1) of the ECT is to be applied\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submissions*\n------------------------\n\n624.\n\nAccording to Spain's position, in determining the scope of Article 10(1) ECT, the Award in paragraphs 343-456 and 365-366, the Tribunal stated that the frustration of a legitimate expectation \"implies, per se, a breach of the provisions of Art. 10(1) FTE but only to the extent that such breach constitutes 'unfair and inequitable treatment.'\"763\n\nMemorial, \u00b6214.\n\n625.\n\nSpain argues that the Award \"does not express the *iter* that lead to such conclusion, nor does it express on which sources of hermeneutic criteria, of those provided for in the Vienna Convention it is relying for that purpose.\"764\n\nMemorial, \u00b6215.\n\n626.\n\nIn any event, according to Spain, the provisions of Article 10 ECT \"are extremely general and in no case can be considered as more favourable than the provisions of the EU Law.\"765\n\nSpain's PHB, \u00b698.\n\n627.\n\nHowever, in spite of Spain's explanations \"since the very beginning of the arbitration why the EU Law was more favourable than the ECT, [\u2026] this has not even been addressed by the Award.\"766\n\nSpain's PHB, \u00b699.\n\n628.\n\nSpain insists that \"it was not simply disagreeing\" with the Tribunal's decision, as indicated by InfraRed in its Counter-Memorial, but was asking that the Committee \"confirm whether the Award presented 'sufficiently pertinent reasons'\"767 for concluding that Spain had breached Article 10(1) of the ECT.768\n\nRL-0164, *Amco Asia Corporation, et al. v.

The Tribunal considered Spain's allegations about the directives, about other references to EU law, but the Tribunal concluded that those specific references were not relevant to resolve the issues raised by this dispute.\"778\n\nHearing Tr., Day 1, 15:12, lines 18-24.\n\n636.\n\nAs a consequence, InfraRed favors that the reasons to justify the decision were explained and there are no grounds to annul the Award.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n637.\n\nOnce more, the Committee is faced with a discrepancy between the Parties, in this case related to standards of protection and standards of fair and equitable treatment. These discrepancies have been relevant in the arbitral proceedings and would be nuclear if an appeal body existed to analyze and decide in relation to the Award, which is not the case of this Committee.\n\n638.\n\nAs already explained, failure to state reasons is in no way equivalent to failure to state reasons that would be agreeable for one of the Parties, and not even failure to address each and all of the lines of defense of a Party.\n\n639.\n\nFor the Committee, what is at stake is the answer to the following questions: did the Award explain in a way that is understandable why Article 10(1) ECT is enough to address the issues at stake in relation to FET and liability? Or was it necessary to address the issues from an EU law point of view?\n\n640.\n\nThe Committee's answer \u2013 irrespective of whether the conclusions of the Tribunal were correct from a legal point of view \u2013 is that reasons were presented and that these were comprehensible and sufficient to allow the readers \"to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B*.*\"779\n\nMemorial, \u00b6141 quoting *MINE*, \u00b6 5.09.\n\n641.\n\nIn other words, Spain asks the Committee to decide on whether the Award presented \"sufficiently pertinent reasons\"780 when concluding that Spain had breached Article 10(1) of the ECT.781 The Committee holds that the Award contains \"sufficiently pertinent reasons.\"\n\nRL-0164, *Amco Asia Corporation, et al. v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on the Application for Annulment, May 16, 1986, \u00b643.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6376-377.\n\n642.\n\nEven if, *quod non*, the Committee should assess whether EU law is more favorable to investors than the ECT, which under Article 16 ECT would allow investors to benefit from the application of Part III of the ECT (including Article 10(1)), the existence of this opting-in system is enough. This is because it is not possible to conclude that the Tribunal's reasons and arguments were \"frivolous, perfunctory or absurd.\"\n\n643.\n\nNeedless to say, if those provisions are more favorable to the investors or to the investments, the conclusion would be the same. This results from the issue of the relation between EU law and the ECT and criteria for prevalence in case these systems of law were in conflict, and this is clearly addressed by the Tribunal. But the Committee agrees with the Tribunal that in the situation at stake there is no real conflict between EU law and the ECT, as the legitimate expectations that have been the cornerstone of the Award should have been respected irrespectively of the content of EU law in relation to state aid.782\n\nAward, \u00b6272 (II), \"[T]he provisions of EU law are not dispositive nor even relevant to resolve the issues raised by this dispute\".\n\n644.\n\nTherefore, the Committee's position is that it is not necessary for its findings to consider whether the ECT system is more favorable to investors than the EU law as far as protection of their investment is concerned, in spite of noticing that the investors able to benefit from EU law are not under a dilemma of opting against it, but rather may add the additional protection of ECT.\n\n645.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request as presented by the Applicant.\n\n5. Provision of contradictory reasons concerning the expectations of InfraRed regarding immutability of the regulatory framework under which they made their investment and the alleged breach thereof\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submissions*\n------------------------\n\n646.\n\nSpain states that there is a contradiction in the Award that affects it, as it recognizes the value of the alleged agreement as a legally relevant fact,783 but at the same time the Award omits to weigh it against other facts, such as the later normative changes made by Spain prior to InfraRed's investment.784\n\nMemorial, \u00b6217.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n647.\n\nSpain posits that this contradiction relates to the value given to the legitimate expectations of InfraRed based upon jurisprudence that she considers of an arbitrary nature to sustain the scope of the ECJ, not limited to non-discrimination, and to the oversight of all the jurisprudence emanating from the Spanish Supreme Court,785 as well as all regulatory changes, which had been declared in conformity with the law by the courts of justice in Spain even before InfraRed's investment.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n648.\n\nSpain also refers to paragraph. 436 of the Award in which the Tribunal stated that there was no evidence \"between 29 December 2010 and 23 June 2011 that contradicts the reasonableness or legitimacy of the expectation,\"786 forgetting the jurisprudence by the Spanish Supreme Court related to the incentive system and regulatory changes before Claimants' investment,787 in particular the Ruling of 25 October 2006, also because on paragraph 371 the Award refers that the \"jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court\" was included in its reasoning, when in fact Spain had demonstrated that this was not the case.788\n\nMemorial, \u00b6219.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 222.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6226.\n\n649.\n\nSpain further alleges that the contradiction between paragraphs 366 and 427 of the Award, as paragraph 366 recognized that \"stability\" does not amount to a \"limitation on a state sovereignty in the absence of the specific manifestation of consent by the host state\"789 and paragraph 427 \"recognizes the alleged agreement as a legally relevant fact,\" without explaining how the press release from the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce, and subsequent resolutions of December 2010 would prevail over the \"normative and jurisprudential antecedents\" reiterated and produced \"since a decade\" before the investment.790\n\nMemorial, \u00b6232.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6233.\n\n650.\n\nAs a consequence, Spain requests that the Committee confirm that the Award did not present \"sufficiently pertinent reasons\"791 and that no evidence is found in the Award that the FET standard is unrelated to discrimination, and inextricably linked to the frustration of legitimate expectations,\"792 which constitutes is a lack of reasons for the Tribunal's finding that Spain infringed the ECT rules.793\n\nRL-0164, *Amco Asia Corporation, et al. v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on the Application for Annulment, May 16, 1986, \u00b643.\n\nReply, \u00b6385.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6384-400.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n651.\n\nInfraRed posits that Spain ignored the Tribunal's reasoned conclusions about (i) the legal standard applicable under Article 10(1) of the ECT in assessing a host State's FET obligation, and (ii) the reasons why Spain breached InfraRed's legitimate expectations.794\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6187.\n\n652.\n\nInfraRed emphasizes that the Tribunal analyzed the standard governing the FET providing a detailed analysis of the meaning of FET in line of the *jurisprudence constante*795 and that the Tribunal interpreted Article 10(1) of the ECT under the VCLT,796 and in any case, the reasons behind the Tribunal's reasoning \"do not need to be explicitly stated as long as the reader can understand the decision reached by the tribunal*.*\"797\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6189.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6190.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n653.\n\nIn addition, InfraRed considers that the Tribunal never made the statement that it would examine the \"jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court.\"798 The phrase that Spain quoted comes from the Award's summary of the *Charanne* Award and cannot be attributed to the Tribunal.799\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6243.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6243 quoting Award \u00b639.\n\n654.\n\nIn any event, regarding the 2010 Agreement, InfraRed argued that Spain omitted to cite the beginning of the sentence that confirms that the Tribunal considered the Purported Agreement as a fact (and not as a \"legally\" binding source of obligations as Spain seemed to allege).800\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6245.\n\n655.\n\nInfraRed also states that the omission of an in-depth treatment of evidence did not constitute grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(e),801 and the Tribunal did not have to explain why it preferred to rely on certain evidence and not on the documents Spain believes to be more relevant. Thus, this allegation for annulment should be dismissed.802\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6246.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6250.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n656.\n\nSpain's reference to an internal contradiction between paragraphs of the Award has not been evidenced. First, the concept of contradiction is not applicable to a decision that is consistent, even if not accepted by one of the parties that would favor a different solution or gives weight to facts and interpretation of legal rules as compared with the other that would correspond to the perspective of one of the parties.\n\n657.\n\nThat does not mean that the choice of relevant facts, when compared with others, and the conclusions, in relation to rules as interpreted or to legal authorities, will not be debatable. But certainly not under the limited possibilities of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention as this rule does not open the door to consider the Committee an appellate body that could and should scrutinize this kind of issues.\n\n658.\n\nA similar reasoning applies to the alleged contradiction between paragraphs 366 and 427 of the Award. The reasoning of the Award seems clear to the Committee. One thing is the right of the Host State not to be limited in abstract in its sovereignty and another is the acceptance of that State to limit it through a \"specific manifestation of consent\"803 to ensure stability to investors, as occurred with \"legally cognizable facts.\" Spain's divergence relates to the relevance of what she calls a \"press release from the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce.\"804 Even if it was only a \"press release\" what was at stake, and the mere analysis of the Award demonstrates that the \"legal cognizable facts\" are not limited to the \"Purported Agreement\" (in a way, incorrectly \"downgraded\" to a \"press release\"), the Committee concludes that there is no failure to state reasons and no contradiction, as posited by Spain.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6232.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6233.\n\n659.\n\nThe reasons to be taken into account to analyze whether a relevant failure for the purposes of Article 52 (1) (e) of the ICSID Convention really exists, have been addressed before and are basically related with the value given as \"legally cognizable facts\" by the Tribunal to the representation, guarantees and other facts from Spain's behavior that were instrumental to InfraRed's investments, as they create relevant expectations in accordance with international law and ECT.\n\n660.\n\nThis is, once more, a debatable issue, but not for the Committee, as it is not an appellate body.\n\n661.\n\nThe same occurs with the alleged contradiction between the \"*jurisprudence constante*\" of the Spanish Supreme Court (that in no way has been considered irrelevant *per se* by the Tribunal, but only for the purposes of the legitimate expectations of InfraRed and its rights related thereto) and conclusions reached by it. This is so in the sense that legitimate expectations of investors are to be interpreted in accordance with the meaning of FET in line with the alleged international *jurisprudence constante*805 out of discrimination situations and not necessarily resulting only from legal rules, as it has been decided by the Tribunal taking into account the Purported Agreement as a \"legally cognizable fact\".806 The Committee easily admits that this conclusion is debatable, but it is not a case of failure to state reasons.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6189.\n\nAward, \u00b6427.\n\n662.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request as presented by the Applicant.\n\n6. Failure to state reasons in relation to the evidentiary activity and the evaluation of the evidence developed in the Arbitration\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submissions*\n------------------------\n\n663.\n\nSpain argued that paragraphs 321-456 and in particular paragraphs 406-456 of the Award, included no more than \"very scarce reference to the evidentiary activity developed in the oral hearing, since only a couple of aspects of the statements of one of the witnesses are mentioned,\"807 as allegedly \"the Award has simply been written as if [relevant documents and witness depositions] did not exist\"808 in spite of Spain having carried out \"an enormous amount of evidentiary work.\"809\n\nMemorial, \u00b6268.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6273.\n\nReply, \u00b6284.\n\n664.\n\nSpain posits also that the discretion of the Tribunal in assessing the evidence does not allow for violations of essential rules such as the right to be heard or the rule on the burden of proof.810\n\nReply, \u00b6285-289.\n\n665.\n\nAs a consequence, these Tribunal's omissions constitute grounds for annulment due to failure to state reasons.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n666.\n\nInfraRed argues that Spain's application is directed to the Tribunal's 'judgment' of the evidence presented by Spain, which is not a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n667.\n\nInfraRed contends also that the Tribunal referred several times to the testimonies presented by Spain in the Award and during the hearing811. In addition to that, InfraRed argued that \"tribunals do not have to indicate in an award the reasons why some types of evidence are more credible than others.\"812\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6230.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6231-233.\n\n668.\n\nInfraRed posits that the Tribunal did not ignore Spain's evidence but simply used its \"discretion\" to evaluate the evidence of the case,813 and therefore InfraRed considered that Spain's application was \"just a petition for revision and reconsideration of the conclusion that the Tribunal reached from Mr. Caravantes and Mr. Montoya witness statements\"814 and a similar reasoning is applied to the alleged violation of the burden of proof.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6233.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6234.\n\n669.\n\nAbout the shift on the burden of proof alleged by Spain815 on the issue of the due diligence to know the regulatory framework in which the investment was made, InfraRed considered that the Tribunal never reversed the burden of proof by offering a \"positive effect to the lack of Due Diligence,\"816 as after considering Spain's arguments, it just came to the conclusion that \"a more thorough due diligence would not have alerted Claimants to the imminent enactment of the Measures in Question.\"817\n\nApplication for Annulment, \u00b660; Memorial, \u00b6281.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6236.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6236, quoting Award, \u00b644.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n670.\n\nThe annulment of an award under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention (\"that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based\") cannot be misleadingly confused with the discussion by a committee about the stated reasons and the assessment of the available evidence made by a tribunal under its discretion.\n\n671.\n\nWhat any committee may and must scrutinize is whether the award failed to state reasons (or provide reasons that are materially to be treated as inexistent), and not whether the tribunal did not state the reasons, if any, that in accordance with an applicant's point of view would end with a different or even opposite decision.\n\n672.\n\nThe Committee admits that in certain situations there is a thin line (and yet a line) separating the failure to state reasons from the failure to analyze different possible outcomes that \u2013 if analyzed \u2013 would make admissible a different outcome under a different reasoning.\n\n673.\n\nHowever, this is not the situation in relation to the Award. The Tribunal assessed the evidence and under its discretion gave weight to some evidence in detriment of other, as it the usual situation in any adjudication, being it judicial or arbitral.\n\n674.\n\nEven appeal courts refrain from entering into the analysis of the assessment of evidence, especially in the case of fact witnesses depositions and crossing, that were or not instrumental for the decision.\n\n675.\n\nWhat has been set up in the ICSID Convention is not an appeal committee, but rather an annulment committee, and this is also to be understood in a way that takes into account that the threshold for annulling an award is stricter than the threshold for amending an award by means of rendering a more adequate one.\n\n676.\n\nIt is expected that a committee will refrain from reassessing evidence, giving it more (or less) weight than the tribunal did, and that it will not reinstate evidence as being essential when the evolution of the arbitral proceedings did not convince the adjudicators of it.\n\n677.\n\nIt is incorrect \u2013 as it does not correspond to the correct interpretation of Article 52(1)(e) of the Convention, and not even to common sense \u2013 to admit that a committee should annul an award under the allegation that some pieces of evidence were not specifically addressed in it.\n\n678.\n\nAnd this idea would be even less admissible, when it clearly results from an award that the tribunal went in a different direction than the one that an applicant would prefer, as it assessed the available evidence giving weight to factual aspects detrimental to the applicant's claim.\n\n679.\n\nThat is the case of the Award, without a doubt. It is not reasonable, let alone legally mandated, for the Tribunal to make reference in the Award to each and every document, and to every proof offered by the fact and expert witnesses, provided that the Award \u2013 as it is the case \u2013 refers to documents and witnesses upon which to base its conclusions.\n\n680.\n\nSpain scarcely mentioned the \"very scarce reference to the evidentiary activity developed in the oral hearing, since only a couple of aspects of the statements of one of the witnesses are mentioned,\"818 which is by itself a confirmation that the requested analysis and decision by the Committee would need to enter into the shoes of the Tribunal to address it, an impossibility for a body with powers vested and limited by Article 52 (1) (e).\n\nMemorial, \u00b6268.\n\n681.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request as presented by the Applicant.\n\n7. Regarding the determination on damages and the failure to state reasons for the Tribunal's valuation, including the date of the investment and the date of valuation\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.1. Regarding the determination of damages\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submissions*\n------------------------\n\n682.\n\nSpain argues that there was a clear contradiction in terms of liability and damages, and that without justification the Tribunal adopted DCF calculation proposed by Brattle rejecting the alternative solution proposed by Accuracy.819\n\nMemorial, \u00b6247.\n\n683.\n\nSpain also concludes from Professor Dupuy's opinion, as mentioned in footnote 582 of the Award, that \"the fact that one member of the Tribunal refers to evidentiary documents in the record that contradict the unsupported opinion of the rest of the Tribunal shows that there is a clear lack of reasoning for adopting Brattle's position and discarding Accuracy's position on regulatory risk and the illiquidity discount,\"820 which had a significant impact on the quantum.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6426-428.\n\n684.\n\nIn Spain's position, this is an indisputable inconsistency between the Award's decision of damages and the damages actually calculated, which expresses the failure to state reasons.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n685.\n\nInfraRed avers that the Tribunal gave reasons and explained precisely how it reached the damages figure it awarded to InfraRed.\n\n686.\n\nInfraRed states that Spain was seeking annulment under this ground not because there were inconsistencies in the Award's reasoning of damages, but because it disagreed with the conclusions reached by the Tribunal.821\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6204.\n\n687.\n\nInfraRed also notes that the \"Tribunal used the DCF Joint Model developed by Spain's and InfraRed's experts and chose to include some of the parameters suggested by Spain.\"822\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6205.\n\n688.\n\nIn any case, InfraRed posits that there were no grounds for annulment because as long as the reasons have been stated, even if they were incorrect, unconvincing or non-exhaustive, the award cannot be annulled under Article 52(1)(e).823\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6206.\n\n689.\n\nInfraRed notes that the Tribunal explicitly mentioned in the Award that \"in coming to th[e] conclusion [about the regulatory risk and the illiquidity discount] the Tribunal has carefully reviewed the opinion and the methodology of the Accuracy experts and of the Brattle experts.\"824\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6252, quoting Award, \u00b6580.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n690.\n\nOnce more, what is at stake here, seen from Spain's point of view, is a disagreement with the Award, as Spain favored in this case Professor Dupuy's dissenting opinion regarding the only request in which one of the arbitrators actually dissented.\n\n691.\n\nThe Committee analyzed with care footnote 782 of the Award and concluded that the dissenting opinion was related to the interpretation of the available technical information at large and specifically to the relevance to be given to the issue of regulatory risk and illiquidity discount.\n\n692.\n\nTo Professor Dupuy, as it is summarized in said footnote, \"the opinion of two independent major credit rating agencies,\"825 Fitch and Moody's, and Accuracy's analysis in relation to the downgrading of the Spain rating, should have been accepted, and \"in order to get as much as possible a comprehensive perception of the economic situation which prevailed at that time\" it would be \"appropriate, as Accuracy did, to reasonably introduce in the analysis variables not strictly related to the Disputed Measures, an approach which is in no way incompatible with the DCF method.\"\n\nAward, fn. 782.\n\n693.\n\nThe dissenting opinion may be correct, and the majority might have erred in its conclusions. However, reasons have been presented by the majority as it is normal in any situation of dissent, in which usually there are internal discussions between the arbitrators. As a matter of fact, and once more this is the usual paradigm, Professor Dupuy's footnote is a reaction to the paragraphs of the Award that favored a different solution.\n\n694.\n\nAnd the same occurs with Spain's reaction to the option of the Tribunal for the adoption of the DCF calculation proposed by Brattle rejecting Accuracy's alternative solution, even if this was correct, which InfraRed refuses. To adopt the technical arguments of one expert in detriment of the other does not amount to a failure to state reasons but is in fact the presentation of reasons that do not correspond to the arguments of the other expert.\n\n695.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request presented by the Applicant.\n\n7.2. Regarding the failure to state reasons in relation to the decision for the date of the investment\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submissions*\n------------------------\n\n696.\n\nSpain argues that the Award failed to provide reasons for setting July 28, 2011 as the date of InfraRed's investment.826\n\nMemorial, \u00b6202.\n\n697.\n\nIn accordance with Spain's position, the Tribunal refers to this date \"without any reference to or analysis of the doubts raised by the Spain regarding the reasons why InfraRed would have preferred to invest in 2011 instead of 2008 when [\u2026] the risks were mostly technical.\"827\n\nMemorial, \u00b6209.\n\n698.\n\nSpain claims that the Tribunal relied only on footnote 8 of the Award that referred to page 4 of the Quantum Brattle Report,828 but that page 4 of Quantum Brattle Report \"says nothing about the date of the investment.\"829\n\nMemorial, \u00b633.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b633 and 35.\n\n699.\n\nIn the Opening Statement Spain explained that \"the fund tried to invest in these plants in 2008, when the project was starting; whereas, very surprisingly, it was not until 2011 when the investment was made. Spain complained and found illogical that InfraRed refrained from investing in those plants in 2008, when the plan[t]s were just at the promotional stage and the risk was mainly technical, and decided to invest almost four years later, when the risk was much bigger. However, the Tribunal arrives directly to this conclusion, to this date of July 28, 2011, without any reference to Respondent's doubts regarding the reason why InfraRed would have preferred to invest in 2011 rather than in 2008.\"830\n\nHearing Tr., Day 1, 13:57, lines 1-14.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n700.\n\nInfraRed submits that Spain's counsel explicitly agreed that such date was July 28, 2011, in the Parties' List of Uncontested Facts831 and that Spain never contested this date. And it posits that Spain's quantum expert confirmed that the date of the investment was July 28, 2011.832\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6178-179.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6181-184.\n\n701.\n\nThis is also confirmed in the Opening Statement, as a reaction to the fact that InfraRed was allegedly convinced that this request had been abandoned by Spain.\n\n702.\n\nInfraRed then states that \"The reason for such abandonment appears to be simple. During the arbitration, Spain confirmed in writing, not once, not twice, but multiple times, that the date of InfraRed's investment was July 28, 2011. This appears not only in Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, as cited on screen, and Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, but as a matter of fact, as seen also on screen, both parties stipulated July 28, 2011 as the date of the investment in an agreed chronology that the parties submitted to the Tribunal in September 2017 C-723).\"833\n\nHearing Tr., Day 1, 15:36, lines 22-5 and 15:37, lines 1-6. See also InfraRed PHB, \u00b6\u00b6153-154.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n703.\n\nThis issue is related to the alleged surprise with InfraRed's decision of not starting the investment some years before. However \u2013 even if there was a reason for surprise, which is an issue the Committee is not aware of \u2013 the facts of the arbitration clearly evidence that in relation to the actual \"date of the investment\", as a fact, the Parties explicitly informed the Tribunal of their agreement.\n\n704.\n\nThis Committee has no doubt that when the parties present to a tribunal an agreement in relation to a fact, the tribunal may conclude differently if it has grounds to disagree with the parties' agreement. In that case, the tribunal should present reasons to deviate from the common understanding of the parties. However, it makes no sense to consider that if the tribunal accepts the common position of the parties, the award should be annulled because it did not add reasons for admitting that fact.\n\n705.\n\nThat is the situation with the Award. The Tribunal accepted the date of the investment as defined in the \"List of Uncontested Facts\" jointly submitted by the Parties. One of the Parties cannot subsequently state that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons, not because the fact was controversial, but because that Party argues that the investment should have started sooner and therefore have a different investment date.\n\n706.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request as presented by the Applicant.\n\n**D. SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Interpretation of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submissions*\n------------------------\n\n707.\n\nSpain notes that a procedural rule is 'fundamental' if it \"refers to the essential fairness that must govern all proceedings and is included within the standards of 'due process' required by international law.\"834 Spain further notes that a deviation is 'serious' if \"a party is deprived of the protection afforded by the relevant procedural rule.\"835\n\nMemorial, \u00b6252.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n708.\n\nSpain also posits that the \"right of a party to be heard\" includes the right of a party to present arguments and evidence, within a \"comparative equal opportunity.\"836 It states that the right to be heard is infringed when a party did not have the opportunity to \"respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other party.\"837\n\nMemorial, \u00b6254.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6257.\n\n709.\n\nMoreover, Spain argues that the unjustified refusal by a tribunal of a party's request for the production of documents is an example of a violation of the right to be heard, in particular when the tribunal concludes that evidence was absent in the case, \"after refusing to produce the documents.\"838\n\nMemorial, \u00b6259.\n\n710.\n\nSpain also alleges that the Tribunal committed a series of breaches in relation to evidentiary activity and the assessment of evidence in the underlying proceeding.839 For instance, it erred in applying the basic procedural principles of the burden of proof and concluded that the absence of legal due diligence on InfraRed' part was irrelevant to the formation of legitimate expectations.840\n\nReply, \u00b6259.\n\nReply, \u00b6260.\n\n711.\n\nLikewise, Spain asserts that \"the evidence presented by both parties must necessarily be given the same weight or value,\"841 which was not the case with the Award.\n\nReply, \u00b6272.\n\n712.\n\nFinally, Spain argues that there was a lack of impartiality towards Spain, also a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d), based on the alleged findings in favor of one the parties without corresponding factual support.842\n\nMemorial, \u00b6303.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n713.\n\nInfraRed notes that a \"departure\" from the rules of procedure cannot be equivalent to, as allegedly is the case, a situation where an applicant disagreed with the Tribunal's conclusion reached after the analysis of the evidence.843\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6217.\n\n714.\n\nInfraRed considers that there may be a \"departure\" from the right to be heard and to be treated equally, as Spain explained, (i) when a party cannot present all relevant arguments and evidence,844 or (ii) when a party does not have the opportunity to respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other.845 Contrary to Spain's argument, however, the right to be heard does not mean that the Tribunal must accord the same weight to the evidence provided by both Parties.846\n\nMemorial, \u00b6256.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6257.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6219, Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6268-274, 295-298.\n\n715.\n\nAccording to InfraRed, to establish a departure of a fundamental rule of procedure, it was required that the party raised its objection during the Arbitration, particularly at the hearing.847 Spain never argued, during six years of Arbitration, that the Tribunal had infringed its due process rights.848\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6221.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6221; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b611 and 134.\n\n716.\n\nMoreover, InfraRed argues that even if a \"departure\" from a fundamental rule of procedure occurred, which has not been the case, for annulment purposes it should be \"serious,\" which was not even remotely evidenced. In accordance with the standard for annulment, this would require (i) the existence of actual material prejudice and (ii) a showing that the violation has caused a \"substantially different result\" in the case.849 InfraRed alleges that none of these factors were demonstrated by Spain.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6224.\n\n717.\n\nInfraRed also stresses, as a general remark, that Spain's application is directed to the Tribunal's \"judgment\" of the evidence presented by Spain, which is not a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n718.\n\nFinally, InfraRed reiterates that under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee may scrutinize whether the procedure was conducted according to basic rules of procedure and \u2013 as ICSID tribunals have wide discretion on this matter -annulment committees are not tasked with reevaluating the weight accorded by the Arbitral Tribunal to the evidence submitted by the Parties.850\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6153.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n719.\n\nAccording to the Updated Background Paper,851 \"it appears from the drafting history of the ICSID Convention that the ground of a 'serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure' has a wide connotation including principles of natural justice, but that it excludes the Tribunal's failure to observe ordinary arbitration rules. The phrase 'fundamental rules of procedure' was explained by the drafters as a reference to principles. One such fundamental principle mentioned during the negotiations was the parties' right to be heard.\"852\n\nRL-0118, Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID May 5, 2016.\n\n*Id.*, \u00b698.\n\n720.\n\n\"Based on the words 'serious' and 'fundamental' in this ground, *ad hoc* committees have adopted a dual analysis: the departure from a rule of procedure must be serious and the rule must be fundamental. *Ad hoc* committees have thus consistently held that not every departure from a rule of procedure justifies annulment. Examples of fundamental rules of procedure identified by *ad hoc* committees concern: (i) the equal treatment of the parties; (ii) the right to be heard; (iii) an independent and impartial Tribunal; (iv) the treatment of evidence and burden of proof; and (v) deliberations among members of the Tribunal.\"853\n\n*Id.*, \u00b699.\n\n721.\n\nThe Committee understands that Spain refers to some situations \u2013 and this ground is more fact specific than any other \u2013 that might be included in the five examples above that may be found in previous decisions of committees. The Committee will proceed to examine all of these situations.\n\n722.\n\nHowever, before doing so, it stresses that only a \"serious\" departure, and also only if it is a departure from a \"fundamental\" rule of procedure, could lead to annulment. The Committee finds that this is a confirmation that the drafters and the signatories of the ICSID Convention admitted this ground of annulment only in very limited cases and as a way of avoiding the risking \"the integrity and fairness of the arbitral process.\"854\n\n*Id.*, \u00b698.\n\n723.\n\nFurthermore, it is clear to the Committee that these risks cannot be those for which appeal courts exist, meaning to avoid the survival of decisions of tribunals or courts that are wrong in matters of fact and/or of law. This is not the \"job description\" of committees as defined in the ICSID Convention.\n\n2. The multiple procedural breaches in relation to the evidentiary activity and the evaluation of evidence in the Arbitration\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) Spain's submissions*\n------------------------\n\n724.\n\nSpain explicitly refers to a number of breaches of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, such as the violation of (i) the right to be heard, (ii) the rule of burden of proof, and (iii) the duty of impartiality.855\n\nAs explained below, when the Committee analyses the position of the Parties, this alleged \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" is to be analyzed as a \"failure to assess the evidence provided by the Kingdom of Spain\" (see Reply, \u00b6272.) and therefore as an example of the violation of the right to be heard.\n\n*(1) The right to be heard*\n---------------------------\n\n725.\n\nSpain argues that it is necessary that \"at least a minimal value be placed on the evidence offered\"856 in defense of its position to avoid annulment of the Award under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. In other words, failure to assess with equal relevance the evidence provided by Spain when compared with the evidence provided by InfraRed leads to annulment.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6273.\n\n726.\n\nSpain alleges that it carried out an enormous amount of evidentiary work. In spite of this, there was a complete absence of an exhaustive and conclusive analysis by the Tribunal of the evidence provided by Spain. Such analysis is unavoidable in order to ensure due respect for the essential principles of procedure, the infringement of which is a ground for annulment of the Award.\n\n727.\n\nAlso, Spain quotes paragraph 438 of the Award to illustrate its position that the Tribunal's duty was not to accept or reject the Parties' theses, but to verify them, in light of the evidence provided.857 Spain further alleges that there is a \"serious\" procedural breach because the Tribunal decided the case only on the basis of its own conclusions on the key issues, without really addressing the positions of Spain.\n\nReply, \u00b6290.\n\n728.\n\nMoreover, Spain posits that the \"right of a party to be heard\" includes the right of a party to present arguments and evidence, within a \"comparative equal opportunity.\"858 It stresses that the right to be heard was infringed when a party did not have the opportunity to \"respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other party,\"859 as it was the case here.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6254.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6257.\n\n729.\n\nLikewise, Spain mentions the unjustified refusal by the Tribunal of a Party's request for the production of documents, in particular when the Tribunal concluded that evidence was absent in the case, \"after refusing to produce the documents.\"860\n\nMemorial, \u00b6259.\n\n730.\n\nSpain argues that the Tribunal also exempted InfraRed from carrying the burden of proof, for instance on the basis of the assumption that the inclusion of the December Resolutions in the proceedings was sufficient to determine the content and scope of its legitimate expectations, which is tantamount to denying Spain's defense or the right to be heard.861\n\nReply, \u00b6262.\n\n731.\n\nFinally, Spain contends that the Award suffered from an anomaly due to the \"scarce reference to the evidentiary activity developed in the oral hearings regarding the existence or not of a breach of the ECJ.\"862\n\nMemorial, \u00b6 268.\n\n*(2) The rule of the burden of proof*\n-------------------------------------\n\n732.\n\nSpain argues that the Tribunal breached the fundamental right to be heard regarding (a) the infringement of the burden of proof of evidence in the proceedings, (b) the violation of the rules on the burden of proof with the regard to the Spanish Supreme Court decisions and (c) the illegal shifting of the burden of proof in favor of InfraRed.\n\n733.\n\nSpain adds that the burden of proof to demonstrate that \"the Original Regulatory Framework would remain stable (*i.e.* immutable) throughout the life of the plants\" lies on InfraRed,863 and that the Tribunal reversed the burden of proof going to the point of stating that \"investors in regulatory projects do not need to due diligence and that this must have positive consequences for them.\"864\n\nMemorial, \u00b6278.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6282.\n\n734.\n\nLikewise, Spain argues that any due diligence would have informed InfraRed of the jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court. However, the Award valued this \"lack of regulatory Due Diligence\" as a justification to have \"a position completely contradictory to that of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence.\"865\n\nMemorial, \u00b6286.\n\n735.\n\nSpain also posits that the Tribunal's conclusion accepting InfraRed's assertion of an alleged absence of evidence of Accuracy\u00b4s position constituted a serious breach of the rules of procedure.866 First, the Tribunal acknowledged in the Award that there was a discrepancy between the experts as to the amount of the costs for running the Plants.867 Next, the Tribunal underlined the fact that InfraRed's expert (Brattle) provided documentation in their first report that contradicted their own position.\n\nReply, \u00b6308.\n\nReply, \u00b6 297; Award, \u00b6590.\n\n736.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal should have considered that the burden of proof of Brattle's hypothesis (fixed and equal management costs for both scenarios) was on InfraRed,868 instead of stating that according to Brattle, it was up to Accuracy to demonstrate that the management costs were variable and that they were reduced as a result of the Measures, and to agree with that argument.869\n\nReply, \u00b6302.\n\nReply, \u00b6303.\n\n737.\n\nThe Tribunal's failure to require legal due diligence to confirm the scope and content of the expectations claimed by InfraRed revealed a breach of the rules on the burden of proof, insofar as it relieved InfraRed of this burden on the basis of an issue that is disputed between the Parties, and which is one of the key issues in the case.870\n\nReply, \u00b6263.\n\n*(3) The duty of impartiality*\n------------------------------\n\n738.\n\nSpain argues the there was a lack of impartiality towards it, also a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, because of the Tribunal's findings in favor of InfraRed without corresponding factual support.871\n\nMemorial, \u00b6303.\n\n739.\n\nAs a rule, Spain stresses that when evidence was provided containing reasonings for Spain's declaration of international liability, there was a complete absence of an exhaustive and conclusive analysis of such evidence by the Tribunal. According to Spain, if such evidence was analyzed impartially, the conclusion of the Tribunal would have been different or opposite.872\n\nSee also Reply \u00b6284.\n\n*b) InfraRed's submission*\n--------------------------\n\n740.\n\nInfraRed considers that not one of the grounds presented by Spain should be accepted because the Tribunal did not violate Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n*(1) The right to be heard*\n---------------------------\n\n741.\n\nInfraRed agrees with Spain that a \"departure\" from the right to be heard and to be treated equally, may occur (i) when a party cannot present all relevant arguments and evidence,873 or (ii) when a party does not have the opportunity to respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other.874\n\nMemorial, \u00b6256.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6257.\n\n742.\n\nHowever, contrary to Spain's argument, the right to be heard does not entail to accord the same weight to the evidence provided by both parties.875\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6219, Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6268-274, 295-298.\n\n743.\n\nInfraRed posits that the Tribunal did not ignore Spain's evidence but simply exercised its \"discretion\" to evaluate the evidence of the case.876\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6233.\n\n744.\n\nInfraRed contends that Spain was accorded a full, fair and comparatively equal opportunity to rebut claims and submit evidence relating to the effect of management costs and value of the debt.877 Spain having raised this argument in the annulment procedure, the late nature of the claim in itself evidences that the Tribunal never departed from a rule of procedure.878\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6174.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6175.\n\n745.\n\nInfraRed agrees that \"the Tribunal did not mention in the Award each of the more than 1300 legal and factual exhibits, annexes to 10 expert reports or specific facts included in the 6 witness statements.\"879 However, it argues that \"a Tribunal does not have an obligation to make a reference in the Award to each piece of evidence.\"880\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6245.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6246.\n\n*(2) The rule of the burden of proof*\n-------------------------------------\n\n746.\n\nInfraRed agrees with Spain that under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee may scrutinize whether the procedure was conducted according to basic rules of procedure.\n\n747.\n\nHowever, it states that ICSID tribunals have wide discretion on this matter and annulment committees are not tasked with reevaluating the weight accorded by the Tribunal to the evidence submitted by the Parties.881 InfraRed quotes *Vivendi v. Argentina*, *Dogan v. Turkmenistan* and *Caratube v. Kazakhstan* in support of their argument.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6153.\n\n748.\n\nTherefore, InfraRed considers that the Tribunal had wide discretion regarding the standard of burden of proof because it is responsible for assessing the probative value of the evidence in the case.882\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6151.\n\n749.\n\nMoreover, InfraRed considers that, in any case, the Tribunal's weighing of the evidence did not seriously depart from any fundamental rules of procedure. The Tribunal distributed the burden of proof in accordance with the most basic due process principles.883\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6157-158.\n\n750.\n\nInfraRed argues that the Tribunal never reversed the burden of proof by offering a \"positive effect to the lack of Due Diligence.\"884 InfraRed further notes that after considering Spain's arguments, the Tribunal concluded that \"a more thorough due diligence would not have alerted Claimants to the imminent enactment of the Measures in Question.\"885\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6236.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6236, quoting Award, \u00b644.\n\n751.\n\nWith this possibility on the record, Spain had the burden to prove that the December Resolutions were not the \"clear expression of a specific commitment,\"886 which it did not discharge.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6160.\n\n752.\n\nAlso, the fact that Spain was not able to persuade the Tribunal that a more exhaustive due diligence by InfraRed would have led to a different understanding, could not be construed as a violation of any fundamental rule of procedure.887\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6237; Rejoinder, \u00b6146.\n\n753.\n\nSimilarly, InfraRed states that the Tribunal did not ignore the Spanish Supreme Court judgements but disagreed with Spain's position as to their relevance, as shown in paragraphs 439-441 of the Award.888 The Tribunal explicitly mentioned the case law of the Supreme Court when analyzing the due diligence that InfraRed performed,889 and considered that they were not relevant to the analysis of InfraRed's legitimate expectations.890\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6238.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6239.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6240.\n\n754.\n\nIn conclusion, InfraRed posits that the Tribunal distributed the burden of proof in accordance with the most basic due process principles.891\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6157-158.\n\n*(3) The duty of impartiality*\n------------------------------\n\n755.\n\nInfraRed considers that this allegation is not serious and that Spain has not adduced any evidence that proves a manifest lack of independence and impartiality by the Tribunal.892\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6250.\n\n756.\n\nInfraRed argues that Spain had abandoned its 'very serious accusation' relating to an alleged \"lack of impartiality and unequal treatment\" by the Tribunal,893 which demonstrates that this allegation was frivolous.894\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6132.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6132.\n\n*c) Analysis of the Committee*\n------------------------------\n\n757.\n\nArticle 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention provides for the annulment of an award if there is evidence of a \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\" The Committee agrees with other *ad hoc* committees holding that \"the departure have a material impact on the outcome of the award for the annulment to succeed.\"895\n\n*Wena*, \u00b658; *Repsol*, \u00b681; *CDC*, \u00b649; *Fraport*, \u00b6246; *Impregilo*, \u00b6164; *El Paso*, \u00b6269; *Iberdrola*, \u00b6104; *Dogan*, \u00b6208; *Micula*, \u00b6134; *TECO*, \u00b6\u00b682-85. See also the analysis of the Annulment Committee in *K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7*.\n\n758.\n\nThis means that the threshold for a committee to annul an award under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention is high and the quality and relevance of the evidence provided is paramount for such a decision.\n\n759.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Spain clarified in its Reply that \"this plea [must] be upheld on the basis of a failure to assess the evidence provided by the Kingdom of Spain,\"896 not on determining the application of this legal standard as claimed by InfraRed897 in the sense that \"the evidence presented by both parties must necessarily be given the same weight or value.\"898 As such, this issue is actually an expression of the violation of the right to be heard, and not an autonomous issue.\n\nReply, \u00b6272.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n760.\n\nIn any event, having analyzed carefully the Award and its reasoning, and the arguments that both Parties brought to its attention in this proceeding, the Committee will decide on all the issues that have been presented, and not only on the rule of the right to be heard.\n\n761.\n\nThe Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not deviate from its duties related with the core principles of any proceeding, such as the \"right to be heard,\" \"the rule of the burden of the proof\" and the \"duty of impartiality.\"\n\n762.\n\nAs it is common in investment arbitration, the parties are represented by sophisticated counsel. Also, it is a fact that Spain faced and is facing a great number of cases, in which it is usually represented by in-house lawyers, who have accumulated a high degree of experience.\n\n763.\n\nIt is also clear that the Parties left no stone unturned. Any admissible arguments, including legal, and all the relevant facts have been presented to the Tribunal \u2013 and likewise to this Committee \u2013 in a way that helps the adjudicators to avoid the ever-present risk of missing any relevant points. Therefore, the support of the evidence and arguments provided by the Parties allows the adjudicators to analyze and decide each and all requests.\n\n764.\n\nTherefore, the Award reached unavoidably a dimension and accuracy that was convenient and probably inevitable, and which in itself deems a \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" not probable.\n\n765.\n\nIn any case, the Committee will specifically address the three alleged violations of procedural rules, namely the (i) right to be heard, (ii) rule of the burden of proof and (iii) duty of impartiality.\n\n*(1) The right to be heard*\n---------------------------\n\n766.\n\nSpain mentions that the right to be heard should not be defined only by the opportunity granted to each party to present its case and to analyze, criticize and argue against the other party's case.\n\n767.\n\nSpain asserts that to respect its right to be heard, \"at least a minimal value [must] be placed on the evidence offered in defense of the Spain's position\"899 and that the Tribunal failed to do so.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6273.\n\n768.\n\nAccordingly, Spain asserts that \"the Tribunal's duty was not to accept or reject the Parties' theses, but to verify them, in light of the evidence provided.\"900\n\nReply, \u00b6290.\n\n769.\n\nLikewise, Spain argues that the right to be heard is violated if a party is not allowed to present arguments and evidence, within a \"comparative equal opportunity,\"901 and when it is not granted the opportunity to \"respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other party.\"902\n\nMemorial, \u00b6254.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6257.\n\n770.\n\nHowever, the alleged violation of the right to be heard has not been evidenced. There is no violation of that right when, after perusal of the parties' arguments, a tribunal concludes that it agrees with the position or the arguments of one of the parties, instead of repeating with different words and style those positions and arguments. It might be debatable whether in a specific situation that was enough to respect the duty of stating the reasons for its findings, but that is a different issue than that of the right to be heard.\n\n771.\n\nSimilarly, the right to be heard does not include an alleged obligation for a tribunal to mention, analyze and comment on each and every piece of evidence. Here, as InfraRed mentioned, there are \"more than 1300 legal and factual exhibits, annexes to 10 expert reports or specific facts included in the 6 witness statements.\"903 It defies common sense to consider that the lack of a reference in an award to each document, fact or argument, let alone comments to witnesses statements and their answers during cross-examination, is a violation of the right to be heard.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6245.\n\n772.\n\nThe power to assess the weight to be given to evidence is part of a tribunal's discretion. There is no violation of the right to be heard if a tribunal is persuaded by some evidence but not by the other. This was the case of the testimonies of Mr. Montoya and Mr. Caravantes.904\n\nMemorial, \u00b6\u00b6269-70.\n\n773.\n\nThe Committee reaches an equivalent conclusion in relation to the dismissal of requests for document production. To consider that the refusal to accept requests from a party violates *per se* the right to be heard makes no sense. It could be different if evidence is provided that the decision of the request in one or more specific cases had unequivocally prevented the party of presenting their case, and no evidence has been provided related thereto.\n\n774.\n\nAs the Updated Background Paper states, \"[t]he task of determining whether an alleged fundamental rule of procedure has been seriously breached is usually very fact specific, involving an examination of the conduct of the proceeding before the Tribunal.\"905\n\nRL-0118, Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID May 5, 2016, \u00b6100.\n\n775.\n\nHere, Spain was not able to provide factual evidence of a breach of its right to de heard pursuant to paragraph 268 of its Reply or the alleged \"very scarce reference to the evidentiary activity developed in the oral hearing.\"906\n\nMemorial, \u00b6268.\n\n776.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request as presented by the Applicant.\n\n*(2) The rule of the burden of proof*\n-------------------------------------\n\n777.\n\nThe Committee has analyzed Spain's allegations related to the Tribunal's violation of the burden of proof. Like with the alleged violation of the right to be heard, if evidenced, a committee may annul an award if it considers that there is a \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\"\n\n778.\n\nTo reach this conclusion, it would be necessary for the Tribunal \u2013 faced with the necessity of applying that *ultima ratio* rule, as it was unable to be convinced on a matter of evidence to reach a decision \u2013 to decide to favor a party by shifting the burden of proof from it to the other party, and for this decision to have a material effect in the outcome of the case.\n\n779.\n\nHowever, the issue of burden shifting is not to be confused with a situation in which a tribunal is more convinced by the arguments of one party, does not give weight to some facts when compared or not with others, does not follow the arguments or legal reasoning of one party, or reaches legal conclusions not favored by one of the parties.\n\n780.\n\nIn the case at hand, the Committee concludes that the above situation took place.\n\n781.\n\nFor example, this was the case of the alleged shifting of the burden of proof to demonstrate that \"the Original Regulatory Framework would remain stable (*i.e.* immutable) throughout the life of the plants\"907 and the issues of the regulatory due diligence.\n\nMemorial, \u00b6278.\n\n782.\n\nStarting with the due diligence argument, Spain posits that an adequate due diligence process before the formal decision to invest would have convinced InfraRed that it was impossible to base its decision-making process on any guarantee of tariff remuneration and its stability.\n\n783.\n\nSpain thereby alleges that it was for InfraRed to prove that an adequate due diligence would not be enough for the investor to conclude that said expectation could never materialize.\n\n784.\n\nThe Tribunal referred in detail to the due diligence performed by InfraRed, an issue that had also been addressed in the final Arbitration hearing.908\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b663-67.\n\n785.\n\nIt is debatable whether or not a high-quality due diligence was carried out. Also, it is debatable whether legal advice under a due diligence process is not prone to errors. However, it appears to the Committee that this is not actually the issue at stake for its decision, but rather whether the Tribunal shifted the burden of proof related to due diligence.\n\n786.\n\nThe Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not shift the burden of proof in favor of InfraRed. The Tribunal concluded, rightly or wrongly, but well under its discretion, that any regulatory due diligence would not have the effects that Spain posited and that the decisions of the Spanish Supreme Court were not relevant for its decision.\n\n787.\n\nThe discretion of a Tribunal to assess the available evidence and to reach its conclusions related thereto is not an action to be made after a decision about which Party has, *rectius* should have, the burden of proof; quite the opposite. The rule of the burden of proof is a legal instrumental to avoid a *non liquet* decision. It is to be called if a court or tribunal was not able to reach a conclusion on a fact or its relevance.\n\n788.\n\nIt is clear to the Committee that the Tribunal was able to conclude, without resorting to that kind of *extrema ratio* solution, the relevance of the due diligence and therefore it did not need to apply the rule of burden of proof criterion, let alone to shift that burden.\n\n789.\n\nA similar situation occurs in relation to the arguments and conclusions of Brattle and Accuracy regarding evidence on damages and management costs.\n\n790.\n\nThis is a very common situation on issues of quantum. The Parties provided expert evidence of very qualified and independent experts, as is the case with Brattle and Accuracy. The experts provided reports and were cross-examined. They also worked together to prepare a Joint Model,909 and the Parties were allowed to file submissions related to that model.910\n\nAward, \u00b6517.\n\nAward, \u00b6603.\n\n791.\n\nAfter these very in-depth and detailed efforts by the Parties and their experts, the Tribunal reached its own conclusions, and in the process sided with one expert over the other,911 and even reached its own findings.\n\nThis occurred in the Award. See, for instance, InfraRed Rejoinder, \u00b6177.\n\n792.\n\nThis kind of conclusion is contained in the discretion of the Tribunal. For that outcome, the positions of the experts are scrutinized and the shifting of the burden of the proof is not actually at stake. The Tribunal was able to decide without resorting to the *ultima ratio* rule of the burden of proof. Instead, it decided under the \"positive\" rule of its learned opinion, after a contradictory evidentiary phase.\n\n793.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request as presented by the Applicant.\n\n*(3) The duty of impartiality*\n------------------------------\n\n794.\n\nSpain quotes the *ad hoc* committee in *Enron v. Argentina,* to state that a \"lack of impartiality can be a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention. Such lack of impartiality may be inferred from an arbitral decision that consistently and insistently makes findings in favour of one of the parties without corresponding factual support.\"912\n\nMemorial, \u00b6303.\n\n795.\n\nIn other parts of its submissions, reference is made to the alleged fact that if the reasonings of Spain \"were analyzed impartially,\"913 the Tribunal would have reached different conclusions.\n\nReply, \u00b6284 (\"si se analizan de manera imparcial los mismos\").\n\n796.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, InfraRed states that \"Spain has not adduced any evidence that proves a manifest lack of independence and impartiality on the part of the Tribunal.\"914\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6250.\n\n797.\n\nIn its Reply, Spain does not provide any evidence of the alleged lack of impartiality and the same occurred during the Hearing. This probably means that Spain made this allegation rhetorically to emphasize its disagreement with the Tribunal's findings rather than as an allegation of improper behavior by the Tribunal.\n\n798.\n\nIn any case, the Committee analyzed carefully this issue and did not find any evidence of lack of impartiality of the Tribunal, even when not alleged by Spain.\n\n799.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee dismisses this request, as if it had actually been presented by the Applicant.\n\n**VIII. COSTS OF THE PROCEEDING**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. SPAIN'S STATEMENT ON COSTS**\n---------------------------------\n\n800.\n\nSpain posits that \"[p]ursuant to Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 53, Article 61(2) and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) apply *mutatis mutandis* to annulment proceedings.\"915 As a consequence, the Committee has the power to decide on allocation of costs between the Parties.\n\nKingdom of Spain Submission on Costs, \u00b64.\n\n801.\n\nSpain argues that if the Committee annuls the Award, even if only partially, it is entitled to recover the incurred costs.916\n\nKingdom of Spain Submission on Costs, \u00b68.\n\n802.\n\nAs far as Spain's costs are concerned, they are the following:917\n\n(i) ICSID fees and Advance payments: EUR 590,197.36;\n\n(ii) Legal fees directly incurred by the Kingdom of Spain: EUR 597,769.87\n\n(iii)Expert Reports: EUR 57,656.50\n\n(iv) Translations: EUR 4,216.55\n\n(v) Other expenses: EUR 24,064.93\n\nKingdom of Spain Submission on Costs, \u00b621.\n\n803.\n\nTherefore, Spain requests that the Committee order Infrared to reimburse it a total of EUR 1,273,905.21.\n\n804.\n\nSpain also requests that \"the Infrared Parties be ordered to pay post-award interest on the foregoing sums, at a compound rate of interest to be determined by the Committee, until the date of full satisfaction of the Committee's decision.\"918\n\nKingdom of Spain Submission on Costs, \u00b623.\n\n**B. INFRARED'S STATEMENT ON COSTS**\n------------------------------------\n\n805.\n\nInfraRed posits that the Committee has discretion, under Convention Article 61(2) and Arbitration Rule 47(1), to allocate the costs of the proceeding.919\n\nInfraRed Submission on Costs, \u00b610.\n\n806.\n\nInfraRed assumes the rejection of Spain's Application and thereby Spain \"must: i) bear the full costs and expenses incurred by the *ad hoc* Committee and ICSID, and ii) reimburse InfraRed for its legal costs and expenses.\"920\n\nInfraRed Submission on Costs, \u00b611.\n\n807.\n\nInfraRed admits that \"the initial approach when deciding about costs in annulment proceedings was to opt for the equal sharing of costs between the parties,\" but states that \"such rule has been overcome by the well-established arbitral practice of applying the *costs follow the event* rule,\"921 and refers to recent decisions by committees to confirm that trend.922\n\nInfraRed Submission on Costs, \u00b612.\n\nInfraRed Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b612-16.\n\n808.\n\nTherefore, InfraRed requests the payment of the following:923\n\n(i) Attorney's fees: EUR 686,716.25\n\n(ii) Other expenses: EUR 8,877.49\n\nInfraRed Submission on Costs, \u00b6\u00b65-9.\n\n809.\n\nIn conclusion, InfraRed requests that the Committee order Spain to pay an amount of EUR 695,593.74.924\n\nInfraRed Submission on Costs, \u00b618.\n\n**C. THE COSTS OF THE PROCEEDING**\n----------------------------------\n\n810.\n\nThe costs of the annulment proceeding, including the Committee's fees and expenses, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, are as follows:\n\nCommittee Members' fees and expenses\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prof. Jos\u00e9-Miguel J\u00fadice | USD 172,968.75 |\n| Dr. Karim Hafez | USD 104,086.39 |\n| Prof. Yuejiao Zhang | USD 111,375.00 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | USD 126,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses925 | USD 83,929.57 |\n| **Total**: | **USD 598,359.71** |\n\nThis amount includes virtual meeting-related expenses, court reporting and translation services. But it does not include charges relating to courier services, printing and photocopying.\n\n**D. THE COMMITTEE'S DECISION ON COSTS**\n----------------------------------------\n\n811.\n\nThe Parties agree that the Committee is entitled to exercise its discretion under the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules when deciding on the issue of costs.\n\n812.\n\nSpain's Application for Annulment has been dismissed in its entirety. The Committee has also dismissed Spain's Stay Request.\n\n813.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Committee considers that it is appropriate that the costs follow the event, although not in their entirety as the Application for Annulment has not been frivolous and the issues at stake were relevant enough to justify it.\n\n814.\n\nExercising its discretion, the Committee decides unanimously that:\n\n(a) Spain shall bear its own legal costs and expenses;\n\n(b) Spain shall reimburse Infrared 50% of their legal fees in the amount of EUR 343,358.125;\n\n(c) InfraRed shall bear 50% of its legal fees and all of their other expenses;\n\n(d) If the payment of EUR 343,358.125 is not made by Spain within 60 days from the notification of the Decision, the amount payable is to be increased by interest on the outstanding amount until full payment at the rate of 2% compounded annually; and\n\n(e) Spain as the Applicant shall bear all of the costs of the proceeding, including the Committee's fees and expenses and the costs of ICSID.\n\n**IX. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n815.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Committee unanimously decides as follows:\n\n(i) The Application for Annulment of the Award is dismissed in its entirety;\n\n(ii) Spain shall reimburse InfraRed 50% of their legal fees in the amount of EUR 343,358.125;\n\n(iii) If the payment of EUR 343,358.125 is not made by Spain within 60 days from the notification of this Decision, the amount payable is to be increased by interest on the outstanding amount until full payment at the rate of 2% compounded annually; and\n\n(iv) Spain as the Applicant shall bear all of the costs of the proceeding, including the Committee's fees and expenses and the costs of ICSID.\n\n10 June 2022"}]}
