Background**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nIn its Request for Interim Measure1 of Protection Regarding Preservation of Evidence (\u2018Request\u2019), dated 21 August 2008, the Railroad Development Corporation (\u2018RDC\u2019 or the \u2018Claimant\u2019) requests the Tribunal to order an interim measure of protection mandating that Respondent preserve certain categories of documents while the arbitration proceedings are pending. These documents, according to the Request, are \u2018unquestionably relevant and material to RDC\u2019s ability to have its claims and requests for relief fairly considered and decided by the Tribunal.\u20192\n\nThe ICSID Convention uses the term \u2018provisional measures\u2019, CAFTA uses \u2018Interim measures.\u2019 Both terms are used In this decision without any attempt to distinguish between them.\n\nRequest, para. 1.\n\n2.\n\nAt the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, the Republic of Guatemala (\u2018Respondent\u2019 or \u2018Guatemala\u2019) replied to the Request on September 12, 2008 (\u2018Response\u2019). The Claimant and the Respondent had a further opportunity to exchange comments. A Reply was filed on September 26 (\u2018Reply\u2019) and a Rejoinder on October 3, 2008 (\u2018Rejoinder\u2019).\n\n**II. Positions of the Parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, on July 3, 2008, it requested the Respondent to preserve listed documents in the Respondent\u2019s possession, custody or control that the Claimant believed should be preserved while the arbitration proceedings are pending. On August 7, 2008, the Respondent informed the Claimant that the request was premature because there is under consideration of the Tribunal Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction, and that in any event it was too broad. The Claimant then requested the Respondent to identify the documents which it would be willing to preserve. The Respondent declined to identify them.\n\n4.\n\nThe Request classifies the documents to be preserved in the following four categories:\n\n\u2018a. Preservation Request No. 1 : All documents referring or relating to the Usufruct Agreements, including (but not limited to): (i) documents referring or relating to the bidding, negotiation, awarding, performance or breach of any or all of the Usufruct Agreements; the public bidding process initiated by the Government of Guatemala (\"GOG\") on February 17, 1997 (the \"RFP\"); (ii) documents referring or relating to RDC\u2019s bid submitted to the GOG in response to the RFP; (iii) documents referring or relating to the award of the 50-year usufructary right to rebuild and operate the Guatemalan rail system made on June 23, 1997 by FEGUA; (iv) documents referring or relating to any analysis or evaluation of the preceding by the GOG; (v) documents referring or relating to royalty payments by FVG to FEGUA and the use of same by FEGUA; (vi) documents referring or relating to GOG\u2019s and/or FEGUA\u2019s compliance, efforts to comply and/or failure to comply with its or their obligations under the Usufruct Agreements; and/or (vii) documents referring or relating to the high level railroad commission that was established at the instruction of President Berger purportedly to support FVG\u2019s railroad operations, as described in paragraph 38 of RDC\u2019s Arbitration Request.\n\nb. Preservation Request No. 2 : All documents referring or relating to Government Resolution 433-2006, published in the Guatemala Official Gazette on August 25, 2006 (the \"Lesivo Resolution\") as described in paragraph 39 of RDC\u2019s Arbitration Request, including (but not limited to): (i) documents referring or relating to FEGUA\u2019s January 13, 2006 legal opinion (Opinion No. 05-2006) described in paragraph 37 of RDC\u2019s Arbitration Request; (ii) documents referring or relating to the March 7, 2006 meeting among RDC, FEGUA and the GOG described in paragraph 38 of RDC\u2019s Arbitration Request; (iii) documents referring or relating to FEGUA\u2019s request to the Attorney General of Guatemala on or about June 22, 2005, to investigate the circumstances surrounding the award of the Usufruct to RDC and/or to issue an opinion on the validity of Deed 143 (as amended by Deed 158) as described in paragraph 35 of RDC\u2019s Arbitration Request; (iv) and/or documents referring or relating to the issuance of the Attorney General\u2019s lesion opinion dated August 1, 2005 (Opinion No. 205-2005) as described in paragraph 36 of RDC\u2019s Arbitration Request.\n\nc. Preservation Request No. 3 : All documents referring or relating to third party interest in assuming or acquiring an interest in the Usufructs subsequent to their award to RDC, including (but not limited to): (i) documents referring or relating to the potential redistribution of the benefits of the Usufruct Agreements to the Guatemalan sugar, electricity or telecommunications industry sectors or the private sector companies and business representatives thereof; (ii) documents referring or relating to the sugar industry's interest in the use of the railroad; (iii) documents referring or relating to meetings between the GOG, its officials and Ram\u00f3n Campollo, H\u00e9ctor Pinto or other representatives of or persons related to the sugar industry; (iv) documents referring or relating to Ciudad Del Sur and/or the Empresa El\u00e9ctrica of Guatemala's (EEGSA) interest in the right of way and/or easement rights to distribute electricity; and (v) Presidential or Vice Presidential calendars or other records by their offices that indicate meetings with the above industry sectors, industry representatives or individuals.\n\nd. Preservation Request No. 4 : All declarations of lesivo by GOG since January 1, 1996 and the related judicial file.\u20193\n\nSince they have figured prominently in the exchanges between the parties, it will be useful to reproduce here the Claimant\u2019s definitions of \u2018documents\u2019, \u2018communications\u2019 and \u2018relating to\u2019:\n\n\u2018 \"Documents\" means each and every form of communication and each and every written, recorded or graphic matter of any kind, type, nature, or description that is or has been in the Republic of Guatemala's possession, custody, or control, including, but not limited to, all printed and electronic copies of emails, notes, correspondence, memoranda, work papers, calendars, registries of entrance to public or private offices/buildings, tapes, stenographic or handwritten notes, written forms of any kind, charts, blueprints, drawings, sketches, graphs, plans, articles, specifications, diaries, letters, telegrams, photographs, minutes, contracts, agreements, reports, surveys, computer printouts, data compilations of any kind, teletypes, telexes, facsimiles, invoices, order forms, checks, drafts, statements, credit memos, reports, summaries, books, ledgers, notebooks, schedules, transparencies, recordings, catalogs, advertisements, promotional materials, films, video tapes, audio tapes, brochures, pamphlets, spreadsheets, or any written or recorded materials of any other kind, however stored (whether in tangible or electronic form), recorded, produced, or reproduced, and also including, but not limited to, drafts or copies of any of the foregoing that contain any notes, comments, or markings of any kind not found on the original documents or that are otherwise not identical to the original documents.\n\n\"Communications\" means any oral or written (including e-mail) communication or transmission of words or ideas between anyone.\n\n\"Relating to\" means constituting, defining, containing, embodying, reflecting, identifying, analyzing, stating, concerning, substantiating, supporting, referring to, conflicting with, dealing with, generated wholly or partly in response to or because of, or in any way pertaining to.\u20194\n\nRequest, para. 12.\n\nExhibit C-1 to the Request.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Tribunal is empowered to order the preservation of evidence as an *interim measure* of protection to preserve the rights of a party under Article 10.20.8 of CAFTA, Article 47 of the ICSID Convention, and Arbitration Rule 39(1) of ICSID. The Claimant adduces ICSID jurisprudence showing that arbitral tribunals have ordered interim measures when the requesting party has shown the need and urgency to avoid irreparable harm to a party\u2019s rights. The Claimant explains that the degree of urgency required \u2018depends upon the circumstances and may be satisfied where a party can show that there will be a need to obtain the documents at some point in the proceedings before the issuance of the award.\u20195\n\nRequest, para. 17.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant specifies the reasons for each of the preservation requests. In substance, the Claimant argues that the documents are: (i) needed to understand the bidding, award, formation and performance of the contracts that comprise the Claimant\u2019s investment, and the Respondent\u2019s knowledge of the destructive effect that the Lesivo Resolution would have on the Claimant\u2019s investment, (ii) relevant to the Claimant\u2019s contention that the intent of the Respondent when it issued the Lesivo Resolution was to redistribute RDC\u2019s usufruct rights to Guatemalan private sector companies without paying compensation, and (iii) relevant to RDC\u2019s claim that the Lesivo Resolution and the law on lesivo do not meet the minimum standard of treatment under international law.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimant justifies the need and urgency on the basis of a recent change of government in Guatemala, the fact that the proceedings on the merits have been suspended while the objection to jurisdiction is under the Tribunal\u2019s consideration, and the fact that, in case the objection is sustained, the Responded has indicated that it would not object if the Tribunal would allow an opportunity to cure the jurisdictional defect and, therefore, \u2018there is little chance that these documents will not be the subject of document production requests in the near future.\u20196 Furthermore, the fact that the Respondent has not recognized the obvious need to preserve the evidence \u2018or to make an offer to assist in that regard only underscores the \"urgency\" of an evidence preservation order from this Tribunal.\u20197\n\nIb\u00edd. para. 25(c)\n\nIb\u00edd. para. 27.\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the level of urgency required depends upon the measure requested: the more intrusive the measure requested, the greater the degree of urgency required. The Claimant considers that what its request involves is \u2018largely a ministerial task that can hardly be deemed intrusive or burdensome.\u20198\n\nIb\u00edd. para. 26.\n\n9.\n\nIn the Response, the Respondent first corrects certain affirmations of the Claimant which the Respondent considers erroneous and reserves its right to further dispute any characterization of fact or law in the Request. The Respondent then explains that, when it first received the request of the Claimant to preserve documentation, it invited the Claimant to reformulate the request because of its breadth. The Claimant dismissed the offer and took the position that the Republic was free to reformulate Claimant\u2019s own request for the Claimant to consider. The Respondent declined to do so.\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent further explains that it is not its position that it would have no objection to the Tribunal permitting the Claimant to cure its defective waiver pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.18, but it \u2018acknowledged that the Tribunal might, for efficiency purposes, seek to grant the Claimant an opportunity to cure its defective waiver.\u20199 If the Tribunal would choose such option, the Respondent confirms that it has not waived any further objections it may have.\n\nResponse, para. 7\n\n11.\n\nThe Respondent also observes that the Claimant seems to understand incorrectly that the current jurisdictional objection is the totality of the jurisdictional phase. The Respondent explains that the current jurisdictional objection has been submitted under the special mechanism provided in Article 10.20.5 of CAFTA and reserves its right to raise any other objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction at the appropriate time as permitted under the ICSID Convention and CAFTA.\n\n12.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s view that the Claimant has failed to establish that protection is urgently required, and that there is a right to be protected. The Respondent recalls that provisional measures under the ICSID Convention are intended to be used only in situations of absolute necessity. The Respondent argues that a change of government is not *per se* evidence of any potential threat to documents; that, if it would be sufficient to demonstrate a need that potentially relevant evidence not be lost or destroyed, preservation orders would always be needed; and that the intention to request documents in the future does not demonstrate a need for protection.\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent characterizes the Request as a US-style pre-trial discovery \u2018fishing expedition\u2019 which has no place in international arbitration. The request for preservation should be tailored to issues relevant to the determination of the merits of the case and there must be a reasonable belief that the documents exist by specifying the presumed author or recipient, the date or time frame of the document and the presumed content.\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it did not consent to broad common-law-style discovery by becoming party to CAFTA or the ICSID Convention anymore than did other civil law countries. The Respondent points out that the request includes four broad categories of documents starting with the words \u2018All documents referring or relating to\u2019 or \u2018All declarations\u2019 and they include sixteen broad document sub-categories. According to the Respondent, the expansive nature of the Request becomes overbearing when added to the definitions of the terms \u2018documents\u2019, \u2018communications\u2019 and \u2018relating to\u2019.\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that the Claimant\u2019s right is only to those documents which can reasonably be produced. The Respondent considers that the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration (\u2018IBA Rules\u2019) are a useful guide to evaluate the Request and considers the Request under their requirements. Under the IBA Rules the Request would qualify as imposing an unreasonable burden because compliance would require significant resources and innumerable persons. The documents lack sufficient relevance or materiality by the simple fact that the great number of documents that fall in the broad categories of the Request cannot be relevant. The Request violates \u2018considerations of fairness and equality of the Parties\u2019 because it asks the Respondent to identify all possibly relevant evidence and much evidence that is not relevant. Effectively the burden of identifying evidence would be shifted unfairly to the Respondent.\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent distinguishes the provisional measures order in the case of *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) v. United Republic of Tanzania (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22),* on which the Claimant has significantly relied in its presentation. The Claimant observes that in that case the parties to the dispute were common law parties; nonetheless the tribunal recognized the overly broad and potentially burdensome nature of the original request and circumscribed it to clearly identified documents.\n\n17.\n\nIn its Reply to the Response, dated September 26, 2008, the Claimant emphasizes that Article 10.20.8 of CAFTA, as compared to ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1), identifies evidence preservation as a specific right to be protected. In this respect, the Claimant recalls that, as provided in Article 10.16.5 of CAFTA, the ICSID Arbitration Rules govern this arbitration unless modified by CAFTA.\n\n18.\n\nAs to the need and urgency of the request, the Claimant points out that there are precedents in Guatemala of theft, looting and destruction of government property and documents in connection with a change of government. The Claimant submits press reports in support of its allegations related to the changes in government of 2004 and 2008. The Claimant reasons that since its \u2018preservation requests will likely be the subject of RDC document requests once the Republic\u2019s jurisdiction objection is resolved, it is, as a matter of logic, *necessary* that these documents be preserved in the interim.\u201910\n\nReply, para. 12.\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimant agrees with the Respondent that broad US-style discovery is not the norm in international arbitration and that the extent of the discovery is entirely within the discretion and control of the Tribunal. The Claimant disputes that its requests for document preservation would go beyond the normal limits of permissible discovery in ICSID proceedings. The Claimant observes that the ICSID Convention and CAFTA place few limits on the Tribunal\u2019s power to recommend any provisional measures and the Tribunal may at its own initiative recommend a provisional measure or make a recommendation that is different from what was requested.\n\n20.\n\nThe Claimant points out that the IBA Rules on which the Respondent extensively relies are related to the production of evidence and not to its preservation. In any case, it is the view of the Claimant that the Request meets the requirements of the IBA Rules. The Claimant affirms that the Request is confined to specific categories of documents purposely broken down into sub-categories to enable the Respondent to identify the precise documents to be preserved, and confirms that the documents to be preserved are only those currently in the Republic\u2019s possession, custody or control and not those In the public domain or already in RDC\u2019s possession.\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimant re-affirms the \u2018extremely limited\u2019 nature of RDC\u2019s request, and therefore that it is not unduly burdensome. It only requires from the Respondent that \u2018it order that the requested relevant documents be preserved and take reasonable steps to communicate and effectuate such order to relevant government entities and officials.\u201911\n\nIb\u00edd. para. 25\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the expectations of the Respondent regarding the conduct of discovery are irrelevant since it signed a treaty where the special importance of evidence preservation is recognized and, in any case, the expectations from a party haling from a common law country are equally deserving of respect. The Claimant argues that a denial of an order of preservation in light of the historical chaos when governments change in Guatemala and constant changes in the current administration of the Respondent would send the message that preserving records in the face of alleged substantial treaty violations is not required in international arbitration.\n\n23.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, dated October 3, 2008, the Respondent re-asserts that the Request be dismissed. The Respondent points out that the evidence submitted with the Reply concerns mostly the 2004 government transition, only one newspaper report concerns the disorderly state of government offices when President Colom took office in January 2008. The Respondent argues that \u2018the state of affairs at the initiation of the Colom administration\u2014or that of past Presidents, for that matter\u2014has nothing to do with the management of information during times other than transitions from one party to another, and no inference should be drawn that President Colom or any of his cabinet members has or will engage in behavior that would result in the loss or destruction of evidence.\u201912 The Respondent reaches the conclusion that the evidence submitted by the Claimant is historical and irrelevant and that the Claimant has not provided evidence to suggest that \u2018it will be denied access to any reasonably tailored set of documents to which the Tribunal might grant discovery.\u201913\n\nRejoinder, para. 8.\n\nIb\u00edd. para. 11.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent confirms its view that the Request is excessive and argues that the Claimant misunderstands the import of arbitration with a sovereign under ICSID and CAFTA. The Tribunal, contrary to what Claimant seems to believe, has not an unlimited power to grant provisional measures. The power of the Tribunal is bounded by \u2018the precise scope of the consent given by the State in the ICSID Convention as well as in any relevant treaty. The Republic\u2019s relevant expectations and understanding of this consent at the time of signing these treaties is thus essential for any determination by this Tribunal regarding the exercise of its power.\u201914\n\nIb\u00edd. para. 14.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes once more that the definition of \u2018documents\u2019 in the Request is so broad as to be incongruous; it encompasses sixty different types of materials without limitation of time in three of the four categories of documents and in the fourth the time limitation spans twelve years. This broad scope of time and type of documents places an undue burden on the resources that Respondent would have to dedicate to comply with the order requested. The Respondent gives as an example of the burden the fact that it would have to try to identify and locate documents spanning five administrations from five different political parties.\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent concludes by requesting the Tribunal to deny the Request.\n\n**III. Considerations of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nIt will be convenient to reproduce here the provisions of CAFTA, the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules setting forth the power of the Tribunal to recommend provisional measures:\n\n28.\n\nArticle 10.20.8 of CAFTA provides in relevant part:\n\n\u2018A tribunal may order an interim measure of protection to preserve the rights of a disputing party, or to ensure that the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is made fully effective, including an order to preserve evidence in the possession or control of a disputing party or to protect the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\u2019\n\n29.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention states:\n\n\u2018Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\u2019\n\n30.\n\nRule 39 of the Arbitration Rules reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\u2018(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(...)\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\u2019\n\n31.\n\nThere is no question between the parties that the Tribunal has the power to grant provisional measures under the ICSID Convention and CAFTA. Articles 47 and 10.20.8 of the ICSID Convention and CAFTA, respectively, could not be more explicit in this respect. Nonetheless, in its Response the Respondent argued that the Request was premature because the proceeding is still at its jurisdictional phase. Both treaties governing this arbitration are clear in stating that the power of the Tribunal to grant provisional measures is not limited to any particular phase of a proceeding. Article 47 of the ICSID Convention provides for the power to recommend any provisional measures without reference to any particular phase of the proceeding. Rule 39(1) is more specific in stating that such power may be exercised \u2018At any time after the institution of the proceeding...\u2019 Art. 10.20.8 of CAFTA provides, *inter alia,* that a tribunal may order an interim measure \u2018to ensure that the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is made fully effective.\u2019 Therefore, if the circumstances that require the measures are present, in the view of the Tribunal the phase of the proceedings in which the request is formulated is not relevant.\n\n32.\n\nIn its arguments, the Claimant has relied substantially on the precedent of the provisional measures ordered by the tribunal in the ICSID case of *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania* and the Respondent on the IBA Rules. The Claimant has observed that the IBA Rules are not applicable in this arbitration and are not relevant since they concern the production rather than the preservation of evidence, while the Respondent has attacked the relevance of the *Biwater* precedent. *Biwater* is one of many examples of provisional measures requests in ICSID arbitral practice, which tend to be case-specific. The IBA Rules are used widely by international arbitral tribunals as a guide even when not binding upon them. Precedents and informal documents, such as the IBA Rules, reflect the experience of recognized professionals in the field and draw their strength from their intrinsic merit and persuasive value rather than from their binding character.\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, in the instant case, it does not need the guidance of the IBA Rules to appreciate that the categories of documents requested and reproduced above are excessively broad and their relevance difficult to assess. The breadth of the Request is particularly compounded by the definition of the terms \u2018documents\u2019, \u2018communications\u2019 and \u2018relating to\u2019 which have also been reproduced. As broken down by the Respondent, the term \u2018documents\u2019 includes sixty types of documents, in most cases without time limits. The Tribunal is doubtful that such all-encompassing requests, if recommended, can realistically be put in practice. In this respect, the Tribunal fails to see how the measures requested would suppose a merely \u2018ministerial task\u2019 for the government. Compliance with the Request would not entail simply a communication from a Minister to those in the administration who are the actual holders of the documents to be preserved. The documents would need to be identified by an undetermined number of government officials across the administration.\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to the question of whether the circumstances which would justify provisional measures exist. Article 47 of the ICSID Convention does not specify any particular circumstances and neither does Article 10.20.8 of CAFTA. The parties have discussed the circumstances in terms of need and urgency of the measures requested. They disagree on whether the need and the urgency that would justify the provisional measures are present and on the standard to be applied by the Tribunal. As to the standard, the Respondent has argued, quoting Professor Schreuer, that provisional measures would only be used in \u2018situations of absolute necessity and that tribunals would exercise self-restraint in their application\u2019. The Tribunal observes that this quote refers to the history of the preparation of the ICSID Convention and, as reported by Professor Schreuer in the same paragraph, a proposal to include in Article 47 \u2018a reference to urgency and imminent danger\u2019 was defeated.15 The conclusion of Professor Schreuer is that \u2018provisional measures will only be appropriate where a question cannot wait the outcome of the award on the merits.\u201916 This seems a reasonable conclusion but it does not imply that the necessity must be \u2018absolute\u2019 or that the Tribunal not act unless such a high threshold of necessity exists. Since no qualifications to the power of an ICSID tribunal to recommend provisional measures found their way in the text of the ICSID Convention, the standard to be applied is one of reasonableness, after consideration of all the circumstances of the request and after taking into account the rights to be protected and their susceptibility to irreversible damage should the tribunal fail to issue a recommendation. Based on this standard and as explained below, the Claimant has not shown that circumstances exist which would justify a recommendation of provisional measures.\n\nExhibit R-5, para. 14.\n\nIbid.\n\n35.\n\nTo prove the need and urgency of the provisional measures, the Claimant relies on destruction or loss of documentation during the 2004 and 2008 changes of administration in Guatemala and the frequent changes in high positions in the administration of President Colom. As evidence, the Claimant has presented mainly news reports which refer to document destruction in 2004. As regards the change of government in 2008, the evidence presented refers to the disorder found in government offices when the new administration took over. No evidence has been presented that during the course of 2008 documents have been destroyed or lost by the current government of Guatemala or that the destruction of relevant documents is imminent because of the existence of this arbitration. A change of government in the normal course of constitutional transfer of power from one administration to another does not justify the recommendation of provisional measures for preservation of documents. In any case, the next change of government In Guatemala would not take place until January 2012.\n\n36.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal concludes that the Request would place an unfair burden on the Government because of its excessive breadth and that no need or urgency has been proven to justify the recommendation. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal is mindful that the Respondent has affirmed in the Rejoinder that Claimant has not provided evidence to suggest that it will be denied access to any reasonably tailored set of documents to which the Tribunal might grant discovery, and it is also mindful of the statement of the Respondent that \u2018no inference should be drawn that President Colom or any of his cabinet members has or will engage in behavior that would result in the loss or destruction of evidence.\u201917\n\nRejoinder, para. 8.\n\n**IV. Decision**\n----------------\n\nFor all the above reasons the Tribunal,\n\n1. Affirms its power to recommend provisional measures at any stage of the proceeding.\n\n2. Denies the request of provisional measures of the Claimant."}, {"Title": "Decision on Objection to Jurisdiction CAFTA Article 10.20.5", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2008-11-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Objection to Jurisdiction CAFTA Article 10.20.5\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Under CAFTA Article 10.20.51**\n\nReferences to articles are references to CAFTA articles unless otherwise stated.\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn June 14, 2007, the Railroad Development Corporation (\u2018RDC' or \u2018Claimant') filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\u2018ICSID') a Request for the Institution of Arbitration Proceedings against the Republic of Guatemala (\u2018Respondent', \u2018Guatemala' or \u2018the Republic') under Articles 10.16 and 10.17 of the Dominican Republic -Central America - United States of America Free Trade Agreement (\u2018CAFTA')2 on its own behalf and on behalf of its Compa\u00f1\u00eda Desarrolladora Ferroviaria, S.A., which does business as Ferrov\u00edas Guatemala (\u2018FVG'), a Guatemalan company majority-owned and controlled by RDC (the \u2018Arbitration Request'). RDC owns eighty two per cent (82%) of the shares of FVG and eighteen percent (18%) is divided among sixty-five Guatemalan investors.\n\nCAFTA became effective between the Republic of Guatemala and the United States of America on July 1, 2006.\n\n2.\n\nICSID registered the Arbitration Request on August 20, 2007. The Claimant appointed the Honorable Stuart E. Eizenstat and the Respondent Professor James Crawford. The parties failed to agree on the Chairman of the Arbitral Tribunal. The Acting Secretary-General of ICSID, after consulting with the parties, appointed Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda on April 8, 2008. Thus the Tribunal was constituted on April 14, 2008.\n\n3.\n\nOn May 29, 2008, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal consider, under Article 10.20.5 and on an expedited basis, an objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal based on the Claimant's failure to comply with the requirements of Article 10.28.2(b) (\u2018Objection to Jurisdiction'), and suspend the proceedings, as required by Article 10.20.5. The Respondent also requested the suspension of the first meeting of the Tribunal scheduled to take place on June 13, 2008.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal suspended the proceeding on the merits as required by Article 10.20.5 but maintained the scheduled first session. During that meeting the parties agreed to a timetable for submission of a CounterMemorial, a Reply and a Rejoinder in respect of the Objection to Jurisdiction.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (\u2018CounterMemorial') on July 11, 2008. The Respondent filed its Reply on August 11, 2008 (\u2018Reply') and the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on September 11, 2008 (\u2018Rejoinder'). All three memorials were filed within the deadlines agreed at the first session.\n\n**II. THE ARBITRATION REQUEST**\n-------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nRDC is a privately-owned railway investment and management company which in 1997 won, through international public bidding, the use of the infrastructure and other rail assets to provide railway services in Guatemala (the \u2018Usufruct'). Only two bids were submitted and RDC's bid was the only one considered responsive by the Respondent. RDC's bid consisted of a staged plan to rebuild the rail system, which had been closed since March 1996, with an investment program of about ten million U.S. dollars. The Usufruct awarded RDC consisted of a 50-year usufruct right to rebuild and operate the Guatemalan rail system. On November 25, 1997, FVG signed the Usufruct Contract of Right of Way (the \u2018Usufruct Contract') with Ferrocarriles de Guatemala (\u2018FEGUA'), a state-owned company established in 1969 and responsible for providing certain railway transport services and managing the rail personal property and real estate assets. The Usufruct and the Usufruct Contract were ratified by the Congress of Guatemala by Decree 27-98, published in the Official Gazette on April 23, 1998.\n\n7.\n\nThe Usufruct covers a 497-mile (narrow gauge) railroad and includes the right to develop alternative uses for the right of way, such as pipelines, electric transmission, fiber optics and commercial and institutional development. In return for the right-of-way Usufruct, RDC (through FVG) agreed to make certain payments to FEGUA.\n\n8.\n\nThe Usufruct Contract was documented by Deed Number 402 (\u2018Deed 402') and came into force on May 23, 1998. In addition, the Usufruct consisted of: (a) a Usufruct Contract of Rail Equipment, Property of FEGUA and documented by Deed Number 41, dated March 23, 1999, and subsequently replaced by Deed 143, dated August 28, 2003 (\u2018Deed 143'), and further amended by Deed 158, dated October 7, 2003 (\u2018Deed 158'); and (b) a Trust Fund Agreement for the Rehabilitation and Modernization of the railroad system documented by Deed 820, dated December 30, 1999 (\u2018Deed 820'). (The Usufruct Contract, Deed 143, Deed 158 and Deed 820 are collectively referred to as the \u2018Usufruct Contracts'.)\n\n9.\n\nFVG resumed commercial service between El Chile and Guatemala City on April 15, 1999. In December 1999, commercial service was restored between Guatemala City and the Atlantic ports of Puerto Barrios and Puerto Santo Tom\u00e1s. Tonnage traffic gradually increased until 2005 but declined in 2006.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 26, 2005, FVG initiated two domestic arbitration cases against FEGUA for breach of contract. The Claimant alleged that Guatemala through FEGUA failed to remove squatters from the rail right of way and to make payments to the Trust Fund. The Claimant further alleged that, in anticipation of FGV's filings, FEGUA requested the Attorney General to investigate the circumstances surrounding the award of the Usufruct and to issue an opinion on the validity of Deed 143 and Deed 158. The Attorney General issued Opinion No. 205-2005 on August 1, 2005 (the \u2018Lesivo Opinion'), and recommended that Guatemala declare Deeds 143/158 void as not in the interest of the country. As translated by the Claimant, the Lesivo Opinion stated:\n\n\u2018Lesion was caused in this case because there is a violation to the rules and procedures that should have been applied in order to execute the agreement in due form and with legal validity. The relevant contract breaks the Government Contracting Law and other laws that govern the process to grant FEGUA's property in usufruct.\n\nThere is pecuniary lesion by executing an Onerous Usufruct Contract to grant the State's property in usufruct to be exploited by a private entity, in exchange of one point twenty-five percent (1.25%) of the gross income as a result of rendering transportation services.'3\n\nArbitration Request, para. 36.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimant affirms that there is no basis in fact or law for this opinion. On January 13, 2006, FEGUA issued Opinion 05-2006 in agreement with the Attorney General's opinion, arguing that the Usufruct Contracts were not awarded as a result of a public bid.\n\n12.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Claimant and FVG made numerous attempts to reach an understanding with FEGUA and met with the President of the Republic, Mr. Oscar Berger, on March 7, 2006. According to the Claimant, the President instructed that FEGUA be dissolved and a high level commission be established to work with RDC and FVG on governmental support of FGV railroad operations and to address issues of public, private and commercial squatters, vandalism and theft which plagued the operations. This commission was established and a number of meetings took place, but after about three months the meetings were suspended. It is the contention of the Claimant that, in parallel, the Government was preparing a resolution to declare the usufruct of the rolling stock injurious to the interests of the State. Such a resolution (the \u2018Lesivo Resolution') was adopted by the Government on August 11, 2006 and published on August 25, 2006.\n\n13.\n\nIt is the Claimant's case that the Lesivo Resolution had the following objectives: to force FVG to withdraw from the arbitration processes in which FVG has charged FEGUA with breach of contract, to appropriate FVG's rolling stock without payment of compensation, and to redistribute to Guatemalan private sector companies the benefits of the Usufruct.\n\n14.\n\nOn November 14, 2006, the Government of Guatemala filed a claim against FVG in the *Sala Primera de lo Contencioso* (the Guatemalan Administrative Court) seeking the court's confirmation of the Lesivo Resolution, an order seizing the rolling stock, and an order denying the FVG general manager the right to travel outside the country. The claim was served on FVG on May 15, 2007. FVG filed its initial objections on May 21, 2007. Consistent with CAFTA Article 10.18.3, FVG intends to defend this action to preserve its contractual rights under Deed 143/158 while this arbitration is pending and does not seek monetary compensation.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimant affirms that the Lesivo Resolution had a devastating impact on its investment. According to the Claimant, since the Lesivo Resolution was issued, the Republic has made successive decisions not to pay into the Trust Fund and not to remove the squatters from the railway right of way. According to the Claimant, these decisions are bound up with the Lesivo Resolution. Furthermore, the Claimant alleges that the Lesivo Resolution was an \u2018all clear signal to poorer Guatemalan citizens to seize land and personal property from FVG with impunity as the Government would not provide protection.'4\n\nArbitration Request, para. 48.\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the Respondent has blocked FVG's attempts to use the courts to enforce its Usufruct rights through the following actions:\n\n- On September 27, 2005, FEGUA filed with the Guatemalan Court of Arbitration a motion to dismiss the case alleging lack of jurisdiction. On December 8, 2005, the Arbitration Court denied FEGUA's motion.\n\n- On January 3, 2006, FEGUA filed a motion to declare Article 103 of the Public Agreement Act unconstitutional because it provides for arbitration in public contracts. So far no hearing has been held on this motion.\n\n- On January 5, 2006, FEGUA filed a lawsuit with the First Circuit of the Administrative Court seeking to annul the Usufruct Contracts and the arbitration clause. The Administrative Court has ruled that the arbitration clause is valid and that the arbitration should continue. According to the Claimant, the Respondent has engaged in delaying tactics that have prevented the judicial order in support of the arbitration clause from entering into effect.\n\n17.\n\nIn the present proceedings, RDC seeks the following relief:\n\n(a) Damages arising from measures of Guatemala inconsistent with its obligations under Chapter 10 of CAFTA, including losses involving RDC's common and preferred shares in FVG, un-repaid advances by RDC to FGV, allocated or to-be-allocated overhead of RDC, the reasonably expected income stream from its investment over the life of the fifty (50) year Usufruct and the risk-adjusted cost of capital applicable to that investment, totaling no less than US $65,000,000.\n\n(b) Costs of these proceedings.\n\n(c) Fees and expenses incurred to oppose the promulgation of the Lesivo Resolution and other measures infringing Chapter 10 of CAFTA.\n\n(d) Pre-award and post-award interest at a rate to be fixed by the Tribunal.\n\n(e) Compensation equal to any tax consequences of the award.\n\n(f) Such further relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate.\n\n**III. THE OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION**\n--------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nIn its challenge to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, Guatemala argues that the waiver submitted by the Claimant under Article 10.18.2(b) is insufficient because:\n\n(a) The Claimant purports to submit a waiver on its own behalf and on behalf of FVG; but the Claimant is not a party in the arbitration proceedings of FVG against Guatemala and it has not shown that it has the authority to waive the rights of FVG to pursue the local arbitration. Therefore, the waiver is invalid.\n\n(b) The Claimant explicitly repudiates the waiver when it reserves its own right and the right of FVG to pursue local remedies required by the Tribunal in order for RDC to avoid the contention by Guatemala that RDC has failed to exhaust local remedies.\n\n(c) The Claimant has not taken the necessary action to give effect to the waiver. The Claimant, through FVG, has initiated and maintained two arbitrations in Guatemala against FEGUA. Both of them involve the same issues raised in this arbitral proceeding and challenge the same measures that are the subject of the Claimant's claim under Article 10.16. These arbitrations are pending and the Claimant has not filed any request to desist or dismiss those proceedings.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Article 10.18.2 is modeled after Article 1121 of NAFTA and that for a claimant to waive effectively its claims it is not enough for the claimant to simply state in writing that it is waiving its claims before the arbitral tribunal; it must actually act in accordance with that waiver.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent reserves \u2018its right to present any other jurisdictional objections, if necessary, at a subsequent point in the proceedings.'5\n\nArbitration Request, p. 3.\n\n**IV. THE COUNTER-MEMORIAL**\n----------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimant recalls that, under Article 10.18.2(b), Claimant is required to provide a waiver on its own behalf and on behalf of FVG and, in turn, FVG is required to provide a waiver on its own behalf; it confirms the validity of both waivers submitted with the Arbitration Request. In its words, \u2018there is no \"hole\" in this interlocking system of waivers whereby either RDC or FVG have retained any rights in connection with CAFTA Article 10.18.2(b).'6 As to the Claimant's authority to waive the rights of FVG questioned by the Respondent, the Claimant refers to Exhibit 7 of the Arbitration Request which evidences RDC's direct ownership and control of FVG.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 12.\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimant disputes that the language of the waiver contradicts its purpose by reserving the right to pursue local remedies that might be required by the ICSID panel. The Claimant points out that Article 10.18.2(b) of CAFTA and Article 1121 of NAFTA differ in \u2018some potentially important respects.'7 Article 1121 of NAFTA uses the terms \u2018conditions precedent' to submission of a claim, and uses the phrase \u2018only if'. None of these terms appears in the CAFTA waiver provision. Furthermore, the reasoning of the NAFTA Tribunal in *Waste Management I*8 is not applicable to the reservation in RDC's waiver. The Claimant justifies the reservation included in the waiver on the Respondent's notification made to ICSID requiring exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under the ICSID Convention. While the Claimant considers that Guatemala waived such right to require exhaustion of local remedies when it consented to arbitration under CAFTA Article 10.17, the Claimant explains that it does not wish to find itself in a situation \u2018whereby the Tribunal might deny access to ICSID arbitration until the Claimant had exhausted local remedies and the Republic might deny access to local proceedings based on the waiver that accompanied the Claimant's arbitration request.'9 In this respect, the Claimant refers to the Respondent's letter to the Secretary-General of ICSID of July 5, 2007 where such argument is developed, and notes that the Respondent has not pursued it in the Objection to Jurisdiction. The Claimant also points out that, in *Waste Management II*, the tribunal showed awareness of such situation and cautioned:\n\n\u2018An investor in the position of the Claimant [Waste Management], who had eventually waived any possibility of a local remedy in respect of the measure in question but found that there was no jurisdiction to consider its claim at the international level either, might be forgiven for doubting the effectiveness of the international procedures. The Claimant has not had its NAFTA claim heard on the merits before any tribunal, national or international; and if the Respondent is right, that situation is now irrevocable. *Such a situation should be avoided if possible*.'10\n\nIbid., para. 17.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, Award of June 2, 2000, 5 ICSID Reports 443.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 20.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States (No. 2)*, Decision on Mexico's Preliminary Objection, 26 June 2002, 6 ICSID Reports 538, 558 (para. 35), quoted in the Arbitration Request, para. 22 (emphasis added by the Claimant).\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimant further refers to Waste Management I and the fact that the tribunal in that case did not require that the waiver had to be in any particular form or language but be \u2018clear, explicit and categorical.'11 According to the Claimant, there is nothing ambiguous in its waiver and RDC's reservation has no negative effect on the substance of its waiver. The Claimant further submits that such reservation has no meaning unless it is triggered by the Tribunal.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, Award of June 2, 2000, 5 ICSID Reports 443. 454 (para. 18).\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant then addresses the issue of whether the measures involved in the domestic arbitrations are the same as those involved in this arbitration. The Claimant explains that the measures at issue in the domestic arbitrations are actually contract breaches under Deed 402 and Deed 820. On the other hand, the measure at issue in this proceeding is the Lesivo Resolution. The Claimant further observes that CAFTA permits claims based on breaches of investment agreements but the contracts at issue in the domestic arbitrations do not qualify as investment agreements under CAFTA because they predate CAFTA's entry into force between the U.S. and Guatemala. The Claimant notes that this is the reason why no claim for breach of contract has been filed in this arbitration and it has continued to pursue the local arbitrations.\n\n25.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Lesivo Resolution is a measure within the meaning attributed to this term in CAFTA Article 2.1, and there is no overlap between this measure and the actions of the Government under consideration in the domestic arbitrations. Therefore, the Claimant does not need to take action to effectuate the waiver under the applicable local rules. Furthermore, it is the Claimant's contention that the burden of proof on the validity of the waiver falls on the Respondent and no proof has been presented by the Respondent. In fact, the Respondent has not identified the measures at issue; it has simply asserted that they are the same.\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimant adds that, even if the Tribunal would accept the Respondent's position, the next logical question for the Tribunal would be the impact of such determination on this proceeding. The Claimant argues that the terms used in NAFTA and CAFTA are different. The tribunal in *Waste Management I* reached its decision that the claimant could not remedy the waiver on the basis of its interpretation of the condition in Article 1121: \u2018A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1116 only if...\u2019 The Claimant points out that in *Methanex,* the U.S. allowed the waiver to be corrected in the interest of efficiency, and requested the tribunal to issue an order that the arbitration would be deemed to have commenced on submission of the effective waivers.12\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America, First Partial Award*, (2002) 7 ICSID Reports 208, 257-258 (para. 93).\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimant observes that the wording of NAFTA has not been reproduced in CAFTA, in any of the more recent FTAs concluded by the U.S. or in the 2004 U.S. Model BIT. The term used in CAFTA is not \u2018Conditions Precedent' but \u2018Conditions and Limitations.' According to the Claimant the difference is that a \u2018limitation' can be remedied by terminating or abandoning the inconsistent behavior. The Claimant considers that its interpretation is consistent with the U.S. emphasis on effectiveness and efficiency in investor-State arbitration.\n\n**V. THE REPLY**\n----------------\n\n28.\n\nIn the Reply, the Respondent argues that, under Article 10.17 of CAFTA and Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, it consented only to arbitrate disputes not already adjudicated in other fora. Article 10.18 is clear in expressing the requirement that the request to initiate arbitration proceedings must be accompanied by waivers of \u2018any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.' It is obvious to the Respondent that the reason for this requirement is \u2018to avoid a multiplication of proceedings, conflicting outcomes and legal uncertainty, forum shopping, double jeopardy for the Respondent and double redress for the Claimant.'13\n\nReply, para. 18.\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent rebuts the inferences drawn by the Claimant from the differences in the language used in Article 1121 of NAFTA and 10.18 of CAFTA. The Respondent finds that the plain meaning of the text of both articles does not provide support for the conclusion reached by the Claimant. According to the Respondent, CAFTA Article 10.18 is directly linked to jurisdiction, in a way which NAFTA is not, by framing the waiver as part of the \u2018Conditions and Limitations on Consent of each Party.' It is evident that \u2018the States party to the Treaty chose to leave no room for doubt that they did *not* consent to arbitration, and thus a tribunal would have no jurisdiction over a dispute, unless the requirements of Article 10.18 were met.'14\n\nIbid., para. 23.\n\n30.\n\nIt is the Respondent's contention that the measures under the local arbitration and this proceeding overlap because the State acts for which the Claimant seeks relief under the local arbitrations and the State acts concerning this arbitration are related even if the claims pursued are different. The Respondent finds support for its position in *Waste Management I* where the tribunal stated that that \u2018the same measure may give rise to different types of claims in different courts or tribunals'15, and \u2018when both legal actions have a legal basis derived from the same measures, they can no longer continue simultaneously in light of the imminent risk that the Claimant may obtain the double benefit in its claim for damages. This is precisely what NAFTA Article 1121 seeks to avoid.'16\n\nIbid., para. 36, citing 5 ICSID Reports 443. 458 (para. 27)..\n\nReply, para. 38 (emphasis added by the Respondent), citing 5 ICSID Reports 443. 459 (para. 27).\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimant's argument that its allegations are based only on the Lesivo Resolution. According to the Respondent, the Claimant alleges that a variety of measures constitute a breach of the Treaty. In this respect, the Respondent points out references in the Request to the \u2018Lesivo Resolution and other actions', \u2018the Lesivo Resolution and other Government measures which accompanied the lesivo process', \u2018The Government's measures, therefore defeat reasonable stability and predictability', \u2018Damages arising from infringing measures ', and \u2018Fees and expenses incurred to oppose the promulgation of the infringing Lesivo Resolution and other infringing measures.' The Respondent further points out that the Claimant itself recognizes that the measures at issue in the local arbitrations form an \u2018integral part' of the Claimant's Treaty claim.17\n\nReply, paras. 51-52.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant misunderstands the meaning of \u2018measures' and conflates it with the term \u2018obligations' when it argues that the alleged breaches of obligations in the domestic arbitrations are distinct from the obligations allegedly breached in the Treaty and infers from this that the measures do not overlap. As examples, the Respondent refers to paragraphs 67 and 68 of the Arbitration Request where it is in substance stated that, since the Lesivo Resolution, the Respondent has failed to remove squatters from the right of way and to make the contractually obligatory payments to the Trust Fund, and that these decisions not to pay into the Trust and not to remove squatters are an integral part of the Lesivo Resolution. The Respondent finds particularly significant that the Claimant seeks to recover in this proceeding \u2018those damages which would, except for such violations of CAFTA, be recovered in those proceedings.'18 The Respondent refers to the heads of damages in the local arbitrations and finds that the damages sought under the Treaty are claimed on account of the same failures.\n\nIbid., para. 66 quoting para. 51 of the Arbitration Request.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent concludes the Reply by acknowledging that, in the interest of efficiency, the Tribunal may wish to permit the Claimant an opportunity to comply with its Article 10.18 obligations. If that would be the case, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to issue an order continuing the suspension on the merits for a forty-five day period to dismiss with prejudice the local arbitrations and to order \u2018Claimant not to file or reinitiate any proceedings in any other fora that involve the measures/state actions that are at issue in this ICSID arbitration.'19 Should the Claimant fail to comply, then the Tribunal should dismiss this arbitration for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nIbid., para 73.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal award to it the legal fees and costs associated with this phase of the proceedings.\n\n**VI. THE REJOINDER**\n---------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the Reply narrows the scope of issues to be decided by the Tribunal by not insisting on the Claimant's lack of authority to waive the rights of FVG to pursue the local arbitration, and then proceeds to distinguish which issues are before the local arbitrations from those in this proceeding. According to the Claimant, the issues before the local arbitrations are (i) the failure by the Republic to pay moneys owed into the Trust Fund pursuant to Deed 820, and (ii) the failure to undertake the judicial processes necessary to remove the squatters pursuant to Deed 402. On the other hand, what is at issue in this arbitration is (i) the Declaration of Lesivo as to Deeds 143/158, and (ii) the Respondent's actions which have deprived it of any semblance of justice in the local arbitrations.20\n\nRejoinder, para. 11 referring to para. 51 of the Request.\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimant then questions the concept of \u2018overlap' developed by the Respondent in the Reply. The Claimant points out that the test of overlap is nowhere to be found in CAFTA or the jurisprudence of NAFTA, and contends that the Respondent fails \u2018to focus on whether the same measure is raised in the same proceedings, and, if the measures are the same, whether this same measure also is \"a measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 16.10\", as required by Article 10.18.2(b).'21\n\nIbid., para. 18.\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimant points out that the Lesivo Resolution and the measures associated with it cannot be the same measures for the simple reason that CAFTA entered into force between the U.S. and Guatemala only on 1 July 2007 and the local arbitrations were initiated in 2005. Because they predate July 1, 2006, the contracts documented in Deeds 820 and 402 cannot be \u2018investment agreements' under CAFTA. Article 10.1.3 precludes any measure that occurred before that date from binding any Party to the obligations of Chapter 10. The measures that the Claimant alleges to be breaches of Articles 10.7, 10.5 and 10.3 are the Lesivo Resolution and other measures in connection with it, and \u2018the Respondent's denial of due process and effective access to the judicial system.'22\n\nIbid., para. 23, third bullet.\n\n38.\n\nAs to the examples cited by the Respondent, the Claimant argues that they are part of the factual background; they are factually contextual and not part of its legal claims under Section A of Chapter 10. The Claimant also rebuts the assertion of the Respondent that it seeks to \u2018double-dip' on damages. The Claimant explains that it is only seeking damages which it cannot obtain locally because of Respondent's violations of Article 10.5 on the minimum standard of treatment. After describing the difficulties that the Claimant has encountered in the pursuit of the local arbitrations and pointing out that after more than three years since the local arbitrations were initiated no hearing had been conducted by the arbitrators, the Claimant contends that it \u2018continues to pursue these local claims not in the hope of securing a monetary award, but rather as a testament to the egregious failure of the Guatemalan judicial system to provide even a modicum of due process.'23 This failure is part of \u2018the other government actions in connection with the Lesivo Resolution.\n\nIbid., para. 36.\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimant argues further that the object and purpose of the waiver is not compromised by permitting the local arbitration to proceed concurrently with this proceeding. The Claimant explains that it is not alleging in the local arbitrations that there had been an expropriation without compensation or a failure to provide a minimum standard of treatment or a failure to provide national treatment. Therefore, continuation of the local arbitrations cannot result in a multiplication of proceedings or forum shopping. Similarly, there is no danger of conflicting results, legal uncertainty, or double jeopardy for the Respondent nor double redress for the Claimant.\n\n40.\n\nThen the Claimant turns to its concern that the Republic may raise an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction for failure to exhaust local remedies. The Claimant notes that there is no requirement to exhaust local remedies under CAFTA and refers to the observation made in the Reply in reference to Chapter II of the ICSID Convention: \u2018[A] Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention.' The Claimant argues that this statement ignores the fact that Guatemala consented generally to ICSID jurisdiction for disputes under CAFTA and waived its earlier notification to ICSID concerning local remedies. In the interest of efficiency the Claimant requests that the Tribunal opine on this matter to avoid a subsequent jurisdictional challenge.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimant concludes by requesting the Tribunal to dismiss the Respondent's objection to jurisdiction. However, if the Tribunal would decide that the waivers are defective, Claimant finds acceptable a forty-five day period to correct them.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL'S VIEWS**\n-----------------------------\n\n42.\n\nBefore addressing the contentions of the parties in respect to the Objection to Jurisdiction, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent no longer contests the validity of the waiver submitted on behalf of FVG.\n\n**A. EXPRESS RESERVATION IN THE WAIVERS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal will deal first with the exhaustion of local remedies reservation in the waivers of the Claimant and FVG. The reservation in the Claimant's waiver reads in relevant part as follows: \u2018provided, however, that RDC, on its own behalf and on behalf of FVG, reserves the right to pursue any and all local remedies which the ICSID arbitration panel requires in order for RDC to avoid any contention by the Government of Guatemala that RDC has failed to exhaust local remedies...'24 FVG makes a similar reservation in its waiver. As explained by the Claimant, this reservation is related to the notification, dated January 13, 2003, submitted by the Republic of Guatemala to ICSID25 and to the letter of July 5, 2007 referred to above where the Respondent has advanced such argument in respect of its consent to ICSID arbitration under CAFTA. The Claimant has noted that no such argument is made in the Objection to Jurisdiction although it felt obliged to comment on some statements made by the Respondent in the Reply. The Claimant has requested the Tribunal to opine on this matter to avoid a future objection to jurisdiction on this account.\n\nExhibit 8 to the Arbitration Request.\n\nNotification made pursuant to Article 25(4) of the ICSID Convention. Document ICSID/8 \u2018List of Contracting States and Measures taken by them for the purpose of the ICSID Convention' available at www.icsid.worldbank.org.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal notes first that no objection to jurisdiction for lack of consent based on the non-exhaustion of local remedies has been submitted by the Respondent. The Tribunal further notes that the Respondent had the opportunity to pursue such a basic objection for lack of consent, as initially argued in its letter, but has chosen not to do so. Admittedly, by filing an objection to jurisdiction under the expedited procedure, the Respondent is not foregoing its right under CAFTA to submit other objections in the future as permitted under Article 10.20.4, and the Respondent has expressly reserved its right in this respect. However, it notes that the use of the expedited procedure as just an additional jurisdictional layer would hardly fit with the stated objective of CAFTA to create effective procedures for the resolution of disputes.26\n\nArticle 1.2. Objectives.\n\n45.\n\nAs to the content of the reservation included in the Claimant's and FVG's waivers, the Respondent has argued that they constitute by themselves a repudiation of the waivers. The Tribunal disagrees. The Tribunal has no authority under CAFTA or the ICSID Convention to order the Claimant to pursue domestic proceedings in order to satisfy consent requirements of the Respondent in this arbitration. In these circumstances, the express reservation in the waivers is without any possible object and it does not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction.\n\n**B. ADEQUACY OF THE WAIVERS**\n------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to the issue of the adequacy of the waivers. In the first part of the waivers it is stated:\n\n\u2018In connection with its claims against the Government of Guatemala submitted to arbitration under CAFTA Article 10.16.1(a) and 10.16.1(b) on behalf of itself and its investment enterprise *Compa\u00f1\u00eda Desarrolladora Ferroviaria, S. A.* (\u2018FVG'), respectively, RDC hereby waives any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any party to CAFTA, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding (\u2018local remedies') with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in CAFTA Article 10.16.'\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent has pointed out that the waivers have not been implemented since FVG continued to pursue claims related to Deeds 402 and 820 in two arbitrations in Guatemala that overlap with claims pursued in this arbitration. The Respondent has argued that CAFTA requires desisting from local proceedings with prejudice; it is not sufficient simply to sign the waiver, it has to be effectuated. Since the waiver is defective, the Respondent contends that Claimant has not met the consent conditions of Article 10.18. The Claimant argues that, on the contrary, there is no such overlap and that the measures at issue in this arbitration are distinct from those under consideration in the local arbitrations. First, Deeds 402 and 820 precede CAFTA and hence they are not investment agreements under the CAFTA definition of such instruments. Second, the measures associated with the Lesivo Resolution related to the increase in squatters and payments to the Trust Fund stem from the Lesivo Resolution itself. Third, FVG seeks only performance and not compensation under the local arbitrations. Fourth, it is unlikely that FVG would succeed in its claims in the local arbitrations because of the obstruction of the Republic.\n\n48.\n\nThe key questions for the Tribunal are whether the measures before the domestic arbitrations are the same measures which are 'alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16', and, if so, what is the effect on the validity of the waiver and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n49.\n\nIt will be useful for reference purposes to reproduce here the text of paragraph 2 of Article 10.18 on 'Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party':\n\n\u2018No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this section unless:\n\n(a) the claimant consents in writing to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and\n\n(b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied,\n\n(i) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), by the claimant's written waiver, and\n\n(ii) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(b), by the claimant's and the enterprise's written waivers\n\nof any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.'\n\n50.\n\nThere is no dispute between the parties that \u2018other dispute settlement procedures' includes arbitration. There is no dispute that Deeds 402 and 820 do not qualify as investment agreements under CAFTA because they predate CAFTA. There is no dispute that the Lesivo Resolution is not a measure under consideration in the local arbitrations. What is disputed is whether the measures related to the Lesivo Resolution and which concern Dead 402 and Deed 820 are the same, in whole or in part, as those before the local arbitrations.\n\n51.\n\nIn the Arbitration Request, the introductory paragraph of Chapter III setting forth \u2018Legal Claims under CAFTA Section A of Chapter 10' refers to \u2018The Lesivo Resolution and the actions of Guatemala under provisions of Section A of Chapter 10 of CAFTA: Expropriation and Compensation (Article 10.7), Minimum Standard of Treatment (Article 10.5), and National Treatment (Article 10.3).'27 Then each claim is developed under separate headings which refer exclusively to the Lesivo Resolution. However, in the text there are generic references to \u2018measures' in connection with the Lesivo Resolution: \u2018the Government of Guatemala's measures, actions and omissions as part of the Lesivo Resolution process'28, and \u2018the Lesivo Resolution and other government measures which accompanied the *lesivo* process defeated the legitimate expectations of RDC..':29 These references are ambiguous and a possible source of misunderstanding about the measures of which the Claimant is complaining.\n\nPara. 51\n\nPara. 58.\n\nIbid., para. 64.\n\n52.\n\nThe ambiguity is dispelled when the Claimant, after referring to the cancelled Deeds 143/151 states: \u2018Specifically, since the Lesivo Resolution, the Government of Guatemala has failed to remove \"squatters\" from the right of way and to make the contractually obligated payments to the Trust Fund designated to rehabilitate the right of way granted under the Usufruct.'30 This statement is part of the legal claim that the Lesivo Resolution violates the minimum standard of treatment obligations of the Respondent under Article 10.5. Therefore, it is difficult to accept the Claimant's argument that references to removal of squatters and failure of payments to the Trust Fund are only references to facts to provide context to the Lesivo Resolution. While it may be correct, as also argued by the Claimant, that the specific words \u2018integral part' pointed out in the Respondent's argument are not found in the section of the Arbitration Request devoted to \u2018Legal Claims' but in the background description in Chapter II,31 the passage cited makes clear that the failure to remove squatters and to make payments into the trust fund are complained of. by the Claimant in the present CAFTA arbitration.\n\nIbid., para. 65.\n\n\u2018Since the Lesivo Resolution, the Government of Guatemala has made successive specific decisions not to pay into the Trust the funds required by Decree 820, and, through FEGUA, has made successive specific decisions not to remove squatters from the railway right of way, stations and yards. These decisions are an *integral part* of the Lesivo Resolution and other affirmative actions by the Government of Guatemala to deny RDC and FVG the minimum standards of treatment required by international law and, thereby, to make it impossible for FVG to remain in business and thereby to appropriate FVG's assets without compensation.' Arbitration Request, para. 50. Emphasis added.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal will now address the remaining arguments advanced by the Claimant to differentiate the claims under consideration under this arbitration from those under consideration in the local arbitrations. The argument that the Claimant is only seeking performance under the local arbitrations is immaterial for purposes of Article 10.18. The waivers under Article 18.10.2 are not restricted to damages claims. They should also cover claims seeking performance. A reading of Article 10.18.3 confirms this understanding. This paragraph excepts from the waivers actions seeking interim injunctive relief which do not involve the payment of monetary damages and brought for the sole purpose of preserving the claimant's or the enterprise's rights and interests during the pendency of the arbitration. This exception would have been unnecessary if Article 10.18.2 waivers were limited to damage claims. There is no question that the actions before the local arbitrations do not seek \u2018interim injunctive relief.' Nor can there be any distinction for this purpose between a claim for damages and one for a debt.\n\n54.\n\nAs to the argument that it is unlikely that the Claimant would receive any payment for damages under the domestic arbitrations, this is not the issue under Article 10.18. It is the fact that two domestic arbitration proceedings exist and overlap with this arbitration as determined by the Tribunal that triggers the defect in the waiver. Whether an overlapping claim before a domestic court or domestic arbitral tribunal would be successful is an entirely different matter.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimant has also argued that the language used in CAFTA Article 10.18 in respect of waivers is less restrictive than NAFTA Article 1121 because the words \u2018Conditions precedent' are not found in the title of CAFTA Article 10.18 and the words \u2018only if' are also missing. The Claimant compares the terms of the two articles in particular \u2018Condition Precedent' to \u2018Limitation' used in the title of CAFTA Article 10.18, and draws the conclusion that a \u2018Limitation' can be remedied by terminating or abandoning the inconsistent behavior.\n\n56.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that the dissimilarities noted by the Claimant between the texts of these two articles justify the inferences drawn by the Claimant. The title of Article 10.18 (\u2018Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party'), when read with the ensuing text and in particular the first sentence of paragraph 2 (\u2018No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section *unless*32.') leads the Tribunal to the conclusion that these differences in drafting are immaterial. \u2018Only if' and \u2018unless' have the same meaning and, whether the term \u2018precedent' is used or not, the conditions set forth in Article 10.18 need to be met before the consent of the Respondent to arbitration is perfected.\n\nEmphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant relies on the difference in the language between the two articles to support the argument that, should the Tribunal find a waiver defective, it may be cured without the need for the Claimant to re-file the claim. Before addressing this issue, the Tribunal will turn to the question of whether the Respondent has accepted that the Claimant might remedy its waiver.\n\n58.\n\nIn the Reply, the Respondent acknowledged, in the interest of efficiency,\n\n\u2018the possibility that the Tribunal may wish to permit Claimant an additional opportunity to comply with its Article 10.18 obligations. In the event that the Tribunal should deem it proper to allow Claimant such an opportunity, the Republic respectfully requests that this Tribunal issue an order continuing the suspension of this matter on the merits for a period of forty-five days to permit Claimant to cure the deficiencies in its waiver by dismissing with prejudice the local arbitrations...'33\n\nReply, para, 73.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant concluded the Rejoinder by stating that \u2018in the event that the Tribunal should find a defect in Claimant's waivers, the parties appear to agree that it can be remedied by the presentation of an effective waiver within a stipulated time frame. Respondent has proposed 45 days, and that is acceptable to the Claimant.'34 The Claimant repeated this understanding of the Respondent's position in its Request for Interim Measures.\n\nIbid., para. 50.\n\n60.\n\nHowever, in its Response to the Claimant's Request for Interim Measures, the Respondent considered that the Claimant has mischaracterized the Respondent's position on the opportunity to cure the defective waiver. According to the Respondent:\n\n\u2018It is not the case that the Republic would have no objection to the Tribunal permitting the Claimant an opportunity to cure its defective waiver pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.18; instead, the Republic confirmed that it seeks dismissal for lack of jurisdiction but acknowledged that the Tribunal might, for efficiency purposes, seek to grant the Claimant an opportunity to cure its defective waiver. Should the Tribunal choose to proceed with that option, the Republic has not waived any objections it might present to such a decision and at the appropriate time.'35\n\nRespondent's Response to Claimant's Request for Interim Measure of Protection Regarding Preservation of Evidence, para. 7.\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimant's understanding of the Respondent's position is a fair reading of the Respondent's statement in its Reply. In fact, the Respondent even requested the Tribunal to issue an order to permit the Claimant to remedy the defective waiver. But it is also clear from subsequent submissions, confirmed during the hearing, that the Respondent retracted this concession and there is no basis on which the Tribunal could hold that it was precluded from doing so. This being a matter pertaining to the consent of the Respondent to this arbitration, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction without the agreement of the parties to grant the Claimant an opportunity to remedy its defective waiver. It is for the Respondent and not the Tribunal to waive a deficiency under Article 10.18 or to allow a defective waiver to be remedied, as the United States did in *Methanex*.36\n\nIn *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. United Mexican States*, Award of January 26, 2006, paras. 114-118, the tribunal held that unambiguous waivers submitted with the Particularised Statement of Claim were sufficient for the purposes of NAFTA Art. 1120(1)(b); the failure to file these with the Notice of Arbitration was a merely formal defect. In the present case, by contrast, the Claimant has maintained the domestic arbitrations over the Respondent's objection, and there is no question of a merely formal defect at the outset of the international arbitral procedure.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal has previously concluded that measures concerning squatters and payments to the Trust Fund alleged to be related to the Lesivo Resolution are measures at issue in the local arbitrations under Deed 402 and Deed 820. The question for the Tribunal is whether, because of this overlap, the entire waiver is defective and affects the whole proceeding before this Tribunal or whether the waiver is only partially defective in respect of those claims maintained in contradiction to the waiver requirements of Article 10.18. To answer this question, the Tribunal turns first to the meaning of the term \u2018claim' in Article 10.18.\n\n63.\n\nCounsel for the Respondent argued, based on *Waste Management I*, that, for a claim to be defective, the overlap of some measures is enough. In effect, this reads the word \"claim\" in CAFTA Article 10.18(2) as referring to the whole arbitration proceeding commenced by the request for arbitration rather than as applying severally to each distinct claim initiated by the request for arbitration.37\n\nTranscript, pp. 48-50.\n\n64.\n\nIn response to a question from the Tribunal, counsel for the Respondent accepted that the same phrase \"no claim\" in Article 10.18(1) applied distributively with respect to different claims that were alleged in the Notice of Arbitration. Such claims might arise at different times and the three-year time limit in Article 10.18(1) would have to be applied separately to each distinct claim. But counsel argued that the function of Article 10.18(1) was different than Article 10.18(2); the use of the same term \"no claim\" in both should not lead to an identical interpretation. In short, the Respondent submitted, \"failure to submit the requisite waiver means that. *there is no jurisdiction over the entire action, not just over the particular claim or one of the claims*.'38\n\nIbid., pp. 163-164. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n65.\n\nThe parties have exchanged post-hearing communications on this issue.39 For the Claimant, Article 18.10.1 contemplates multiple \u2018claims' and \u2018it would be incomprehensible that a claimant who had such multiple claims would be subject to a limitations bar on all of its claims just because one of them was older than three years.' A tribunal faced with that situation would consider each claim separately and accept or reject each on the basis of the time limitation bar. The same reasoning should be applied to the waiver requirement.\n\nLetter of the Claimant of October 17, 2008 and letter from the Respondent of October 22, 2008.\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimant finds support for this interpretation in Article 10.16(1) and (2). According to the Claimant, the drafters of Article 10.16(2) \u2018clearly considered that **a claim** submitted to arbitration may contain **multiple claims** and further, that the inference to be drawn is that each such **claim** can be considered separately as a \"claim\" subject to the provisions of Article 10.18(2). The requirement that each claim be pled, and supported, with specificity would be meaningless if the signatories had not also contemplated that each claim be considered separately from the others, both on the merits and as to jurisdiction.'40 As to Article 10.16(1), \u2018a claim under this section refers to each specific breach that is alleged and contemplates that each will be considered separately for all purposes.'\n\nEmphasis in the original.\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, as is the case in NAFTA, the term \u2018claim' in Chapter 10 is \u2018interchangeably used to refer to the **whole action** that is presented by a claimant for consideration by a tribunal in a given arbitration (\u2018whole claim'), or to each **individual claim** that forms part of the action (\u2018individual claim').'41 The Respondent recalls that, as discussed in the Reply, \u2018 **No claim** may be submitted to arbitration.unless.' in Article 10.18.2 of CAFTA has the same meaning as in \u2018A disputing investor may submit a **claim**.to arbitration only if.'42 of NAFTA Article 1121. Given that \u2018claim' has the same meaning in both articles, reasons the Respondent, it is instructive that in the relevant NAFTA jurisprudence this term is understood to mean the whole claim and that NAFTA tribunals in *Waste Management I*, *Waste Management II* and *Thunderbird* have an \u2018unequivocal understanding' that the term \u2018claim' refers to the whole claim and have concluded that an invalid waiver affects the claimant's ability to proceed with the entire arbitration.\n\nLetter dated October 22, 2008, p. 1. Emphasis in the original.\n\nEmphasis added by the Respondent.\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent has further argued that:\n\n\u2018the ordinary meaning of the text in Article 10.18.2 demonstrates that the term \"claim\" in that Article refers to the whole claim, and the term \"claims\" refers to individual claims: \"No **claim** may be submitted to arbitration.unless.the notice of arbitration is accompanied, for **claims** submitted.by the claimant's written waiver.\" In other words, the claimant is barred from proceeding with the **whole** of its claim if that claimant fails to present valid waivers for any of its **individual** claims. This understanding is logical in light of the construction of this provision which contemplates the existence of various individual \"claims\", each one of which requires a valid waiver, presented with and in the context of the whole \"claim\", which is what would be barred from proceeding if the waiver requirements are not met.'43\n\nThe Respondent concludes by reiterating its request that the Tribunal dismiss the whole claim of the Claimant.\n\nIbid., pp.3-4. Emphasis in the original\n\n69.\n\nGrammatically, the phrase \u2018No claim' at the beginning of paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of Article 10.18 could mean \u2018any claim', \u2018a claim', \u2018each claim' or \u2018all claims' and not necessarily the \u2018whole claim' to use the Respondent's terminology. But the term \u2018claim' is used consistently to refer to a specific cause of action throughout Article 10.18. It is not necessary to have recourse to any theory of \"dual meaning\" to make sense of Article 10.18. Article 10.18(1) time bars claims older than three years from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired knowledge of the alleged breach. Evidently here, as the Respondent accepts, the word \u2018claim' must mean each individual claim submitted to arbitration. This being the case, it would be odd that the same word in the same grammatical construction would mean something different when used subsequently in other paragraphs of the same article.\n\n70.\n\nThis understanding of the Tribunal is confirmed by the wording in Article 10.18(4). This paragraph excludes claims for certain breaches if such claims have been previously submitted to the administrative tribunals or courts of the respondent:\n\n\u2018No claim may be submitted to arbitration:\n\n(a) for breach of an investment authorization under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(B) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(B),or\n\n(b) for breach of an investment agreement under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(C), or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C),\n\nif the claimant.or the claimant or the enterprise.has previously submitted the same alleged breach to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent.'\n\n71.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal these are \u2018individual' claims related to a specific breach of an investment authorization or of an investment agreement. This understanding is confirmed by reading Article 10.18(4) with Article 10.16(2)(b) and Article 10.16(2)(c) which require that the notice of intention specify:\n\n\u2018(b) for *each claim*, the provision of this Agreement, investment authorization, or investment agreement alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions;\n\n(c) the legal and factual basis for *each claim*.'44\n\nEmphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n72.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the phrase \u2018No claim' in Article 10.18(2) has the same meaning as it does in Article 10.18(1): it refers to a specific claim made against a State under Chapter 10. This interpretation respects the rationale and purpose of the waiver to which the Respondent has often alluded to in support of its arguments. It would not give rise to conflicting outcomes nor to double redress for the same conduct or measure.45 It is also more in consonance with the objective of CAFTA to introduce effective procedures of dispute settlement. The effect of the interpretation proposed by the Respondent would be the dismissal of the entire proceeding, but it would not prevent the Claimant from initiating a new ICSID arbitration by submitting a request for arbitration with a waiver modified accordingly, a rather ineffective and procedurally inefficient result.\n\n*Thunderbird*, para. 118 *.*\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent has drawn the attention of the Tribunal to Article 1121 of NAFTA and the related NAFTA jurisprudence. It is evident that CAFTA Article 10.18 and NAFTA Article 1121 have the same general rationale and purpose. While the Respondent has argued that the dual use of the term \u2018claim' is also a feature of NAFTA, the Tribunal observes that in NAFTA Article 1121 \u2018claim' is used consistently in the singular. This difference between the two articles may lead to different interpretations -but the Tribunal's function is confined to CAFTA Chapter 10, and it is not necessary to express any view as to the application of Article 1121(1)(b) of NAFTA to the current facts.\n\n74.\n\nThe other NAFTA cases adduced by the Respondent do not address the issue discussed here. The validity of waivers submitted after the notice of arbitration was at issue in *Thunderbird*. The tribunal in that case decided that it did \u2018not wish to disregard the subsequent filing of those waivers, as to reason otherwise would amount, in the Tribunal's view, to an overformalistic reading of Article 1121 of the NAFTA.' The issue in respect of NAFTA Article 1121 before the tribunal in *Waste Management II* was whether a claim could be re-submitted to a new arbitral tribunal with a new valid waiver after having been rejected in a previous arbitral proceeding because of the invalidity of the waiver. Mexico filed a preliminary objection to jurisdiction arguing that a claim could only be submitted once. The tribunal dismissed the objection. Therefore, the only relevant precedent is *Waste Management I* and, as explained above, the differences between NAFTA Article 1121 and CAFTA Article 10.18 in respect of the use of the term \u2018claim' may, in the view of the Tribunal, reasonably justify a different interpretation under CAFTA.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the word \u2018claim' in Article 10.18 means the specific claim and not the whole arbitration in which that claim is maintained. Therefore, the waivers submitted by the Claimant are valid in respect of claims arising out of the Lesivo Resolution and the subsequent conduct of the Respondent pursuant to that resolution.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n76.\n\nHaving carefully considered the parties' arguments in their written pleadings and oral submissions, and for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides:\n\n(a) That the reservation included in the waivers submitted by the Claimant pursuant to Article 10.18.2 is of no consequence for purposes of their validity.\n\n(b) That the waivers submitted by the Claimant pursuant to Article 10.18.2 are valid in respect of the claim arising from the Lesivo Resolution and from subsequent conduct of the Respondent pursuant to the Lesivo Resolution and, therefore, fulfill the Respondent's consent to arbitration conditions under Article 10.18 in respect of that claim.\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimant has requested the award of the costs of this phase of the proceeding. The Respondent has requested the award of such costs and its own legal fees and expenses associated with this phase of the proceeding. The Tribunal will consider this matter as part of the merits.\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal will order the continuation of the proceeding on the merits and will establish a calendar for the filing of pleadings on the merits after consultation with the parties."}, {"Title": "Decision on Clarification Request of the Decision on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Interpretation", "Date": "2009-01-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Clarification Request of the Decision on Jurisdiction\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn December 12, 2008, the Republic of Guatemala (\u2018Respondent') filed a request for clarification (\u2018Request') of the Decision on Jurisdiction of November 17, 2008 (\u2018Decision'). The Railroad Development Corporation (\u2018Claimant') filed comments on 19 December 2008 (\u2018Comments').\n\n**I. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nRespondent is \u2018gravely concerned' by the interpretation Claimant has given the Decision and requests a detailed clarification regarding precisely what is excluded by the defect the Tribunal found in the waiver as well as what is not excluded. According to Respondent, there is an inconsistency between the acknowledgement by the Tribunal that there are three specific claims in this arbitration and its conclusion that \u2018claims arising out of the Lesivo Resolution and the subsequent conduct of Respondent pursuant to that resolution' are permissible and not affected by the overlap in measures and the Claimant's defective waiver.\n\n3.\n\nIt is Respondent's contention that this seeming inconsistency can be likely reconciled \u2018when one considers the Tribunal's determination that, while all three claims reference the Lesivo Resolution, Claimant's Article 10.5 claim contains measures which create impermissible overlap with the claims in the local arbitrations,'1 and, therefore, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Claimant's Article 10.5 claim in accordance with Article 10.18.2.\n\nRequest, para. 8\n\n4.\n\nRespondent finds that the Decision fails to state explicitly the consequences of holding Claimant's waiver defective and believes that its understanding of the Decision as articulated in the Request \u2018permits the Decision to be internally consistent.'2\n\nIbid., para. 9.\n\n5.\n\nAs Respondent understands Claimant's interpretation of the Decision, the Decision would permit the Claimant to recast the pre- and post-Lesivo measures related to squatters and payments to the Trust Fund in a denial of justice claim. According to Respondent, such interpretation would maintain an impermissible overlap of this proceeding with the two domestic arbitrations.\n\n6.\n\nRespondent concludes by requesting the Tribunal to confirm that the Republic's understanding of the Decision is correct or, if it is incorrect, to articulate what specific claims it understands Claimant to have brought before it and which of these specific claims are excluded from these proceedings because of the defect in the waiver.\n\n7.\n\nClaimant does not find the Decision to be internally inconsistent or vague. Claimant considers that Respondent attempts to reopen the Decision and re-argue the case under the guise of a clarification. Claimant draws the conclusion from the Decision that its claim under Article 10.5 related to the failure to remove squatters and to make payments into the Trust Fund cannot proceed.\n\n8.\n\nClaimant points out that these failures are the only measures identified by the parties to be at issue in the domestic arbitrations. According to Claimant, it can proceed to claim that Respondent has violated Article 10.5, for instance, by failure of the Guatemalan court system and police to afford redress and protection for injuries to the rights of Ferrov\u00edas Guatemala.\n\n9.\n\nClaimant notes that it intends to press claims that relate to squatters that it believes are consistent with the Decision and provides an example of one such claim to show that the Tribunal is not in a position to accommodate the request to articulate \u2018precisely what specific claims it understands Claimant to have brought before it.'3\n\nComments, para 3.\n\n10.\n\nClaimant disagrees with the Respondent's contention that affirmative actions of Respondent to deny Claimant access to its courts and due process are the same measures as those at issue in the local arbitrations. Claimant concludes by agreeing with Respondent that the parties have drawn opposing conclusions from the Decision but it \u2018fails to see how this forms an adequate basis for compelling the Tribunal to address the self-serving and erroneous arguments that Respondent advances in its request for clarification.'4\n\nIbid., para. 6\n\n**II. The Views of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the Decision in light of the Request and Claimant's comments. For the reasons that are set forth below, the Tribunal considers that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to clarify the Decision on the terms requested.\n\n12.\n\nIt is unnecessary to clarify the Decision because it is not vague or internally inconsistent. The Decision clearly states that the waivers are valid \u2018in respect of the claim arising from the Lesivo Resolution and from subsequent conduct of the Respondent pursuant to the Lesivo Resolution.'5 To reach this conclusion and as part of its considerations, the Tribunal found it difficult to accept the argument of Claimant that \u2018references to removal of squatters and failure of payments to the Trust Fund are only references to facts to provide context to the Lesivo Resolution,'6 particularly, in view of paragraph 50 of the Arbitration Request.7 After this finding, the Tribunal proceeded to consider whether the entire waiver was defective. The Tribunal first observed that it had \u2018previously concluded that measures concerning squatters and payments to the Trust Fund alleged to be related to the Lesivo Resolution are measures at issue in the local arbitrations under Deed 402 and Deed 820.'8 Then the Tribunal frames the question to be considered as follows: \u2018The question for the Tribunal is whether, because of this overlap, the entire waiver is defective and affects the whole proceedings before this proceeding or whether the waiver is only partially defective in respect of those claims maintained in contradiction to the waiver requirements of Article 10.18.'9\n\nDecision, para. 76(b).\n\nIbid., para. 52.\n\nThis paragraph reads as follows: \u2018Since the Lesivo Resolution, the Government of Guatemala has made successive specific decisions not to pay into the Trust the funds required by Deed 820, and, through FEGUA, has made successive specific decisions not to remove squatters from the railway right of way, stations and yards. These decisions are an integral part of the Lesivo Resolution and other affirmative actions by the Government of Guatemala to deny RDC and FVG the minimum standards of treatment required by international law and, thereby, to make it impossible for FVG to remain in business and thereby to appropriate FVG's assets without compensation.' The Tribunal emphasized the expression \u2018integral part'.\n\nDecision, para. 62.\n\nIbid.\n\n13.\n\nIt is the Tribunal's view that the reasoning of the Tribunal leading to its decision clearly excludes claims based on the measures at issue in the local arbitrations under Deed 402 and Deed 820 irrespective of the article of CAFTA under which they would be advanced. On the other hand, Article 10.5 provides for the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. This is a general and wide ranging standard of treatment that may cover claims based on other measures taken by Respondent beyond those at issue in the local arbitrations. It would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to exclude them *a priori* or to speculate on how Claimant may articulate its claims.\n\n**III. Decision**\n-----------------\n\n14.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the request for clarification of the Decision on Jurisdiction."}, {"Title": "Second Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2010-05-18T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Second Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**I.

CAFTA entered into force between the United States of America and Guatemala on July 1, 2006.\n\n2.\n\nThe Tribunal, composed of Professor James Crawford, Honorable Stuart E. Eizenstat and Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda (President) was constituted on April 14, 2008.\n\n3.\n\nOn May 29, 2008, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal considered on an expedited basis, an objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.20.5. As required by Article 10.20.5, the Tribunal suspended the proceedings on the merits. The parties exchanged written submissions and a hearing on jurisdiction was held on October 10, 2010. On November 17, 2008, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Objection to Jurisdiction under CAFTA Article 10.20.5 (\"First Decision on Jurisdiction\"). In that decision the Tribunal held:\n\n\"(a) That the reservation included in the waivers submitted by the Claimant pursuant to Article 10.18.2 is of no consequence for purposes of their validity. [and] (b) [t]hat the waivers submitted by the Claimant pursuant to Article 10.18.2 are valid in respect of the claim arising from the Lesivo Resolution and from subsequent conduct of the Respondent pursuant to the Lesivo Resolution and, therefore, fulfill the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration conditions under Article 10.18 in respect of that claim.\"\n\n4.\n\nOn December 12, 2008, the Respondent filed a request for clarification of the First Decision on Jurisdiction. The Claimant filed comments on December 19, 2008. On January 6, 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 establishing the procedural calendar on the merits phase of the proceedings and fixing May 24, 2009 as the deadline for the submission of the Memorial on the Merits, and a two-week deadline after the date of submission of the Memorial on the Merits for \"Respondent [to] inform the Tribunal and Claimant of any intention to raise preliminary objections.\" On January 13, 2009, the Tribunal issued the Decision on Clarification in connection with the First Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of May 5, 2009 and the Respondent\u2019s letter of May 7, 2009, the parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to modify the schedule for the submissions of pleadings set forth in Procedural Order No. 2. By letter of May 8, 2009, the Tribunal approved the parties\u2019 proposal. According to the new calendar, the Claimant\u2019s Memorial was to be submitted on June 26, 2008 while the Respondent\u2019s notice of any jurisdictional objections was scheduled for July 25, 2009. Accordingly, Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits on June 26, 2009.\n\n6.\n\nOn July 24, 2009, Guatemala filed a notice of intent to raise preliminary objections, as it had reserved the right to do under CAFTA, Article 10.20.4.2 Claimant objected on August 4, 2009. A further exchange between the parties on this matter took place by Respondent\u2019s letter of August 7 and Claimant\u2019s letter of August 14, 2009.\n\nCAFTA Article 10.20.4 provides that the \"preliminary question\" procedure (laid down in Article 10.20.5) is \"[w]ithout prejudice to a tribunal\u2019s authority to address other objections as a preliminary question\". This led in the present case to two jurisdictional hearings on different points, which is inconvenient, to say the least.\n\n7.\n\nOn August 24, 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 suspending the proceeding on the merits, establishing September 24, 2009 as the deadline for Guatemala to submit its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction and granting Claimant 30 days after receipt of Respondent\u2019s Memorial to submit its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n8.\n\nOn September 24, 2009, Guatemala filed its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction (\"Respondent\u2019s Memorial\"); Claimant filed its CounterMemorial on Jurisdiction (\"Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial\") on October 26, 2009.\n\n9.\n\nOn November 3, 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 whereby the Tribunal decided that \"given the thoroughness of the memorials filed, the Tribunal does not need to receive further written argument but, before deciding on Respondent\u2019s objections, it would assist the Tribunal to hear the parties in oral argument.\"\n\n10.\n\nOn November 18, 2009, Claimant proposed a bifurcated hearing whereby the Tribunal would hear first oral argument on whether any of Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections are \"maintainable or proper as a matter of law without any need to resolve any disputed questions of fact\", and, only if the Tribunal would determine that one or more of Respondent\u2019s objections are properly maintainable as a matter of law, would the Tribunal hold a subsequent evidentiary hearing.\n\n11.\n\nOn November 24, 2009, Respondent objected to Claimant\u2019s proposal, *inter alia*, because \"its jurisdictional objections are inextricably intertwined with certain facts and thus the legal issues involved can only be evaluated with reference to those facts.\"\n\n12.\n\nOn December 1, 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 deciding to hold a single three-day hearing on the objections to its jurisdiction.\n\n13.\n\nAfter consulting the parties, the Tribunal decided to hold the hearing from March 1 to March 3, 2010.\n\n14.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction took place at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. Pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.21 the hearing was open to the public. Representatives of the United States of America (the \u2018United States\u2019) and the Republic of El Salvador (\u2018El Salvador\u2019) attended the hearing as non-disputing parties. The parties were represented by their respective counsel who made presentations to the Tribunal.

STATEMENT OF FACTS**\n--------------------------\n\n22.\n\nRailroad Development Corporation (\"RDC\") is a privately-owned railway investment and management company incorporated in the United States. In 1997 it won, through international public bidding, the use of the rail infrastructure to provide railway services in Guatemala (the \"Usufruct\"). Only two bids were submitted. RDC\u2019s bid consisted of a staged plan to rebuild the rail system, which had been closed since March 1996, with an investment program of about ten million U.S. dollars. Only RDC\u2019s bid was considered responsive by Respondent, in spite of the fact that RDC submitted an integrated bid that included the use of the railway equipment.\n\n23.\n\nThe Usufruct awarded to RDC consisted of a 50-year right to rebuild and operate the Guatemalan rail system by way of a usufruct. On November 25, 1997, FVG signed the Usufruct Contract of Right of Way with Ferrocarriles de Guatemala (\"FEGUA\"), a state-owned company, established in 1969, responsible for providing railway transport services and managing the railway\u2019s personal property and real estate assets. The Usufruct and the related Railway Usufruct Contract were ratified by the Congress of Guatemala by Decree 27-98, and published in the Official Gazette on April 23, 1998. It is accordingly not in dispute that - whether RDC\u2019s bid conformed to the tender requirements or was a non-conforming bid accepted by Guatemala - the Railway Usufruct Contract was lawfully concluded as a matter of Guatemalan law.\n\n24.\n\nThe Usufruct covers a 497-mile narrow gauge railroad and includes the right to develop alternative uses for the right of way, such as pipelines, electric transmission, fiber optics and commercial and institutional development. In return for the right-of-way Usufruct, RDC (through FVG) agreed to make certain payments to FEGUA.\n\n25.\n\nThe Railway Usufruct Contract was documented by Deed Number 402 (\"Contract 402\") and came into force on May 23, 1998. In addition, on December 30, 1999, FVG and FEGUA entered into a Trust Fund Agreement for the Rehabilitation and Modernization of the railroad system (\"Contract 820\") providing for certain payments to be made by FEGUA into a trust fund established for this purpose (\"Trust Fund\").\n\n26.\n\nIn November 1997, Guatemala invited bids for the use of FEGUA\u2019s rail equipment in onerous usufruct. On December 11, 1997, FVG submitted its bid. FVG was the only bidder and on December 16, 1997 won the rail equipment usufruct. The Tribunal would observe that it is not surprising that FVG was the only bidder. As noted above, its original bid (which resulted in Contract 402) had explicitly envisaged both the right of way and the use of the railway stock and property. Further, the railway being narrow gauge, only the narrow gauge rolling stock retained by FEGUA was of any use.\n\n27.\n\nOn March 23, 1999, FEGUA and FVG signed Usufruct Contract 41 (\"Contract 41\"), granting FVG \"the use, enjoyment, repair and maintenance of railway equipment owned by FEGUA for the purposes of rendering railway transportation services.\" This contract never entered into force for lack of approval by an *Acuerdo Gubernativo* (\"Executive Resolution\"). Such approval was required under Guatemalan administrative law and also by Clause 6.4 of the bidding conditions for Contract No. 41. As reported below (see paragraph 104) and despite a question by the Tribunal, it is uncertain why no *Acuerdo Gubernativo* was issued. Meanwhile, FVG had the use of the railway equipment under short-term arrangements (see below, paragraph 143).\n\n28.\n\nIn view of the fact that Contract 41 did not enter into force and in order to achieve the same purposes, FVG and FEGUA entered into Contract 143 on August 28, 2003. The circumstances and effect of Contract 143 are a matter of controversy between the parties and the Tribunal simply registers here the fact that FVG and FEGUA signed this contract, and subsequently modified it by Contract 158 (\"Equipment Usufruct Contracts\")\n\n29.\n\nFVG restored commercial service between El Chile and Guatemala City on April 15, 1999. In December 1999, commercial service was restored between Guatemala City and the Atlantic ports of Puerto Barrios and Puerto Santo Tom\u00e1s. Tonnage traffic gradually increased until 2005 but declined in 2006.\n\n30.\n\nOn June 13, 2005 and on July 25, 2005, FVG filed domestic arbitration cases against FEGUA for breach of Contract 402 and Contract 820, respectively. FVG alleged that Guatemala through FEGUA failed to remove squatters from the rail right of way and to make payments to the Trust Fund. FVG further alleged that, in anticipation of FVG\u2019s filings, FEGUA requested the Attorney General to investigate the circumstances surrounding the award of the Usufruct and to issue an opinion on the validity of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts. The Attorney General issued Opinion No. 205-2005 on August 1, 2005 (the \"*Lesividad* Opinion\"), and recommended that Guatemala declare the Equipment Usufruct Contracts void as not in the interest of the country.\n\n31.\n\nOn January 13, 2006, FEGUA issued Opinion 05-2006, arguing, in agreement with the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, that the Contracts were not awarded as a result of a public bid.\n\n32.\n\nClaimant met the President of the Republic, Mr. Oscar Berger, on March 7, 2006; as a result the President set up a high level commission to work with RDC and FVG, on which FEGUA was represented. This commission met a number of times but the meetings were suspended after the meeting held on May 11, 2006. The importance of this meeting loomed large in the exchanges between the parties. At issue is when Claimant learned about the process of *lesividad*, which Respondent alleges to have been started in late April 2006, and to what extent this process was suspended to allow the negotiations to proceed. For reasons that will become apparent, this is a matter which is not material to the question of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n33.\n\nContract 143 having been executed on August 26, 2003, the period for the Government to declare it *lesivo* under the Guatemalan statute of limitations (three years from the date of execution of the contract) expired on August 26, 2006. The day before, i.e. August 25, 2006, the resolution declaring the Equipment Usufruct Contracts *lesivos* to the interests of the State was published. It had been signed by the President on August 11, 2006.\n\n34.\n\nAfter the publication of the *Lesivo* Resolution a \"*mesa de di\u00e1logo*\" was established and FEGUA, FVG and the parties continued to negotiate during the period of ninety days within which the Attorney General had to file the *lesividad* claim with the Administrative Tribunal. To this date the Administrative Tribunal has not decided on the *lesividad* claim.\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal will now summarize the three objections to jurisdiction as they were developed in the evidence and in argument, and the parties\u2019 replies to the Tribunal\u2019s questions addressed in the post-hearing briefs.\n\n**III. THE OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**1. FIRST OBJECTION: THE TRIBUNAL LACKS JURISDICTION BECAUSE CLAIMANT\u2019SCLAIMS RELATE TO A DISPUTE AND \"ACTS OR FACTS\" THAT PREDATE THETREATY\u2019S ENTRY INTO FORCE (OBJECTION** ***R******ATIONE*** ***T******EMPORIS*****)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*A. R**ESPONDENT**\u2019**S* *P**OSITION ON THE* *O**BJECTION* *R**ATIONE* *T**EMPORIS*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCAFTA Article 10 provides as follows:\n\n1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to:\n\n(a) investors of another Party;\n\n(b) covered investments; and\n\n(c) with respect to Articles 10.9 and 10.11, all investments in the territory of the Party.\n\n3. For greater certainty, this Chapter does not bind any Party in relation to any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Agreement.\n\n36.\n\nAccording to Respondent, all claims of RDC fall outside the temporal scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction because Claimant\u2019s Treaty claim is a continuation of a dispute which arose before the Treaty entered into force and the acts or facts on which RDC relies also happened before such entry. (The CAFTA entered into force between Guatemala and the United States on July 1, 2006.)\n\n37.\n\nRespondent\u2019s contention is based on CAFTA Article 10.1.3 and Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"Vienna Convention\") which reflect the customary international law principle of non-retroactive application of treaties. According to Respondent, this general rule applies, as held by the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\") in the *Ambatielos* case, unless there is a special clause providing for retroactive application, which is not the case here.3 It is the Respondent\u2019s view that the phrase \"for greater certainty\" at the beginning of CAFTA Article 10.1.3 indicates that an explicit non-retroactivity clause was included to reaffirm the customary international law rule of nonretroactivity. Respondent argues that the non-retroactive nature of the Treaty implies that pre-treaty disputes and acts or facts that pre-date the Treaty are outside its scope.\n\n*Ambatielos Case* (Greece v. United Kingdom), I.C.J. Rep. 1952, p. 28, 45.\n\n38.\n\nIn support of its contention Respondent adduces the work of the International Law Commission (\"ILC\") and in particular the Third Report of Sir Humphrey Waldock, Special Rapporteur on the Law of Treaties, which was considered at the Sixteenth Session of the ILC.4 Respondent points to the statement that, when jurisdictional clauses are attached to substantive clauses to secure their application, the non-retroactivity principle applies to exclude any disputes that arose prior to the treaty\u2019s entry into force. Respondent also adduces jurisprudence of the Permanent Court of International Justice (\"PCIJ\") (*Phosphates in Morocco*5) and of investment treaty arbitration tribunals (*Impregilo v. Pakistan,*6*Salini v. Jordan,*7*MCI v. Ecuador,*8*Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine*9) in support of its conclusion that, regardless of the wording of the treaty, \"investment treaty tribunals have consistently held that unless there is evidence of intent to the contrary, they lack jurisdiction under the treaties over disputes which arose prior to the treaty\u2019s entry into force and over acts or facts that predate the treaty.\"10 Respondent finds that there is no evidence that the parties to the Treaty intended that it would have retroactive effect.\n\nThird Report on the Law of Treaties, by Sir Humphrey Waldock, Special Rapporteur, *Yearbook of the International Law Commission,* 1964, Vol. II, A/CN.4/167 and Add. 1-3.\n\n*Phosphates in Morocco Case*, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, no. 74, 1938, p. 23.\n\n*Impregilo SpA v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11), Decision on Jurisdiction, April 22, 2005, 12 ICSID Rep. 242.\n\n*Salini Construttori SpA and Italstrade SpA v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13), Decision on Jurisdiction, November 29, 2004, 14 ICSID Rep. 303.\n\n*M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Tribune, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6), Award, July 31, 2007.\n\n*Generation Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/9), Award, September 16, 2003, 10 ICSID Rep. 236.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, para. 112.\n\n39.\n\nRespondent finds further support in the case law of investment treaty arbitration to determine whether the dispute originated before the Treaty. Based on *Lucchetti v. Peru,*11*Vieira v. Chile*12 and *MCI v. Ecuador*,13 Respondent argues that the key test is whether the facts or considerations that gave rise to the earlier dispute continued to be central to the later dispute. According to Respondent, when this test is applied to the instant dispute, the dispute is clearly a pre-Treaty dispute because the facts and considerations that gave rise to the decision to declare the Equipment Usufruct Contracts *lesivos* are \"the very same facts and considerations that have been in play in the dispute that has existed between the parties since 2004 concerning the legality of the subject contracts.\"14 Respondent points out that FEGUA has questioned the validity of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts since April 2004 when it denied the request made by FVG to hand over certain warehouses and attached the legal opinion of FEGUA\u2019s Legal Department on the illegalities of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts. The same illegalities were the basis on which the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the Cabinet Ministers and the President of Guatemala himself concluded that the Equipment Usufruct Contracts must be declared *lesivos*. Furthermore, alleges Respondent, the subject matter of the dispute is the same that gave rise to the pre-Treaty dispute since it results from Guatemala\u2019s position on the invalidity of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts which now Claimant characterizes as a Treaty breach. Respondent explains that the *Lesivo* Resolution was Guatemala\u2019s way to deal with this dispute when the parties were unable to reach a settlement to cure the underlying illegalities. According to Respondent, the dispute did not come to an end, or subsequently crystallize in a new dispute. This was attested by Claimant\u2019s own conduct in requesting the suspension of the signing of the *Lesivo* Resolution in order to continue the negotiations, an event which occurred two months before the resolution was adopted and before the CAFTA entered into force. It was also attested by the repeated references of Claimant to the \"*lesivo* process\", which show that Claimant did not understand the *lesividad* declaration to be a single act which occurred after the Treaty entered into force.\n\n*Industria Nacional de Alimentos S.A. and Indalsa Per\u00fa (formerly* *Empresas Lucchetti S.A. and Lucchetti Per\u00fa S.A.) v. Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4), Award on Jurisdiction, February 7, 2005, 12 ICSID Rep. 218.\n\n*Sociedad An\u00f3nima Eduardo Vieira v. Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/7), Award, August 21, 2007.\n\n*M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, see note 8 above.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, para. 133. Emphasis in the original.\n\n40.\n\nRespondent describes the steps of the *lesividad* process in the instant case as follows:\n\n\u2022 First, on August 1, 2005, the Attorney General\u2019s Office issued Opinion 205-2005 recommending that the Usufruct Contracts be declared *lesivos* on account of invalidity.\n\n\u2022 Second, on January 13, 2006, FEGUA submitted this opinion to the President\u2019s Office with its own recommendation that the Usufruct Contracts be declared *lesivos* on account of nullity. Then the President\u2019s Office transferred the recommendation to the Ministry of Finance for analysis.\n\n\u2022 Third, on April 6, 2006, in a joint opinion three departments of the Ministry of Finance concurred in the *lesividad* of the Usufruct Contracts on account of their invalidity.\n\n\u2022 Fourth, on April 26, 2006, the President decided the issuance of the *lesividad* declaration and began the collection of ministerial signatures.\n\n41.\n\nRespondent contests Claimant\u2019s affirmation that it knew nothing about the *lesividad* process until the Treaty entered into force. Respondent points out that this matter was public knowledge, it was discussed in the press and, on May 11, 2006, \"in the midst of settlement negotiations and before the Treaty entered into force, *Claimant objected to the ongoing lesivo process in light of the settlement negotiations* and required that the *lesivo* process be suspended, the decision of the President put on hold, pending the negotiations.\"15 According to Respondent, on that date, the process was put on hold but if negotiations did not succeed the resolution would need to be adopted because the President would incur personal liability if he did not declare the *lesividad* within the three-year statute of limitations period.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 145. Emphasis in the original.\n\n42.\n\nRespondent alleges that Claimant manipulated the timing of the issuance of the *Lesivo* Resolution. According to Respondent, \"Claimant, after purportedly negotiating with Guatemala for months to settle the disputes that gave rise to the *Lesivo* Resolution, and aware that the *Lesivo* Resolution would not be issued until negotiations [failed], kept negotiations going, but then curiously lost all interest in reaching a negotiated resolution to the dispute soon after CAFTA entered into force.\"16 On the other hand, Respondent finds proof of its own negotiating good faith in the fact that, as late as September 8, 2006, FEGUA offered to negotiate new contracts with Claimant to replace the Usufruct Contracts.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 148.\n\n43.\n\nRespondent argues that the *ratione temporis* constraints cannot be circumvented by asserting a Treaty claim since such interpretation would mean that the *ratione temporis* objection could always be defeated by invoking a different cause of action under the Treaty. Respondent finds support for this argument in *Lucchetti v. Peru*17 and *Impregilo v. Pakistan*18 and affirms that, merely because certain acts took place after the Treaty\u2019s entering into force, \"such circumstances do not obviate the need for the Tribunal to dig deeper in order to determine whether the dispute at bottom relates to the \u2018same subject\u2019 matter as some earlier, pre-Treaty dispute.\"19\n\n*Lucchetti v. Peru*, see note 11 above, quoted in Respondent\u2019s Memorial.\n\n*Impregilo v. Pakistan*, see note 6 above, quoted in Respondent\u2019s Memorial.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial, para. 152\n\n44.\n\nRespondent argues further that, even if Claimant\u2019s assertions are assumed to be true, the evidence shows that the dispute arose before the entry into force of the Treaty. Respondent addresses each of Claimant\u2019s assertions. First, Respondent refers to Claimant\u2019s assertion that the *lesividad* process was used in an attempt to force FVG to withdraw from the local arbitration processes in which FVG has charged FEGUA with breach of contract. According to Respondent, this assertion would mean that Respondent\u2019s maneuver was designed to address the local arbitrations and underlying contractual disputes that arose long before the Treaty\u2019s entry into force.\n\n45.\n\nRespondent refers to two more assertions of Claimant, that it was the purpose of the *lesividad* process: (a) to appropriate FVG\u2019s rolling stock making it impossible for FVG to perform under the basic right-of-way and thus effectively appropriating all of FVG\u2019s business without paying compensation, and (b) to redistribute to Guatemalan private sector companies the benefits of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts. Respondent denies the truthfulness of these assertions but, in its opinion, they show that, by Claimant\u2019s own admission, the *Lesivo* Resolution arose in the context of a pre-Treaty dispute.\n\n46.\n\nAlternatively, Respondent argues that,\n\n\"if the Tribunal takes a narrower view of the scope of the *ratione temporis* objection, and focuses on the specific \u2018acts or facts\u2019 alleged by Claimant as part of its Treaty claims, without regards to the existence of the underlying broader dispute to which these acts and facts relate, Claimant\u2019s claims are still outside the scope of the treaty because its claim centers on an act or fact that took place before the Treaty\u2019s entry into force.\"20\n\n*Ibid*. para. 164.\n\n47.\n\nThen Respondent addresses Claimant\u2019s argument that, if it were not for the *Lesivo* Resolution, the Treaty would not have been breached and affirms that the *lesividad* process was set in motion and the decision to declare the Equipment Usufruct Contracts *lesivos* taken by the President of Guatemala shortly after April 26, 2006 well before the Treaty entered into force. According to Respondent, the *Lesivo* Resolution was inescapable given the unanimous recommendation of the Guatemalan administration to declare the Equipment Usufruct Contracts *lesivos*, and the fact that the President faced personal liability if the resolution was not issued within the statutory limitation of three years, which expired on August 25, 2006.\n\n*B. C**LAIMANT**\u2019**S* *P**OSITION ON THE* *O**BJECTION* *R**ATIONE* *T**EMPORIS*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant contests facts on which Respondent relies in support of its arguments. According to Claimant: (a) FEGUA did not inform FVG of any legal defects with regard to the Equipment Usufruct Contracts in the April 2004 exchange of correspondence between the General Manager of FVG, Mr. Senn and the Director of FEGUA, Dr. Gramajo; (b) discussions between FEGUA and FVG since late 2004 did not concern the validity of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts or whether they were *lesivos* ; (c) FEGUA never conveyed to FVG its concern about the historical and cultural value of the railway equipment assets; (d) during the years 2004-2005, FVG only presented proposals and possible draft contracts at FEGUA\u2019s request, not because FVG deemed a new contract necessary; (e) FEGUA never informed FVG that the parties were at an impasse; (f) Respondent never provided or communicated to FVG any of the legal opinions concerning the *lesivo* character of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts; (g) at the meeting between the Chairman of RDC, Mr. Posner, and President Berger on March 7, 2006 there was no mention that the Equipment Usufruct Contracts were illegal or harmful to the State, the President indicated his desire to see a high-level commission formed to work with RDC and FVG to resolve outstanding contract disputes with FEGUA related to FVG\u2019s arbitrations; and (h) no legal or technical defects of the Usufruct Contracts were discussed at the meetings of the High-Level Commission held on April 3, May 5 and May 10, 2006.\n\n49.\n\nAs to the May 11th meeting of the High-Level Commission, Claimant alleges that Claimant\u2019s representatives heard on the way to the meeting that a document to cancel FVG\u2019s contract was being circulated for signature among the Ministers. At the meeting the Government\u2019s representatives informed the Claimant\u2019s representatives that the Government was not willing to withdraw FEGUA\u2019s legal actions which sought to annul the arbitration clause in Contracts 402 and 820. When confronted with what the Claimant\u2019s representative had heard just before the meeting, the Government\u2019s representatives appeared surprised and, after trying unsuccessfully to contact the persons whom they needed to talk to, stated that they would investigate the issue and stop whatever it was and get back to FVG at the next meeting scheduled for later in the month.\n\n50.\n\nThe meeting scheduled for May 24, 2006 was cancelled by the Government on that same day and no further meetings took place. Through the remainder of May and June 2006 Messrs. Senn and local FVG counsel, Carrasco contacted the High-Level Commission members in an effort to reconvene the meetings. On July 6, 2006, Mr. Carrasco e-mailed the Commission members insisting that negotiations resume. Commission member Ms. Pineda responded only on August 16, 2006 stating that the Government was working on a negotiating proposal. Claimant points out that the President had signed the *Lesivo* Resolution five days earlier.\n\n51.\n\nClaimant affirms that only in mid-August did it learn that the *lesivo* rumor heard on May 11, 2006 was true. According to Claimant, on August 11 Mr. Melville of Cementos Progreso, a minority shareholder of FVG, informed Mr. Posner that at the doing of Mr. Campollo, a local businessman, the Government would declare some aspects of unspecified usufruct contracts of FVG *lesivos.* Mr. Posner instructed Mr. Carrasco to seek the support of the United States Embassy and, to this effect, Mr. Carrasco prepared a fact sheet. Claimant finds support in the fact sheet for its argument that up to then Claimant had no specifics regarding the impending *Lesivo* Resolution and was unaware that it had already been signed.\n\n52.\n\nOn August 24, 2006, representatives of the Government and FVG met. According to Claimant, at this meeting Respondent presented \"a written take-it-or-leave it proposal which principally demanded that FVG renegotiate key terms of Contracts 402 and 820, dismiss its breach of contract arbitrations, and surrender \u2018railway sections yet to be restored in which other investors may be interested;\u2019\"21 this proposal also included \"a minor reference to modifying the terms\"22 of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts. Claimant alleges that Responded \"informed FVG that it intended to issue the Lesivo Resolution with regard to the equipment contracts the next day unless FVG agreed to its demands concerning Contracts 402 and 820 and regardless if FVG was willing to agree to the Government\u2019s requested modifications to the equipment contracts.\"23 Claimant refused Respondent\u2019s demands and the *Lesivo* Resolution was issued the next day.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 35.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n53.\n\nRegarding the specific arguments made in this objection, Claimant agrees with Respondent that CAFTA Article 10.1.3 only serves to \"reaffirm the standing residual rule of customary international law of non-retroactivity embodied in Article 28 of the VCLT [Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]\", but it contests Respondent\u2019s assertion that, due to the Treaty\u2019s non-retroactivity, it must explicitly provide that it applies to disputes that arose prior to the Treaty\u2019s entry into force.\n\n54.\n\nClaimant considers this to be a misstatement of customary international law which, according to Claimant, provides that, \"absent expressly stated party intent to the contrary, an investment treaty applies to *any dispute existing* between the parties at the time of the treaty\u2019s entry into force.\"24 Claimant finds support in the official Commentary to Article 28(3) of the Vienna Convention which states that when \"an act or fact or situation which took place or arose prior to the entry into force of a treaty continues to occur or exist after the treaty has come into force, it will be caught by the provisions of the treaty.\"25 Claimant also refers to the Commentary on Article 28(2) which, based on the *Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions*, concludes that if an agreement uses \"the word \u2018disputes\u2019 without any qualification, the parties are understood as accepting jurisdiction with respect to all disputes existing after the entry into force of the agreement.\"26 Claimant contests the meaning attributed by Respondent to the Sixteenth Session Report of the ILC and quotes the following paragraph: \"[The] word \u2018disputes\u2019 is apt to cover any dispute which exists between the parties after the coming into force of the treaty. *It matters not either that the dispute concerns events which took place prior to that date or that dispute itself arose prior to it* ; for the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration or judicial settlement all their existing disputes without qualification.\"27\n\n*Ibid*. para. 41.\n\n*Ibid.* para. 43.\n\n*Ibid.* para. 44.\n\nReport of the International Law Commission on the Work of its Sixteenth Session, July 11, 1964, Doc. A/CN.4/173, *Yearbook of the ILC*, 1964, Vol. II, p. 178 (emphasis added by Claimant) quoted in para. 47 of the Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial.\n\n55.\n\nClaimant argues that this is how Article 25 of the ICSID Convention has been construed by the doctrine and arbitral tribunals. Claimant points out that the cases of *Lucchetti v. Peru* and *Vieira v. Chile*, relied on by Respondent, concern treaties which specifically provide that they do not apply to disputes prior to their entry into force. Claimant observes that Respondent ignores in its argument that \"the obvious reason for the inclusion of specific language barring pre-entry disputes in the Chile BITs at issue in *Lucchetti* and *Vieira* was to bar a category of disputes that otherwise would *not* be excluded from the treaties\u2019 respective jurisdiction.\"28\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 55. Emphasis in the original.\n\n56.\n\nClaimant dismisses the relevance of other arbitral case law relied on by Respondent because on closer analysis it does not support Respondent\u2019s position. Claimant further refers to the decision of the arbitral tribunal in *Chevron v. Ecuador* where the tribunal rejected Ecuador\u2019s *ratione temporis* objection because the treaty\u2019s temporal restrictions referred to investments and not disputes.\n\n57.\n\nAfter rebutting Respondent\u2019s arguments based on arbitral jurisprudence, Claimant addresses the text of the Treaty itself. Claimant argues that nowhere in CAFTA Article 10.15 (Consultation and Negotiation) and CAFTA Article 10.16 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration) or elsewhere in Chapter 10 does the Treaty qualify or restrict the types of investment disputes that may be submitted to arbitration. Claimant points out that the term \"measure\" as used in the Treaty relates to a national or an enterprise of a State party that has made an investment in the territory of another Party in existence as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement, and reasons:\n\n\"RDC is the \u2018investor\u2019 in Article 10.1(a), FVG is the \u2018covered investment\u2019 in Article 10.1(b), and the \u2018measure(s) adopted or maintained by [Respondent]\u2019 that form the basis for RDC\u2019s \u2018claim(s)\u2019 under Article 10.16 are \u2018the Lesivo Resolution and.subsequent conduct of the Respondent pursuant to the Lesivo Resolution.\u2019 These measures adopted by Respondent \u2018breached.an obligation under Section A.\u2019 The initial breach, the Lesivo Resolution, was officially declared on August 25, 2006 by publication in the Guatemalan Official Gazette; additional breaches arising from Respondent\u2019s subsequent conduct pursuant to the Lesivo Resolution by definition occurred after August 25, 2006.\"29\n\n*Ibid*. para. 76.\n\n58.\n\nClaimant concludes that the parties to the Treaty chose not to define the Treaty\u2019s *ratione temporis* jurisdiction by reference to the timing of the dispute and instead chose the timing of a \"measure\", the State act complained of. Claimant sees bad faith on the part of the Respondent when it fails to take this into account in its Memorial and had relied on it in its previous preliminary objection.\n\n59.\n\nClaimant offers an alternative argument should the Tribunal find that it has no jurisdiction over disputes that arose prior to the Treaty\u2019s entry into force. It is Claimant\u2019s contention that there was in fact no dispute between Claimant and Respondent in respect of the *Lesivo* Resolution or any of the alleged legal defects in the Equipment Usufruct Contracts before the Treaty entered into force. As a further alternative argument, Claimant contends that its Treaty claims are based on a *different dispute*,30 one that arose after the Treaty entered into force.\n\n*Ibid*. para. 83. Emphasis added by Claimant.\n\n60.\n\nAs regards the first alternative argument, Claimant points out that most of the events Respondent relies upon were internal to Respondent and FEGUA and cannot have been part of a dispute with FVG. Claimant relies on the six factors which characterize a dispute outlined by the *Vieira* tribunal to show that no dispute existed with Respondent prior to the Treaty entering into force. First, \"there was absolutely NO communication between Respondent and Claimant prior to CAFTA\u2019s entry into force about the Government\u2019s intention to declare these contracts [the Equipment Usufruct Contracts] *lesivo*.\"31 Second, \"With minimal exception, the Government went to great lengths NOT to communicate to Claimant either the nature of the contracts\u2019 alleged legal defects or the possibility of using *lesivo* to take over RDC\u2019s investment prior to August 2006, when the *Lesivo* Resolution issued.\"32\n\n*Ibid*. para. 89. Emphasis added by Claimant.\n\n*Ibid*. Emphasis added by Claimant.\n\n61.\n\nClaimant points out that, prior to the *Lesivo* Resolution, Respondent never communicated to Claimant any of the legal opinions on the alleged *lesivo* nature of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts and, as to the illegalities of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts, the only communication identified by Respondent is the letter of April 14, 2004 of Dr. Gramajo to Mr. Senn attaching FEGUA legal opinion 47-2004 which does not mention any of the alleged illegalities. Dr. Gramajo\u2019s transmittal letter simply denied Mr. Senn\u2019s request.\n\n62.\n\nClaimant argues that the \"conversations\" to which Dr. Gramajo refers can hardly constitute a dispute when the two parties seem to be of one mind to solve the existing problems. Claimant observes that the issues identified were almost entirely within Respondent\u2019s control and, while Respondent never offered to solve them, there is no evidence that it ever refused to do so, \"thereby potentially creating a dispute.\"33\n\n*Ibid*. para. 92.\n\n63.\n\nClaimant contests Respondent\u2019s argument based on FEGUA\u2019s purported concern for the condition of the railroad equipment as historical and cultural patrimony of the State. According to Claimant, prior to the *Lesivo* Resolution, Respondent never declared any of FEGUA\u2019s railway equipment or rolling stock to be part of its cultural and historic patrimony, and this contention does not appear in the *Lesivo* Resolution itself.\n\n64.\n\nClaimant also points out that Dr. Gramajo\u2019s concern about cannibalization of equipment is raised now for the first time. According to Claimant, there is nothing in the Equipment Usufruct Contracts or in the predecessor Contract 41 which prohibited FVG from removing parts from unused equipment to be used in working equipment. Claimant also refers to the criminal complaint filed by FEGUA against FVG in order to safeguard railway equipment cited by Dr. Gramajo and observes that it was not legally notified of the suit until after the Treaty entered into force and no ruling has been issued by the court to this date.\n\n65.\n\nClaimant argues in great detail how the exchanges that took place at the May 11th meeting of the High Level Commission do not constitute a disagreement which implies \"a minimum of communication between the parties\" as put by the *Vieira* tribunal.\n\n66.\n\nClaimant continues with its analysis of the May 11th meeting and of the events that preceded the issuance of the *Lesivo* Resolution to show that the remainder of the requirements for a dispute to exist, as set forth by the *Vieira* tribunal, were lacking before the entry into force of the Treaty. Claimant argues that there was neither a disagreement on a point of law or fact expressed at the May 11th meeting or at any other meeting of the High-Level Commission; at that meeting or afterwards no argument took place which reflected a situation in which the parties had clearly opposing positions in regard to an issue of fact or of law; there is no authentic oral or written registration of a disagreement either in the minutes of the May 11th meeting or thereafter, in fact, according to Claimant, the offer of Commissioner Fern\u00e1ndez to suspend any consideration of *lesivo* is the antithesis of registering a disagreement; and there was no concrete claim of Claimant before the Treaty\u2019s entry into force because, in the aftermath of the May 11th meeting, Respondent misled Claimant to believe that any governmental action was in abeyance. Claimant concludes by saying that the May 11th meeting was not the origin or the source of a dispute between the parties regarding the declaration of *lesividad* of the Usufruct Contracts.\n\n67.\n\nClaimant argues alternatively that, even assuming that Respondent\u2019s assertions are true, Claimant\u2019s Treaty claims are based on a different dispute than any dispute between the parties that arose prior to the Treaty\u2019s entry into force. According to Claimant, the declaration of *lesividad* is a new and separate dispute from that concerning the validity of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts under Guatemalan law.\n\n68.\n\nClaimant finds support for this contention in *Jan de Nul v. Egypt*.34 As in that case, any dispute that allegedly existed between Claimant and Respondent prior to entry into force of the Treaty with regard to the Equipment Usufruct Contracts would have been decided in accordance with Guatemalan law and FEGUA never presented its claims against FVG in a domestic court. It also finds support in *Lucchetti v. Peru* since the entry of a new actor can be a decisive factor in determining whether the dispute is a new dispute.35 The new actor in the instant case is the President of Guatemala and the Cabinet Ministers who intervened to issue the *Lesivo* Resolution. Furthermore, according to Claimant, \"the separate and distinct nature of the *Lesivo* Resolution from any of the alleged contract disputes between FVG and FEGUA is confirmed by the fact that the *lesivo* claim the Government filed in Administrative Court subsequent to the *Lesivo* Resolution was filed against *both FVG and FEGUA*.\"36\n\n*Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13), Decision on Jurisdiction, June 16, 2006.\n\n*Lucchetti*, see note 11 above, quoted in Claimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial.\n\n*Ibid*. para. 141. Emphasis added by Claimant.\n\n69.\n\nOn the basis of *Mondev v. United States*37 and *Tecmed v. United States*,38 the Claimant contends that it is permissible to refer to the conduct of Respondent prior to the Treaty\u2019s entry into force in order to provide context to the Respondent\u2019s issuance of the *Lesivo* Resolution and subsequent conduct of Respondent.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award, October 11, 2002, 6 ICSID Rep.181.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award, May 29, 2003.\n\n70.\n\nClaimant rebuts Respondent\u2019s argument that the act of declaring the Equipment Usufruct Contracts *lesivos* actually took place when the President decided to take such action in April 2006 following the unanimous opinion of his advisors; and that, barring settlement, the President had no option but to go through with the declaration to avoid potential personal liability. Claimant argues that: (a) there is no evidence of any such decision except hearsay within hearsay; (b) Respondent\u2019s own expert does not attempt to define the legal act of declaring *lesividad* as the moment the President decides in his own head to begin the necessary administrative process to issue such declaration; and (c) Guatemalan administrative law specifically forbids to take as a resolution the opinions given by any legal or technical advisor: \"The judgment of the President of the Republic cannot be constitutionally or legally substituted by the judgment of his legal advisors or other lower ranking Government officials, no matter how many opinions and recommendations they provide.\"39\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 155.\n\n**2. SECOND OBJECTION: THE TRIBUNAL LACKS JURISDICTION BECAUSE THEALLEGED INVESTMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE USUFRUCT CONTRACTS IS NOT A COVERED INVESTMENT UNDER THE TREATY (OBJECTION** ***R******ATIONE*** ***M******ATERIAE*****)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*A. R**ESPONDENT**\u2019**S* *P**OSITION ON THE* *O**BJECTION* *R**ATIONE* *M**ATERIAE*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nRespondent bases this objection on CAFTA Article 10.28(g), which includes in the definition of \"investment\", \"licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar rights conferred pursuant to domestic law\". Respondent argues that the Equipment Usufruct Contracts are in the nature of \"licenses, authorizations, permits and similar rights\". The purpose of Contract 143 was to confer to FVG the use, enjoyment, repair and maintenance of the railroad equipment identified in that contract, for rendering of services in the different branches of the railroad service. Contrary to what is asserted by Claimant, the Usufruct Contracts are not run-of-the-mill concession contracts but \"usufruct contracts that involve the inherent governmental function of granting to a private third party the permission and right to use a public good.\"40\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial. para. 179.\n\n72.\n\nRespondent goes on to argue that, according to CAFTA Article 10.28(g), licenses, authorizations permits and similar rights need to be conferred \"pursuant to domestic law\" if they are to constitute investments; if they do not create rights protected under domestic law, they \"do not have the characteristics of an investment.\" It is the contention of Respondent that the Equipment Usufruct Contracts suffer from grave legal defects; they were not awarded through a public bidding process and were not approved by an *Acuerdo Gubernativo*. Accordingly they were not conferred pursuant to Guatemalan law. Respondent explains that, although the terms of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts were assumed to have been based on the bidding terms intended for Contract 41, Guatemalan law required a new bidding term for the new contract which was signed four years after the Contract 41 bidding process. The absence of new bidding terms was one of the key grounds of the *Lesivo* Resolution.\n\n73.\n\nRespondent affirms that Claimant was well aware of these requirements having participated in the bidding process of other usufruct contracts included the intended Contract 41. Respondent contests the Claimant\u2019s allegation that Clause 10 of Contract 402 already conferred rights over the rolling stock. Respondent explains that this clause needs to be read together with the bidding terms of that contract which provide for a subsequent bidding process to acquire the rolling stock that it deems convenient for its activities, and it shows that Claimant was aware of this requirement.\n\n74.\n\nRespondent further explains that FEGUA\u2019s authority as an autonomous agency is limited to the powers delegated to it by the Guatemalan Congress and the powers of the *Interventor* of FEGUA are in turn limited to those specified in FEGUA\u2019s Organic Law, which in either case do not include the authority to grant usufruct rights to private parties of the public railway stock without the President\u2019s approval through an *Acuerdo Gubernativo*. Respondent alleges that Claimant was aware of this requirement, having participated in the bidding processes of Contracts 402 and 41; in particular it was well aware that Contract 41 never entered into force for lack of this requirement. Furthermore, Respondent points out that Claimant was sufficiently concerned over the validity of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts to seek their \"official recognition\".\n\n75.\n\nRespondent considers misleading the contention of Claimant that Contract 41 was replaced by Contract 143 at the Government\u2019s request. Respondent observes that one year after the execution of Contract 41 and being aware that the *Acuerdo Gubernativo* was not forthcoming, Claimant\u2019s General Manager wrote to FEGUA\u2019s *Interventor* seeking alternative ways to ensure that they could use the equipment. Respondent also alleges that the Equipment Usufruct Contracts were prepared by Claimant in an attempt to circumvent a legal precondition for the use of rolling stock.\n\n76.\n\nRespondent explains that the approval by the Guatemalan Executive was not a mere formality but a substantive requirement under Guatemalan law; lack of this approval meant that none of these contracts generated usufruct rights. Respondent adds that the \"reasons for that approval not having been obtained have no bearing on this dispute, and the tribunal could not make a determination about them because they predate the entering into force of the Treaty.\"41\n\n*Ibid*. para. 199.\n\n77.\n\nRespondent concludes that the Equipment Usufruct Contracts are not \"covered investments\" under CAFTA Article 10.28(g) because they were not conferred in accordance with Guatemalan law and, therefore, pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and CAFTA Article 10.17, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Guatemala has not consented to submit to arbitration legal disputes that do not arise out of a \"covered investment\".\n\n*B. C**LAIMANT**\u2019**S* *P**OSITION ON THE* *O**BJECTION* *R**ATIONE* *M**ATERIAE*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nClaimant refers to the broad definition of investment under CAFTA and points out its non-exhaustive character. Claimant argues that its covered investment is not defined or limited to the Equipment Usufruct Contracts, but consists of its controlling interest in and ownership of shares in its investment enterprise FVG: \"It is through this investment and ownership stake in FVG that RDC had an \u2018expectation of gain\u2019, not only through the profits that FVG was expected to earn through the Usufruct (which could have been paid to RDC in the form of dividends), but also through the expected increased equity value of FVG as the business enterprise operating the Usufruct.\"42 Furthermore, \"even if one were to construe the nature of RDC\u2019s covered investment on the basis of the bundle of rights granted to FVG by Guatemala pursuant to *all of the* Usufruct Contacts43, it would still satisfy the Article 10.28 [of the Treaty] definition of \u2018investment\u2019 because the Usufruct was an \u2018asset\u2019 that RDC indirectly owned that had the \u2018expectation of gain or profit.\u2019\"44\n\n*Ibid*., para. 162.\n\nIn this context the term \"Usufruct Contracts\" includes Contract No. 402.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 164. Emphasis added by Claimant.\n\n79.\n\nClaimant contests the characterization of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts as \"concessions over public goods\". Claimant refers to the Guatemalan Civil Code distinction between goods under public domain of \"common use\" and of \"special use\". The latter are those destined for the services of state decentralized entities such as FEGUA. According to Claimant, this mischaracterization implies that the Usufruct Contracts are not \"licenses, concessions, authorizations, permits and similar rights\" as contended by Respondent.\n\n80.\n\nClaimant further argues that the expression \"conferred pursuant to domestic law\" in CAFTA Article 10.28(g) refers to the validity of the investment and not to its definition. Claimant observes that this expression appears only in Article 10.28(g) and contends that, even assuming *arguendo* that the Equipment Usufruct Contracts fall under Article 10.28(g), this article does not limit the definition of what constitutes an \"investment\" under this provision but is concerned with the legality of the investment.\n\n81.\n\nClaimant rebuts Respondent\u2019s argument that the Equipment Usufruct Contracts were void *ad initio* under Guatemalan law. According to Claimant, the Equipment Usufruct Contracts were \"conferred pursuant to domestic law\". Claimant points out that Respondent has not alleged that RDC or FVG committed any acts in violation of Guatemalan law in obtaining or entering into the Equipment Usufruct Contracts but it has argued that they are not \"protected investments because a State-owned entity, FEGUA, acted in violation of Guatemalan law by entering into these agreements without initiating a new public bidding process and obtaining Executive approval.\"45\n\n*Ibid*. para. 178.\n\n82.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent is estopped from objecting to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae* because FEGUA provided a legal opinion of its legal advisors to RDC and other potential bidders to the effect that the bidding rules complied with Guatemalan law and each of the Equipment Usufruct Contracts set forth the legal capacity of FEGUA\u2019s representative to enter into the contract and the legal basis for the contract. Furthermore, Contract 143 states that \"[t]his contract shall be in force as of its endorsement, without need of subsequent authorization from any other authority\", a statement contrary to later assertions by the Government that Contract 143 is void because it was not awarded pursuant to a separate public bidding process and not authorized or approved by *Acuerdo Gubernativo*.\n\n83.\n\nClaimant recalls that during nine years Respondent allowed FVG to perform Contract 402 and the Equipment Usufruct Contracts. RDC further argues that it reasonably relied upon the Government\u2019s representations and actions in making its initial and subsequent investments and concludes that the Government\u2019s conduct generated in RDC expectations protected by international law and Respondent is estopped from asserting that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae*.\n\n**3.

R**ESPONDENT**\u2019**S* *P**OSITION ON THE* *T**HIRD* *O**BJECTION*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThis objection was the subject of the First Decision on Jurisdiction and the subsequent Decision on Clarification. Respondent includes it in its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction because Claimant, in its Memorial on the Merits, \"insists on raising claims based on the same measures that are at issue in the local arbitrations, measures that the Tribunal already ruled were excluded from this arbitration by virtue of Claimant\u2019s failure to adequately meet the threshold requirement of Article 10.18.2 of the Treaty.\"46\n\n*Ibid*. para. 224.\n\n85.\n\nRespondent re-affirms that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear claims related to the removal of squatters from the right of way of the railroad and related to FEGUA\u2019s payments into the Trust Fund because they are the subject of local arbitration proceedings and Claimant has failed to waive its right to continue those proceedings. Respondent supports its contention with arguments which the Tribunal heard in connection with the first round of preliminary objections to its jurisdiction and for which Respondent finds support in the Decisions of the Tribunal. They will not be repeated here.\n\n*B. C**LAIMANT**\u2019**S* *P**OSITION ON* *T**HIRD* *O**BJECTION*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nClaimant explains that its claim of breach of fair and equitable treatment is based upon the *Lesivo* Resolution and not Respondent\u2019s failure to remove squatters. According to Claimant, the Memorial on the Merits clearly states that \"the Government\u2019s action in issuing the *Lesivo* Resolution, in violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, served to undermine *RDC\u2019s investment-backed expectations*, one of which was RDC\u2019s reasonable expectation that the Government would protect the railway against squatters.\"47\n\n*Ibid*. para. 189. Emphasis added by Claimant.\n\n87.\n\nClaimant further explains in respect of its full protection and security claim that the type of measures at issue in FVG\u2019s claim in the local arbitrations are different from the measures on which Claimant relies in this arbitration. In the case of the local arbitration, FVG\u2019s claim is against FEGUA, as legal owner of the railway right-of-way, for breaching its contractual obligation to bring legal actions to evict squatters from the right of way. In the case of the Treaty arbitration, Claimant relies \"upon the failure of an entirely different organ of the Government of Guatemala - the local police and law enforcement authorities - to provide any semblance of physical or legal protection to FVG\u2019s property and assets (and, hence, RDC\u2019s investment) after the issuance of the *Lesivo* Resolution.\"48\n\n*Ibid*. para. 193.\n\n88.\n\nFinally, Claimant disputes that its claims are based upon Respondent\u2019s failure to make Trust Fund payments as alleged by Respondent. According to Claimant, references to such failure are in \"the context of factual background.and in discussing the reasonable factual assumptions underlying FVG\u2019s Business Plan.\"49\n\n*Ibid*. para. 198.\n\n**4. RELIEF REQUESTED**\n-----------------------\n\n89.\n\nRespondent has requested that the Tribunal dismiss all claims of Claimant for lack of jurisdiction and order Claimant to pay Respondent\u2019s costs, legal fees, and share of administrative expenses incurred in these proceedings.\n\n90.\n\nClaimant requests that the Tribunal deny the jurisdictional objections without any further briefing or hearings and award Claimant its reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees in responding to Respondent\u2019s objections.\n\n**IV. POST-HEARING SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**1. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S QUESTIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nAfter the hearing the Tribunal requested that the parties answer the following questions:\n\n(a) On the assumption (which is understood is in dispute) that a declaration of lesividad involves a measure of judgment or discretion can it really be said that a contract subsequently declared lesivo is unlawful *ab initio*.\n\n(b) Can a contract be declared lesivo as a result of facts occurring after its conclusion?\n\n(c) Can the Administrative Tribunal disagree with an executive determination of lesividad? Has the Administrative Tribunal ever done so? If so, how can it be said that the executive declaration is decisive for CAFTA purposes?\n\n(d) What are the publication requirements of acts of the administration under Guatemalan law? Can it be said that the declaration of lesividad was legally finalized prior to proper notification to the complainant via publication, with a list of reasons for the act?\n\n(e) Why was Contract 41 never approved? Why did each side proceed under Contract 41 (and then Contracts 143 and 158) as though there was a legal contract in place?\n\n**2. THE PARTIES\u2019 REPLIES**\n---------------------------\n\n*A. R**EPLIES TO THE* *F**IRST* *Q**UESTION*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nRespondent replied that a contract declared *lesivo* by the competent judicial authority is deemed unlawful *ab initio*. According to Respondent, Guatemala cannot unilaterally declare a contract *lesivo* and cease performance. Respondent explains that the governmental agency concerned must continue to operate under the contract until the Administrative Tribunal declares the contract unlawful *ab initio* ; if it does so, the Administrative Tribunal orders that the parties restore things to their respective positions before the agreement was entered into, thus avoiding any unjust enrichment due to the partial *de facto* performance of the contract declared *lesivo*.\n\n93.\n\nRespondent explains further that a determination of *lesividad* by the Executive is not binding on the Administrative Tribunal, and the State has the burden of proof to establish that the contract concerned is unlawful and prejudicial.\n\n94.\n\nClaimant draws a distinction between the concepts of \"legality\" and \"harmfulness to the interests of the State\". Claimant explains that the lawfulness of a contract is a matter of the law of contracts and not *lesividad*. According to Claimant, a contract may comply with Guatemalan law and still be harmful to the interests of one of the parties; the legality of a usufruct contract is regulated by the civil law on contracts while the *lesividad* is a procedure regulated by the *Ley de lo Contencioso Administrativo*. It is the view of Claimant that \"The availability to the State of separate and distinct remedies in the civil and administrative courts to declare a contract void *ab initio* or voidable due to various legal defects demonstrates that Guatemalan law draws a clear distinction between the \u2018legality\u2019 of a contract and *\u2018lesividad\u2019* of a contract.\"50\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 8. Emphasis in the original.\n\n95.\n\nClaimant concludes by affirming that the declaration of *lesivo* should not be based on the technical defects of a contract which can be otherwise remedied but because, in the judgment of the President of Guatemala, \"the announced interests of the State upon which the contract is based were capricious or because the terms of the contract were not reasonably related to those announced interests.\"51\n\n*Ibid*. para. 11.\n\n*B. R**EPLIES TO THE* *S**ECOND* *Q**UESTION*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nRespondent replied in the negative and explained that \"*lesividad* is determined by legal defects and illegalities relating to the contract\u2019s formation and the terms of the contract as such, and not by supervening causes or subsequent conduct by the parties. This helps to explain why a contract declared *lesivo* is deemed unlawful *ab initio*.\"52\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 12.\n\n97.\n\nClaimant replied substantially in similar terms. According to Claimant, \"the nature of *lesivo* itself and the structure of the procedures concerning the declaration of *lesividad*,.indicate that independent facts occurring subsequent to the formation of the contract cannot be considered as a ground for l *esivo*.\"53 Claimant considers that this view is confirmed by the fact that \"the statute of limitations on declaring *lesividad* runs three years from the date of the contract, not from some subsequent event\",54 and by the fact that none of the declarations of *lesivo* over the last 20 years have relied on independent post-execution facts.55\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 13.\n\n*Ibid*. para. 14.\n\n*Ibid*. para. 16.\n\n*C. R**EPLIES TO THE* *T**HIRD* *Q**UESTION*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nRespondent replied that the Administrative Tribunal is an independent branch of government under Guatemalan law and free to disagree with the executive declaration of *lesiv* o: \"The court\u2019s mandate in those cases is to objectively and independently assess whether the contract in question is lesivo, considering the evidence presented both by the Attorney General and the private party to the contract.\"56 Respondent explained that in the last thirty years only one decision has been rendered based on *lesividad* claims and in that instance the State prevailed. However, Respondent points out that, in the case of the *lesividad claim* concerning Contracts 143 and 158, the Administrative Tribunal has twice decided against requests of the Attorney General for the suspension of those contracts, which shows, according to Respondent, the independence of this adjudicatory body.57\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 18.\n\n*Ibid*. para. 22.\n\n99.\n\nRespondent considers that the President\u2019s decision of *lesivo* is decisive, \"because that act or fact, which serves as the basis for Claimant\u2019s claim, is an act or fact that occurred and was completed *before* the entry into force of CAFTA.\"58 Respondent reasons that \"At that precise moment, the President made an official determination that could not be reversed without incurring in personal liability, unless the parties reached a negotiated solution that would resolve causes giving rise to the *lesividad* of Contracts 143/158.\"59 However, the President\u2019s declaration is \"not necessarily decisive when one considers liability under CAFTA, because that executive declaration of *lesividad,* by itself, has no legal effect other than instructing the Attorney General to initiate a claim against Ferrov\u00edas in the *Contencioso Administrativo* court.\"60 In this respect, Respondent recalls that Claimant has had no legal or other impediment to operate in Guatemala while the *lesividad* proceeding is pending.61\n\n*Ibid*. para. 23. Emphasis in the original.\n\n*Ibid*. para. 24.\n\n*Ibid*. para. 28. Emphasis in the original.\n\n*Ibid*. para. 29.\n\n100.\n\nClaimant agrees that, as a technical legal matter, the Administrative Tribunal can disagree with the President\u2019s finding of *lesivo* but it points out that \"there exists no known case where an Administrative Tribunal has disagreed with or denied a Government *lesivo* claim when such claim was made within the requisite three-year time frame for such claims.\"62 According to Claimant, \"*lesivo* is little more than a thinly guised methodology for State-sponsored extortion\" because once a *lesivo* claim is filed the Government may not desist from it and thus settlement may be justified only on terms favorable to the Government.63 Claimant considers that, for CAFTA purposes, \"it is the declaration of *lesividad* and not the subsequent Administrative Court proceeding, which is substantively decisive because a *lesividad* declaration has immediate and profound negative consequences on the private contracting party.\"64\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 19.\n\n*Ibid*. para. 22.\n\n*Ibid*. para. 24.\n\n*D. R**EPLIES TO THE* *F**OURTH* *Q**UESTION*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nRespondent explains that the purpose of the publication of a *lesivo* declaration is to instruct the Attorney General to present a *lesividad* claim before the courts within three months of its publication and not to notify private parties (in the instant case the Claimant), that the contracts are *lesivo* nor of the reasons for such declaration. Publication of the instruction has no legal effect in itself as regards the private parties\u2019 rights. Respondent explains further that the legal justification for the finding of contracts *lesivo* is formally presented before the Administrative Tribunal. Thereafter private parties are notified and have the opportunity to rebut it, as was the case of Claimant.65 According to Respondent, notice to Claimant officially or otherwise does not affect the finality of the President\u2019s decision.66\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 33.\n\n*Ibid*. para. 37.\n\n102.\n\nClaimant replies that, *inter alia*, *Acuerdos Gubernativos* require publication under Guatemalan law which is explained by the fact that the private parties are not party to the proceedings leading to the declaration of *lesividad* and are not given notice otherwise. Furthermore, without publication, the declaration of *lesividad* has no legal effect, \"no party other than the President and his Cabinet can take official notice of a declaration\u2019s existence in order to take specific action until after it is published.\" Claimant reasons that \"if the Government actually believed that publication of the declaration had no legal significance in relation to the three-year statute of limitations, it would not have made sure that publication took place prior to the expiration of the limitations period.\"67\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 27 and 28.\n\n103.\n\nClaimant notes that, contrary to the presupposition underlying the Tribunal\u2019s question, the lesivo declaration contains no list of reasons and only refers to the report of FEGUA\u2019s Overseer and the Solicitor General office\u2019s opinion which were not in the public domain or provided to FVG.68\n\n*Ibid*. para. 29.\n\n*E. R**EPLIES TO THE* *F**IFTH* *Q**UESTION*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the reasons for the lack of approval of Contract 41 \"remain essentially unclear based on the evidence of record.\"69 However, Respondent notes that Ferrov\u00edas never utilized the legal remedies open to it in such circumstance. Respondent emphatically denies that the parties ever considered that Contract 41 entered into force or operated as if it were in force. On the other hand, Contracts 143 and 158 are \"technically in force and must be observed by the parties -notwithstanding its [sic] illegalities- at least until such time as the *Contencioso Administrativo* court decides whether those Contracts are *lesivo* and should be declared null *ab initio\"*70\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 38.\n\n*Ibid*. para. 44.\n\n105.\n\nIn its reply Claimant first points out that it is not correct to state that Contract 41 was never \"approved\" by the Government since the Government had approved and published the bidding terms and conditions. At most, according to Claimant, it can be argued that Contract 41 was not ratified by the President. Claimant also observes that,\n\n\"Despite the Government\u2019s purported position that such ratification was necessary and essential, it never provided FVG with any reason or explanation as to why it did not or could not obtain ratification.Even to this day, FVG does not know or understand why the Government never obtained Executive ratification of Contracts 41 and 143, and Respondent\u2019s witnesses have certainly not offered any logical or credible explanation for the Government\u2019s failure to do so.\"71\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 35. Emphasis in the original.\n\n106.\n\nAs to the second part of the question, Claimant believed that Contract 143 was legal, and \"Entirely consistent with the fact that FVG had been using the railroad equipment without objection or protest from the Government for *six years* prior to the execution of Contract 143 on August 28, 2003. Contract 143 specifically provided that no further Executive approval or ratification of the contract was necessary.\"72\n\n*Ibid*. para. 37.\n\n**V. THE REPUBLIC OF EL SALVADOR\u2019S SUBMISSION AS A CAFTA NON-DISPUTINGPARTY**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nEl Salvador filed comments under Article 10.20.2 on the issue whether CAFTA Chapter Ten applies to disputes that existed before CAFTA entered into force and remain unresolved after CAFTA entered into force.\n\n108.\n\nBased on CAFTA Article 10.1.1 and Article 10.1.3, it is El Salvador\u2019s opinion that consent to arbitration by CAFTA parties does not include \"consent to arbitration with respect to measures adopted or any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of CAFTA for the consenting Party.\"73 El Salvador is confirmed in this opinion by CAFTA Article 10.15 which begins with the words \"In the event of an investment dispute...\" According to El Salvador this phrase when read together with CAFTA Article 10.1.1 and Article 10.1.3 \"can only mean an investment dispute based on CAFTA, i.e. an investment dispute that arose after CAFTA entered into force.\"74 El Salvador concludes that Chapter Ten is prospective and \"a dispute that existed before CAFTA entered into force that remains unresolved after CAFTA entered into force, cannot give rise to a claim for a violation of the substantive provisions of CAFTA.\"75\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s Submission, para. 5.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 6.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 7.\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal invited the parties to comment on El Salvador\u2019s submission. The parties had addressed the issue of the applicability of CAFTA to continuing disputes in their memorials. Claimant\u2019s communication refers to its prior submissions and arguments and considers that El Salvador\u2019s submission does not warrant further comments. Respondent supports the views expressed by El Salvador which it considers to be consistent with its position in this proceeding.\n\n**VI. ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------\n\n**1. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n110.\n\nBefore addressing the objections to jurisdiction raised by Respondent, the Tribunal will consider as preliminary matters the law to be applied and its jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention.\n\n111.\n\nThe law to be applied by the Tribunal at this jurisdictional phase is not a matter in dispute. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is governed by Chapter Ten of CAFTA and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and, to the extent required for their interpretation, the Tribunal will have recourse to customary international law as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties.\n\n112.\n\nExcept for the issue of whether an investment which does not conform to the laws of Respondent may qualify as an investment under the ICSID Convention, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the ICSID Convention as such has not been a matter of contention between the parties. It is undisputed that Claimant is not a national of Respondent, that the dispute between the parties is a legal dispute and that the dispute arises out of an investment. The Tribunal does not need to dwell on the extensive case law on the characteristics to be met by an investment to be considered such under the ICSID Convention76 or on whether such characteristics are in the nature of jurisdictional conditions.77 Based on the facts of this case, Claimant\u2019s investment was risky, substantial, of long duration, there was an expectation of return and it would assist in the resumption of rail transport in Guatemala, which Respondent judged \"*un objetivo de inter\u00e9s econ\u00f3mico para las actividades productivas de la naci\u00f3n.*\"78 The Tribunal will consider the issue of the legality of the investment and its relevance to qualify as such under the ICSID Convention as part of its analysis of the Second Objection to its jurisdiction.\n\nSee *e.g.* *Salini Construttori and Intalstrade v. Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4) Decision on Jurisdiction, July 16, 2001. *See also* *Joy Mining Machinery, Ltd. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11), Decision on Jurisdiction, August 6, 2004, para. 53; *Jan de Nul N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13), Decision on Jurisdiction, June 16, 2006, at para. 91; *Helnan International Hotels A/S v. The Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19), Decision on Objection to Jurisdiction, October 17, 2006, at para. 77; *L.E.S.I.-DIPENTA v. Republic of Algeria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/08), Decision on Jurisdiction, July 12, 2006.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that several recent tribunals have discussed this issue in depth -- see *e.g. *Malaysian Historical Salvors, SDN, BHD v. Malaysia*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/10), Decision on the Application of Annulment of April 16, 2009*\u00a0(Award and Dissent); *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Limited v. United Republic of Tanzania*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22), Award, July 24, 2008, paras. 310, 312-318).\n\nCla\u00fasula Primera, Contract 402 (\"an objective of economic interest to the productive capacities of the nation\").\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal will now proceed to analyze each of the objections.\n\n**2. OBJECTION** ***R******ATIONE*** ***T******EMPORIS***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe following issues emerge from the parties\u2019 exchanges on the *ratione temporis* objection and are listed in the order they will be addressed by the Tribunal: i) first, the date of the measure subject of the claim; is the critical date the date the *lesivo* process began or the date of publication of the *Lesivo* Resolution?; ii) Second, is there a dispute between the parties and, if the answer is yes, when did the dispute begin?; iii) Third, if it is the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the dispute began before the date of entry into force of the Treaty, is it the intention of the Treaty to cover disputes which began before such date?\n\n115.\n\nRespondent has based its first objection on CAFTA Article 10.1.3 and Article 28 of the Vienna Convention. For ease of reference, it is convenient to reproduce the text of these provisions. CAFTA Article 10.1.3 reads as follows:\n\n\"For greater certainty, this Chapter does not bind any Party in relation to any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Agreement.\"\n\nArticle 28 of the Vienna Convention provides:\n\n\"Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.\"\n\n116.\n\nThe consent of Respondent to arbitration is limited to breaches of obligations undertaken by Respondent under the Treaty. Therefore, to paraphrase Article 28 in positive terms, the Tribunal has jurisdiction in respect of any act or fact that took place or any situation that continued to exist after the Treaty entered into force. The Treaty cannot be breached before it entered into force: \"An act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs.\"79\n\nArticle 13, International Law Commission, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, adopted in the Annual Report of the International Law Commission on its Fifty-third Session (April 23- June 1 and July 2- August 10, 2001), A/56/10 ch. IV, endorsed by UNGA res. 56/83, December 12, 2001.\n\n117.\n\nIt will be useful to recall here that in the First Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal determined that:\n\n\"(b)... the waivers submitted by the Claimant pursuant to Article 10.18.2 are valid in respect of the claim arising from the Lesivo Resolution and from subsequent conduct of the Respondent pursuant to the Lesivo Resolution and, therefore, fulfill the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration conditions under Article 10.18 in respect of that claim.\"80\n\nFirst Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, November 17, 2008, para. 76.\n\n118.\n\nThe *Lesivo* Resolution is an act of the Government under preparation since before the Treaty entered into force. To be issued, the resolution needed approval by *Acuerdo Gubernativo* signed by all Government Ministers and the President, who signed it last on August 11, 2006. Publication of the resolution was two weeks later on August 25, 2006.\n\n119.\n\nIf the President had not signed the *Acuerdo Gubernativo* and the Resolution had not been published, the measure represented by the *Lesivo* Resolution would not have come into existence as expressly stated in its Article 3: *\"El presente Acuerdo Gubernativo* *empieza a regir**al d\u00eda siguiente de su publicaci\u00f3n en el Diario de Centro Am\u00e9rica*\"81 The Tribunal remains unconvinced, as argued by Respondent, of the inevitability of the *lesivo* process and the lack of discretion of the President to sign or not to sign a *lesivo* resolution once he has been advised that a contract is *lesivo* and has decided to proceed with the declaration of *lesivo* unless there is a settlement.\n\n\"The Acuerdo Gubernativo *begins to take effect* the day after its publication in the Diario de Centro Am\u00e9rica.\" Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n120.\n\nRespondent has alleged that the *lesivo* process started at the latest in April-May 2006 when the President decided to declare the Equipment Usufruct Contracts *lesivo* or as early as in August 2005 when the *Lesivo* Opinion was issued. The evidence before the Tribunal does not show the exact date when the President took the decision to declare the Equipment Usufruct Contracts *lesivo* and Respondent has not submitted any document which registers the date of such decision or the decision itself. It seems incongruent with the formal requirements of the Guatemalan legal system that the controlling date of a measure of the Government would be uncertain and unknown to members of the Government or those affected by it, as opposed to the legal certainty of the date of the President\u2019s signature and of the publication of the *Lesivo* Resolution. It is undisputed that both these acts occurred after the entry into force of the Treaty as between the parties on July 1, 2006. These considerations are even more applicable to the argument that the Tribunal should consider the *Lesivo* Opinion itself as only the first step in the process.\n\n121.\n\nFurthermore, even if the Tribunal were to accept the inevitability of the *lesivo* process after some undefined point in time in April-May 2006, we would be faced with an act or situation which occurred before the Treaty entered into force and continued to occur or exist afterwards. Respondent\u2019s own expert, Dra. Vielman, in her oral testimony, testified that *lesivo* is a \"comprehensive proceeding\". When Dra. Vielman was cross-examined about the steps to reach the *Lesivo* Resolution - in her written expert opinion she had affirmed that there were two steps: the signature of the President and the publication of the resolution in the official gazette - she replied \".it is important to note at this point.that this is a *comprehensive proceeding*. First, you have the President\u2019s decision, and then there are some other related acts that lead to a proceeding to declare.that the Contract is null and void.\" Counsel to Claimant queried whether the expert was saying that there are three steps as opposed to the two steps asserted in her expert statement. Dra. Vielman replied:\n\n\"I am not contradicting my own statement. In my statement, we said that there is the step -and I could give you more steps. You have the decision by the President, you have all the decisions that support the discussion by the President, which is the one that determines the willingness of the State, and then you have the signing of the document - of the resolution and the publication. But once again, I think it is important to state that this is a *comprehensive proceeding*. These are related acts and they are final.\"82\n\nTranscript of March 3, 2010, pp. 737-738. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n122.\n\nThe idea of process is also reflected in the affirmation of Dra. Vielman in her written statement that a *lesivo* resolution has no legal effect on the \"*administrado*\". It is simply a \"*supuesto procesal*\" (\"procedural course\") which permits the Attorney General to seek the annulment of the *lesivo* contract in Administrative Court. During her cross-examination she reiterated this idea: \"Whether it [was] published, not published, the Executive Resolution of *lesividad* has no effects whatsoever. What it does is that it instructs the Attorney General to start the *lesividad* proceedings, and these proceedings are the vehicle for annulment to be declared.\"83\n\n*Ibid*. p. 741.\n\n123.\n\nThis idea of a comprehensive process brings the Tribunal to consider whether it is faced with a \"continuing act.\" As pointed out in the ILC Commentary to Article 24 of the Draft Convention on the Law of Treaties submitted to the General Assembly, if\n\n\"an act or fact or situation which took place or arose prior to the entry into force of a treaty continues to occur or exist after the treaty has come into force, it will be caught by the provisions of the treaty. The non-retroactivity principle cannot be infringed by applying a treaty to matters that occur or exist when the treaty is in force, even if they first began at an earlier date.\"84\n\nThe Commentary then adds: \"In other words, the treaty will not apply to acts or facts which are *completed* or to situations which have ceased to exist before the treaty comes into force.\"85\n\nDraft Articles on the Law of Treaties with commentaries, adopted by the ILC at its eighteenth session, *Yearbook of the International Law Commission,* 1966, Vol. II, p. 212, Para. 3 of the commentary to Article 24 which became Article 28 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n*Ibid*. para. 4. Emphasis in original.\n\n124.\n\nThere is consistent arbitral case law considering \"continuing acts\" in breach of a treaty when their occurrence spans a period before and after a treaty enters into force. The *Mondev* tribunal noted that the parties accepted that \"in certain circumstances conduct committed prior to the entry into force of a treaty might continue in effect after that date, with the result that the treaty could provide a basis for determining the wrongfulness of the continuing conduct.\"86 The tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines* considered a continuing breach the persistent failure to pay sums due under a contract.87 Similarly, the tribunal in *Tecmed* determined to be a continuing breach acts, omissions or conduct provided \"upon consummation or completion of their consummation after the entry into force of the Agreement constitute a breach of the Agreement. \"88\n\n*Mondev v. U.S.A.*, see note 37 above, Award, para. 56.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA v. Republic of Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, January 29, 2004, 8 ICSID Rep. 515, para. 167.\n\n*Tecmed v. Mexico*, see note 38 above, Award, para. 63.\n\n125.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that, if the *Lesivo* Resolution is viewed as a measure taken on a specific date, it was taken on the day of publication. Alternatively, if it is considered as part of a process, then it is part of a continuing act which started before the date of the entry into force of the Treaty and continued after such date. On either view, Respondent\u2019s argument fails.\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal will now address the second issue, is there a dispute and, if the answer is in the affirmative, when did it start?\n\n127.\n\nWhether there is a dispute and when it started depends on the definition of dispute and the elements which differentiate one dispute from another. The term \"dispute\" is not defined in CAFTA Article 10.28 (Definitions). The dictionary defines dispute as \"a conflict or controversy; a conflict of claims or rights; an assertion of a right, claim or demand on one side, met by contradictory claims or allegation on the other.\"89 Somewhat more broadly the ICJ has defined \"dispute\" as a \"disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between the parties.\"90 The ICSID Convention does not define \"dispute\". The Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention explains in the context of delimiting the nature of disputes which may be submitted to the jurisdiction of ICSID under Article 25(1) of the Convention that: \"The expression \u2018legal dispute\u2019 has been used to make clear that while conflicts of rights are within the jurisdiction of the Centre, mere conflicts of interests are not.\"91\n\n*Black\u2019s Law Dictionary* (West Paul, 1968), Revised Fourth Edition, p. 558.\n\nSee *e.g. Case Concerning East Timor* (Portugal v. Australia), I.C.J. Rep 1995, pp. 89 and 99.\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (1965), p. 44, para. 26.\n\n128.\n\nClaimant has argued its case on the basis of the *Vieira* tribunal\u2019s definition and has applied each of the requirements listed in that definition to the facts before the Tribunal in order to deny the existence of a dispute before the date of entry into force of the Treaty. In the view of the Tribunal the *Vieira* definition of \"dispute\" is arguably the strictest definition of such term in international arbitral practice and stricter than the way the term \"dispute\" has been understood in arbitral practice and under the jurisprudence of the ICJ.92\n\nRelevant jurisprudence has preferred not to look at a check-list understanding of \"dispute,\" but rather to rely on a more commonly-understood notion of what makes for a dispute. See paragraph 127 above and *e.g. AALP v. Sri Lanka*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3), Award of June 27, 1990; *Lucchetti*, see note 11 above, para. 48; *Interpretation of Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania*, Advisory Opinion of March 1950, I.C.J. Reports 1950, p. 65 at 74; *South West Africa, Preliminary Objections. Judgment*, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 319, at 328.\n\n129.\n\nFor its part, the Tribunal retains the concept of dispute as a conflict of views on points of law or fact which requires sufficient communication between the parties for each to know the other\u2019s views and oppose them. Furthermore and for purposes of determining the date when a dispute starts, it is necessary to distinguish it from the facts leading to the dispute, which naturally will have occurred earlier. In this respect, the Tribunal finds useful the description of the emergence of a dispute in *Maffezini* :\n\n\"It begins with the expression of a disagreement and the statement of a difference of views. In time these events acquire a precise legal meaning through the formulation of legal claims, their discussion and eventual rejection or lack of response by the other party. The conflict of legal views and interests will only be present in the latter stage, even though the underlying acts predate them. It has also rightly commented that the existence of the dispute presupposes a minimum of communication between the parties, one party taking the matter with the other, with the latter opposing the Claimant\u2019s position directly or indirectly. This sequence of events has to be taken into account in establishing the critical date for determining when under the BIT a dispute qualifies as one covered by the consent necessary to establish ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction.\"93\n\n*Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, January 25, 2000, 5 ICSID Rep. 387, para. 96.\n\n130.\n\nThe next step for the Tribunal is to determine which dispute is before it. The so-called *lesivo* process is different from the disagreements between FVG and FEGUA related to Contract 402 and Contract 820 and the subject of local arbitrations. It is clear from the record that there were also disagreements between FVG and FEGUA related to the Equipment Usufruct Contracts, such as access to a workshop, use of tools, preservation of historic assets and the irregularities pointed out in the opinion attached to the letter of Mr. Gramajo to FVG dated April 14, 2004. The conflict in that regard was sufficiently serious for Claimant to seek the help of the President to solve the issues between FVG and FEGUA.\n\n131.\n\nThe issue for the Tribunal is whether the instant dispute may be differentiated from the disputes in the local arbitration proceedings. For this purpose, the Tribunal finds guidance in arbitral practice related to *lis pendens*. In *Benvenuti & Bonfant* the tribunal held that \"there could only be a case of *lis pendens* where there was identity of the parties, object and cause of action in the proceedings pending before both tribunals.\"94\n\n*Benvenuti & Bonfant SRL v. the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/77/2), Award, August 8, 1980, 1 ICSID Rep. 330, p. 340 at para. 1.14.\n\n132.\n\nIn the instant case, the cause of action is based on the Treaty and not the Equipment Usufruct Contracts. The parties to the dispute are RDC and the Republic of Guatemala and the object of the dispute is the *Lesivo* Resolution itself and the subsequent conduct of Respondent as it relates to the Claimant\u2019s investment. For purposes of this proceeding the dispute between RDC and the Republic of Guatemala crystallized when the *Lesivo* Resolution was published after CAFTA entered into force.\n\n133.\n\nThe *lesivo* process proceeded in parallel to negotiations of FEGUA with FVG regarding issues in dispute in the local proceedings; to the extent that Claimant was aware of such process, which is disputed by Claimant, it was used to negotiate other pending issues. Suffice here to mention that, in the settlement proposal communicated to FVG by FEGUA in the meeting of August 24, 2006, of seven items, only the seventh is related to the Equipment Usufruct Contracts. More importantly, the *Lesivo* Resolution in the \"*Exposici\u00f3n de Motivos*\" does not list items such as the conservation of the historic and cultural patrimony of railway equipment, nor does it list the other six items part of the settlement proposed by Respondent on August 24, 2006.95\n\nThe *Lesivo* Resolution fails to mention the grounds for *lesividad* which were included in the *Lesivo* Opinion of the Attorney General (Exhibit R-15). For instance, that Opinion found as grounds of *lesividad* certain provisions of Contract 143 (which had been copied from Contract 41 and which the Government had attested to be in accordance with Guatemalan law), namely: (a) the fact that the canon was paid at the end of the year because Government was deprived of the interest which would accrued to the Government if FVG would had to pay the canon in installments; and (b) the fact that a 45 year-term was too long taking into account the life of the equipment. Similarly in his letter, dated January 13, 2006, to the President of Guatemala, Dr. Gramajo lists as irregularities matters which can also be found in Contract 41, for instance, \"FEGUA\u2019s obligation to grant any new or used equipment or spare parts in usufruct to the selected entity\" (para. 4(a); \"The usufructuary is authorized to move the equipment outside the national territory for the term it deems necessary\" (para. 4(b)); \"the contract provides that the usufructuary may remove component parts of a piece of equipment to use them as replacements in other equipment\" (para. 4(f)); the term of the contract (para. 4(g)); the canon of 1.25% of the net freight turnover, \"No method was established for calculating the amounts charged for freight services, and FEGUA is not allowed to participate in the prior determination of said freight services.\" (para. 4(h)) (Exhibit R-21).\n\n134.\n\nExpressed differently, the grounds for the *Lesivo* Resolution (\"*Exposici\u00f3n de Motivos*\")96, even if they had been cured by FVG, would not have satisfied the conditions of the settlement proposed on August 24, 2006. While this confirms, as argued by Claimant, the use of the *lesividad* process as an element of pressure to achieve other results which seem unrelated to the *lesividad* declaration *97,* this does not make the dispute in connection with the *Lesivo* Resolution and the subsequent conduct of Respondent an integral part of other disputes which may have existed or may still exist in the local arbitration proceedings. It is understandable that parties in a negotiation bargain on all pending matters but, if a settlement is not reached, the nature of the dispute or disputes returns to whatever it was *ex ante*. The disputes submitted to local arbitration are no more part of the dispute before this Tribunal than the dispute before this tribunal is part of them.\n\nExhibit C-10. The translation provided by Claimant does not convey the full meaning of the Spanish original. \"*Exposici\u00f3n de Motivos*\" has been translated as \"Explanatory Statement\". \"Motivo\" in this context means \"ground\". The statement lists the grounds for Respondent\u2019s adopting the *Lesivo* Resolution.\n\nThe element of pressure is registered in the minutes of the meeting held at FEGUA\u2019s request and without representatives of Claimant at the Procurador\u00eda General de la Naci\u00f3n (\"PGN\") on September 28, 2006. The Attorney General \"*indic\u00f3 que hab\u00eda dejado pendiente de iniciar dichas acciones [acciones correspondientes en el caso de la Declaraci\u00f3n de Lesividad] por la existencia de una mesa de di\u00e1logo entre las partes pero que \u00e9l considera que si no hay avances en dicha mesa no es conveniente esperar m\u00e1s para**actuar en este caso. Considera tambi\u00e9n el Procurador, que al iniciar la PGN los procesos jur\u00eddicos har\u00eda un poco de presi\u00f3n para que efectivamente se agilicen las negociaciones*.\" Exhibit R-36.\n\n135.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware, as pointed out by Respondent, that in *Lucchetti*, the tribunal decided that: \"The allegation of a BIT claim, however meritorious it might be on the merits, does not and cannot have the effect of nullifying or depriving of any meaning the *ratione temporis* reservation spelled out in Article 2 of the BIT.\"98 This warning, however, is inapposite in a situation as in the instant case where relevant facts arose or continued, and/or a dispute (on which jurisdiction could be based) emerged after the BIT was in force.\n\n*Lucchetti v. Peru*, see note 11 above, Award, para. 59.\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that there is a dispute between Claimant and Respondent which began on the date the *Lesivo* Resolution was published in the Official Gazette. Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal does not need to determine whether a tribunal under CAFTA has jurisdiction over disputes which began before the date the Treaty entered into force and continued after such date. It merely notes that CAFTA is expressed to apply \"to measures adopted or maintained by a Party\" (Article 10.1.1), and that it was not until the *Lesivo* Resolution was finally published that it could be considered a \"measure\".\n\n137.\n\nOn the basis of the above considerations, the Tribunal rejects the *ratione temporis* objection.\n\n138.\n\nIn view of the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the dispute between the parties concerns a measure dated after the entry into force of the Treaty, the Tribunal does not need to address the arguments in El Salvador\u2019s submission in support of Respondent\u2019s position in respect of the *ratione temporis* objection.\n\n**3. OBJECTION** ***R******ATIONE*** ***M******ATERIAE***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nRespondent has argued that Claimant\u2019s investment is not a \"covered investment\" under the Treaty or the ICSID Convention because the investment was illegal and did not create rights protected under domestic law. Respondent has based its argument on CAFTA Article 10.28(g) and the fact that the Equipment Usufruct Contracts were not let through public bidding and did not receive Presidential and Congressional approval. Claimant has argued that the Equipment Usufruct Contracts were in the nature of a concession under Article 10.28(e) which does not refer to domestic law.\n\n140.\n\nCAFTA Article 10.28(g) is part of a non-exhaustive list of forms of investment and reads as follows: \"licenses, authorizations, permits, and other rights conferred pursuant to domestic law.\" As part of the same list, Article 10.28(e) provides \"turnkey, construction, management, production, concession, revenue-sharing and other similar contracts.\" The Tribunal notes that reference to domestic law is limited to paragraph (e), but it does not consider that it is correct to infer from this fact that rights conferred under other forms of investment may be contrary to Guatemalan law. It is to be expected that investments made in a country will meet the relevant legal requirements. Therefore, it is immaterial whether the Equipment Usufruct Contracts qualify as a form of investment under CAFTA Article 10.28(g) or 10.28(e). The Tribunal agrees with Claimant, supported by a long line of case law, that \"conferred pursuant to domestic law\" is not a characteristic of the investment to qualify as such but a condition of its validity under domestic law.99\n\nThe *Salini v. Morocco* tribunal held that reference to the law of the host State in the BIT was \"to the validity of the investment and not to its definition. More specifically, it seeks to prevent the Bilateral Treaty from protecting investments that should not be protected, particularly because they would be illegal.\" See note 76 above, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 46.\n\n141.\n\nIt is well established before this Tribunal that Contract 41 was legally tendered by the Government and that the only bid was submitted by FVG and accepted by Respondent on December 16, 1997. Contract 41 was signed more than a year later, on March 23, 1999, but never approved by *Acuerdo**Gubernativo* and Congress, both approvals being conditions for Contract 41 to become effective.\n\n142.\n\nShortly after signature of Contract 41, on April 12, 1999, FEGUA authorized FVG by letter to use the towing and traction equipment at the request of FVG.100 The authorization was renewed in 2000 at FVG\u2019s request. The letter of FVG, dated April 16, 2000, explains that the requested equipment is needed by FVG to fulfill its obligations under Contract 402 pending the approval of Contract 41, and then it states: \"The use of the railway equipment we are hereby requesting is subject to the same terms and conditions as apply to the agreement mentioned in item b) above [Contract 41], and will not in any way amend or affect the agreement already mentioned.\"101\n\nOficio 076-99 Clasificaci\u00f3n GaP referred to in FVG\u2019s letter dated April 16, 2000. Exhibit R-41.\n\nExhibit R-41.\n\n143.\n\nThus notwithstanding that Contract 41 was never approved, FEGUA let FVG operate the equipment to the extent that, shortly after signature of Contract 41 and three days after FEGUA authorized the use of the railway equipment, on April 15, 1999, train service was established between Guatemala City and El Chile. It is worth noting that at that time Contract 402 was not yet effective; it became effective more than a month later on May 23, 1999, which implies that the section Guatemala City-El Chile of the railway was rehabilitated before Contact 402 was effective. In December 1999 train service was extended to Puerto Barrios and Puerto Santo Tom\u00e1s. FVG used the equipment and paid the corresponding canon under the terms of Contract 41 as if it would have been in effect until signature of Contract 143. Afterwards, the equipment continued to be used and the higher canon provided for in Contract 143 was paid and accepted until after the publication of the *Lesivo* Resolution.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that both parties to the Contract - FEGUA and FVG - conducted themselves substantially as if the terms of Contract 41 had been in effect - as they have done since the beginning of their relationship in the case of Contract 402. Contract 143 was entered into four years after Contract 41 when it was evident that Contract 41 would not come into effect. The reasons for declaring the Equipment Usufruct Contracts *lesivo* as stated in the \"*Exposici\u00f3n de Motivos*\" of the *Lesivo* Resolution are substantially the same as those that prevented Contract 41 becoming effective (lack of approval by *Acuerdo Gubernativo* and by Congress) or relate to the need to follow the procedures for public contracting that, notwithstanding the fact that they had already been followed by FVG and FEGUA in respect of the same equipment in the case of Contract 41, had been to no avail to secure the approvals entirely under the Government\u2019s control.\n\n145.\n\nRespondent has argued that FVG was fully aware of the approval conditions of Contract 143 when it entered into it since its objective was the same: the usufruct of the equipment. Respondent has denied that FEGUA and FVG entered into Contract 143 at the Government\u2019s request. Who took the initiative to sign a new contract is irrelevant to the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion. FEGUA and FVG were faced with a *de facto* situation which they tried to reflect in Contract 143, and FEGUA benefited from a 25% increase in the canon stipulated in Contract 41.102\n\nThe Tribunal notes that prior ICSID tribunals have accorded determinative import to such *de facto* situations. For instance, in *Amco Asia* the Tribunal held that even if the government\u2019s action did not change the legal realities, it did create a *de facto* situation on which the Tribunal based its decision. *Amco Asia Corp., Pan-American Development Ltd and PT Amco Asia Indonesia v. Republic of Indonesia* (Case No. ARB/81/1), Award (Original Arbitration Proceeding), November 20, 1984, para. 257.\n\n146.\n\nEven if FEGUA\u2019s actions with respect to Contract 41/143 and in its allowance to FVG to use the rail equipment were *ultra vires* (not \"pursuant to domestic law\"), \"principles of fairness\" should prevent the government from raising \"violations of its own law as a jurisdictional defense when [in this case, operating in the guise of FEGUA, it] knowingly overlooked them and [effectively] endorsed an investment which was not in compliance with its law.\"103\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25), Award, August 16, 2007, para. 346.\n\n147.\n\nBased on these considerations the Tribunal finds that Respondent is precluded from raising any objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the ground that Claimant\u2019s investment is not a covered investment under the Treaty or the ICSID Convention.\n\n**4. THIRD OBJECTION**\n----------------------\n\n148.\n\nAs already pointed out, in its First Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal determined that:\n\n\"(b) the waivers submitted by the Claimant pursuant to Article 10.18.2 are valid in respect of the claim arising from the Lesivo Resolution and from subsequent conduct of the Respondent pursuant to the Lesivo Resolution and, therefore, fulfill the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration conditions under Article 10.18 in respect of that claim.\"\n\n149.\n\nWhen Respondent requested a clarification of the First Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal denied the request because it was the Tribunal\u2019s view that:\n\n\"the reasoning of the Tribunal leading to its decision clearly excludes claims based on the measures at issue in the local arbitrations under Deed 402 and Deed 820 irrespective of the article of CAFTA under which they would be advanced. On the other hand, Article 10.5 provides for the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. This is a general and wide ranging standard of treatment that may cover claims based on other measures taken by Respondent beyond those at issue in the local arbitrations. It would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to exclude them *a priori* or to speculate on how Claimant may articulate its claims.\"\n\n150.\n\nNow Claimant has articulated its claims in its Memorial on the Merits and Respondent has raised the issue of Claimant\u2019s compliance with the First Decision on Jurisdiction of the Tribunal by allegedly pressing claims excluded by the terms of this decision.\n\n151.\n\nAs clearly stated above, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to claims arising from the *Lesivo* Resolution and from subsequent conduct of Respondent pursuant to this Resolution. Therefore, Claimant should strictly circumscribe its claims to the terms of the First Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n152.\n\nAs regards payments by FEGUA into the Trust Fund, Respondent lists specific references to Contracts 402 and 820 in the Memorial on the Merits in paragraphs 39, 195 and 222. Claimant explains that:\n\n\"The only specific references in Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits regarding Guatemala\u2019s failure to make Trust Fund payments are in the context of factual background (paragraph 39) and in discussing the reasonable factual assumptions underlying FVG\u2019s Business Plan (paragraph 222). Nothing in Claimant\u2019s Memorial even arguably suggests that any of its claims - indirect expropriation, fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security and national treatment - are based upon Guatemala\u2019s failure to make payments into the Trust Fund.\"104\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 198.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that paragraph 195(vii) of the Memorial on the Merits, which is not referred to in the Counter-Memorial, reads as follows:\n\n\"Despite serious breaches of contract by the Government prior to the Lesivo Resolution, which cannot be allowed to diminish the amount of compensation due RDC, FVG, through its own efforts, was on track to achieve its long-term business plan up to the Lesivo Resolution.\"\n\nBoth, this paragraph and paragraph 222 are part of the chapter on compensation. While the Tribunal accepts that paragraph 39 is part of the factual context, as argued by Claimant, references in the chapter on compensation show that Claimant continues to press claims related to payments by FEGUA into the Trust Fund, a matter which the Tribunal has determined to be outside its jurisdiction and which should not be further discussed in this arbitration.\n\n154.\n\nAs to the removal of squatters, Claimant has drawn a distinction between the measures subject of the local arbitration on the failure of FEGUA to remove squatters and the conduct of Respondent subsequent to the *Lesivo* Resolution: \"in contrast to FVG\u2019s breach of contract claim in the squatters arbitration, the failure of law enforcement authorities to provide full protection and security to RDC\u2019s investment arose only *after and as result of* the issuance of the Lesivo Resolution.\"105 To the extent that such difference may be proven, *prima facie*, the Tribunal would have jurisdiction to consider measures of Respondent related to squatters which are part of \"the conduct subsequent to the *Lesivo* Resolution.\"\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial, para. 196. Emphasis in the original.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n155.\n\nHaving carefully considered the parties\u2019 arguments in their written pleadings and oral submissions, and for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal has decided: (a) to reject Respondent\u2019s objections *ratione temporis* and *ratione materiae* to its jurisdiction; and (b) to confirm that its jurisdiction is limited to the *Lesivo* Resolution and conduct subsequent to this Resolution, which may include acts or omissions of Respondent related to squatters, but only to the extent that these result from the *Lesivo* Resolution.\n\n156.\n\nBoth parties have requested the award of costs and their respective legal fees and expenses associated with this phase of the proceeding. The Tribunal will consider this matter as part of its final award.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal will order the continuation of the proceeding on the merits and will establish a calendar for the filing of further pleadings on the merits after consultation with the parties."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2012-06-29T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn June 14, 2007, Railroad Development Corporation (\"RDC\" or \"Claimant\") filed before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") a Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Guatemala (\"Respondent', \"Guatemala\" or the \"Government\") on its own behalf and on behalf of Compa\u00f1\u00eda Desarrolladora Ferroviaria, S.A., a Guatemalan company which does business as Ferrov\u00edas Guatemala (\"FVG\") and is majority-owned and controlled by RDC. The Request was brought under the Dominican Republic - Central America -United States of America (\"United States\") Free Trade Agreement1 (\"CAFTA\" or the \"Treaty\"). ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration on August 20, 2007.\n\nSigned in August 5, 2004. CAFTA entered into force between the United States of America and Guatemala on July 1, 2006.\n\n2.\n\nPursuant to CAFTA Article 10.19.1, Claimant appointed the Honorable Stuart E. Eizenstat (United States of America); Respondent appointed Professor James Crawford (Australia). Pursuant to Article 10.19.3, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID appointed Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda (Spain), as President of the Tribunal. The Arbitral Tribunal was constituted on April 14, 2008.\n\n3.\n\nOn May 29, 2008, Respondent requested that the Tribunal consider, on an expedited basis, an objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.20.5. As required by Article 10.20.5, the Tribunal suspended the proceedings on the merits. The parties exchanged written submissions and a hearing on jurisdiction was held on October 10, 2008 in Washington D.C. The parties were represented by their counsel. Pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.21 the hearing was open to the public.\n\n4.\n\nOn November 17, 2008, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Objection to Jurisdiction under CAFTA Article 10.20.5 (\"First Decision on Jurisdiction\"). In that decision the Tribunal held:\n\n\"(a) That the reservation included in the waivers submitted by the Claimant pursuant to Article 10.18.2 is of no consequence for purposes of their validity. [and] (b) [t]hat the waivers submitted by the Claimant pursuant to Article 10.18.2 are valid in respect of the claim arising from the *Lesivo* Resolution and from subsequent conduct of the Respondent pursuant to the *Lesivo* Resolution and, therefore, fulfill the Respondent's consent to arbitration conditions under Article 10.18 in respect of that claim.\"\n\n5.\n\nOn December 12, 2008, Respondent filed a request for clarification of the First Decision on Jurisdiction. Claimant filed comments on December 19, 2008. On January 13, 2009, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Clarification of the First Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n6.\n\nOn January 6, 2009, the Tribunal issued a procedural order establishing the procedural calendar on the merits phase of the proceedings, fixing May 24, 2009 as the deadline for the submission of the Memorial on the Merits, and a two-week deadline after the date of submission of the Memorial on the Merits for \"Respondent [to] inform the Tribunal and Claimant of any intention to raise preliminary objections.\"\n\n7.\n\nBy Claimant's letter of May 5, 2009 and Respondent's letter of May 7, 2009, the parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to modify the schedule for the submissions of pleadings set forth in Procedural Order No. 2 and sought the Tribunal's approval of the agreed procedural schedule. By letter of May 8, 2009, the Tribunal approved the parties' proposal. According to the new calendar, Claimant's Memorial was to be submitted on June 26, 2008 while Respondent's notice of any jurisdictional objections was scheduled for July 25, 2009. Accordingly, Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits on June 26, 2009.\n\n8.\n\nOn July 24, 2009, Guatemala filed a notice of intent to raise preliminary objections, as it had reserved the right to do under CAFTA, Article 10.20.4. Claimant objected on August 4, 2009.\n\n9.\n\nOn August 24, 2009, Tribunal issued a procedural order suspending the proceeding on the merits.\n\n10.\n\nOn September 24, 2009, Guatemala filed its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction under Article 10.20.4 of CAFTA and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on October 26, 2009.\n\n11.\n\nOn 3 November 2009, the Tribunal informed the parties that a second round of pleadings was not necessary.\n\n12.\n\nThe second hearing on jurisdiction was held from March 1 to March 3, 2010 at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. Pursuant to CAFTA Article 10.21 the hearing was open to the public.

SUMMARY STATEMENT OF FACTS**\n----------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nIt will be useful to recount here the basic facts as they were stated in the Second Decision on Jurisdiction. RDC is a privately-owned railway investment and management company which in 1997 won, through international public bidding, the use of the infrastructure and other rail assets to provide railway services in Guatemala (the \"Usufruct\"). Only two bids were submitted and RDC's bid was the only one considered responsive by Respondent. RDC's bid consisted of a staged plan to rebuild the rail system, which had been closed since March 1996, with an investment program of about ten million U.S. dollars. Although the bidding conditions did not include rolling stock, RDC included in its bid a rehabilitation plan for the rolling stock that would be required for the operation of the railroad (Section 4.2, \"Rehabilitation Plan for Locomotives and Freight Cars\"). The Usufruct that was awarded to RDC consisted of a 50-year right to rebuild and operate the Guatemalan rail system and did not include rolling stock. On November 25, 1997, FVG signed the Usufruct Contract of Right of Way (the \"Usufruct Contract\", \"Contract 402\" or \"Deed 402\") with Ferrocarriles de Guatemala (\"FEGUA\"), a state-owned company established in 1969 which is responsible for providing certain railway transport services and managing the rail equipment and real estate assets. The Usufruct and the Usufruct Contract were ratified by the Congress of Guatemala by Decree 27-98, published in the Official Gazette on April 23, 1998, and came into force on May 23, 1998.\n\n31.\n\nThe Usufruct covers a 497-mile narrow gauge railroad and includes the right to develop alternative uses for the right of way, such as pipelines, electricity transmission, fiber optics and commercial and institutional development. In return for the right-of-way Usufruct, RDC (through FVG) agreed to make certain payments to FEGUA.\n\n32.\n\nIn November 1997 Guatemala invited bids for the use of the FEGUA rail equipment in onerous usufruct. On December 11, 1997, FVG submitted its bid and won the rail usufruct on December 16, 1997. FEGUA and FVG signed Usufruct Contract No. 41, dated March 23, 1999 (\"Contract No. 41\"), which granted FVG \"the use, enjoyment, repair and maintenance of railway equipment owned by FEGUA for the purposes of rendering railway transportation services.\" This contract never went into force because it was never approved by *acuerdo gubernativo*. Such approval is required under Guatemalan Administrative Law and Clause 6.4 of the bidding conditions for Contract No. 41. No explanation was offered to the Tribunal of why the government approval was not given.\n\n33.\n\nSince Contract No. 41 had not entered into force, FVG and FEGUA entered into Contract No.143 on August 28, 2003. The circumstances and effect of Contract No. 143 are a matter of controversy between the parties and the Tribunal simply registers the fact that FVG and FEGUA signed this contract and modified it in October 2003 by deed No. 158 (\"Contract 143/158\").\n\n34.\n\nFVG restored commercial service between El Chile and Guatemala City on April 15, 1999. In December 1999, commercial service was restored between Guatemala City and the Atlantic ports of Puerto Barrios and Puerto Santo Tom\u00e1s. Tonnage gradually increased until 2005 but declined in 2006.\n\n35.\n\nOn June 26, 2005, FVG initiated two domestic arbitration cases against FEGUA for breach of contract. The Claimant alleged that Guatemala through FEGUA failed to remove squatters from the rail right of way and to make agreed payments to the Trust Fund. The Claimant further alleged that, in anticipation of FVG's filings, FEGUA requested the Attorney General to investigate the circumstances surrounding the award of the Usufruct and to issue an opinion on the validity of Deed 143 and Deed 158. The Attorney General issued Opinion No. 205-2005 on August 1, 2005 (\" *Lesivo* Opinion\"), and recommended that Guatemala declare Contract 143/158 void as not in the interest of the country. As translated by the Claimant, the *Lesivo* Opinion stated:\n\n\"Lesion was caused in this case because there is a violation to rules and procedures that should have been applied in order to execute the agreement in due form and with legal validity. The relevant contract breaks the Government Contracting Law and other laws that govern the process to grant FEGUA's property in usufruct.\n\nThere is pecuniary lesion by executing an Onerous Usufruct Contract to grant the State's property in usufruct to be exploited by a private entity, in exchange of one point twenty-five percent (1.25%) of the gross income as a result of rendering transportation services.\"\n\n36.\n\nOn January 13, 2006, FEGUA issued Opinion 05-2006, in agreement with the Attorney General's opinion, arguing that Contract 143/158 was not awarded as a result of a public bid.\n\n37.\n\nClaimant and FVG made numerous attempts to reach an understanding. Claimant met the President of the Republic, Mr. Oscar Berger, on March 7, 2006. The President set up a high level commission to work with RDC and FVG, on which FEGUA was represented. This commission met a number of times but after about three months the meetings were suspended. It is the contention of the Claimant that, in parallel, the Government was preparing a resolution to declare the usufruct of the rolling stock injurious to the interests of the State. Such a resolution (\" *Lesivo* Resolution\" or \" *Lesivo* Declaration\") was adopted by the Government on August 11, 2006 and published on August 25, 2006.\n\n**III. JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n-------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nIn its First Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal decided:\n\n\"(a) That the reservation included in the waivers submitted by the Claimant pursuant to Article 10.18.2 is of no consequence for purposes of their validity.\n\n(b) That the waivers submitted by the Claimant pursuant to Article 10.18.2 are valid in respect of the claim arising from the *Lesivo* Resolution and from subsequent conduct of the Respondent pursuant to the *Lesivo* Resolution and, therefore, fulfill the Respondent's consent to arbitration conditions under Article 10.18 in respect of that claim.\" (para. 76)\n\n39.\n\nIn its Second Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal decided to reject Respondent's objections *ratione temporis* and *ratione materiae*, and to confirm that its jurisdiction is limited to the *Lesivo* Resolution and conduct subsequent to this Resolution, which may include acts or omissions of Respondent related to squatters, but only to the extent that these result from the *Lesivo* Resolution.\n\n40.\n\nIn the reasoning leading to its decision, the Tribunal concluded that: \"there is a dispute between Claimant and Respondent which began on the date the *Lesivo* Resolution was published in the Official Gazette. Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal does not need to determine whether a tribunal under CAFTA has jurisdiction over disputes which began before the date the Treaty entered into force and which continued after such date. It merely notes that CAFTA is expressed to apply \u2018to measures adopted or maintained by a Party' (Article 10.1.1), and that it was not until the *Lesivo* Resolution was finally published that it could be considered a \u2018measure'\". (para.136)\n\n**IV. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**1. Memorial**\n---------------\n\n41.\n\nIt is the contention of Claimant that Respondent indirectly expropriated Claimant's investment. Claimant analyzes the *Lesivo* Resolution against the requirements of Article 10.7.1 of CAFTA for a lawful expropriation and argues that the *Lesivo* Resolution does not meet them.\n\n42.\n\nClaimant denies that the expropriation was for a public purpose. It rebuts the suggestion that its purpose could be to protect the cultural and historical patrimony, since no rolling stock was ever designated as such. The argument that the canon fee was too low ignores the fact that the effective rate in the Usufruct Contracts was 11.25%. Further, the integrated character of the Usufruct Contracts \"makes ridiculous the contention that another round of public bidding on the rolling stock would have produced a serious competing bid or made any difference in the \u2018award' of Deed 143.\" (para. 108). Claimant denies that *lesivo* was a non-discriminatory measure since the Government had the intention to act against Claimant in favor of Mr. Ram\u00f3n Campollo or other nationals. Claimant contends that the *lesivo* procedure lacked due process, basing itself on Professor Riesman's opinion that:\n\n\"In this idiosyncratic Guatemalan *lesivo* regime, the President of the Republic in Cabinet Council can freely decide what such interests of the State are, and, due to the lack of standards for review, the administrative court which is then asked to confirm his decision will have a hard time articulating any reasons to counteract the President's judgment. In particular, the interests of the State which are adduced may not even amount to illegalities of contract formation and content. The private party to whom the resolution is directed has no opportunity to be heard - to be informed of and respond to the charges prior to the issuance of the decree. Under Article 584 of the Procedural Code, the Government is even prohibited from desisting from a *lesivo* claim once it has been filed.\" (para. 111)\n\n43.\n\nClaimant then refers to the indirect expropriation factors in Annex 10-C of CAFTA. In Claimant's view, the *Lesivo* Resolution had a devastating effect:\n\n(i) It caused a critical number of FVG's railway customers to refuse to continue to do business with FVG;\n\n(ii) It caused FVG's principal suppliers of goods, services and short-term financing to significantly reduce or eliminate their credit terms and/or services to FVG;\n\n(iii) Potential new customers, lenders, investors and joint venture partners immediately backed away from negotiations and discussions with FVG after having previously expressed interest in doing business with FVG; and\n\n(iv) Local courts, police and municipalities consistently relied upon the Lesivo Resolution as a basis to deny protection to, issue rulings against and allow theft of and vandalism against FVG's Usufruct property.\" (para. 133)\n\n44.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the *Lesivo* Resolution interfered with Claimant's reasonable investment-backed expectations: the rolling stock was an express component of the award of the 50-year Usufruct to operate the railroad, and RDC had the expectation that each of the Usufruct Contracts would be awarded, executed and approved in accordance with Guatemalan law.\n\n45.\n\nClaimant contends that for nine years prior to the *Lesivo* Resolution RDC had a reasonable investment-backed expectation that the financial terms of Contract 143/158 were sufficient, adequate and not harmful to the interests of Guatemala and that Respondent represented them as legal and proper, Deed 143 included. (para 119)\n\n46.\n\nPrior to the *Lesivo* Resolution, RDC had no reason to believe that it was not adequately protecting Guatemala's \"historical and cultural patrimony\" interest in certain rolling stock and rail equipment. FVG had no notice of what specific rolling stock the Government had designated as cultural patrimony because the Government never officially declared or designated under its Cultural Patrimony Law any of the FEGUA rolling stock. Claimant refers (i) to Guatemala's own description of the condition of the railway operation as \"in a state of obsolescence\" and in a \"terrible state\", (ii) to the fact that, by 2003, Guatemala was so pleased with FVG's rehabilitation and restoration of the railroad equipment that it entered into an agreement with FVG to display several FVG-restored historical locomotives and rail cars at the national railroad museum, and (iii) to an award that in 2005, approximately a year and a half prior to the *Lesivo* Resolution, was presented by FEGUA's Overseer to FVG's Chairman on behalf of the FEGUA-affiliated Railroad Museum for \" *the rescue and restoration of the Historic Railway Patrimony of Guatemala*.\" (para. 120. Emphasis added by Claimant)\n\n47.\n\nAccording to Claimant, an indirect expropriation can occur even though the investor still retains nominal or legal ownership of the investment or investment assets. Furthermore, a State's actions can constitute an indirect expropriation under international law even where such actions are determined to be legitimate or in compliance with the host State's domestic laws. Whether or not it was lawful under Guatemalan law, the *Lesivo* Resolution was completely disproportionate to its stated aim. In Claimant's opinion Guatemala could have taken less extreme actions that would not have destroyed RDC's investment if it had been truly interested in protecting the public interests upon which it purports to rely to justify the *Lesivo* Resolution.\n\n48.\n\nClaimant also alleges that Respondent is in breach of the minimum standard of treatment under Article 10.5 of CAFTA. According to Claimant, when applied against a foreign investor the *lesivo* procedure does not conform with this obligation because it is a procedure that lacks foundation under substantive Guatemalan law, affords no due process to the investor; in practice, as was the case here, Respondent may use its *lesivo* power in order to avoid or force the renegotiation of valid administrative contracts without compensating the investor. According to Claimant: \"The Government here specifically demanded that, in order to avoid a declaration of *lesivo*, FVG had to agree, for no consideration, to modify significantly the economic terms of the Usufruct Contracts, drop its local arbitrations for breach of contract, and release undeveloped railway segments to other interested parties (*i.e.*, Ramon Campollo). The Government did this because it knew and understood that, once a *lesivo* resolution is issued against an administrative contract, that contract is, as a practical matter, rendered worthless even if the resolution has no legal or factual basis.\" (para. 145)\n\n49.\n\nClaimant alleges that Respondent acted maliciously because it issued the *Lesivo* Resolution to accomplish improper and discriminatory goals. It points to the following specific grounds: \"(i) Basing the *Lesivo* Resolution on grounds that are directly contrary to the facts and prior actions, representations and agreements of the Government; (ii) Basing the *Lesivo* Resolution on grounds that were entirely the fault of the Government and easily within the Government's control to address and correct (if even necessary) through less extreme measures; (iii) Issuing the *Lesivo* Resolution just prior to the expiration of the three-year limitation period after FVG refused the Government's demands that it agree, for no consideration (other than the Government abandoning the *Lesivo* Resolution), to modify the economic terms of the Usufruct Contracts to the Government's benefit and surrender substantial rights under the Contracts; (iv) Declaring Deeds 143/158 detrimental or injurious to the interests of the State when no demonstrable injury to the State existed; (v) Failing to provide FVG with any due process to challenge or contest the *Lesivo* Resolution before an independent and neutral decision maker prior to or even shortly after its issuance; and (vi) failing to act in good faith towards RDC and its investment by implementing a measure with intent to discriminate and knowledge of the unlawfulness of such implementation.\" (para. 149)\n\n50.\n\nClaimant argues that the minimum standard of treatment includes the concept of transparency; Respondent failed to ensure a transparent and predictable framework and with the *Lesivo* Resolution undermined legitimate investment-backed expectations of Claimant based on representations, promises and actions of Respondent over more than nine years.\n\n51.\n\nClaimant also alleges breach of Respondent's obligation to provide full protection and security to its investment under Article 10.5.1 of CAFTA. Claimant bases this allegation on the fact that, after the *Lesivo* Resolution was issued, the local authorities determined that there was no need to protect an investment declared harmful to the State's interests. Consequently, local people stole 65 kilometers of rails, track materials, cross-members of three major bridges and set up living quarters along the tracks and in station yards. Claimant also alleges that these actions, in some instances, were done by or in collaboration with local authorities who also intervened in legal actions brought by FVG, to argue that FVG no longer had any enforceable contract rights and no legal standing. Claimant explains that FVG reported to the Public Ministry every theft, act of vandalism or squatter invasion but is not aware of any action taken in response to FVG's reports.\n\n52.\n\nClaimant further alleges breach of the national treatment standard of CAFTA Article 10.3. According to Claimant, RDC and Ram\u00f3n Campollo are foreign and domestic investors in \"like circumstances\": both are competitors in the same economic sector since they have been competing to invest and operate the railroad and in leasing and developing the railroad's assets. Claimant refers to offers directly or indirectly made to RDC by Mr. Campollo. According to Claimant: \"In these proposals, Campollo demanded that he be allowed, without compensating FVG, to take over the Usufruct in whole or in part and be granted the exclusive right to use, develop and exploit the Usufruct assets, particularly along the South Coast corridor where Campollo's sugar business and other business interests and investments are concentrated. Direct competition could hardly be clearer.\" (para. 162)\n\n53.\n\nClaimant contends that the discriminatory measure of Respondent was the *Lesivo* Resolution because direct and circumstantial evidence demonstrates that one of the principal motivations of Respondent in issuing the resolution was to help facilitate the takeover of the FVG's usufruct by Mr. Campollo. Claimant also contends that in any case \"even absent the complicity between the Government and Mr. Campollo, Guatemala discriminated against RDC when it sought to coerce RDC into surrendering unrestored rail segments in favor of \u2018other [interested] investors' in exchange for the Government abandoning the *Lesivo* Resolution.\" (para. 165)\n\n54.\n\nAs to damages, Claimant argues that the damages that RDC should recover must be determined by international law and must be the fair market value of its investment including: \"(i) the adjusted amount of the investment as of the date of expropriation and other substantive violations of CAFTA - in this case as of 2006; (ii) consequential damages of lost profits from that date to the terminal date of the Usufruct; and (iii) compound pre-award interest at a commercially reasonable rate.\" (para. 172) As calculated by Claimant the aggregate of these three items comes to $64,035,859.\n\n55.\n\nClaimant requests that the Tribunal determine:\n\n\"a. That Claimant is an \"investor of a Party\" protected by CAFTA;\n\nb. That Claimant's \"covered investments\" under CAFTA include (i) income generated under the Usufruct, (ii) investment capital and loans committed by RDC to FVG under the Usufruct, and (iii) the value of FVG as the business enterprise operating the Usufruct;\n\nc. That the *Lesivo* Resolution and subsequent conduct of the Republic of Guatemala pursuant to the Resolution described herein constitute an indirect expropriation of Claimant's rights in the Usufruct, in violation of CAFTA Article 10.7.1;\n\nd. That through these measures, the Republic of Guatemala violated the minimum standard of treatment of CAFTA Article 10.5 by failing to provide, in accordance with customary international law, fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security to Claimant's covered investments;\n\ne. That the Republic of Guatemala has violated the national treatment standard of CAFTA Article 10.3;\n\nf. That the Republic of Guatemala shall pay Claimant $64,035,859 in damages plus compound pre-award interest at the average interest rate paid by Guatemala on its private commercial debt; and\n\ng. That that the Tribunal, pursuant to its power under CAFTA Article 10.26, award Claimant its costs and attorneys' fees incurred in prosecuting its CAFTA claims.\" (para. 248)\n\n**2. Counter-Memorial**\n-----------------------\n\n56.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant promised to rehabilitate Guatemala\u2019s entire railway system and deliver a modernized state-of-the-art railway, but did not deliver. It ran its investment through FVG, but had losses every year since its inception because it did not invest the funds necessary to give the railway project a fair opportunity to succeed. It rehabilitated the first phase very poorly and realized that the only investment that could be profitable would be the rehabilitation and successful operation of the railway on the Southern Coast.\n\n57.\n\nRespondent explains that this part of the rehabilitation would cost approximately $100 million and Claimant was not able to raise the funds or provide them itself. By that time, FVG already was on notice that Contract 143/158 had been questioned by FEGUA and it was negotiating with that agency over the terms of a new equipment contract that would cure the defects in the existing one, as well as a number of other contractual disputes. Respondent affirms that these negotiations faltered at about the same time that FVG realized that it could not raise the funds to build the railway in the Southern Coast.\n\n58.\n\nRespondent presents the current arbitration as part of a strategy undertaken when Claimant realized that its investment was in a shambles. According to Respondent: \"Claimant\u2019s first step, initiating two local arbitrations against FEGUA -one of which sought to blame the Government for failing to remove squatters from the right of way notwithstanding that FVG had a long-standing practice of charging rent to these very same squatters, thereby perpetuating the problem of which it complained and despite that the Government was cooperating with the eviction of the squatters including designing a detailed plan to evict squatters along the portion of the right of way that encompassed the Southern Coast.\" (para. 6)\n\n59.\n\nRespondent refers to a round of negotiations in 2006 after a meeting of Claimant with President Berger. According to Respondent, Claimant and FVG were not prepared or willing to negotiate in good faith because they had no real solution to their failed business venture, and when \"they caught wind from an internal government source that the Government was going to declare their equipment contract *lesivo* to the interests of Guatemala, they initiated their planning for this exit strategy; *i.e.*, this arbitration.\" (para. 7)\n\n60.\n\nRespondent points out that the very first business day after the publication of the *Lesivo* Declaration, Claimant and FVG took out a paid advertisement in all of the principal Guatemalan newspapers read by the general public, branding FVG as a \"dead man walking\" and manufacturing the harm they allege in this case. Furthermore, according to Respondent, Claimant unilaterally abandoned Guatemala and repudiated its obligations under the Usufruct Contracts when it announced on July 6, 2007 that it was discontinuing rail service as of October 1, 2007 and withdrawing financial support from FVG. (Respondent claims that Guatemala had legitimate reasons for initiating the *lesividad* process, that this process was not the cause of Claimant's alleged damages, that the *lesividad* process at issue in this case was initiated after four separate and independent entities had undertaken an objective legal analysis of Contract 143/158, and that the initiation of this internal, administrative process was not in response to pressure from the Guatemalan businessman Ram\u00f3n Campollo or to favor other national investors at the expense of a foreign investor. According to Respondent, \"the *Lesivo* Declaration was issued in response to the contracts' inherent illegalities and Claimant's unwillingness to correct those illegalities in good faith, through a negotiated settlement.\" (para. 11)\n\n61.\n\nRespondent explains thus the *lesividad* process in Guatemala: it is \"part of the Executive Branch\u2019s inherent powers and of the country\u2019s constitutional system of checks and balances which pre-dated Claimant\u2019s investment. It provides the executive branch with the power to declare an administrative act that is harmful to the public interest *lesivo*, thereby opening the door for that executive branch determination to be tested in the courts. Private parties affected by the declaration may challenge it in the court proceeding and have the opportunity to convince the courts to reject the executive branch's determination and to seek and receive compensation in the event that the court upholds that determination. Until the judiciary makes a determination that a particular contract or action *is* injurious to the interests of the State, the private party retains full rights in the contract notwithstanding the President's *Lesivo* Declaration.\" (para. 12)\n\n62.\n\nIt is Respondent's contention that the *Lesivo* Declaration did not cause the harm that Claimant alleges since the declaration addressed only Contract 143/158 and not Contract 402 that, by Claimant's own admission, was the core value of its investment. Respondent points out that any harm was attributable to Claimant's own acts and Claimant cannot shift to Guatemala the responsibility for any customer alarm or confusion that they caused.\n\n**3. Reply**\n------------\n\n63.\n\nClaimant contests Respondent's insistence that FVG breached its railway rehabilitation obligations under Contract 402 and points out that it misrepresents what those obligations were and ignores that FEGUA confirmed by official letter that FVG had complied with its rehabilitation obligations, that FVG's lack of profitability was largely due to Respondent's failure to fulfill its own contractual obligations, otherwise FVG would have been profitable on a cash flow basis, and that FVG's failure to obtain sufficient financing and outside investment to rebuild and reopen the South Coast corridor was caused by Respondent's failure to remove squatters from the South Coast right-of-way.\n\n64.\n\nClaimant alleges that Respondent misrepresents the circumstances and motivations behind the process which culminated in the *Lesivo* Resolution. According to Claimant, the *lesivo* process was \"secretly initiated and pursued by Respondent not out of concern about any alleged legal infirmities in the usufruct equipment contracts (Contracts 143/158), which the Government both internally and externally acknowledged were \u2018in effect.' Rather, as confirmed by Respondent's own witnesses and records, the real story is that the alleged legal defects in Contracts 143/158 -which Respondent caused and could have easily resolved on its own without any need for \u2018negotiation' with FVG - were utilized by Respondent as a mere pretext to issue the *Lesivo* Resolution, which Respondent then proceeded to use as a means to try to coerce FVG to renegotiate and surrender its rights under the Usufruct Contracts. The Government's non-negotiable demands to FVG in exchange for withdrawing the *Lesivo* Resolution included, *inter alia*, (i) requiring FVG to put up a $50 million investment to re-open the entire South Coast corridor or surrender its rights to \u2018other [interested] investors' such as Ram\u00f3n Campollo; (ii) relieving the Government of its contractual obligations to remove squatters and make payments to the Railway Trust Fund; (iii) requiring FVG to drop its local breach of contract arbitrations against FEGUA; (iv) increasing the canon fee payments to the Government under the Usufruct Contracts; and (v) forcing FVG to surrender certain railway equipment that had been granted in usufruct. Indeed, Respondent's witnesses in this case freely admit the Government's bad faith motivation behind the *Lesivo* Resolution.\" (para. 2)\n\n65.\n\nClaimant explains that it did not give in to the Government's demands. Instead, like any responsible business would, Claimant issued a press release protesting the Government's hostile and improper action. Claimant argues that Respondent's litigation-inspired theory ignores that: \"in addition to Claimant's press release, there were countless newspaper, television and radio reports in Guatemala concerning the *Lesivo* Resolution in the days and weeks after it was published. These reports did not once quote or rely upon Claimant's press release, but, instead, reported the statements of President Berger, the Attorney General and other senior Government officials which trumpeted the Government's action and implacable hostility to FVG. It was the Government's *Lesivo* Resolution and accompanying public statements which poisoned and destroyed FVG's relations with its existing and potential customers, suppliers, lessees, investors and bankers.\" (para. 3)\n\n66.\n\nAccording to Claimant, President Berger made clear in his public statements that \"the reason he declared *lesivo* was not because of any legal defects in the usufruct equipment contracts, but because FVG had not re-opened the South Coast corridor. He and other Government officials also made clear that they were going to take away the railway usufruct from FVG unless FVG acceded to the Government's extortionate demands, including putting up $50 million within 90 days to re-open the South Coast corridor.\" (para. 4)\n\n67.\n\nClaimant argues that Mr. Campollo's blanket denial of knowledge of or interest in the railway and Claimant's Usufruct rights is not credible and is contradicted by: \"(1) the several actions and statements of his acknowledged representative and agent, H\u00e9ctor Pinto; (2) his financial and personal connections with the family of President Berger; and (3) the fact that, based upon his own business experience in operating a railroad and in the Guatemala commercial real estate sector, he was a direct competitor of Claimant.\" (para. 5)\n\n68.\n\nClaimant requests the Tribunal to determine:\n\n\"a. That the *Lesivo* Resolution and subsequent conduct of the Republic of Guatemala pursuant to and in furtherance of the *Lesivo* Resolution constitute an indirect expropriation of Claimant's covered investments, in violation of CAFTA Article 10.7;\n\nb. That, through these measures, the Republic of Guatemala violated the minimum standard of treatment of CAFTA Article 10.5 by failing to provide, in accordance with customary international law, fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security to Claimant's covered investments;\n\nc. That the Republic of Guatemala has violated the national treatment standard of CAFTA Article 10.3;\n\nd. That the Republic of Guatemala shall pay Claimant $63,778,212 in damages plus compound pre-award interest at 9.34%; and\n\ne. That the Tribunal, pursuant to its power under CAFTA Article 10.26, award Claimant its costs, attorneys' fees and administrative expenses incurred in prosecuting its CAFTA claims.\" (para. 580)\n\n**4. Rejoinder**\n----------------\n\n69.\n\nRespondent recognizes the parties continue to disagree on many factual and legal issues, but affirms that the Tribunal, in discharging its Article 48(3) obligation need only decide fundamental issues. It attempts to limit its responses to the essential claims and defenses that the Tribunal must decide.\n\n70.\n\nAccording to Respondent, with respect to expropriation, the Tribunal must determine \"whether Claimant has satisfied its burden of demonstrating that the preliminary determination by the Executive branch that Claimant's equipment contract (\"Contract 143/158\") was *lesivo* interfered with all of its contracts, to the extent that Claimant's entire investment was \u2018worthless'.\" (para. 4, emphasis in the original omitted)\n\n71.\n\nIt is Respondent's contention that Claimant has failed to demonstrate the link between the declaration of *lesividad* of Contract 143/158 and the real estate rights of Claimant under Contract 402, that the Claimant itself estimates to be the source of 92% of potential income. Absent this link, Respondent argues that Claimant cannot prove its assertion that the *Lesivo* Declaration has caused the financial and commercial decimation of Claimant's real estate operations. Respondent points out that the evidence demonstrates that Claimant's income under the real estate contracts it had before the *Lesivo* Declaration has increased since the issuance and publication of that Declaration.\n\n72.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant\u2019s argument that the *lesividad* process was motivated by the intent to force Claimant to surrender its right under the Usufruct Contracts to benefit other investors, in particular Mr. Campollo. Respondent argues that there is no evidence to support that argument: \"If Guatemala\u2019s intention really was to take away Claimant\u2019s rights under Contract 402, why would it use an option that did not target Contract 402 specifically? Or one \u2014 which Claimant characterizes as a \u2018legal black hole\u2019 \u2014 that had no immediate effect, could be overturned by the *Contencioso Administrativo* Court, and would leave the property in Claimant\u2019s possession pending the *Contencioso Administrativo* Court decision?\" (para. 6) In any case, points out Respondent, Claimant has retained possession of the right-of-way and the railway equipment both legally and factually and has continued to collect revenues from its right-of-way usufruct.\n\n73.\n\nIn terms of fair and equitable treatment, Respondent thus frames the question for the Tribunal's decision: \"whether, in light of the facts, information, and resources that Guatemala had at the time, the initiation of the *lesividad* process falls below the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law\" (para. 7, emphasis in the original omitted).\n\n74.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant articulates the incorrect legal standard under CAFTA and that it has failed to prove that Guatemala's conduct fell below the correct standard of treatment as well as the heightened and inapplicable standard on which Claimant relied.\n\n75.\n\nAs to the obligation to afford the investment full protection and security, Respondent argues that the question to be determined is not whether Guatemala\u2019s efforts with respect to interference would have been sufficient to satisfy its contractual obligations to clear the right-of-way of squatters, but whether \"based on Guatemala\u2019s resources, its legal framework, and the facts that were known at the time, the question is whether the measures that Guatemala took to protect Claimant\u2019s investment were reasonable.\" (para. 9 emphasis in the original omitted) Respondent contends that Claimant has failed to demonstrate that Guatemala\u2019s actions fell short of its commitments under CAFTA. According to Respondent, the facts show that Guatemala has at all relevant times taken reasonable steps to protect Claimant\u2019s investment, both before and since the ***Lesivo*** Declaration.\n\n76.\n\nRespondent frames the question to be determined by the Tribunal in respect of national treatment as to ***\"whether Claimant satisfied its burden of proving that: (1) Claimant and Ram\u00f3n Campollo were \"in like circumstances;\" and (2) whether Claimant actually received less favorable treatment as compared to Ram\u00f3n Campollo.*** If the Tribunal finds that Claimant has met its burden with respect to both of these points, it must also consider whether there were any reasons that could justify any proven disparate treatment\" (para. 10)lt is Respondent\u2019s contention that Claimant has failed to prove that: (i) RDC, a commercial railroad operator in Guatemala, and Ram\u00f3n Campollo, who is primarily in the business of sugar production, whose sugar operation in the Dominican Republic contained a non-commercial, very small rail system for internal company use only, were competitors in the railroad business in Guatemala, and (ii) Mr. Campollo was RDC\u2019s competitor for use of the real estate rights arising from the right-of-way usufruct. Respondent argues further that there is no proof that Claimant received less favorable treatment as compared to Mr. Campollo in these sectors.\n\n77.\n\nAs to Claimant's damages allegations, Respondent argues that Claimant attempts \"to be placed not in the same position it would have been had the *Lesivo* Declaration never been issued, but in the position it would have been if it had not invested its money in FVG and instead had done so in a prosperous and profitable enterprise that generated a whopping 12.9% annual return on equity.\" (para. 13) Respondent asserts that the question for the Tribunal to decide is \"whether Claimant proved that: (1) it suffered quantifiable, compensable damages; and (2) whatever damages it suffered were proximately caused by the *Lesivo* Declaration.\" (para. 13, emphasis in original omitted) Respondent contends that Claimant did not fulfill its burden of proof, and that the evidence shows that its investment in FVG was worthless long before the *Lesivo* Declaration was issued and that the Declaration had no legal or practical effect on Claimant's investment.\n\n78.\n\nRespondent concludes with the request that the Tribunal dismiss all Claimant's claims.\n\n**V. THE CLAIM OF INDIRECT EXPROPIATION**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nFor convenience of reference, it will be useful to reproduce here the relevant provisions of CAFTA:\n\n\"Article 10.7: Expropriation and Compensation\n\n1. No Party may expropriate or nationalize a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalization (\"expropriation\"), except:\n\n(a) for a public purpose;\n\n(b) in a non-discriminatory manner;\n\n(c) on payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2 through 4; and\n\n(d) in accordance with due process of law and Article 10.5.\"\n\n80.\n\nArticle 10 must be interpreted in terms of Annexes 10-B and 10-C. Annex 10-B on \"Customary International Law\" provides:\n\n\"The Parties confirm their shared understanding that \"customary international law\" generally and as specifically referenced in Articles 10.5, 10.6, and Annex 10-C results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 10.5, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.\"\n\nAnnex 10-C reads as follows:\n\n\"The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:\n\n1. Article 10.7.1 is intended to reflect customary international law concerning the obligation of States with respect to expropriation.\n\n2. An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment.\n\n3. Article 10.7.1 addresses two situations. The first is direct expropriation, where an investment is nationalized or otherwise directly expropriated through formal transfer of title or outright seizure.\n\n4. The second situation addressed by Article 10.7.1 is indirect expropriation, where an action or series of actions by a Party has an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright seizure.\n\n(a) The determination of whether an action or series of actions by a Party, in a specific fact situation, constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by case, fact-based inquiry that considers, among other factors:\n\n(i) the economic impact of the government action, although the fact that an action or series of actions by a Party has an adverse effect on the economic value of an investment, standing alone, does not establish that an indirect expropriation has occurred;\n\n(ii) the extent to which the government action interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations; and\n\n(iii) the character of the government action.\n\n(b) Except in rare circumstances, nondiscriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety, and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations.\"\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider Respondent's argument that Claimant cannot claim expropriation of usufruct rights that FVG does not own. It will then proceed to analyze the nature of the *Lesivo* Declaration, its public purpose, whether the Government interfered with reasonable investment backed expectations and their economic impact on Claimant's investment. To the extent necessary, the Tribunal will complement the summary of the parties' arguments on specific matters.\n\n***1. FVG's Usufruct Rights under Contract 143/158***\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n*Analysis of the Tribunal*\n--------------------------\n\n82.\n\nRespondent has argued that Claimant cannot claim expropriation of usufruct rights that FVG does not own. For purposes of considering Respondent's argument it will be useful to recall the reasoning which led the Tribunal to the dismissal of the objection *ratione materiae* in the Second Decision on Jurisdiction:\n\n\"141. It is well established before this Tribunal that Contract 41 was legally tendered by the Government and that the only bid was submitted by FVG and accepted by Respondent on December 16, 1997. Contract 41 was signed more than a year later, on March 23, 1999, but never approved by *Acuerdo Gubernativo* and Congress, both approvals being conditions for Contract 41 to become effective.\n\n142. Shortly after signature of Contract 41, on April 12, 1999, FEGUA authorized FVG by letter to use the towing and traction equipment at the request of FVG. The authorization was renewed in 2000 at FVG's request. The letter of FVG, dated April 16, 2000, explains that the requested equipment is needed by FVG to fulfill its obligations under Contract 402 pending the approval of Contract 41, and then it states: \u2018The use of the railway equipment we are hereby requesting is subject to the same terms and conditions as apply to the agreement mentioned in item b) above [Contract 41], and will not in any way amend or affect the agreement already mentioned.'\n\n143. Thus notwithstanding that Contract 41 was never approved, FEGUA let FVG operate the equipment to the extent that, shortly after signature of Contract 41 and three days after FEGUA authorized the use of the railway equipment, on April 15, 1999, train service was established between Guatemala City and El Chile. It is worth noting that at that time Contract 402 was not yet effective; it became effective more than a month later on May 23, 1999, which implies that the section Guatemala City-El Chile of the railway was rehabilitated before Contract 402 was effective. In December 1999 train service was extended to Puerto Barrios and Puerto Santo Tom\u00e1s. FVG used the equipment and paid the corresponding canon under the terms of Contract 41 as if it would have been in effect until signature of Contract 143. Afterwards, the equipment continued to be used and the higher canon provided for in Contract 143 was paid and accepted until after the publication of the *Lesivo* Resolution.\n\n144. The Tribunal concludes that both parties to the Contract - FEGUA and FVG - conducted themselves substantially as if the terms of Contract 41 had been in effect - as they have done since the beginning of their relationship in the case of Contract 402. Contract 143 was entered into four years after Contract 41 when it was evident that Contract 41 would not come into effect. The reasons for declaring the Equipment Usufruct Contracts *lesivo* as stated in the \" *Exposici\u00f3n de Motivos* \" of the *Lesivo* Resolution are substantially the same as those that prevented Contract 41 becoming effective (lack of approval by *Acuerdo Gubernativo* and by Congress) or relate to the need to follow the procedures for public contracting that, notwithstanding the fact that they had already been followed by FVG and FEGUA in respect of the same equipment in the case of Contract 41, had been to no avail to secure the approvals entirely under the Government's control.\n\n145. Respondent has argued that FVG was fully aware of the approval conditions of Contract 143 when it entered into it since its objective was the same: the usufruct of the equipment. Respondent has denied that FEGUA and FVG entered into Contract 143 at the Government's request. Who took the initiative to sign a new contract is irrelevant to the Tribunal's conclusion. FEGUA and FVG were faced with a *de facto* situation which they tried to reflect in Contract 143, and FEGUA benefited from a 25% increase in the canon stipulated in Contract 41.\n\n146. Even if FEGUA's actions with respect to Contract 41/143 and in its allowance to FVG to use the rail equipment were *ultra vires* (not \u2018pursuant to domestic law'), \u2018principles of fairness' should prevent the government from raising \u2018violations of its own law as a jurisdictional defense when [in this case, operating in the guise of FEGUA, it] knowingly overlooked them and [effectively] endorsed an investment which was not in compliance with its law'\n\n147. Based on these considerations, the Tribunal finds that Respondent is precluded from raising any objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the ground that Claimant's investment is not a covered investment under the Treaty or the ICSID Convention.\"\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 2 of the *Lesivo* Declaration instructs and authorizes the Attorney General of the Nation \"to undertake and execute all legal measures required in order *to cease the binding force* of the contract identified above [Contract 143/158] and hold the relevant parties legally accountable, if applicable.\" (Emphasis added by the Tribunal) The text shows that Respondent considered that Contract 143/158 was binding; otherwise there would have been no purpose in instructing the Attorney General in these terms. The Tribunal also notes that Respondent recognizes that this is the case in its Counter-Memorial: \"[...] because Claimant's alleged right to compensation is not yet ripe, because the *Contencioso Administrativo* court has not yet decided the matter and thus Contract 143/158 remains valid and in full force, Guatemala has not violated any duty to pay \u2018prompt, adequate and effective compensation.'\" (Para. 339) Respondent also states that the court may decide that Contract 143/158 is not *lesivo* and leave it permanently in effect. (para. 265)\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that FVG's rights under Contract 143/158 are in effect and could be expropriated by Respondent. Whether the *Lesivo* Declaration expropriated them and the extent to which it affected Claimant's investment beyond Contract 143/158 are matters to which the Tribunal now turns.\n\n**2. The Character of the Government's Action**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n*Analysis of the Tribunal*\n--------------------------\n\n85.\n\nOn its face the *Lesivo* Declaration is a measure adopted by the executive branch where the Government agrees to declare Contract 143/158 *lesivo* because it causes harm to the State, and instructs and authorizes the Attorney General to take measures to cease its obligatory character. As instructed, the Attorney General filed a *lesivo* claim with the Administrative Tribunal.\n\n86.\n\nAfter the second hearing on jurisdiction the Tribunal asked the parties, *inter alia* : \"(a) On the assumption (which it is understood is in dispute) that a declaration of *lesividad* involves a measure of judgment or discretion, can it really be said that a contract subsequently declared *lesivo* is unlawful *ab initio* ; (b) Can a contract be declared *lesivo* as a result of facts occurring after its conclusion? [...]\"\n\n87.\n\nTo the first question Respondent replied that a contract declared *lesivo* by the competent judicial authority is deemed unlawful *ab initio*. According to Respondent, Guatemala cannot unilaterally declare a contract *lesivo* and cease performance; the governmental agency concerned must continue to operate under the contract until the Administrative Tribunal declares the contract unlawful *ab initio* ; if it does so, the Administrative Tribunal orders that the parties restore things to their respective positions before the agreement was entered into, thus avoiding any unjust enrichment due to the partial *de facto* performance of the contract declared *lesivo*.\n\n88.\n\nClaimant drew a distinction between the concepts of \"legality\" and \"harmfulness to the interests of the State\". Claimant explains that the lawfulness of a contract is a matter of the law of contracts and not *lesividad*. According to Claimant, a contract may comply with Guatemalan law and still be harmful to the interests of one of the parties; the legality of a usufruct contract is regulated by the civil law on contracts while the *lesividad* is a procedure regulated by the *Ley de lo Contencioso Administrativo*. It is the view of Claimant that \"[t]he availability to the State of separate and distinct remedies in the civil and administrative courts to declare a contract void *ab initio* or voidable due to various legal defects demonstrates that Guatemalan law draws a clear distinction between the \u2018legality' of a contract and *\u2018lesividad'* of a contract.\" Claimant concludes by affirming that the declaration of *lesivo* should not be based on the technical defects of a contract which can be otherwise remedied but because, in the judgment of the President of Guatemala, \"the announced interests of the State upon which the contract is based were capricious or because the terms of the contract were not reasonably related to those announced interests.\"\n\n89.\n\nRespondent replied to the second question in the negative and explained that \" *lesividad* is determined by legal defects and illegalities relating to the contract's formation and the terms of the contract as such, and not by supervening causes or subsequent conduct by the parties. This helps to explain why a contract declared *lesivo* is deemed unlawful *ab initio*.\"\n\n90.\n\nClaimant replied substantially in similar terms. According to Claimant, \"the nature of *lesivo* itself and the structure of the procedures concerning the declaration of *lesividad* ***,*** [...] indicate that independent facts occurring subsequent to the formation of the contract cannot be considered as a ground for *lesivo*.\" Claimant considers that this view is confirmed by the fact that \"the statute of limitations on declaring *lesividad* runs three years from the date of the contract, not from some subsequent event\", and by the fact that none of the declarations of *lesivo* over the last 20 years have relied on independent post-execution facts.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that: (a) *lesivo* is unrelated to the performance of either party under the contract declared *lesivo* ; (b) it leaves the rights of the parties unaffected; (c) it is a process that applies only to contracts with the State and its agencies; (d) a declaration of *lesivo* may or may not be accepted by the Administrative Tribunal; (e) if the declaration is accepted, the defendant would have the possibility to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court; and (f) if the *lesivo* declaration is confirmed, a *lesivo* contract is void *ab initio*.\n\n92.\n\nThe parties dispute a number of issues: the relationship between legality or irregularity and *lesividad;*, whether the power to declare *lesivo* meets the requirements of due process because the affected private party in an administrative contract is not heard or informed before a declaration of *lesividad* is adopted by the Government; and whether the President has any discretion once an illegality has been brought to his attention, but to declare it *lesivo*. The Tribunal will consider these questions in due course.\n\n**3. The Purpose of the Measure**\n---------------------------------\n\n*Analysis of the Tribunal*\n--------------------------\n\n93.\n\nClaimant has alleged that the intent of Respondent was not to expropriate for a public purpose but to award Claimant's usufruct rights to Mr. Ram\u00f3n Campollo or other investors. On the other hand, Respondent has denied any connection between its actions in respect of Claimant's investment and Mr. Campollo or any other investors. The Tribunal will proceed by recalling the timeline of events and contemporary documentary evidence in its consideration of the disputed facts and the contradictory allegations of the parties.\n\n94.\n\nMr. Campollo and Messrs. Duggan and Senn met in Miami in the offices of counsel to Claimant on December 3, 2004. Both parties agree that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss Mr. Campollo's potential interest in investing in the railway and rebuilding the South Coast corridor. The meeting was also attended by Juan Esteban Berger, son of the then President Berger. Prior to that meeting, at the request of Mr. Campollo, RDC, through Mr. Duggan, had advised Mr. Campollo on the operation of the railway in his sugar plantation in the Dominican Republic.\n\n95.\n\nOn February 17, 2005, Mr. H\u00e9ctor Pinto, who was a member of the Squatters Commission representing the sugar industry and who, according to Claimant, acted on behalf of Mr. Campollo, sent a letter to FVG with a proposed agreement. Claimant has been unable to locate a copy of the letter and has submitted an email from Mr. Duggan to Mr. Senn which attaches a rough translation in English (Ex C-97). The letter was sent on behalf of Desarrollos G which Claimant considers to be a company owned by Mr. Campollo. Claimant also considers that this proposal is a follow-up to the discussions at the Miami meeting.\n\n96.\n\nOn March 9, 2005, Mr. Pinto sent by email to FVG a draft contract to be entered into between FVG and Desarrollos G. The email was copied to Juan Esteban Berger and, according to Claimant, the meta-data contained in this document reveals that the last author of the draft was JEB (Juan Esteban Berger).\n\n97.\n\nOn March 15, 2005, Messrs. Posner, Duggan, Senn and RDC's President Robert Pietandrea met with Mr. Pinto. According to the testimony of Messrs. Posner, Duggan and Senn, Mr. Pinto stressed that if FVG chose not to collaborate with Mr. Campollo in accordance with the option sent by Mr. Pinto, then Mr. Campollo would take the business with or without FVG. Mr. Pinto was informed that RDC had no interest in Mr. Campollo's proposal but would be willing to consider Mr. Campollo buying into FVG as an investor or business partner.\n\n98.\n\nOn April 5, 2005, Mr. Pinto called Mr. Senn and on April 6, 2005, Mr. Pinto sent to Mr. Posner a letter by email attaching a draft contract, supposedly the same document that FVG had already received on March 9. The transmittal letter of Mr. Pinto explains that, as a follow up to the recent meeting during Mr. Posner's visit to Guatemala, \"le env\u00edo para su estudio y consideraci\u00f3n la propuesta de intenci\u00f3n que se ha discutido con Ferrov\u00edas durante m\u00e1s de cuatro meses, tiempo durante el cual se adelantaron gestiones preparativas para el restablecimiento del Ramal Sur o Corredor Pac\u00edfico, que pretende conectar Puerto Quetzal a [sic] el centro inter modal de transporte de Ciudad del Sur en Santa Luc\u00eda Cotzumalguapa.\"2 According to Mr. Pinto, it was of paramount importance to know the opinion on the attached proposal since it was \"muy importante iniciar los estudios t\u00e9cnicos de prefactibilidad y la estrategia de desalojo de invasores.\"3\n\n\"I am sending you for your review and consideration the proposal discussed with Ferrov\u00edas during more than four months, during which administrative steps were taken in preparation of re-establishing the South Spur or Pacific Corridor in order to connect Puerto Quetzal to the inter-modal transport center of Ciudad del Sur in Santa Luc\u00eda Cotzumalguapa.\" Translation of the Tribunal.\n\n\"it was very important to initiate the technical prefeasibility studies and the strategy to remove squatters.\" Translation of the Tribunal.\n\n99.\n\nThe record of the conversation between Mr. Senn and Mr. Pinto was summarized by Mr. Senn in an email to Mr. Posner on April 6, 2005. Mr. Senn writes: \"H\u00e9ctor called me yesterday saying that regardless of what we decide about signing this document, it can't be signed now, may be later [...] because of illegalities in our contract.\" In the email Mr. Senn characterizes Mr. Pinto as being \"obviously Ram\u00f3n [Campollo's] dirty-jobber\" and advises that a counter-proposal be done \"directly to Ram\u00f3n and no-one else to avoid falling in his misunderstandings game.\" The message also explains that \"Ram\u00f3n plays a key role within the local sugar industry and he already sent someone last Friday to talk to Freddie P\u00e9rez of Expogranel (General Manager of the sugar export terminal at Puerto Quetzal). His message was to hold the project until we finish discussing some illegalities...I felt Freddie [was] a little concerned about the issue but finally [he] agreed to keep moving forward with our project, FVG-Expogranel, while handling carefully the relation with Ram\u00f3n.\" (Ex C-100) Mr. Posner advised Mr. Senn to reconfirm RDC's lack of interest in the proposal sent by Mr. Pinto, but that RDC is open to discuss the counterproposal RDC made at the March 15 meeting.(Ibid)\n\n100.\n\nA further meeting of Messrs. Duggan and Senn with Mr. Pinto took place on April 12, 2005.\n\n101.\n\nOn the same date Dr. Gramajo informed the Legal Coordinator of the Ministry of Communications of the legal issues in respect of Contracts 402, 143/158 and 820.\n\n102.\n\nOn April 13, 2005, Mr. Pinto informed Mr. Gandara, Vice-Minister of Communications, that the negotiations between the company he represented and FVG had been unsuccessful and requested to be excused from attending further meetings of the Squatter Commission.\n\n103.\n\nOn April 15, 2005, Messrs. Senn and Duggan met with Mr. J.E. Berger.\n\n104.\n\nOn the same date, Mr. Campollo informed FVG that he had decided not to participate in the project proposed to him by RDC in Miami. According to Mr. Campollo's testimony, he signed the letter in front of Mr. Pinto and instructed him not to contact or negotiate with FVG on his behalf.\n\n105.\n\nMr. Gramajo, Overseer of FEGUA at the time, testified that, upon receipt of Mr. Pinto's letter, he decided not to move forward with the plan to remove squatters from the South Corridor because the sugar industry withdrew its support, including the company represented by Mr. Pinto.\n\n106.\n\nNotwithstanding Mr. Campollo's instruction, Mr. Pinto continued to contact FVG. On February 28, 2006, a week before the March 7, 2006 meeting with President Berger, Mr. Pinto contacted FVG expressing interest in having a meeting on the use of the railway to connect the planned Ciudad del Sur industrial park development in Santa Luc\u00eda with Puerto Quetzal. The last email of Mr. Pinto on this topic is dated July 26, 2006.\n\n107.\n\nOn July 28, 2006, Messrs. Montano and Melville separately informed Mr. Duggan and Mr. Posner, respectively, that there was a push within the government to cancel the usufruct and to declare the concession *lesivo*. According to Claimant, both attributed the action to the doing of Mr. Campollo or that after the concession was cancelled it would be awarded to Mr. Campollo.\n\n108.\n\nOn September 5, 2006, Mr. Pinto wrote to Emmanuel Seidner, an official working for the Competitiveness Commissioner, informing him that railway service between Puerto Quetzal to Ciudad del Sur would be restored shortly in order to transport sugar to the port. He sent a blind copy to Mr. Senn. The authenticity of this communication has been questioned by Respondent but Claimant has produced the original email from Ms. V\u00e1ldez, Mr. Pinto's secretary, to Mr. Senn, attaching Mr. Pinto's letter to Mr. Seidner. (Ex C-116) Claimant has argued that Ciudad del Sur was a project of Mr. Campollo. Mr. Campollo has testified that by that time this project had been abandoned for more than a year.\n\n109.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that it has not had the benefit of Mr. Pinto's testimony because he is now deceased. The contemporaneous documents written by Mr. Pinto or its interlocutors show his persistent interest in the Southern Corridor whether acting on behalf on Mr. Campollo or on his own account. He was aware of the thinking of FEGUA on the illegalities of Contract 143 before Mr. Gramajo wrote to the Legal Coordinator at the Ministry of Communications. It is evident from Mr. Gramajo's testimony that he regarded Mr. Pinto at least as a representative of the sugar industry, if not of Mr. Campollo. The evidence also shows that Mr. Campollo had an interest in the South Corridor and RDC's representatives met him in Miami when seeking interested parties in restoring that segment of the railroad. He later desisted from pursuing the matter further as stated in his letter of April 15, 2005 (Respondent, Exhibit R-173) and acknowledged by FVG on April 18, 2005 (Respondent, Exhibit R-174). It is significant in this respect that the Usufruct Contracts continue to be in effect more than five years after the *Lesivo* Declaration without any attempt by Respondent to hand over the railway concession to Mr. Campollo.\n\n110.\n\nTo conclude, notwithstanding the emphasis placed by Claimant on Mr. Campollo being the mover behind the scenes who allegedly would ultimately benefit from the demise of the Usufruct Contacts, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the evidence produced in support of Claimant's allegations. That the purpose of the *Lesiv* o Declaration was to deprive Claimant of its usufruct rights for the benefit of Mr. Campollo has not been proven.4\n\nSee paras. 155-156 below on the issue of whether Mr. Campollo and Claimant were similarly situated.\n\n111.\n\nOn the other hand, it is clear from the President Berger's statements that Respondent was dissatisfied with the lack of further investment in the railroad by Claimant and that the *Lesivo* Declaration was used as a tactic to pressure Claimant to invest more, irrespective of its obligations under Contract 402, or forfeit its investment in favor of other unspecified investors. This is a matter that the Tribunal will address when considering the alleged breach of the minimum standard of treatment.\n\n**4. Investment-backed Expectations**\n-------------------------------------\n\n*a) The Parties' Arguments*\n---------------------------\n\n112.\n\nClaimant asserts that the *Lesivo* Declaration has undermined, *inter alia*, the following expectations: \"(i) RDC's expectation that FVG would have the exclusive right to use the rolling stock during the entire 50-year term of the Usufruct; (ii) RDC's expectation and understanding that Deed 143 was awarded, executed and approved in accordance with Guatemalan law; (iii) RDC's expectation and understating that the economic terms of Deeds 143/158 were acceptable to the Government; (iv) RDC's expectation and understanding that Deeds 143/158 adequately protected the Government's purported \u2018historical and cultural patrimony' interests in the rolling stock; (v) RDC's expectation that the Government would, pursuant to its obligation under Deed 402, not \u2018hinder the rail and non-rail activities of [FVG]', and \u2018protect the exercise of [FVG's] rights against third parties that may intend to have or want to exercise a right on the real estate granted as onerous usufruct'; (vi) RDC's expectation and understanding that any disputes between it or FVG and the Government would be addressed and resolved through negotiation or binding arbitration rather than unilateral Government action; and (vii) RDC's expectation and understanding that Guatemala would not take any precipitous or arbitrary actions against it that would serve to harm RDC's investment or FVG's business, especially where there is no contention that FVG has breached any obligation under the Usufruct Contracts and there is no evidence that Deeds 143/158 were injurious to the interests of the State.\" (Memorial, para. 153)\n\n113.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant could not expect that Contract 143/158 would not be challenged under Guatemalan law. Respondent refers to the experience of Claimant with public contracting in Guatemala and to the fact that all three contracts - 402, 820 and 41- were subject to public bidding. Respondent asserts that \"Claimant was acutely aware that the lack of Executive approval could lead to the invalidity of a Contract, this being the very reason why Contract 41 never entered into force; a fact that Claimant concedes. That it entered into Contract 143/158 and, in violation of Guatemalan law, tried to contract away this legal requirement cannot create a legitimate expectation that the absence of this legal requirement would not later be challenged by the Government using a legal remedy that existed when Claimant entered into this Contract.\" (Rejoinder, para. 58)\n\n114.\n\nRespondent contends that \"performance of a contract cannot preclude Guatemala from utilizing pre-existing measures, within their time limits, to remedy legal defects under that contract. A bright-line ruling that a State is precluded from questioning the validity of a contract because it had performed under that contract -which, when taken to the extreme, could prevent even contracts initiated under coercion or through bribery- would severely and improperly restrict State sovereignty.\" (Rejoinder, para. 60)\n\n115.\n\nRespondent insists that the question for the Tribunal is not whether Contract 143/158 is *lesivo* but whether the Government acted reasonably in reaching the conclusion that it was *lesivo* and in issuing the Declaration. Respondent contends that \"even if these officials [Government officials who studied whether Contract 143/158 was *lesivo* ] in good faith reached an incorrect legal determination about whether this contract was *lesivo*  ***-*** which Guatemala contends they did not - that does not constitute an expropriation under CAFTA or a violation of any legitimate expectation Claimant may have. Claimant cannot have a legitimate expectation that the Government would make no mistakes in assessing Claimant's legal rights under the subject contract (Rejoinder, para. 64)\n\n*b) Analysis of the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n116.\n\nIt is reasonable to argue that an investor, or any party to a contract, may not have legitimate expectations that a government would not make mistakes in assessing one's legal rights. This is not the issue. The question is whether, if mistakes are made, other parties who had acted on such mistakes in good faith and to their own detriment, should have the right to expect that the party who made the mistake would bear the consequences.\n\n117.\n\nIn the instant case Claimant participated in the bidding for three contracts which it won. The first two were approved by *acuerdo gubernativo* while the third, Contract 41, was signed but never approved. At the second objections to jurisdiction phase, the Tribunal asked the parties:\n\n\"(e) Why was Contract 41 never approved? Why did each side proceed under Contract 41 (and then Contracts 143 and 158) as though there was a legal contract in place?\" (Second Decision on Jurisdiction (para. 91)\n\n118.\n\nRespondent replied that the reasons for the lack of approval of Contract 41 \"remain essentially unclear based on the evidence of record.\" Respondent noted that \"Ferrov\u00edas never utilized the legal remedies open to it in such circumstance. Respondent emphatically denies that the parties ever considered that Contract 41 entered into force or operated as if it were in force. On the other hand, Contracts 143 and 158 are \"technically in force and must be observed by the parties -notwithstanding its [sic] illegalities - at least until such time as the *Contencioso Administrativo* court decides whether those Contracts are *lesivo* and should be declared null *ab initio\"*. (Second Decision, para. 104)\n\n119.\n\nIn turn Claimant replied that:\n\n\"it is not correct to state that Contract 41 was never \"approved\" by the Government since the Government had approved and published the bidding terms and conditions. At most, according to Claimant, it can be argued that Contract 41 was not ratified by the President. Claimant also observes that, \"Despite the Government's purported position that such ratification was necessary and essential, it never provided FVG with any reason or explanation as to why it did not or could not obtain ratification [\u2026] Even to this day, FVG does not know or understand why the Government never obtained Executive ratification of Contracts 41 and 143, and Respondent's witnesses have certainly not offered any logical or credible explanation for the Government's failure to do so.\" (Second Decision, para. 105. Footnotes omitted)\n\n120.\n\nTo this day the Tribunal has not been given any explanation for the absence of ratification of Contract 41 by the Respondent.5 Absent such an explanation, in its view, in a situation where three contracts are let that relate to the same operation, an investor who had won all three, two of which had been approved by the Respondent or its agencies, could reasonably expect that the third contract would also be ratified. In this respect the Tribunal observes, as it did in its Second Decision on Jurisdiction, that notwithstanding that Contract 41 was never ratified by *acuerdo gubernativo*, FEGUA let FVG operate the equipment to the extent that, shortly after signature of Contract 41 and three days after FEGUA authorized the use of the railway equipment by an exchange of letters with FVG, on April 15, 1999, train service was established between Guatemala City and El Chile. It is also worth noting that at that time Contract 402 was not yet effective; it became effective more than a month later on May 23, 1999, which indicates that the section Guatemala City-El Chile of the railway was rehabilitated before Contract 402 was effective. This factual context shows that both parties moved to implement the rehabilitation of the railroad and restoration of service once the contracts were awarded and signed.\n\n\"I also wish to clarify that I did ask President \u00c1lvaro Arz\u00fa to approve Equipment Contract 41 by Executive Resolution. I do not know if Ferrov\u00edas, for their part, requested the same. I can confirm that while I was Overseer we never received the approval, and I do not know the reason why President Arz\u00fa's administration did not do it [...]\" Witness Statement of Andr\u00e9s Porras, Overseer of FEGUA from January 1997 to March 2000, para. 23.\n\n121.\n\nThe arrangement to use the equipment through exchanges of letters lasted until 2003 when Contract 143 was signed. According to Respondent, Claimant was aware of the need of the *acuerdo gubernativo* because of its participation in the bidding of Contract 41 and, therefore, could not have a legitimate expectation that the contract would not be declared *lesivo* because of lack of compliance with Guatemalan law.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant has argued that, while the bidding conditions required the ratification of Contract 41 by *acuerdo gubernativo*, it does not follow that for the type of equipment covered in Contract 143 and given that FEGUA is an autonomous, decentralized agency, Guatemalan law actually requires ratification by *acuerdo gubernativo*. Respondent disagrees and the Tribunal does not need to decide between the two positions, it nevertheless notes that there are credible arguments based on the laws of Guatemala to suggest that Contract 143 may not have required *acuerdo gubernativo*. The Tribunal further notes that, although the Government never bothered to ratify Contract 41, it benefited from the re-opening of the railway service with the equipment leased through the exchanges of letters on Contract 143/158, and FEGUA accepted payment of the canon for the use of the equipment without protest. The Attorney General's opinion of August 1, 2005 points out the special situation of FEGUA as an institution subject to the State's control for purposes of contract approvals: \"[...] in accordance with the Government Contracts Law [Ley de Contrataciones del Estado], the prior contract [Contract 41] should have been approved by the Board of Directors, but given that the entity is being overseen, we face a *sui generis* case not provided for in the Procurement Law.\" (Ex. R-15, para a)) In this situation it is a reasonable analogy to consider that the Overseer of FEGUA replaced FEGUA's Board, rather than the President of Guatemala doing so. (Mayora Second Opinion, para. 3.4.3) As for the lack of public bidding, the equipment covered by Contract 143 was substantially the same as that included in Contract 41, and FVG had squarely won the bid for this contract. Respondent was well aware that the railway equipment was needed to run the railroad. Notably because of the narrow gauge of the railroad track, the equipment could not be used anywhere else nor was it practical or economically feasible to bring suitable equipment from somewhere else. Respondent also accepted and approved at the highest level (including Congress) Contract 402, by which FVG reserved its right to opt out of this contract if it did not get the railway equipment. FVG needed the equipment to fulfill its obligations under Contract 402 and FEGUA confirmed that it had fulfilled its obligations under that contract providing service with equipment leased under the exchange of letters. In those circumstances, in the Tribunal's view, it was legitimate for the investor to believe that its actions and those of its counterpart were not harmful to the interest of the State. The investor was providing a service which at the highest levels Government had decided to privatize and which in state hands had already irretrievably broken down. There was nothing, at the time the contracts were concluded, to suggest that they were contrary to the interests of Guatemala. On the contrary, they were procured through competitive bidding, the terms of which were prepared by the Government itself.\n\n123.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the expectation of Claimant to have a legally valid contract was not misplaced. It was created by the actions of Respondent and of its agency, FEGUA.\n\n**5. The Economic Impact of the Government's Action**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n*a) The Parties' Arguments*\n---------------------------\n\n124.\n\nClaimant describes the impact of *lesivo* as follows:\n\n(i) It caused a critical number of FVG's railway customers to refuse to continue to do business with FVG;\n\n(ii) It caused FVG's principal suppliers of goods, services and short-term financing to significantly reduce or eliminate their credit terms and/or services to FVG;\n\n(iii) Potential new customers, lenders, investors and joint venture partners immediately backed away from negotiations and discussions with FVG after having previously expressed interest in doing business with FVG; and\n\n(iv) Local courts, police and municipalities consistently relied upon the *Lesivo* Resolution as a basis to deny protection to, issue rulings against and allow theft of and vandalism against FVG's Usufruct property.\" (Memorial, para. 133)\n\n125.\n\nRespondent disputes that the Declaration had any such effects and indicates that, in any case, the Declaration affected only Contract 143/158 and not Contract 402 which Claimant considered to be the core of its investment. Respondent recalls that FVG could terminate Contract 402 only if it could not acquire the railway equipment pursuant to a separate bidding process and as a consequence would not be able to comply with the purposes of that contract. Respondent presumes that this would require Claimant to show that it could not acquire the equipment elsewhere. Respondent concludes in respect of Contract 402 that Claimant's argument that it could no longer operate under Contract 402 if it lost the right to use FEGUA's equipment is without merit and the *Lesivo* Declaration had no effect on Contract 402.\n\n126.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the mere initiation of the *lesividad* process did not interfere with Contract 143/158 in law or in fact and, if Claimant suffered damage, it was due to Claimant's own actions in publicizing the Declaration. Respondent points out that it did not hold press conferences or take out pre-prepared press releases in all the popular Guatemalan newspapers.\n\n127.\n\nRespondent maintains that it negotiated in good faith to cure the defects of Contract 143/158 and that Claimant squandered those opportunities. In particular Respondent refers to FEGUA's proposal to FVG of August 24, 2006. (Ex. C44) In addition, Respondent asserts that Claimant bears responsibility for publishing statements that pre-judged the result of the judicial review of Contract 143/158 before it began. Respondent concludes on this point that \"to the extent Claimant suffered any damages or lost business as a result of the *Lesivo* Declaration, it was a result of its own misguided public relations strategy, and without any encouragement or help from Guatemala. In essence, Claimant created a self-fulfilling prophecy by repeatedly informing the country and its investors that it was \u2018dead man walking', and risky business partner\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 273).\n\n128.\n\nRespondent argues that even if the Tribunal were to find that the *Lesivo* Declaration and subsequent acts interfered with Claimant's investment such interference was not substantial. Referring to the abundant case-law on this subject, Respondent contends that the measures equivalent to expropriation must be not mere restrictions but of \"such magnitude as to \u2018 *annihilate* ' the investment, \u2018 *radically deprive* ' Claimant of the economic use and enjoyment of its investment, \u2018 *neutralize* ' the benefits, economic value of the use enjoyment or disposition of the investor's property, render Claimant's property rights \u2018 *useless* ' due to a \u2018 *substantially complete deprivation* ' of the economic use and enjoyment of rights to property or \u2018 *destroy* ' the business in question\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 317, footnotes omitted). Respondent affirms that Claimant has not shown that the *Lesivo* Declaration had any of these effects.\n\n129.\n\nRespondent refers to Claimant's own statements in the Memorial to the effect that \"RDC's investment in the rehabilitation of the railroad was wholly unconnected to the profits FVG would have earned over the life of the Usufruct from its program to lease the right of way and adjacent real estate parcels for non-railway purposes\", and concludes that the claim of substantial interference is unsustainable because the *Lesivo* Declaration did not deprive Claimant of its rights under the most lucrative component of its investment, Contract 402. Furthermore, as defined by Claimant, the investment comprises Contracts 402, 41, 820 and 143/158 and therefore the *Lesivo* Declaration relates to only a small portion of its investment.\n\n130.\n\nRespondent insists that any loss of railway customers was due to Claimant's press campaign, and to the fact that it ended railway service in 2007. Respondent points out that all agencies and branches of the Government have acted consistently with the understanding that Contract 143/158 was still in effect. Respondent refers to several examples: the Administrative Court declined a request in 2007 and in 2008 to grant injunctive suspension of Contract 143/158, \"thereby recognizing that FVG retained its rights under that agreement.\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 325); and the police and municipalities have continued \"to uphold the validity of Contract 143/158 (and 402) and have continued to evict squatters from the land.\" (ibid.)\n\n131.\n\nRespondent adds that, if Claimant suffered any interference, it is not irreversible or irrevocable and, therefore, not permanent because the *Lesivo* Declaration has not been confirmed by the Administrative Tribunal. Respondent reiterates that the *Lesivo* Declaration is devoid of legal effect and only the Administrative Tribunal has the power to declare Contract 143/158 null and void for *lesividad.* Respondent emphasizes that Claimant retains full ownership and possession of the rights granted pursuant to each of the Usufruct Contracts and remains in possession of the railway equipment contemplated under Contract 143/158.\n\n132.\n\nClaimant points out that Respondent linked the issuance of the Resolution to the alleged failure to comply with its rehabilitation obligations under Contract 402 and its unwillingness to surrender substantial rights under that contract. Claimant argues that the fact that it would not need FEGUA's equipment for the South Coast segment is irrelevant because, if FVG did not have that equipment, it could not fulfill its performance obligations under Contract 402 and \"had the Government taken away the FEGUA equipment from FVG, FVG could have immediately exercised its right under Clause 18 of Contract 402 to terminate that contract without further liability or obligation\" (Reply, para. 261).\n\n133.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent did not, in the weeks after the issuance of the *Lesivo* Declaration, disavow any of its statements regarding its intent to use the Declaration to force FVG to amend Contract 402 - under the threat of terminating the Usufruct Contracts and taking the entire railway - because FVG would not be able to provide railway services. According to Claimant this is how the action of Respondent was perceived by current and potential customers, suppliers and lenders.\n\n134.\n\nClaimant recalls that the case law requires substantial deprivation or impairment of the investor's economic rights or reasonably expected economic benefits. Claimant argues that the fact that FVG continues to earn income from one long-term property lease and four right-of-way easements does not show that Claimant has not been substantially deprived of the expected economic benefits of its investment. Claimant emphasizes that both the lease and easements date back from before the *Lesivo* Declaration and that it has not been able to secure any additional ones.\n\n135.\n\nClaimant denies that its press release caused or contributed to any losses of FVG and contends that the evidence shows that the actions and public statements of the President, the Attorney General and other high officials caused FVG to be perceived as a dead man walking.\n\n136.\n\nRespondent insists in its Rejoinder that Claimant has failed to show that Guatemala substantially interfered with its investment. Respondent points out that Claimant had conceded in its Reply that the bulk of its income came from real estate rights granted pursuant to Contract 402, that RDC's investment in the rehabilitation of the railroad was unconnected to the profits FVG would earn over the life of the usufruct from real estate leases, that the records show that real estate income has increased since the *Lesivo* Declaration, that the equipment covered by Contract 143/158 could be used only within Phase I of the project. Furthermore, Respondent points out to the limited evidence, as stipulated by Claimant's counsel, supporting the allegations of Claimant in respect of the effect of the *Lesivo* Resolution on customers, suppliers or lenders whether current or potential. Respondent also points out that Claimant's customers continued to do business with Claimant or would have done business with Claimant, if Claimant had not voluntarily ceased operations in 2007.\n\n137.\n\nRespondent insists on the possibility of the *Lesivo* Declaration being overturned, and the fact that in the meantime the railway equipment remains in the hands of FVG to support its argument that the Declaration had no permanent or lasting effect. According to Respondent, \"Claimant's argument boils down to a suggestion that the multi-year length of the proceedings is alone sufficient to prove its claim.\" (Rejoinder, para. 82) Respondent also insists in the lack of a causal link between the *Lesivo* Declaration and the alleged damage to Claimant's investment.\n\n138.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"it is not unreasonable to conclude, and is likely a higher probability, that FVG was pleased to seize on the *Lesivo* Declaration as an excuse to close an unprofitable business. As far back as the annual report for 2002, FVG made clear that the fiber optic contracts that it anticipated in its business plan had not materialized (due to no fault of Guatemala), leaving a large hole in its revenues from leasing activity - activity that Claimant says represented 92 percent of the expected benefits from its investment. And as made clear in the Counter-Memorial, the writing was on the wall that Claimant's investment was doomed to fall well before the *Lesivo* Declaration was published, because, Respondent argues, Claimant itself acknowledged that it needed approximately US$100 million to restore the railway in the Southern corridor of Guatemala in order to make its venture profitable and that it did not have any viable source of funding to obtain this capital. Without this investment, Claimant was doomed to more years of continuous losses, and needed capital infusions by the shareholders of FVG to keep the company from sinking into bankruptcy. If ongoing capital infusions from FVG were needed since profits from the railroad business were non-existent, as they were in fact, Claimant's economic incentive was to close railway operations as rapidly as possible.\" (Rejoinder, para. 98)\n\n*b) Analysis of the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider the link between the availability of the equipment and Contract 402; then the extent to which Respondent linked the issues of Contract 143/158 to the overall investment notwithstanding that the *Lesivo* Declaration addressed only Contract 143/158; and lastly the effect of the Declaration on Claimant's investment.\n\n140.\n\nIt is a fact that the right-of-way and the equipment contracts were bid separately. Clause 10(e) of Contract 402 provides for the right of FVG to \"Acquire railway and non-railway equipment owned by FEGUA, as it may be convenient for its operations, under the terms of the bidding conditions from which this contract arises.\" (Claimant's translation) Rule 4.1.6 of the bidding rules for Contract 402 in relevant part provides that: \"Bidders may inspect the railway equipment and equipment not directly related to the railway owned by FEGUA. Said equipment shall be auctioned at a future date after the adjudication of the Railway Usufruct Contract and the contractor shall have the opportunity to acquire the equipment which he considers appropriate for his operations.\" (Translation of the Tribunal) Therefore, the phrase in Clause 10(e) of Contract 402 \"under the terms of the bidding conditions from which this contract arises\" simply means that the bidder who won the railroad usufruct contract would have the opportunity to bid for the equipment in the future as would other interested parties.\n\n141.\n\nIn case Claimant could not obtain the railway equipment of FEGUA, Clause 18 of Contract 402 enabled Claimant to terminate it: \"III In the event that COMPA\u00d1IA DESARROLLADORA FERROVIARIA, SOCIEDAD ANONIMA is unable to exercise the conferred rights it is entitled to with regards to the railway equipment according to the contract and bidding terms referred to in the second clause of this contract, or notwithstanding, having exercised them, it is not able to acquire the railway equipment in accordance with what is established in the tenth clause of this contract and as a consequence it is not able to comply with the purposes of this contract, for reasons not attributable to it, then it may terminate this contract without any responsibility on its part.\" (Claimant's translation) Respondent has argued that, in the situation foreseen in this Clause, Claimant would need to show that it could not acquire the equipment somewhere else. Claimant has disputed that this is the case. As the Tribunal understands it, the consequence of not fulfilling the purpose of the contract is directly related to the inability to acquire FEGUA's equipment, and to no other contingency.\n\n142.\n\nThe concern of Claimant for a way out in the event described was understandable in light of the terms of Clause 16 of Contract 402: \"The Usufructuary's failure to begin railway restoration and failure to render cargo transportation services under the terms of sections two, three, four, five, and six of the THIRTEENTH CLAUSE of this contract: In the event that the USUFRUCTUARY fails to restore the railway and fails to render cargo transportation services under the terms of sections two, three, four, five, and six of the THIRTEENTH CLAUSE hereof, the Usufructuary shall surrender to FEGUA the real property where the railway yet to be restored is located, and any such property shall no longer be subject to this usufruct.\" To comply with its obligations under Contract 402 Claimant needed the equipment of FEGUA, given the narrow gauge of the railroad track and the difficulty of obtaining this narrow gauge equipment elsewhere. Notwithstanding the vicissitudes related to the use of FEGUA's railway equipment, FVG has never exercised the option of surrender.\n\n143.\n\nContrary to Respondent's argument, the facts show that Respondent itself considered the equipment of FEGUA an important element in the negotiation of the alleged illegalities surrounding Contract 143/158. Respondent on numerous occasions in its pleadings has manifested how it has negotiated with Claimant and has made every effort to solve any illegalities. However, this effort came with strings attached which went beyond any such illegalities. In this respect, the Tribunal finds it useful to recall its considerations on the *ratione temporis* objection in the Second Decision on Jurisdiction:\n\n\"133. The *lesivo* process proceeded in parallel to negotiations of FEGUA with FVG regarding issues in dispute in the local proceedings; to the extent that Claimant was aware of such process, which is disputed by Claimant, it was used to negotiate other pending issues. Suffice here to mention that, in the settlement proposal communicated to FVG by FEGUA in the meeting of August 24, 2006, of seven items, only the seventh is related to the Equipment Usufruct Contracts. More importantly, the *Lesivo* Resolution in the \"Exposici\u00f3n de Motivos\" does not list items such as the conservation of the historic and cultural patrimony of railway equipment, nor does it list the other six items part of the settlement proposed by Respondent on August 24, 2006.\n\n134. Expressed differently, the grounds for the *Lesivo* Resolution (\"Exposici\u00f3n de Motivos\") even if they had been cured by FVG, would not have satisfied the conditions of the settlement proposed on August 24, 2006. While this confirms, as argued by Claimant, the use of the *lesividad* process as an element of pressure to achieve other results which seem unrelated to the *lesividad* declaration, this does not make the dispute in connection with the *Lesivo* Resolution and the subsequent conduct of Respondent an integral part of other disputes which may have existed or may still exist in the local arbitration proceedings [...].\"\n\n144.\n\nRespondent has asked rhetorically why would it choose the *lesivo* process if it had other means more certain and straight forward to terminate the rights of Claimant. Only Respondent can answer that question. The fact is that it chose to link the alleged illegalities or irregularities which motivated the *Lesivo* Resolution to other matters in dispute related to Contracts 402 and 820. The *Lesivo* Declaration itself focused on Contract 143/158 and without the equipment provided under this contract the train service could not be carried on.\n\n145.\n\nEach party blames the other for statements made in the press following the publication of the *Lesivo* Declaration, which allegedly added to the impact of the Declaration on FVG. Respondent has focused in particular on the paid press release of FVG published on September 4, 2005. It was addressed to FVG's customers, suppliers, collaborators and the public and reads in part as follows: \"This is now more than an investment for us; it is a struggle for justice. Although we have lost faith in the Guatemalan legal and political systems, we remain convinced that the railway plays an important role in a country that abandoned its railway in 1996 and currently does not depend on either unrealistic schemes or government subsidies. For this reason, we will not only continue to advocate for implementation of our business plan as we originally conceived it, but also to fight for the right to do so against a government that has gone out of its way to obstruct our progress by violating the terms of the railroad infrastructure trust and begin something that will ultimately result in the expropriation of our usufruct. This is a commitment we have to our 62 shareholders, our customers and our employees.\" (Ex R-105) The statement expressed disappointment but also a willingness to move ahead notwithstanding the difficulties. The news had already been in the press for a few days when FVG's press release was published. Thus *El Peri\u00f3dico* published an article on August 30, 2006, with the title \"Ferrov\u00edas de Guatemala is left without trains\" where both Mr. Gramajo and Mr. Senn are quoted, but they spoke in more measured terms than what the title gives to understand and none said what the FVG was left without trains.(Ex. R-104) In fact, the statements by the President and other officers of the Government as reported in the press could be construed to be as damaging as any that Claimant may have issued.\n\n146.\n\nTo put this matter in perspective, the Tribunal observes, first, that the existence of a dispute between the Government and FVG was known before the issuance of the *Lesivo* Declaration; for instance, the article in the *Siglo XXI* edition of September 8, 2006 (Ex. C-136) speaks of a worsening dispute. Second, the *lesivo* process is not a routine procedure and its extraordinary character would have been of interest to the press; it would have been news *per se*. Third, the statements of President Berger are clear and consistent in linking *lesividad* to the overall investment of Claimant. Thus on September 5, 2006, the *Diario de Centro Am\u00e9rica* reported that the previous day the President had explained that \"the declaration of *lesividad* arises from the fact that the US$50 million investment under said contract did not occur. However, he added, Ferrov\u00edas [FVG] has a 90-day term to enter into dialogue with the corresponding authorities.\" (Ex. C-131) Similarly in a speech transmitted by *El Independiente*, Third Broadcast of September 8, 2006 President Berger said: \"[...] I am worried about the size of the company; my concern is that it does not have the financial resources. We do not mean to harm anybody; if it [the company] came today to tell us that it will invest the US$50 million and make the wide gauge work from Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n to Santa Luc\u00eda Cotzumalguapa, which for strategic purposes would move what we sell to Mexico, what comes from Mexico, and what goes to our ports, we would sit at the table. I am surprised because that was the 90-day arrangement and (unintelligible 01:18), they can invest, and we fully supported them. [...]\" (Ex. C-132) The 90-day term - at least in the statement quoted first - is clearly related to the 90-day period that the Government has to file the *lesivo* claim with the Administrative Tribunal from the day of publication of the *Lesivo* Declaration.\n\n147.\n\nRespondent has played down the effects of the Declaration because Claimant to this day retains the equipment concerned and its rights under Contract 402. But the President's declaration that a contract which is an integral part of an investment is harmful to the interests of the State is a powerful tool that creates at least uncertainty in the minds of users, existing or potential. The negative connotation of being associated with a company whose contract with the Government is considered *lesivo* by agreement of all members of that Government cannot be discounted. Furthermore, the uncertainty created by the *Lesivo* Declaration may last for a considerable period of time. Even if the claim of *lesivo* would eventually be dismissed, it would be, from a business point of view, difficult, if not impossible, to return to the situation *ex ante*.\n\n148.\n\nClaimant has placed particular emphasis on the similarities of the *Shufeldt* case ***6*** with the dispute before the Tribunal. In *Shufeldt* a concession contract was terminated by legislative decree signed by the President of Guatemala because it was harmful to the interests of the State. According to Claimant, the grounds for the measure taken by Guatemala to terminate the concession after six years of having benefited from it, bear remarkable similarity to those adduced by Respondent in the case of Contract 143/158 - *inter alia*, lack of authority of the Minister of Agriculture to enter into the concession contract, lack of approval by the National Assembly, no public bidding, etc.- Respondent has pointed out that the legislative decree once signed and published brought the concession contract to an end and Mr. Shufeldt was deprived of all his contract rights, which is not the effect of the *Lesivo* Declaration in respect of Contract 143/158. Respondent has further explained that Guatemala's main arguments in the *Shufeldt* case \"related to the nullity *ab initio* of the contract due to lack of legislative approval and lack of Government authority to enter into a contract which violated its tax laws. In the present case, however, while similar arguments may have been a principal defense involved at the jurisdictional phase, they have been accorded no such status in terms of Guatemala's expropriation defense. Guatemala has consistently argued that the lack of *effect* (let alone substantial effect) upon Claimant's investment is the determinative defense to Claimant's expropriation claim.\" (Rejoinder, para. 128) Leaving aside that this is a misstatement of Respondent's overall position7, the Tribunal agrees that the *Lesivo* Declaration is different in character from the legislative measure taken by Respondent in the case of *Shufeldt*. The question for the Tribunal is whether notwithstanding the differences, the measure here had equivalent effects on the investment.\n\n*Percy Shufeldt (US) v. Guatemala*, 2 U.N.R.I.A.A. 1079, Decision of July 24, 1930.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial Respondent argued that Claimant could not prove that had any usufruct rights under Guatemalan law: \"With respect to Contract 143/158, Claimant's expropriation claim is unsustainable, as this contract is not valid, never came into force and therefore affords Claimant no protection under Guatemalan law. Guatemala could not expropriate alleged rights that Claimant never had.\" (para. 234)\n\n149.\n\nRespondent was fully aware of the powerful effect of a *lesivo* declaration when it chose to use its publication to renegotiate all issues in respect of the three contracts, as evidenced by the settlement offer of August 24, 2006 and the negotiations that ensued before the Attorney General filed the *lesivo* claim with the Administrative Tribunal. Respondent's argument that Claimant would have been glad to seize on this opportunity to close a loss-making business, does not jibe with the fact that FVG continued to provide the service for more than a year after the *Lesivo* Declaration was published until, October 1, 2007. It would not have been in its interest to make matters worse. Furthermore, if, as Respondent argues, the economic interest of Claimant relies on the right-of-way and real estate associated with the railroad, Claimant would have an interest in preserving the service even at a loss, lest it be deprived of the real estate rights for not rendering its service.\n\n150.\n\nThe effect of the *Lesivo* Declaration is evident in the drop in the volume of freight carried by the railroad post- *lesivo* as compared with the previous year, in the fact that suppliers refused FVG credit, in the reluctance of customers to enter into long-term arrangements with FVG, and in the increase in squatters, industrial or otherwise. The perception created by the Declaration is evident in the decision of the municipality of San Antonio La Paz to install a water pipeline in the right-of-way without requesting authorization from FVG because due to *lesivo* FVG could not grant it (Ex. C-50) and in the paving of the right-of-way by the Municipality of Puerto Barrios, the port to be served by the restored section of the railroad.\n\n151.\n\nThe question here is whether in the circumstances there was an expropriation of the railway enterprise. The authorities on expropriation are numerous and largely depend on their own facts. A common theme is that an effect of the measures is that the claimant is deprived substantially of the use and benefits of the investment. Thus the statements to this effect in cases such as, *inter alia*, *Metalclad Corporation v United Mexican States*,8*Pope and Talbot, Inc v Canada*,9*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed SA v United Mexican States*,10*CMS Gas Transmission v* *Argentina*,11*Telenor Mobile Communications SA v Republic of Hungary*12 and *Fireman's Fund Insurance Company v United Mexican States*.13\n\nICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award of August 30, 2000, para. 103: \u2018Thus, expropriation... includes... interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, *in whole or in* *significant part*, or the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State' (emphasis added).\n\nNAFTA (UNCITRAL), Partial Award of June 26, 2000, para. 102\n\nICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/2, Award of May 20, 2003.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award of May 12, 2005, para. 262: \u2018The essential question is therefore to establish whether the enjoyment of the property has been effectively neutralized. The standard that a number of tribunals have applied in recent cases... is that of substantial deprivation'.\n\nICSID Case No ARB/04/15, Award of September 13, 2006, para. 65: \u2018...the interference with the investor's rights must be such as *substantially to deprive* the investor of the economic value, use or enjoyment of its investment' (emphasis added).\n\nICSID Case No ARB(AF)/02/1, Award of July 14, 2006, para. 176(c): \u2018The taking must be a substantially complete deprivation of the economic use and enjoyment of the rights to the property, or of identifiable distinct parts thereof'.\n\n152.\n\nAs to the circumstances here, the Tribunal would note: (a) that more than five years after the publication of the *Lesivo* Declaration, Contract 143/158 and Contract 402 remain in effect; (b) Claimant continues to be in possession of the railway equipment; (c) Claimant continues to receive rents associated with its real estate rights under Contract 402; and (d) such rents amount to 92% of revenues of FVG. For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the effect on Claimants' investment does not rise to the level of an indirect expropriation.\n\n**VI. NATIONAL TREATMENT**\n--------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to the allegation that Respondent breached Article 10.3 of CAFTA. The Tribunal has already concluded that Claimant has not shown that the purpose of the *Lesivo* Resolution was to favor Mr. Campollo. It is on this premise that Claimant has in great measure based its allegation under Article 10.3. As noted by the Tribunal, more than five years after the *Lesivo* Resolution, Claimant continues to have its contractual rights to the right-of-way and to remain in possession of the railway equipment. This by itself is sufficient basis for rejecting Claimants' allegation that Respondent treated Claimant differently from Mr. Campollo. Furthermore, the Tribunal considers that Respondent has failed to show that Claimant and Mr. Campollo are foreign and domestic investors in \"like circumstances.\" According to Claimant, both are competitors in the same economic sector since they have been competing to invest and operate the railroad and in leasing and developing the railroad's assets. Claimant supports this statement by citing the fact that Mr. Campollo has certain interests in the sugar industry in the Dominican Republic, and operates a railroad there purely for the transportation of the produce of his estate. In the Tribunal's view, the obvious difference in scale between the railroad for the exclusive exploitation of the sugar plantation of Mr. Campollo in the Dominican Republic and the railway operation of Claimant in Guatemala defeats the \"like circumstances\" argument.\n\n154.\n\nClaimant contends that, in any case, \"even absent the complicity between the Government and Mr. Campollo, Guatemala discriminated against RDC when it sought to coerce RDC into surrendering unrestored rail segments in favor of \u2018other [interested] investors' in exchange for the Government abandoning the *Lesivo* Resolution.\" (Memorial, para. 165) The Tribunal will address the substance of this contention under the minimum standard of treatment. As to the expression \"other investors\", without further substantiation (which Claimant has failed to provide), it is too vague to state a separate basis of claim. The Tribunal is in no position to determine who these investors are and whether they are in \"like circumstances\", nor has the Tribunal been presented with evidence of the identity of these investors.\n\n155.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal finds that the allegation of breach by Respondent of its obligations under Article 10.3 of CAFTA is without merit.\n\n**VII. MINIMUM STANDARD OF TREATMENT**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Parties' Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n156.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent did not treat it fairly and equitably, contrary to Article 10.5 of CAFTA. Claimant refers to this standard of treatment as understood by arbitral tribunals in *Waste Management II* and *Tecmed*.14 According to Claimant, this standard requires the State to respect the reasonable expectations that were taken into account and reasonably relied upon by the foreign investor; in that regard the conduct of the State must be transparent, consistent, non-discriminatory and not based on unjustifiable or arbitrary distinctions. According to Claimant, this is an objective standard unrelated to whether the State has had any deliberate or malicious intention or manifested bad faith.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award of April 30, 2004, (*Waste Management II*); *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales S.A. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award of May 29, 2003.\n\n157.\n\nClaimant relates the breach of this standard to the *Lesivo* Resolution. Claimant contends that the *lesivo* procedure does not define what makes a contract detrimental to the interests of the State and, therefore, the Government can declare such contract *lesivo* for reasons unsupported by the facts and within the control of the Government regardless of whether a contract is in truth harmful to the State's interests. According to Claimant, the *lesivo* procedure does not afford due process since it does not allow the investor an opportunity to contest or respond to the Government's allegations before the declaration is issued. Claimant argues that as applied in this case the *lesivo* procedure was \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, [was] discriminatory [and] involve[d] a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\"15. Claimant proceeds to list the actions which allegedly breached Respondent obligations under the fair and equitable treatment standard:\n\n\"(i) Basing the *Lesivo* Resolution on grounds that are directly contrary to the facts and prior actions, representations and agreements of the Government;\n\n(ii) Basing the *Lesivo* Resolution on grounds that were entirely the fault of the Government and easily within the Government's control to address and correct (if even necessary) through less extreme measures;\n\n(iii) Issuing the *Lesivo* Resolution just prior to the expiration of the three-year limitations period after FVG refused the Government's demands that it agree, for no consideration (other than the Government abandoning the *Lesivo* Resolution), to modify the economic terms of the Usufruct Contracts to the Government's benefit and surrender substantial rights under the Contracts;\n\n(iv) Declaring Deeds 143/158 detrimental or injurious to the interests of the State when no demonstrable injury to the State existed;\n\n(vi) Failing to act in good faith towards RDC and its investment by implementing a measure with intent to discriminate and knowledge of the unlawfulness of such implementation.\" (Memorial, para. 149)\n\n*Waste Management II*, *op. cit.,* para. 98.\n\n158.\n\nClaimant also contends, citing *Tecmed* and *Metalclad*, that the fair and equitable treatment standard includes the concept of transparency. Claimant alleges that Guatemala failed to ensure a transparent and predictable framework for FVG's business and with the *Lesivo* Declaration undermined RDC's reasonable and legitimate investment-backed expectations such as:\n\n\"(i)RDC's expectation that FVG would have the exclusive right to use the rolling stock during the entire 50-year term of the Usufruct;\n\n(ii) RDC's expectation and understanding that Deed 143 was awarded, executed and approved in accordance with Guatemalan law;\n\n(iii) RDC's expectation and understating that the economic terms of Deeds 143/158 were acceptable to the Government;\n\n(iv) RDC's expectation and understanding that Deeds 143/158 adequately protected the Government's purported \"historical and cultural patrimony\" interests in the rolling stock;\n\n(v) RDC's expectation that the Government would, pursuant to its obligation under Deed 402, not \"hinder the rail and non-rail activities of [FVG],\" and \"protect[] the exercise of [FVG's] rights against third parties that may intend to have or want to exercise a right on the real estate granted as onerous usufruct\";\n\n(vi) RDC's expectation and understanding that any disputes between it or FVG and the Government would be addressed and resolved through negotiation or binding arbitration rather than unilateral Government action; and\n\n(vii) RDC's expectation and understanding that Guatemala would not take any precipitous or arbitrary actions against it that would serve to harm RDC's investment or FVG's business, especially where there is no allegation or contention that FVG has breached any obligation under the Usufruct Contracts and there is no evidence that Deeds 143/158 were injurious to the interests of the State.\" (Memorial, para. 154)\n\n159.\n\nRespondent stresses that under CAFTA the obligation of fair and equitable treatment requires only the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law and does not create additional substantive rights. Respondent asserts that Claimant carries the burden of proof that the standards of conduct it invokes as part of its fair and equitable treatment claim are indeed part of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. Furthermore, according to Respondent, Claimant may not rely on the definition of fair and equitable treatment provided by international tribunals that were not similarly bound by the minimum standard of treatment of customary international law.\n\n160.\n\nRespondent refers with approval to the statement in the *Glamis Gold Award*16 that arbitral awards do not constitute State practice and thus cannot create or prove customary international law, and argues that, in order for Claimant to meet its burden, Claimant may only rely on treaties that require or jurisprudence that interprets the \"customary international law\" standard of treatment.\n\n*Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. The United States of America,* UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Award of June 8, 2009, para. 605.\n\n161.\n\nRespondent argues that \"Claimant has *failed* to demonstrate that the three alleged standards of treatment -non-arbitrariness, transparency and adherence to an investor's legitimate expectations- are elements of the minimum standard of treatment.\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 354. Emphasis in the original) According to Respondent, even if Claimant had succeeded in doing so, it still failed to demonstrate that Guatemala breached this standard. Respondent recalls that customary international law places a heavy burden upon a claimant to demonstrate that a State has breached an applicable standard of conduct and refers to the large amount of deference accorded by arbitral tribunals to respondent States in determining whether their action violates the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n162.\n\nRespondent refers with approval to how the minimum standard of treatment was described by the arbitral tribunals in *Waste Management II*,17*GAMI*,18*Thunderbird*19 and *Genin*20 and asserts that Claimant has completely failed to demonstrate that Guatemala's conduct fell short of the minimum standard of treatment required by customary international law.\n\n*Waste Management II*, *op.cit.,* para. 98.\n\n*Gami Investments, Inc. v. Mexico*, UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Final Award of November 15, 2004, para. 97.\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. Mexico*, UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Award of January 26, 2006, para. 194.\n\n*Genin and others v. Estonia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Award of June 25, 2001, para. 367.\n\n163.\n\nRespondent affirms that Guatemala acted at all times in good faith in respect of Claimant's investment. It refers to the description in *Waste Management II* of the two elements of acting in good faith (which Respondent accepts is one of the obligations comprised in the minimum standard of treatment). The first element, whether the State acted \"improperly or \"without justification\", is a requirement that the State act rationally in accordance with its own laws. The second element requires that the State acted \u2018deliberately\" or \"consciously\" in order to destroy the relevant investment.21\n\n*Waste Management II*, *op cit*, para. 138.\n\n164.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"[...] Guatemala has acted rationally, in accordance with its own laws, and without malicious or improper intent.... Guatemala applied the *lesividad* procedure consistently with the letter and spirit of its laws, acting in good faith. At no point in time did the Government act with \"intent to discriminate and knowledge of the unlawfulness\" of its conduct. In fact, there was no unlawfulness, much less a known unlawfulness; Guatemala sought, and ensured, the faithful and good faith application of its extant laws concerning *lesividad*.\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 371)\n\n165.\n\nRespondent explains that: \"Once the illegalities of Contract 143/158 were raised, each of the Government\u2019s agents acted pursuant to Guatemalan law and all concluded that the contract must be declared *lesivo',* and that is what the President did. The *Acuerdo Gubernativo* which instructed the Attorney General to initiate proceedings before the *Contencioso Administrativo* court was signed by all of the required Ministers and the President, and was published in the Official Gazette within the three-year statute of limitations period. The Attorney General filed the case within the 90-day period required under Article 23 of the *Ley De Lo Contencioso Administrativo.* The *Contencioso Administrativo* courts have also acted consistently with their mandate, offering Claimant an opportunity to be heard, and even rejected the provisional measures requested by the Attorney General to suspend the validity of Contract 143/158 pending the final decision regarding its *lesividad.\"* (Counter-Memorial, para. 373. Footnotes omitted)\n\n166.\n\nRespondent insists that: \"Guatemala's sole intent and motivation was to apply its laws, and obtain a functioning railroad system. Rather than turn the railroad over to Ram\u00f3n Campollo upon publishing the *Lesivo* Declaration, as Claimant's conspiracy theory suggests, Guatemala continued to meet with Claimant after the *Lesivo* Declaration was published, to negotiate a contract that would enable the railroad to operate. Negotiations ended when FVG stated that it had no interest in entering into new equipment contracts. Despite Guatemala's efforts to negotiate, Claimant ceased railway operations in 2007, and left Guatemala without an operational railroad.' (Counter-Memorial, para. 374. Footnote omitted)\n\n167.\n\nRespondent rejects the claim that it denied Claimant justice or due process of law. First, Respondent argues that the *lesividad* process \"affords due process to the private party and ensures that the Executive follows a process of submitting its determinations to the courts in order to revoke its administrative acts that it believes are injurious to the public good, rather than simply allowing the Government to unilaterally revoke those acts [...], and affords private parties not only an opportunity to be heard, but an opportunity to overturn the initial declaration of *lesividad*, recourse for declarations that were improperly issued, and, if a contract *is* declared null and void after the administrative phase, the ability to file an indemnity claim for work that had previously been completed.\"(Counter-Memorial, para. 381.)\n\n168.\n\nAccording to Respondent, in determining whether a particular procedure affords due process tribunals do not second guess State actions. Tribunals have held that no violation of due process occurs when the State applies a pre-existing law that is fair on its face, and \"tribunals have explained that initial decisions that have the potential to be overturned upon further review do not generally violate the fair and equitable treatment standard under customary international law.\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 387) Respondent contends that Claimant's assertion that the *lesividad* procedure does not accord due process is contrary to each of these three rules and affirms that Guatemala has been transparent and strictly observed established procedure to declare Contract 143/158 *lesivo* : \"[...] the process started upon request by FEGUA's overseer, followed by legal opinions from all concerned Ministries and FEGUA, as well as the President's Secretary General, and culminated with the decision by the President to declare the equipment contracts *lesivo*. Although not required to do so by law, the Government even informed Claimant of the process and halted it in order to accommodate negotiations in the hopes of reaching a compromise. Since a negotiated solution was impossible, the *Lesivo* Resolution was published in accordance with the law within the established time period to do so. Following publication, the Attorney General filed its complaint before the *Contencioso Administrativo* Court, where the process remains pending [...]\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 197).\n\n169.\n\nRespondent affirms that mere arbitrariness does not constitute a breach of the fair and equal treatment standard under CAFTA, and that the *Lesivo* Declaration was not arbitrary by any objective standard: \"In light of the five legal opinions from independent agencies and outside counsel, each of which concluded that Contract 143/158 must be declared *lesivo*. In view of Claimant's indifference toward negotiation, and the pending statute of limitations deadline, the President's decision to declare Contract 143/158 *lesivo* was not only reasonable, but required. Under these circumstances, Guatemalan law affords the President no discretion; he must initiate the *lesividad* process via *Acuerdo Gubernativo* [...]\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 408)\n\n170.\n\nRespondent denies that it discriminated against Claimant. According to Respondent, the existence of a discriminatory measure requires a fact-based inquiry and a comparison of the complainant to a similarly-situated person. Claimant has not explained how the *lesividad* process is discriminatory and has not provided \"the Tribunal with a proper basis of comparison, describe a distinction between itself and domestic investors, and demonstrate that the State action was unreasonable.\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 405) In any case, Respondent argues that there was no discriminatory effect because a tribunal would make the final decision.\n\n171.\n\nRespondent re-affirms that Claimant has not satisfied its burden of demonstrating that to act transparently is an element of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment and its belief that it acted transparently: \"Claimant was aware of each aspect of the *lesividad* process. First, [...] Claimant was aware of the illegalities in Contract 143/158, and participated in negotiations with Guatemalan officials to cure these deficiencies. Second, Claimant was aware that Guatemala was considering initiating the *lesividad* process. As counsel for Claimant stipulated for the record at the Hearing on Jurisdiction, there was a document regarding the *lesividad* of Claimant's concession contracts that was being circulated among Government Ministers for signature in May 2006 [...]\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 420. Footnotes omitted) Furthermore, \"Claimant has also been given notice and has been afforded a full opportunity to be heard in its own defense in further proceedings before the *Contencioso Administrativo* court. True to Guatemalan law, the *Contencioso Administrativo* courts have reinforced the principle that a *lesivo* declaration itself has no effect upon the validity of a contract. On two separate occasions, the *Contencioso Administrativo* courts declined to temporarily suspend Contract 143/158 while the final decision regarding the validity of that contract was pending. What is more, Guatemalan courts have ruled that the *Lesivo* Declaration had no effect upon Claimant's investment or rights under Contract 402, and police and other authorities continue to recognize the validity of Claimant's entire investment [...].\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 422. Footnotes omitted)\n\n172.\n\nRespondent also argues that Claimant has not demonstrated that the doctrine of \"legitimate expectations\" is part of the minimum standard of treatment. According to Respondent, the cases on which Claimant relies - *Sempra, Tecmed and* *Waste Management II* --address \"the more narrow contours of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, to determine if that minimum standard itself requires that a State act according to an investor's legitimate expectations.\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 211) Respondent refers to the warning in the *MTD Decision on Annulment*22 that \" *The obligations of the host State towards foreign investors derive from the terms of the applicable investment treaty and not from any set of expectations investors may have or claim to have.* A tribunal which sought to generate from such expectations a set of rights different from those contained in or enforceable under the BIT might well exceed its powers, and if the difference were material might do so manifestly [...]\" (Counter-Memorial, para. 427) Respondent also relies on the fact that the *Glamis Gold*23 tribunal accorded no weight to the claimant's argument based on legitimate expectations and concluded that not living up to expectations cannot be sufficient to find a breach of NAFTA.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. & MTD Chile S.A. v. Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Decision on Annulment of March 21, 2007, paras. 67-69.\n\n*Glamis Gold, op cit,* para. 620.\n\n173.\n\nIn any case, according to Respondent, Claimant's expectations were not legitimate and Claimant was aware, given its previous experience in Guatemala, that Contract 143/158 was plagued by formation defects: \"Because Contract 143/158 did not comply with the formation requirements of which Claimant was well-aware -having previously been awarded two contracts as a result of a public bid, and having admitted that Contract 41 never entered into force because it never received the requisite approval- Claimant could not have generated any legitimate expectations based on the terms of Contract 143/158. Hence, these expectations are unreasonable.\" (CounterMemorial, para. 435) Claimant could not expect that Guatemala would not enforce its laws.\n\n174.\n\nRespondent adds that, even if Claimant's expectations were considered reasonable, Respondent has not frustrated them since Claimant remains in full possession of the railway equipment, has initiated more than 50 legal proceedings relating to the theft of rails and more than 50 legal proceedings to dislodge squatters along the right of way granted under Contract 402. Furthermore, Respondent argues that Claimant could not expect that, because there are arbitration clauses in the contracts, Respondent would refrain from upholding its own laws, and denies that it took any precipitous or arbitrary action on the part of Guatemala.\n\n175.\n\nRespondent addresses the argument that the process of *lesividad* is as such contrary to the minimum standard: acceptance of this argument would undermine the requirement that fair and equitable treatment be determined by a case-specific, fact-based inquiry, and would violate notions of comity and sovereignty. Respondent refers to its previous arguments that the *lesivo* process is not inherently unfair, unreasonable or inequitable exercise of State power but \"a judicially recognized constitutional and reasonable measure designed to uphold the rule of law.\" (CounterMemorial, para. 449)\n\n176.\n\nFinally, Respondent asserts that the factual allegations made by Claimant (Memorial, para. 149) are either false or do not constitute a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. It was not true that the *Lesivo* Declaration was taken on grounds directly contrary to the Government's representations or that the *Lesivo* Declaration was predicated upon a situation that was entirely the fault of the Government. It was not contrary to the minimum standard of treatment to issue the *Lesivo* Declaration on the last day that it could be issued or to request that Claimant comply with its obligations under Contract 402. To presuppose that Contract 143/158 was not actually injurious to the State mischaracterizes the effect of the *Lesivo* Declaration. That Declaration merely demonstrates that the President and his Cabinet had enough evidence to submit the question whether the contract was *lesivo* to the Administrative Tribunal.\n\n177.\n\nIn its Reply Claimant observes that the terms of CAFTA and NAFTA are essentially the same in describing the fair and equitable obligation and considers that arbitral awards in NAFTA cases are particularly relevant to this Tribunal. After a review of NAFTA awards since 2001, Claimant concludes that *Glamis Gold* is an outlier in its formulation of the minimum standard of treatment and notes that all these tribunals held that customary international law may evolve over time. Claimant refers in particular to *Mondev*24 and *Merrill & Ring*25 for the care they took to establish this evolution and notes that there is agreement among NAFTA tribunals that fair and equitable treatment can only be discerned when applied to the facts of each case.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2 (NAFTA), Award, of October 11, 2002, para. 125.\n\n*Merrill & Ring Forestry L.P. v. Canada*, UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Award of March 31, 2010, paras. 202212.\n\n178.\n\nClaimant then considers the period for assessing Respondent's conduct. According to Claimant, it is permissible to refer to conduct of Respondent prior to CAFTA's entry into force in support of its claims; acts or omissions by Respondent may be relevant in determining whether the State has subsequently committed a breach of its obligations. Claimant asserts that Guatemala had an obligation to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of CAFTA from the date it signed this treaty. In a footnote Claimant explains that Article 28 of the Vienna Convention provides \"an appropriate lens for viewing Respondent's conduct in the period between CAFTA's signing and entry into force, consistent with customary international law.\" (Reply, para. 341, footnote 800)\n\n179.\n\nAccording to Claimant, it is well established that fair and equal treatment encompasses the obligation of the State to act in good faith and failure to act in good faith is proof of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under customary international law. Claimant refers to examples of violations of good faith identified in arbitral awards in the investment context which exist in the instant case: \"(i) situations of coercion and harassment directed at the investor; (ii) a deliberate conspiracy to defeat the investment; (iii) use of threats of rescission to bring a concessionaire to the re-negotiation table; and (iv) termination of an investment for reasons other than the one put forth by the government [...]\" (Reply, para. 343)\n\n180.\n\nClaimant points out that the defects in Contract 143/158 were entirely within the Government's control to fix and that it never made an offer to fix them because Respondent was never concerned about these defects except to use them as a threat instrument. According to Claimant, the *lesivo* strategy was first set forth in Mr. Gramajo's Options Paper of April 2005 where it is proposed \"seeking the \u2018nonamicable Termination' of Contract 143 and. using the lack of Executive approval of this contract as a basis for renegotiating the terms of the Contracts 402 and 820 to relieve FEGUA of its outstanding $2 million debt to the Railway Trust Fund, its obligation to make further contributions to the Trust Fund and its obligation to remove squatters. Notably missing from the Options Paper was the 'good faith option' of simply securing Executive approval for the Contract.\" (Reply, para. 347)\n\n181.\n\nClaimant observes that the Attorney General's opinion of August 1, 2005 stated that Contract 143/158 was *lesivo* but this infirmity could be resolved by means other than *lesividad* such as early termination, annulment or mutual agreement and notes that when on January 13, 2006 Mr. Gramajo requested the President to declare Contract 143/158 *lesivo* he ignored the other options and cited as irregularities provisions copied from Contract 41.\n\n182.\n\nClaimant disputes Respondent's assertion that the High-Level Railroad Commission was a good faith exercise. Claimant argues that the opposite was true because in parallel the Government was preparing the *Lesivo* Declaration. Claimant refers to the fact that President Berger signed the *Lesivo* Declaration on August 11, 2006, but that Respondent waited until the week of August 21 to tell Claimant that if it would not agree to changes in the Usufruct Contracts, a declaration of *lesividad* would be issued. Respondent alleges that the offer it received at the meeting of August 24 would have altered the economic terms of FVG's concession to its detriment; in that offer there was only a minor reference to the equipment contracts in order to rectify the terms deemed to cause lesion to the interests of the State. Claimant maintains that only learned then, for the first time, that the *Lesivo* Declaration was directed to Contract 143/158.\n\n183.\n\nClaimant questions the inevitability of the *lesivo* process and the alleged lack of discretion of the President: the legal opinions of Respondent contemplated other solutions and in fact the grounds for *lesividad* were under the Government's control. Claimant points out that in the various legal opinions of Respondent the only substantial harm to the State's interests is that Respondent was denied the benefit of other potential bidders for the equipment who may have offered a higher price. Claimant finds the proposition ludicrous given that FVG had the exclusive right to the only narrow gauge railway in Guatemala and in 1997 FVG had been the only bidder.\n\n184.\n\nIn support of its argument that the Respondent acted in bad faith Claimant refers to President Berger's statement that the *Lesivo* Resolution was issued not because of the defects in Contract 143/158 but because FVG failed to rebuild and reopen the South Coast corridor and that FVG had 90 days to guarantee a USD50 million investment or otherwise he would take away the railway concession and call for a new bidding process. Claimant also refers to the secret minutes of the discussion tables after the *Lesivo* Declaration which show that the Attorney General used the timing of the *lesivo* action in the Administrative Tribunal to \"increase pressure to advance the negotiations'. In this respect, Claimant explains that: \"Negotiations between FVG and the Government ended not because FVG was unwilling to enter into a new usufruct equipment contract -the Government never made such a stand-alone offer -but because FVG was unwilling to accede to the Government's extortionate demands to surrender its fundamental rights under the Usufruct Contracts.\" (Reply, para. 354) Claimant concludes by referring to the holding of the tribunal in *Waste* *Management II*26 that deliberately setting out to destroy or frustrate the investment by improper means is a breach of the minimum standard of treatment.\n\n*Waste Management II, op. cit.*, para.138.\n\n185.\n\nClaimant asserts that Respondent denied Claimant due process of law and rebuts Respondent's defenses in respect of the *lesivo* process. Claimant explains that the question is not whether *lesividad* process is constitutional under Guatemalan law but whether it accords with due process requirements of international law. Claimant contends that there are no defined legal criteria or precedent that the Administrative Tribunal may use to perform a meaningful review of the President's action and the process has been pending for years when it should have been completed within six months. Claimant asserts that the publication of the *Lesivo* Resolution had drastic consequences even if, as claimed by Respondent, it was only the first step in the initiation of a court process. Claimant also contends that it is absurd to affirm that it is reasonable that the Government make an initial decision in a purely internal deliberation when the *Lesivo* Declaration is a public declaration by the President of the Republic and his Cabinet. Claimant adds that during to the entire process leading to the *Lesivo* Resolution the internal and outside legal opinions were kept from Claimant and Claimant was not notified of the alleged technical and legal grounds for the *Lesivo* Resolution until May 15, 2007, six months after Respondent had commenced its action in the Administrative tribunal.\n\n186.\n\nClaimant disputes that it has the opportunity to obtain recourse if the Declaration is held by the Administrative Tribunal to have been issued improperly. According to Claimant, the governing law does not provide for declaratory relief or damages. Moreover the focus would be on whether Government agencies complied with the procedural requirements, because there are no substantive requirements with which to comply or for the Administrative Tribunal to assess.\n\n187.\n\nClaimant disputes Respondent's contention that the obligation to refrain from acting arbitrarily is not an element of the minimum standard of treatment. While Claimant recognizes that CAFTA - as it is also the case for NAFTA - does not contain a separate provision on arbitrary treatment, \"NAFTA tribunals have reviewed a State's conduct for arbitrariness or otherwise acknowledged that arbitrary actions are prohibited by the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment under customary international law minimum standard of treatment [...]\" (Reply, para. 373) The issue is what is the standard to be applied. Claimant refers to *Waste Management II* which speaks of conduct \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic.\"27 Claimant admits that mere arbitrariness may not be sufficient but few NAFTA tribunals have required the manifest arbitrariness that Respondent seeks to require in this proceeding. On the other hand, Claimant states that, even if the standard of manifest arbitrariness is to be applied, to which it said it had no objection, \"it is not difficult to divine such arbitrariness in Respondent's conduct.\" (Reply, para. 374)\n\n*Waste Management II*, *op.cit.*, para. 98.\n\n188.\n\nAccording to Claimant, \"[...] the *Lesivo* Resolution as applied in this case was arbitrary and violated the fair and equitable treatment obligation in CAFTA Article 10.5 because it was not based on any defined legal standards, but on the Executive's personal whim and discretion; it did not serve any legitimate public purpose; and it was taken for reasons other than those put forward by the Government.\" (Reply, para. 381)\n\n189.\n\nOn Respondent's contention that Claimant has not met its burden of proof on whether legitimate expectations are part of fair and equitable treatment, Claimant refers to *Waste Management II* 's statement that in applying the standard of review under customary international law minimum standard of treatment \"it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\"28 Claimant also refers to the *Glamis Gold* tribunal's statement that Article 1105(1) of NAFTA \"requires the evaluation of whether the State made any specific assurance or commitment to the investor so as to induce its expectations.\"29\n\n*Ibid*. para. 99.\n\n*Glamis Gold, op.cit.*, para. 620.\n\n190.\n\nClaimant refers to Respondent's assertion that Claimant should have known the law of the country including the law on *lesivo*, and states that: \"Claimant had every reason to expect that Guatemala would not use the *lesivo* process as a strategy and means to force Claimant to renegotiate and surrender substantial rights under the Usufruct Contracts to benefit the Government and the mutual economic interests of Ram\u00f3n Campollo and President Berger's family.\" Reply, para.394) As to Respondent's assertion that Claimant's legitimate expectations had not been frustrated because Claimant retains possession of the equipment, Claimant reiterates that this is nothing more than form over substance and that \"[b]y itself, the *Lesivo* Resolution rendered Claimant's possession of such equipment *worthless* because it destroyed FVG's railroad business.\" (Reply, para. 396. Emphasis in the original)\n\n191.\n\nAs to transparency, Claimant recalls that CAFTA's preamble includes an explicit objective to \"PROMOTE transparency...in international trade and investment\" and argues that the following actions demonstrate a fundamental lack of transparency: \"(i) the lack of any objective standards for a declaration of *lesividad* in Article 20 of the *Ley De Contencioso Administrativo* ; (ii) Respondent's deliberate withholding of its intention to declare Contracts 143/158 *lesivo* until the day before the deadline to publish the declaration; and (iii) Respondent's deliberate withholding from Claimant of the asserted legal grounds for declaring Contracts 143/158 *lesivo* until months after its action was formally filed in the *Contensioso Administrativo* court [...]\" (Reply, para. 397)\n\n192.\n\nIn its Rejoinder Respondent argues that Claimant has failed to prove that the standard of fair and equitable treatment imposes: \"(a) a duty to refrain from acting in bad faith; (b) an obligation to afford due process; (c) a duty to refrain from engaging in arbitrary or discriminatory conduct; (d) an obligation to refrain from frustrating an investor's legitimate expectations; and (e) a duty to provide transparency and stability to foreign investments.\" (para. 132). According to Respondent, Claimant has tried to satisfy its burden of proof by citing previous awards and by relying on the 2000 plus BITs in existence; but, this is not sufficient evidence. Relying on *Glamis Gold*, Respondent reiterates previous affirmations that they do not constitute state practice and cannot create or prove customary international law.30 As to the BITs, it is Respondent's opinion that, even if such treaties could demonstrate *opinio iuris*, they do not define the standard and do not establish State agreement with respect to the individual types of conduct invoked in this case.\n\n*Glamis Gold*, *op.cit.*, para. 605.\n\n193.\n\nRespondent also contends that Claimant has failed to establish that Guatemala's conduct fell short of the minimum standard of treatment. First, there is no evidence to support Claimant's conspiracy theories underlying the intention behind the issuance of the *Lesivo* Declaration. Second, Respondent disputes that the Options Paper demonstrates a bad faith strategy on the part of the Government; this paper does not reflect the use of *lesividad* as a pressure mechanism to take away Claimant's rights under Contracts 402 and 820 or to force a renegotiation of those agreements. Third, Respondent insists that FEGUA negotiated with FVG \"in good faith and with the intent to address the illegalities contained in Contract 143/158 and the hope that the parties could simultaneously address issues related to other aspects of the relationship.\" (Rejoinder, para. 165) Respondent adds that: \"Pursuant to Guatemalan law, Guatemala could not have solved the problems related to Contract 143/158 by itself. It needed FVG's -and therefore the Claimant's- cooperation, which it never obtained.\" (ibid.)\n\n194.\n\nRespondent refers to the letter of Mr. Senn to Vice-Minister D\u00edaz and stresses its importance for the following reasons: \"First, it demonstrates that, as of November 2004, Claimant was aware that Contract 143/158 had legal defects. Second, it expressly confirms that Claimant was aware that the Government did not recognize the validity of Contract 143/158 due to these illegalities. Third, it serves as contemporaneous evidence of Claimant's awareness that some sort of remedy was in order, and shows that, rather than refuse to negotiate because the defects in Contract 143/158 \"were entirely within the Government's control to resolve and that they could easily be resolved without any \u2018negotiation' with Claimant,\" FVG chose to negotiate with FEGUA in an attempt to resolve the Contract 143/158 problem by \"presenting an amendment to the contract, or a new contract, before the end of the year.\" Fourth, and finally, it offers contemporaneous insight into FVG's impression of its negotiations with FEGUA. While Claimant's witnesses now purport to recall that the Government's \"explicit\" agenda was to \"coerce Claimant into either substantially giving up its property rights or forcing it to abandon its investment without any compensation,\" Claimant's 17 November 2004 letter gave no such indication. Nor did it discuss a fear that Guatemala would terminate FVG's rights in order to favor Ram\u00f3n Campollo\" (Rejoinder, para. 171. Footnotes omitted).\n\n195.\n\nRespondent insists that it was prepared to make reciprocal concessions when it proposed a draft settlement in August 2006: \"This would necessarily include a path to conduct a new public bid and to provide that any new railway contract would be approved by the President, as required by Guatemalan law. These were some of the principal defects that had been identified by the Attorney General and other agencies, and necessarily ones that would need to be corrected; the Government acknowledged in the drafts presented to FVG that the legal defects with the railway equipment contract would need to be remedied as part of any negotiated solution. FVG, however, refused to negotiate, sending to the meeting only Mr. Senn, who indicated that he did not have a power of attorney or authority to reach an agreement on behalf of FVG. The Government therefore published the *Lesivo* Declaration on the last possible day before the statute of limitations would expire.\" (Rejoinder, para. 173. Footnotes omitted)\n\n196.\n\nRespondent addresses the issue of publishing the *Lesivo* Declaration on the last day before the three-year statutory term expired and explains that, contrary to what Claimant argues, it shows its good faith in making a last-minute attempt to solve the pending issues after a lengthy negotiation process. Respondent also affirms that \" *there is no proof whatsoever that the Government would have been unwilling to stop the Lesivo Declaration if Claimant had agreed to negotiate a path forward to resolve the legal defects in Contract 143/158 prior to the publication of that resolution, even if the parties could not reach agreement on the others issues set forth in the settlement draft.* However, there is ample proof that the Government would have been willing to do so, as demonstrated by its willingness in 2004 and 2005 to attempt to negotiate a resolution of these defects as well as by the language included in the draft agreement presented to FVG on 24 August 24 2006 wherein the Government made clear that it wanted FVG to agree to a path that would remedy these defects, and by the Government's continued efforts to negotiate a path forward to cure the defects in the equipment contract even after the *Lesivo* Declaration was issued.\" (Rejoinder, para. 176. Emphasis in the original; footnotes omitted)\n\n197.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant cannot convert a standard bargaining situation into bad faith and a treaty violation and insists that Guatemala negotiated in good faith to resolve all issues that were of concern to the parties including the legal defects of Contract 143/158 but did not use the defects to threaten Claimant and force its hand. In Respondent\u2019s opinion, *\"Lesividad* also was the *least intrusive* solution to the problem for Claimant, in that requesting a final determination from the *Contencioso Administrativo* Court would fulfill the Government\u2019s obligation to seek a remedy for the illegalities of Contract 143/158, and provide adequate safeguard for Claimant\u2019s investment, while at the same time permitting Claimant to retain possession of the equipment pending the Court\u2019s decision. If the *Contencioso Administrativo* Court decided that Contract 143/158 was not, in fact, *lesivo* to the interests of the State, the contract would be validated despite its illegalities.\" (Rejoinder, para. 181. Footnote omitted, emphasis in the original) Respondent refers to the holding of the Tribunal in its Second Decision on Jurisdiction that \"principles of fairness should prevent the government from raising violations of its own law as a defense when [in this case, operating in the guise of FEGUA, it] knowingly overlooked them and [effectively] endorsed an investment which was not in compliance with its law.\" (Rejoinder, para. 185) Respondent argues that the Tribunal cannot adopt in the merits context as a finding that initiating the *lesividad* process was \"unfair\" or \"inequitable.\" According to Respondent: \"A finding that Guatemala would be precluded by CAFTA to question the validity of a contract within the processes available under domestic law, simply because it had performed under that contract for a period of time, would severely and improperly restrict State sovereignty. Taken to the extreme, a bright-line rule that a State is estopped from exercising pre-existing domestic remedies to question the validity of a contract simply because the State had operated under that contract for a period of time could prevent a State from terminating a contract initiated by bribery or corruption.\" (Ibid)\n\n198.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the facts do not support the preliminary conclusion of the Tribunal in the Second Decision on Jurisdiction to the effect that FEGUA \"knowingly overlooked [the legal defects in Contract 143/158] and [effectively] endorsed an investment which was not in compliance with its law\". Respondent contends that the more developed record shows that Mr. Gramajo informed FVG as soon as it learned of the legal defects and that FEGUA negotiated with FVG while at all times maintaining that Contract 143/158 was invalid. Responded argues that FEGUA did not accept payments under Contract 143/158 and allowed FVG to use the railway equipment pursuant to the prior authorizations issued by the predecessor of Mr. Gramajo as shown by Mr. Gramajo's letter of April 12, 2004 to G. Zachrisson. FEGUA did not endorse Contract 143/158 as proven by the letter of FVG to the ViceMinister of Communications dated November 15, 2004. In Respondent's opinion Claimant should not be entitled to rely on equitable arguments because no one can benefit from his own wrong and \"FVG and Claimant knew what the legal requirements were for the equipment contract and sought to evade them by entering into back-dated lease agreements and later Contract 143/158.\" (Rejoinder, para. 187)\n\n199.\n\nAs to denial of justice or due process, Respondent argues that \"the Court has amply demonstrated both its independence and its willingness to uphold Claimant's rights in this very case. Thus, although the Attorney General sought a provisional suspension from the *Contencioso Administrativo* Court which would temporarily suspend Contract 143/158, the Court rejected the Attorney General's request, and rejected his subsequent petition to reconsider the initial rejection. Similarly, in 2010, the *Contencioso Administrativo* Court overturned an initial declaration of *lesividad*.\" (Rejoinder, para. 190. Footnotes omitted) Respondent adds that the Administrative Tribunal is competent to consider the formal and substantial aspects of a declaration of *lesividad*, and if the focus of the proceedings has been on the procedural requirements of the law, it is because Claimant chose to challenge the *Lesivo* Declaration on procedural rather than substantive grounds. Respondent concludes this is a failure of Claimant's litigation strategy rather than of Guatemala's judicial system.\n\n200.\n\nRespondent recalls that Claimant has had the opportunity to be heard by the Constitutional Court and this Court decided that the *amparo* action filed by Claimant was untimely. According to Respondent, Claimant has failed to prove its case based on the length of the *contencioso administrativo* process as demonstrated by the documents filed in or issued by the Administrative Tribunal in respect of the *lesividad* of Contract 143/158.\n\n201.\n\nRespondent contends that the *Lesivo* Declaration and subsequent actions were not arbitrary or discriminatory, and \"encourages the Tribunal to adopt the standard articulated by the NAFTA tribunal in *International Thunderbird* and by the International Court of Justice in *ELSI*, both of which considered the severity of an arbitrary measure. In *International Thunderbird*, the tribunal discussed a breach in terms of \u2018manifest arbitrariness falling below acceptable international standards.' In *ELSI*, the ICJ stated that arbitrariness under customary international law \u2018is not so much something opposed to *a* rule of law, as something opposed to *the* rule of law...It is a *wilful [sic] disregard of due process of law*, an act which *shocks*, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety [...]'\" (Rejoinder, para. 204. Footnotes omitted, emphasis added by Respondent)\n\n202.\n\nRespondent takes issue with the reasons given by Claimant in support of its submission that the *Lesivo* Declaration was arbitrary. The first reason adduced by Claimant is that the Declaration was not based on defined legal standards, did not serve a public purpose and was taken for reasons other than those put forward by the Government. According to Respondent, the Declaration was based on fact and reason and the absence of a list of pre-ordained circumstances that are harmful to the interests of the State does not equate with the absence of any legal standard on which to objectively assess the matter; the *lesivo* process serves the legitimate public purpose of upholding the law, \"to ensure that the Government is not bound to perform contracts which violate its laws, and to ensure that the Government is not bound *ad eternum* to perform a contract which is, or may become, harmful to the public interest\" (Rejoinder, para. 211); and the record shows that the actions before and after the *Lesivo* Declaration were proper to remedy the legal defects of Contract 143/158.\n\n203.\n\nRespondent insists at every turn that Claimant has failed to show the elements it claims that are covered in the minimum treatment standard and to rely on arbitral awards to prove State practice. Thus, in the context of whether frustrating Claimant's legitimate expectations or failing to provide transparency and stability is in breach of the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment, Guatemala states: \"Though Claimant alleges that Guatemala \u2018apparently missed the point that the tribunal in *Waste Management II* was putting forward a standard of review for fair and equitable treatment under the customary minimum standard, having first conducted a comprehensive review of other NAFTA cases that had applied this standard,' it appears that it is Claimant that has missed Guatemala's point: decisions by international tribunals \u2018do not constitute State practice and thus cannot create or prove customary international law.'\" (Rejoinder, para. 217. Footnotes omitted, underlining added by Respondent)\n\n204.\n\nRespondent argues that the obligation of transparency is limited to the investor having the opportunity to know the rules and regulations that will govern its investment. Respondent first points out the contradiction in Claimant's argument in respect of the *Lesivo* Declaration: it affirms at the same time that it had kept the issuance of the Declaration secret and that it was used as a threat instrument. Then Respondent asserts that the extent of the standards and the standards themselves were readily available to Claimant at the time it invested.\n\n205.\n\nAs to legitimate expectations, Respondent affirms that Claimant has failed to prove that they were legitimate or that Guatemala has frustrated them. Respondent argues that there is no evidence that the *lesivo* process was used to force Claimant to renegotiate and surrender its rights under the Usufruct Contracts to benefit the Government and the mutual economic interests of Ram\u00f3n Campollo and/or President Berger\u2019s family. Respondent refers to the Second Decision on Jurisdiction and explains that \"It is understandable that the Tribunal in its Second Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, based on the limited record then before it, may have jumped to the conclusion that Guatemala may have used the *Lesivo* Declaration as a pressure instrument given the comment made by the then-Attorney General in this 28 September meeting, but the full record simply does not bear out this is what occurred. It is important to note that this was an internal Government meeting that took place at the *end* of the many months of negotiations between the Government and FVG to try and sort out the disputes between them. There was record of only one meeting between parties after this internal meeting, which took place on 4 October 2006, and there is no indication at all that the *Contencioso Administrativo* proceeding was even discussed in that meeting, let alone used as a pressure tool.\" (Rejoinder, para. 237. Footnotes omitted)\n\n206.\n\nRespondent confirms that it has used *lesividad* in conformity with its \"normal function\" from a procedural and substantive point of view and affirms that the question for this Tribunal must be limited to procedure since Claimant has failed to establish that *lesividad* was used as part of a conspiracy to give Claimant's investment to Ram\u00f3n Campollo and the question of whether it was correct to issue the *Lesivo* Declaration is irrelevant and beyond the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Respondent asserts that it met all procedural requirements under the relevant laws.\n\n**2. Non-Disputing Parties' Submissions**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nThree non-disputing State parties -the United States, El Salvador and Honduras- filed submissions on the minimum standard of treatment of aliens. The United States refers to Article 10.5(1) and (2) and explains: \"These provisions demonstrate the CAFTA-DR Parties' express intent to incorporate the minimum standard of treatment required by customary international as the standard for treatment in CAFTA-DR Article 10.5. Furthermore, they express an intent to guide the interpretation of that Article by the Parties' understanding of customary international law, *i.e*., the law that develops from the practice and *opinio iuris* of States themselves, rather than by interpretations of similar but differently worked treaty provisions. The burden is on the claimant to establish the existence and applicability of a relevant obligation under customary international that meets these requirements.\"\n\n208.\n\nAfter considering the provisions of Article 10.5, El Salvador concludes: \"the proper interpretation of the requirement to provide \u2018Fair and Equitable Treatment' as part of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international, as required by CAFTA, can only be derived from the analysis of general and consistent State practice resulting from a sense of legal obligation. International awards are relevant to the determination of the appropriate interpretation under CAFTA, but only if and to the extent they actually examine State practice resulting from a sense of legal obligation. Therefore, international arbitral awards that refer to \u2018Fair and Equitable' as an autonomous standard, as well as investment treaties that use \u2018Fair and Equitable Treatment' without reference to customary international law, are not relevant for purposes of the interpretation of the standard under CAFTA Article 10.5\"\n\n209.\n\nEl Salvador notes that the interpretation of the standard of minimum treatment by NAFTA tribunals has not always been clear and uniform and states: \"El Salvador considers that, in most respects, the interpretation and reasoning of the arbitral tribunal in the NAFTA arbitration between Glamis Gold and the United states of America correctly reflects the interpretation of the requirement to provide \u2018Fair and Equitable Treatment' as part of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, and therefore, under CAFTA Article 10.5. Thus in El Salvador's view, to violate the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law included in CAFTA Article 10.5, a measure attributable to the State \u2018must be sufficiently egregious and shocking -a gross denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons- so as to fail below accepted international standards.\"\n\n210.\n\nEl Salvador considers that Article 10.5 does not include obligations of transparency, reasonableness, refraining from mere arbitrariness, or not frustrating investors' legitimate expectations. El Salvador informs the Tribunal that its interpretation is consistent with that expressed by the United States during the *Glamis Gold* arbitration and concludes: \"El Salvador considers that the customary international law minimum standard of treatment articulated in *Neer v. Mexico* has not changed significantly over time. El Salvador agrees with the view expressed by the United States in the *Glamis Gold* arbitration that the recognition that customary international law may evolve over time does not require that any particular standard must have evolved within a certain amount of time.\" (Footnotes omitted)\n\n211.\n\nIn its submission Honduras observes that Article 10.5 bears the title of \"Minimum Standard of Treatment\" and not of \"Fair and Equitable Treatment\", which is only a \"concept\" included in the minimum treatment, and coincides in substance with the submissions of the United States and El Salvador.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n*a) The Applicable Standard*\n----------------------------\n\n212.\n\nFor purposes of easy reference, it will be useful to reproduce here the terms of Article 10.5 of CAFTA on the minimum standard of treatment:\n\n\" 1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\n\n2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights. The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide:\n\n(a) \"fair and equitable treatment\" includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and\n\n(b) \"full protection and security\" requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law.\n\n3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.\"\n\nA footnote to this article directs the Tribunal to interpret it in accordance with Annex 10-B on customary international law:\n\n\"The Parties confirm their shared understanding that \u2018customary international law' generally and as specifically referenced in Articles 10.5, 10.6, and Annex 10-C results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 10.5, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.\"\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal refers also to the Preamble of the Treaty where the State parties declare that have concluded CAFTA, inter alia, to:\n\n**\"ENSURE** a *predictable* commercial framework for business planning and investment;\n\n**PROMOTE** *transparency* and eliminate bribery and corruption in international trade and investment;\n\n**SEEK** to facilitate regional trade by promoting efficient and *transparent* customs procedures that reduce costs and ensure *predictability* for their importers and exporters.\" (Emphasis added by the Tribunal)\n\n214.\n\nArticle 1.2(1) on Objectives which applies to the entire agreement provides that:\n\n\"The objectives of this Agreement, as elaborated more specifically through its *principles and rules*, including national treatment, most-favored-nation treatment, and *transparency* [...]\" (Emphasis added by the Tribunal)\n\n215.\n\nThe following paragraph states:\n\n\"2. The Parties shall interpret and apply the provisions of this Agreement in the light of its objectives set out in paragraph 1 and in accordance with applicable rules of international law.\"\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Mixed Commission in the *Neer* case did not formulate the minimum standard of treatment after an analysis of State practice. After reviewing commentaries by J.B. Moore, De Lapradelle and Politis, the Mixed Commission stated: \"Without attempting to announce a precise formula, it is in the opinion of the Commission possible to go a little further than the authors quoted, and to hold (first) that the propriety of governmental acts should be put to the test of international standards, and (second) that the treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency. Whether the insufficiency proceeds from deficient execution of an intelligent law or from the fact that the laws of the country do not empower the authorities to measure up to international standards is immaterial.\" (*Neer*, para. 4) It is ironic that the decision considered reflecting the expression of the minimum standard of treatment in customary international law is based on the opinions of commentators and, on its own admission, went further than their views without an analysis of State practice followed because of a sense of obligation. By the strict standards of proof of customary international law applied in *Glamis Gold*, *Neer* would fail to prove its famous statement - \"the treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency\"31 - to be an expression of customary international law.\n\n*L.F.H. Neer and Pauline Neer (U.S.A.) v. United Mexican States* (1926) 4 *R.I.A.A*, p. 61, para. 4.\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal notes further that, as such, arbitral awards do not constitute State practice, but it is also true that parties in international proceedings use them in their pleadings in support of their arguments of what the law is on a specific issue. There is ample evidence of such practice in these proceedings. It is an efficient manner for a party in a judicial process to show what it believes to be the law. The problem, as the Mixed Commission in *Neer* already recognized, rests in \"[...] the difficulty of devising a general formula for determining the boundary between an international delinquency of this type and an unsatisfactory use of power included in national sovere ignty.\"32 The difficulty in drawing this boundary is at the origin of the diversity of decisions on the minimum standard of treatment.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n218.\n\nThe parties have taken opposite stands on whether the minimum standard of treatment has evolved since *Nee* r's formulation. This matter has been dealt with extensively by previous tribunals in cases under NAFTA. The Tribunal refers positively in particular to the *ADF* award which accepts the evolution of customary international law noted in *Mondev*33 and records the NAFTA parties' views in this respect: \"[...] it is important to bear in mind that the Respondent United States accepts that the customary international law referred to in Article 1105(1) is not \u2018frozen in time' and that the minimum standard of treatment evolves. The FTC Interpretation of 31 July 2001, in the view of the United States, refers to customary international law \u2018as it exists today'. It is equally important to note that Canada and Mexico accept the view of the United States on this point even as they stress that \u2018the threshold [for violation of that standard] remains high.' Put in slightly different terms, what customary international law projects is not a static photograph of the minimum standard of treatment of aliens as it stood in 1927 when the Award in the *Neer* case was rendered. For both customary international law and the minimum standard of treatment of aliens it incorporates, are constantly in a process of development.\"34 The Tribunal adopts this reasoning in *ADF* and shares the conclusion that the minimum standard of treatment is \"constantly in a process of development,\" including since *Neer* 's formulation.\n\n*Mondev*, *op. cit.,* para. 125.\n\n*ADF Group Inc. v. United States*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/1 (NAFTA), Award of January 9, 2003, para. 179.\n\n219.\n\nRegarding the content of the standard, the Tribunal refers to and adopts the conclusion reached by the tribunal in *Waste Management II* in considering NAFTA Article 1105 standard of review and after surveying NAFTA arbitral awards: \"[...] the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety\u2014as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candor in an administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\"35 The Tribunal finds that *Waste Management II* persuasively integrates the accumulated analysis of prior NAFTA Tribunals and reflects a balanced description of the minimum standard of treatment. The Tribunal accordingly adopts the *Waste Management II* articulation of the minimum standard for purposes of this case.\n\n*Waste Management II, op. cit.*, para. 98.\n\n*b) The Application of the Minimum Standard of Treatment*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal will start with Claimant's allegation that its rights to due process were breached when it was not heard before the decision of *lesividad* was taken by *acuerdo gubernativo*. As explained by expert Aguilar of Respondent, there is no right to be heard before the President makes his decision:\n\n\"33. Since the administrative procedure for the issuance of the ***Acuerdo Gubernativo*** that finds the *lesividad* of an action or decision *does not* *originate by the petition of the private party, nor does the declaration* *includes constitutive effects binding to the private party that deprive them of their rights*, given that they are no part of the process for the issuance of the *acuerdo gubernativo*, a hearing prior to the issuance of the same is not granted, nor should it be granted, to them.\n\n34. Therefore, the lack of a hearing in the government process declaring the *lesividad* does not violate the due process principle, because the private party is not part of the process, which is purely an internal process of the government, and the declaration to be issued will not prejudice or diminish the exercise of their rights.\" (Aguilar, First Opinion. Emphasis in the original)\n\n221.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in the instant case FVG became a respondent once the Attorney General filed the claim of *lesivo* with the Administrative Tribunal. Hence the private party is a party in the subsequent proceeding even if the declaration does not include \"constitutive effects binding to the private party\". Furthermore, the other respondent party in the *lesivo* proceeding before the Administrative Tribunal is FEGUA, the counterparty of FVG in Contract 143/158. Not only has FEGUA been aware of the overall *lesivo* process but it took the first step in this process by its letter to the President on January 13, 2006. The Tribunal considers that there is a lack of equality-in-arms between the two contractual parties and an element of unfairness in the process because the private party has no right to be heard before the President decides that an act of the Government is *lesivo*. On the other hand, in the circumstances of this case, Claimant has fully participated in proceedings before the Administrative Tribunal and, given the fact that the Tribunal has found a breach of the minimum standard on other grounds, the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to determine whether a breach of due process has occurred on this ground.\n\n222.\n\nClaimant has also argued that the *lesividad* procedure is flawed because of the vagueness of the grounds to determine that a measure is \"harmful to the interests of the State.\" While the Tribunal agrees that the phrase is indeterminate and could be improved by adding guidance, like in Article 63 of the Spanish Law adduced by Respondent as an example in these proceedings (RL-47), the Tribunal also realizes that it may be difficult to list beforehand what may be harmful to the interests of the State. In any case, to allow the Government to invalidate its own acts during a period of three years since their occurrence is, by any standard, an extraordinary remedy which may be easily abused in its application. Whether it has been abused in the instant case and to such an extent as constituting a breach of the minimum standard of treatment, are matters addressed next by the Tribunal.\n\n223.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider this question from the perspective of the uncertainty created by the time elapsed since FVG started to use the railway equipment, the understanding by Respondent of the actions which it has considered to be harmful to its interests, and the use of *lesivo* in the wider context of the relationship of Respondent with Claimant.\n\n224.\n\nRespondent's expert Aguilar opines: \"The State of Guatemala never awarded to, or acknowledged, Ferrov\u00edas any property right for the usage of railroad equipment as none of the documents signed by Ferrov\u00edas and FEGUA's Overseer gave Ferrov\u00edas a legitimate property right [...]\" (Second Opinion, para. 31) Furthermore, \" Ferrov\u00edas was not entitled to take possession, or usufruct, of the railroad equipment owned by the State of Guatemala before the President of the Republic and his Cabinet approved Contract 41.\" According to expert Aguilar, \"The State interests that were harmed in the present case were the loss of usage and usufruct of the railroad equipment owned by the State of Guatemala because the equipment was appropriated by Ferrov\u00edas. This is acknowledged by Article 464, Civil Code, which reads: *\u2018Property is the right to enjoy and dispose of goods within the limits and, in compliance with, the obligations established by the law.'* In the case of Contract 143/158, the particular State interest, as owner of the railroad equipment, was to claim the property illegally held by Ferrov\u00edas. This interest is not vague or ambiguous, and it is the same interest that was expressed in the Complaint filed before the *Contencioso-Administrativo* Court. (Second Opinion, para. 83. Emphasis in the original)\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it appropriate to recall that Contract 41, which never became effective due to lack of *acuerdo gubernativo* and *acuerdo congresional* (clause 3.6.4 of the Bidding Conditions), was signed on March 23, 1999. Claimant restored service in the first phase of the railroad project, at that time, with the railway equipment subject to Contract 41, under exchanges of letters between FVG and FEGUA and more than four years later under Contract 143/158. By the time the *acuerdo gubernativo* related to the *lesividad* was signed on August 11, 2006, train service had been provided in the said segment of the railroad for more than seven years using that same railway equipment. Additionally, FEGUA had received payment for the use of the railway equipment as provided in Contract 41 and later in Contract 143/158.\n\n226.\n\nRespondent was fully aware that FVG needed the railway equipment under Contract 41 to provide the train service under Contract 402, otherwise FVG had the option to terminate Contract 402. For reasons which are to this day unknown, and for which the Tribunal has received no satisfactory explanation, it failed to take the next steps in order that Contract 41 could become effective. Furthermore, the Overseer of FEGUA recognized that FVG had fulfilled its obligations under Phases I and II of Contract 402 for which it used that railway equipment. To say now that FVG appropriated the railway equipment and harmed the State by depriving it of its property flies in the face of these facts and of logic.\n\n227.\n\nThe Respondent's settlement offer of August 24, 2006 contradicts its legal arguments before this Tribunal in one important respect. It has been maintained by Respondent's expert that \"The President of the Republic **was obliged** to issue, in Council of Ministers, the Declaration of *Lesividad* of Contracts 143 and 158, because if he had failed to do so, there being reasonable grounds to do so, he would have incurred [...] **joint and several liability;** a declaration of *lesividad* cannot be issued in a discretionary manner, which includes declaration of *lesividad* of Contracts 143 and 158.\" (First Opinion, para. 72. Emphasis in the original) This opinion notwithstanding, Clause 3, paragraph B) of the settlement offer provides that \"Ferrocarriles de Guatemala -FEGUA-, through its Legal Representative, is bound to request the Solicitor General's Office as Representative of the State of Guatemala to fully waive to [sic] the Claim under Administrative Law identified with number-----filed before the First Court of Claims under Administrative Law [...]\".This implies that the process before the Administrative Tribunal may be withdrawn at the request of the Attorney General, which belies the alleged inevitability of the *Lesivo* process. This is further confirmed by the minutes of the meeting of the round table, held on August 30, 2006, without FVG representatives. Point three of the minutes reads in part: \"Only the governmental representatives were invited to the meeting, which was held in order to hear the Opinion of the Attorney General of Guatemala, who noted that according to the law the PGN may not reverse the procedures unless a direct order to that effect is issued by the President of the Republic. He was informed that a discussion table had been assembled to address the issue with the parties involved. He agreed that he would not file any legal actions until the discussion process was concluded.\" (Ex. R-36) Thus, in the settlement offer the Overseer of FEGUA would have committed himself to request the Attorney General to waive the *lesivo* claim and in turn he would have needed an order of the President. The Tribunal notes that these are Respondent's documents, drafted by Respondent, and they contradict the arguments made by Respondent and its expert that the President has no discretion in matters of *lesividad*. He has discretion and used it with the approval of his Government for a purpose different from that for which it was justified, namely, to obtain additional concessions, including further investments by Claimant, unrelated to the basis for the *Lesivo* Declaration. Respondent has not been able to show any example in support of the alleged liability of the President if he had not declared *lesivo* Contract 143/158.\n\n228.\n\nAs regards the grounds (\" *motivos* \") of the *Lesivo* Declaration, it is striking that four out of a total of five grounds are related to the bidding conditions of Contract 41. The Tribunal will review and comment on each of them:\n\n*Motivo* a) considers that the right to discuss the terms of Contract 41 awarded to FVG by the bidding board is contrary to Article 19 of Respondent's Procurement Law. The Tribunal finds it difficult to understand the relevance of this reason since it concerns the award of the non-ratified contract.\n\n*Motivo b*) relates to the fourth clause of Contract 143/158 which permits that other property different from that listed in the inventory may be incorporated in violation to the terms of Article 90 of the law on Government Contracting. The Tribunal recalls that this is what clause fourth of Contract 41 already provided from the start: \"This is a general description and the parties accept to include other property that by nature is incorporated to the aforesaid equipment, owing to the nature and purposes of the contract as well as for its effectiveness.\"\n\n*Motivo c*) states that the sixth clause of Contract 143/158 contradicts item V of the first clause of that contract as well as clause 6.4 of the bidding conditions of Contract 41. This ground is in turn contradicted by the terms of the next ground, *Motivo d)*\n\n*Motivo d*) states that the parties applied the bidding conditions for a contract that they had terminated when they should have proceeded to a new bidding. Evidently whether or not the parties applied the prior bidding conditions, reference to the bidding conditions of Contract 41 was a good enough reason for the Respondent to motivate the *Lesivo* Declaration.\n\n229.\n\nMore significantly, several of the provisions of Contract 41 (*Motivos* a) and b)) were considered nine years later contrary to Articles 19 and 90 of the Public Procurement Law and, to the extent that they had been incorporated in Contract 143/158, were grounds for the Declaration of *lesivo*. Further to the *Exposici\u00f3n de Motivos,* the whereas clauses (\" *considerandos* \") of the *Lesivo* Declaration refer to the legal opinions of the Attorney General and of FEGUA, and explain that they are the basis for the Declaration. Both opinions include, as part of the reasons in support of the *lesividad* of Contract 143/158, elements taken from Contract 41, such as for instance, the duration of the contract or the frequency of payment of the canon. These examples show the legal uncertainty inherent to *lesivo*. Even if Contract 41 had been ratified, for a period of three years the Government may have found cause for declaring it *lesivo* on the grounds adduced nine years later in respect of Contract 143/158.\n\n230.\n\nThe settlement offer was made on the eve of the publication of the *Lesivo* Declaration. Respondent has argued that it sought to dispose of all issues pending with Claimant. The offer is evidence of that, since it sets forth the contentious issues between Respondent and Claimant in respect of Contract 402, Contract 820 and Contract 143/158. The Tribunal understands that the transaction proposed on August 24, 2006 would have consisted in a package of concessions between the two parties. What the Tribunal finds objectionable is that Respondent links the publication of the *Lesivo* Declaration of Contract 143/158 to a settlement of issues unrelated to the Declaration itself and to its justification, and that, in order to avoid its publication, Claimant had to agree to undertakings which would not necessarily cure the \"illegalities\" or \"irregularities\" of Contract 143/158.\n\n231.\n\nRespondent has indicated that there is no evidence that Respondent would not have agreed to limit the undertakings required in the settlement offer to Contract 143/158 if Claimant had not abandoned the negotiations. This is speculative and there is no evidence in the proceedings to show that at any point in time Respondent ever proposed to Claimant to correct what made Contract 143/158 *lesivo* without further conditions.\n\n232.\n\nThe fact that the Respondent did not use the *Lesivo* Declaration for its intended purpose is evident in Respondent's own minutes of the meeting of the round table of September 28, 2006: \"The Attorney General indicated that the PGN is ready to file the pertaining actions in the case regarding the *lesivo* declaration of the Contract for Onerous Usufruct of Railroad Equipment. He noted that such actions were deferred pending the results of the discussion table, but that he thinks that if no progress is made by the discussion table the actions should be brought without delay. The Attorney General also believes that if the PGN initiated the legal procedures this would increase pressure to advance the negotiations.\" (para. 3 of the Minutes. Ex. R-36) As noted previously by the Tribunal, President Berger was blunt in his statements as reported in the press about what motivated the *Lesivo* Declaration: \"the declaration of *lesividad* arises from the fact that the US$50 million investment under said contract did not occur. However, he added, Ferrov\u00edas [FVG] has a 90-day term to enter into dialogue with the corresponding authorities.\" (Ex. C-131) The statement substantially coincides with the transcript of the President's broadcast on September 4, 2006. (Ex. C-132)\n\n233.\n\nThe Tribunal has already pointed out that the *lesivo* procedure has characteristics which may be easily abused by the Government. The alleged inevitability of the process together with \"illegality\" having equal status with *lesividad* mean that an extraordinary remedy may become routine once any \"illegality\" of a Government act has been identified by the Government itself. It is inconceivable that just any illegality would harm the interests of the State without the President's having to exercise his own judgment in the matter. An investor in Guatemala would have no certainty that, at any time within three years of its investment, the State may declare the investment *lesivo*, if a flaw is discovered by the State in, for instance, the authorization of the investment, irrespective of the flawless performance by the investor of its obligations as part of such authorization. Unless such an extraordinary remedy is used in truly exceptional circumstances such as in cases of corruption, to give an example of concern to Respondent, it creates situations which have the potential to violate the minimum standard of treatment of aliens under customary international law.\n\n234.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, the *lesivo* remedy has been used under a cloak of formal correctness allegedly in defense of the rule of law, in fact for exacting concessions unrelated to the finding of *lesivo*. Even if FEGUA's actions with respect to Contract 41/143 and in allowing FVG to use the rail equipment were *ultra vires* (not \"pursuant to domestic law\"), which has not been convincingly established for the Tribunal, the Government should be precluded from raising violations of its own law as a defense when, for a substantial period of time it knowingly overlooked them, obtained benefits from them, and it had the power to correct them.\n\n235.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the manner in which and the grounds on which Respondent applied the *lesivo* remedy in the circumstances of this case constituted a breach of the minimum standard of treatment in Article 10.5 of CAFTA by being, in the words of *Waste Management II*, \"arbitrary, grossly unfair, [and] unjust.\" In particular the Tribunal stresses the following facts, which taken together demonstrate the arbitrary, grossly unfair, and unjust nature of *lesivo* in this case, including by evidencing that *lesivo* was in breach of representations made by Guatemala upon which Claimant reasonably relied: a) the Government declared *lesivo* Contract 143/158 for the use of railway equipment for which FEGUA received rents without protest; b) that contract had been concluded at the initiative of FEGUA36 because the Government itself failed, for unknown reasons, to ratify Contract 41 after FVG had won it through public bidding; c) failure of Government ratification and lack of public bidding for the use under Contract 143/158 of the same equipment as under Contract 41, both under control of the Government, and which it had the power to remedy, were in part the justification to declare *lesivo* Contract 143/158; d) other grounds for *lesivo* referred to terms of Contract 41 that the Government itself had proposed and FVG and FEGUA had copied in Contract 143/158; e) the railway equipment in question had been used since the initiation of the rail service in 1998 with full knowledge of the Government and without which Claimant could not have performed its obligations under Contract 402; f) FEGUA certified that such obligations under Phase I and II of the railway rehabilitation had been performed satisfactorily by FVG, which had used the very same railway equipment, first under the exchanges of letters between FEGUA and FVG and later under Contract 143/158; g) the conditions proposed by the Government for not proceeding with *lesivo* were for the most part unrelated to the curing of *lesivo* and the *Lesivo* Declaration was used as a tactic to pressure Claimant to invest more, irrespective of its obligations under Contract 402, or forfeit its investment in favor of other unspecified investors.\n\n\"CODEFE undertook the commitment vis-\u00e0-vis Ferrocarriles de Guatemala by means of Official Letter No. GG-020-2000 to the effect that, while it was [in the process of] obtaining the respective approval of the railway equipment onerous usufruct (public deed No. 41), it would pay, monthly, for the use of traction and hauling equipment as stipulated in subsection b) of the aforementioned agreement, i.e., 1% of the Gross Railroad Freight Traffic, which situation FEGUA accepted in accordance with Official Letters GaP 076-99 and O23-2000. As to date, this contract has not been legalized, as indicated in Clause Sixth thereof, and as the responsible party for safeguarding the interests of the State, we do hereby make the formal request for payment of the amount obtained from the total value of the Gross Transport Handled for the Use of the Railway Equipment owned by FEGUA, from the date of commencement of commercial\n\n236.\n\nWhat effect the breach had on Claimant's investment will be addressed by the Tribunal as part of its damages assessment.\n\n**VIII. FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY**\n--------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nClaimant's remaining contention is that Respondent failed to afford Claimant's investment full protection and security within the meaning of CAFTA Article 10.5. As set forth above in the recitation of the parties' respective positions, Claimant supports this contention mainly by arguing that Guatemala failed to protect FVG's right-of-way from squatters. While the issue of squatters had been the subject of considerable dispute between the parties prior to the *Lesivo* Declaration, including the formation of a Presidential Squatters Commission in January 2005 and FVG's initiation operations to 31 December 2001, on an urgent basis. **Given the silence of the Higher Authorities for approval of Contract No. 41, we are ready to renegotiate the contract**.\" (Letter of FEGUA's Overseer to Mr. Senn of FVG of Aug. 22, 2002 (Ex R-198). Emphasis added by the Tribunal). of a domestic arbitration in Guatemala later that year, the Tribunal reiterates that its jurisdiction extends to \"acts or omissions of Respondent related to squatters, but only to the extent that these result from the *Lesivo* Resolution.\" (Second Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 155).\n\n238.\n\nArticle 10.5(1) of CAFTA reflects that \"full protection and security\" is a core component of the minimum standard of treatment. Without minimizing the importance of this protection to the CAFTA framework, the Tribunal concludes for reasons of procedural economy that it is not necessary to reach Claimant's allegation that Respondent failed to provide full protection and security from squatters. The parties' arguments on this issue raise factually complex questions, including the extent to which the harm complained of by Claimant should be attributed to the *Lesivo* Declaration, as opposed to the pre-existing dispute between the parties relating to the squatters. Given that there was a continuous problem of squatters - as reflected by the Presidential Commission and ongoing arbitration - it is difficult on this record to isolate only those aspects of the larger issue over which we have jurisdiction. At the same time, even if the Claimant were able to establish a breach of this CAFTA protection, Claimant would be entitled to no greater relief than is already warranted by Respondent's breach of the minimum standard discussed above. Accordingly, the Tribunal will not consider the alleged breach of full protection and security.\n\n**IX. DAMAGES**\n---------------\n\n**1. The Parties' Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n239.\n\nIn its Memorial Claimant contends that the damages should cover the fair market value of its investment, including the adjusted amount of the investment as of the date of the violations of CAFTA, consequential damages of lost profits from that date to the end of the Usufruct, and pre-award interest at a commercially reasonable rate, namely at the rate paid by Respondent on its private debt obligations, compounded semi-annually.\n\n240.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial Respondent recalls the provisions of CAFTA on compensation in the case of an expropriation. It notes that CAFTA does not establish a standard of compensation for breaches of other obligations under the treaty and that the principle of reparation under customary international law would apply to such breaches. Respondent refers to Claimant's statements to show that the railway equipment was not a required component of its investment or was of secondary priority, contends that there is no causal nexus between the publication of the *Lesivo* Declaration and any damage or loss suffered by Claimant or, if there was, it was FVG's own doing by its press campaign or by mismanaging its business well before the *Lesivo* Declaration was published.\n\n241.\n\nRespondent points out that Claimant has engaged in double-counting by requesting damages for lost profits and lost investment and calculating its damages based on a discounted cash flow analysis (\"DCF\"). Respondent contends that FVG had no profits during its operation and its assessment of future lost profits is speculative and unsubstantiated. Respondent explains that Claimant's net capital contribution (\"NCC\") approach to calculating damages is inappropriate because this method is used in cases where the alleged expropriation took place shortly after the investment was made and prevented the investor from exploiting its investment. Respondent argues that by the time the *Lesivo* Declaration was issued, the viability of FVG was in question and no buyer would base the value of the business on the amount of the historical investment without reference to actual results. Respondent disputes the discount rate use by Claimant in its calculations as being grossly underestimated and contends that an appropriate analysis shows that, at the time of the *Lesivo* Resolution, FVG had a negative fair market value and Claimant has not suffered any damages.\n\n242.\n\nAs regards pre-award interest, Respondent argues that compound interest as claimed by Claimant need to be justified on the facts of the particular case since the traditional principle that compound interest is not allowed continues to apply.\n\n243.\n\nIn its Reply Claimant contends that the appropriate standard for measuring compensation in the case of an illegal expropriation is not the fair market value prescribed in CAFTA but the customary international law standard of full reparation set forth in *Chorz\u00f3w*.37 According to Claimant, this is also the standard to apply for breaches of the minimum standard of treatment and national treatment obligations.\n\n*The Factory At Chorz\u00f3w (Ger. V. Pol.), Claim for Indemnity, The Merits,* 1928, P.C.I.J. (Ser. A.), No. 17, (Sept. 13), p. 40.\n\n244.\n\nClaimant contends that, under the full reparation standard, it is entitled to recover the amount invested and the lost profits. Claimant also contends that the possibility of double counting is avoided by amortizing its sunk costs over the life of the usufruct after the *Lesivo* Declaration.\n\n245.\n\nClaimant disputes that FVG was not profitable as affirmed by Respondent. Claimant explains that \"the future cash flows to be discounted consist not of future profits or earnings but of future cash flow: gross income less the expenses necessary to produce that income.\" (Reply, para. 487) Furthermore, according to Claimant, accounting results must be adjusted to reflect the rents that were not paid into the railway trust. Claimant adds that: \"it is axiomatic that a respondent cannot rely upon its own breaches or fault in order to argue that a claimant has not met the standards for proving entitlement to recovery.\" (Reply, para. 489)\n\n246.\n\nClaimant also contends on the basis of Article 36(2) of the ILC Articles that even if FVG had not shown profitability prior to the *Lesivo* Resolution, international law does not require prior profitability to recover damages on account of lost profits and it is possible to justify an award of damages on grounds of the track record of successful investments in similar circumstances. Claimant disputes Respondent's argument that the real estate valuations or utility easement projections are speculative. Furthermore, according to Claimant, even if lost profits are not awarded by the Tribunal, there is no authority to support the contention of Respondent's expert that recovery of the net capital contribution is only appropriate when the expropriation takes place close to the time of the original investment. Claimant finds support for this contention in *Vivendi II*38 and *Phelps Dodge.*39\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Second Award of August 20, 2007, para.8.3.19.\n\n*Phelps Dodge Corp. and Overseas Private Investment Corp. v. Islamic Republic of Iran*, Award No. 217-99-2 of March 19, 1986, reprinted in 10 Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal Reports 121, para. I, 31.\n\n247.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\"WACC\") is inflated and unreasonable because, *inter alia*, it is assumed that Claimant would have borrowed funds in Guatemala and that the WACC should be computed with a 50/50 weighting between railroad cost of capital and real estate cost of capital. According to Claimant, this weighting does not correspond to the factual situation of an 8% contribution by the railroad and a 92% contribution by real estate.\n\n248.\n\nClaimant contends that it can recover the amount it invested and the amount invested by the minority shareholders. For its contention, Claimant relies on Article 10.16.1 of CAFTA and the explanation given by the United States as a nonparty submission in the GAMI arbitration in respect to parallel Article 1117 of NAFTA.40\n\n*GAMI*, *op.cit.,* Submission of the United States of June 30, 2003, paras. 9-10 and 12.\n\n249.\n\nClaimant argues that it has established causation for its damages. According to Claimant, \"It is irrelevant that FVG would not have needed the FEGUA equipment for the eventually restored South Coast right-of-way; if FVG did not have the FEGUA equipment, it could not fulfill its performance obligations under Contract 402 because there was not a sufficient inventory of replacement narrow gauge rolling stock available elsewhere in the world that could be obtained at a reasonable cost.\" (Reply, 569) Claimant then refers to the devastating *de facto* effect of the Declaration on the value of Claimant's investment as if it had declared the entire usufruct harmful to the interests of the State, disputes the effect of its own press release and affirms that \"Respondent has not presented any evidence that any current or prospective customer, supplier, lender or lessee first learned about the *Lesivo* Declaration from Claimant's press release or took any action as a result of it.\" (Reply, para. 572)\n\n250.\n\nClaimant submits a revised claim of $63,778,212 after deducting $2,704,310 on account of revenues obtained since the Declaration of *Lesivo* in an effort to mitigate its damages. As to compound interest, Claimant argues that there is no reason for simple interest taking into account the compensatory function of the interest awarded and ignores the financial reality in which businesses operate. Claimant also refers to the increasing tendency of arbitral tribunals to award compound interest as Respondent itself has recognized.\n\n251.\n\nIn its Rejoinder Respondent disagrees with the interpretation given to Article 10.7.2 of CAFTA by Claimant. Respondent points out that the words \"lawful\" and \"unlawful\" do not appear in Article 10.7, and that to apply the Claimant's reasoning would ignore the State parties' decision to measure damages as provided in this article. The fair market value of the investment is sufficient to wipe out the effects of the *Lesivo* Declaration and it is the appropriate measure of damages in accordance with the *Chorz\u00f3w* criteria. According to Respondent, the way in which Claimant applies *Chorz\u00f3w* compensates it twice for its investment.\n\n252.\n\nRespondent insists on the speculative character of Claimant's future profits claim. Respondent acknowledges that lost profits decrease from $36.16 million in the Memorial to $22.19 million in the Reply, but Respondent contends that the lost profits claim continues to be unsubstantiated and extremely optimistic whether lost profits relate to the operation of the railroad or to the real estate leasing and development rights. Respondent also insists that the correction introduced by Claimant to reduce double counting is not enough because the net present value of the amortizations deducted from future cash flows is substantially lower than the amount computed as lost investment.\n\n253.\n\nRespondent explains that the historical approach of considering that Claimant possessed an asset, with a fair market value approximately equal to the sum of the amounts invested in FVG, is not appropriate because a portion of these amounts were used to cover operational losses of FVG. For this reason, an alternative historical approach would be to look at the value of FVG's equity as reflected in its books just prior to the *Lesivo* Declaration (US$4.2 million as of December 2006), as this method would take into account both the capital contributions and the accumulated losses. However, Dr. Spiller [Respondent's expert] also explained in his First Report that, given FVG's severe financial distress prior to the *Lesivo* Declaration, this figure would result in an overestimation of FVG's fair market value at that time. (Rejoinder, para. 367)\n\n254.\n\nRespondent disputes that the amount claimed for business termination was used for such purpose and, according to the evidence submitted by Claimant, Respondent points out that only $119,235 was spent in severance payments out of a total of $1.35 million claimed by Claimant.\n\n255.\n\nRespondent also disagrees with the interpretation given by Claimant to Article 10.16.1 and to the jurisprudence applying the related Article 1117 of NAFTA. According to Respondent, Article 10.16.1(b) \"only speaks of a claimant's ability to seek compensation for damages suffered *by the enterprise* it owns or controls. What is more, CAFTA Article 10.26.2(b) and (c) specifically require that any damages awarded under CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b) be awarded and paid directly to the enterprise, not the individual claimant-investor.\" (Rejoinder, para. 375. Emphasis added by Respondent) Furthermore, Respondent points out that all other FVG minority shareholders are Guatemalan and do not qualify as claimant or investor of a party to CAFTA.\n\n256.\n\nRespondent reiterates its disagreement with the discount rate applied by Claimant, that before the *Lesivo* Declaration FVG was worthless, and that Claimant has failed to prove a causal connection between the damages it claims and the *Lesivo* Declaration.\n\n257.\n\nRespondent argues that, in case of any damages awarded to Claimant by the Tribunal, the Tribunal \"should condition Guatemala's obligation to pay on Claimant's first renouncing and forfeiting all of the rights it has under the usufruct contracts (402, 143/158 and 41), returning all lands and equipment covered by those contracts to Guatemala.\" (Rejoinder, para. 398)\n\n258.\n\nAs to compound interest, according to Respondent, Claimant has failed to show the existence of special circumstances that would justify compounding in this case and there is equally no justification for applying the \"coerced loan\" rationale to arrive at the interest rate proposed by Claimant. Respondent proposes instead to apply a pre-award interest rate equivalent to six-month LIBOR plus two percentage points.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that CAFTA's provisions on compensation refer only to compensation in case of expropriation. The Tribunal has concluded that the investment has not been expropriated. The question arises of the compensation standard to be applied in the case of breaches of CAFTA other than expropriation.\n\n260.\n\nCAFTA directs the Tribunal to interpret Article 10.5 on the minimum standard of treatment in accordance with Annex B on customary international law. Under customary international law as reflected in the ILC Articles, \"The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\" (Article 31.1) The Tribunal needs to determine the amount of compensation to be paid on account of the injury suffered by Claimant as a consequence of the breach of the minimum standard of treatment. The Tribunal has determined that Claimant's investment was not expropriated because it continued to enjoy its contractual rights under Contract 143/158 and it has remained in possession of the equipment covered under that contract. The Tribunal has also determined that the *Lesivo* Declaration had a significant effect on Claimant's overall investment but it has recognized that Contract 402 continues to be in force and that FVG continues to receive rents from the real estate appurtenant to the right-of-way. Therefore, the issue is how to assess the compensation on account of a measure which has an injurious effect, falling short of expropriation on assets which continue in possession of Claimant.\n\n261.\n\nBefore turning to the assessment of compensation, the Tribunal needs to address two preliminary matters: (a) the renunciation by Claimant to its rights under the Usufruct Contracts in case compensation is awarded by the Tribunal, and (b) the interpretation of Article 10.16.1 of CAFTA.\n\n262.\n\nOn the first of these matters Respondent has argued that, \"if the Tribunal awards any damages to Claimant for Guatemala's alleged breaches of its obligations under CAFTA, it should condition Guatemala's obligation to pay on Claimant's first renouncing and forfeiting all of the rights it has under the usufruct contracts (402, 143/158 and 41), returning all lands and equipment covered by those contracts to Guatemala\" (Rejoinder, para. 398). At the hearing, in answer to a question of the Tribunal, counsel to Claimant stated: \"[...] if you awarded full reparation, however you define that, if you awarded full reparations, whether its for whatever State action that violates international law, once you award full reparations, then the payer of those reparations, the State, is subrogated to all of our rights under the Contract, its Contract, it seems to me. And therefore, it seems to me that the fashioning of your Award to the extent that you'd concluded that what you were awarding were full reparations, fashioning it in that fashion you would automatically cause Guatemala to be subrogated to our rights under the leases.\" (December 16, day eight, p. 2134 of transcript)\n\n263.\n\nThe return of investment assets conditional on payment of the award is not uncommon in indirect expropriation cases. Thus in *ADC v. Hungary*, the claimant on receipt of compensation was required to transfer to the respondent its shareholding in the relevant investment vehicle.41 Similarly, in *Tecmed v. Mexico*, the claimant was required to take all necessary steps to transfer to the respondent or its nominee the assets comprising the hazardous landfill which was the focus of the dispute.42 It is less obviously appropriate in cases involving breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, but it is not unknown. In *CMS v. Argentina*, for example, the claimant was a US company which owned a 29.42% share in an Argentine gas utility company. Following regulatory action by the respondent in the wake of the Argentine fiscal crisis of the early 2000s, the tribunal found that the fair and equitable treatment standard of the relevant BIT had been breached. The tribunal awarded the claimant compensation conditional on the transfer of its shareholding in the utility to the respondent.43\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award of October 2, 2006, para. 543.4.\n\n*Tecmed*, *op. cit*, para. 199.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic*, Award of 12 May 2005. The Award was later partially annulled, but not for any reason connected to the form of the remedy. See Decision of Annulment of 25 September 2007.\n\n264.\n\nIn the present case only Contract 143/158 was directly affected by the *Lesivo* Resolution, and it could be argued that the remedy should concern only that contract. The Tribunal does not agree, for three reasons. First and most important, neither Party has taken this point (see paragraphs 54-5, 69 and 79-80 above). On the contrary, both contemplate a Tribunal award which fully resolves the dispute by ensuring that the parties do not need to persist in a relationship which has become antagonistic and acrimonious. Secondly, the Claimant has effectively made its election, withdrawing from Guatemala following the passing of the *Lesivo* Resolution, and the Tribunal considers that its conduct in that respect was reasonable. Thirdly, the investment concerned the renovation and running of a railway as a whole.\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal is also concerned that to restrict the scope of the remedy to Contract 143/158 would be to create an undesirable risk of double recovery, *e.g.* through the sale of Claimant's shares in FVG to a third party which might then acquire a right to litigate with respect to the same conduct considered by this Award. The Tribunal notes that it has the capacity to render an award tailored so as to minimize the risk of double recovery between the parties.44 In the circumstances this situation is best resolved by requiring Claimant, on the full and effective payment of the prescribed compensation by Respondent, to transfer to Respondent or its nominee all the Claimant's shares in FVG.\n\nSee further *Sempra Energy International v The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/02/16, Decision on Jurisdiction of May 11, 2005, para. 102 (\"international law and decisions offer numerous mechanisms for preventing the possibility of double recovery\"); *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua SA v The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on Jurisdiction of May 16, 2006, para. 51 (\"any eventual award in this case could be fashioned in such a way as to prevent double recovery\").\n\n266.\n\nAs to the interpretation of Article 10.16.1 of CAFTA, the Tribunal notes a certain inconsistency in the way Claimant has pleaded its case. On the one hand, Claimant filed its arbitration request both on its own behalf and on behalf of FVG. On the other hand, Claimant has pleaded that compensation be paid by Respondent to Claimant. Article 10.16.1(a) covers submission to arbitration of a claimant on its own behalf. Article 10.16.1(b) provides for submission to arbitration by a claimant on behalf of \"an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly.\" As pointed out by Respondent, Claimant ignores Article 10.26.2's requirement that, where a claim is submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(b), an award of monetary damages shall provide that the sum be paid to the enterprise. In the instant case, the minority shareholders of FVG are all nationals of Respondent and do not qualify as investors under CAFTA. For these reasons the amounts awarded for its loss from its investment should be paid to Claimant and be calculated on the basis of the percentage of the total amount invested by FVG's shareholders, which was contributed by Claimant.\n\n267.\n\nTo summarize, for the reasons that have been given, the Tribunal considers that reparation is due to Claimant to compensate it fully for the injury suffered. It further considers that, in the circumstances of the case and to resolve the dispute between the parties, the payment of the amount awarded should be subject to Claimant relinquishing its rights under all the contracts, *i.e.* Contracts 402 and 143/158.45 As noted, Respondent has pleaded that payment of the award be on condition that Claimant return the right of way and equipment to Guatemala. Since FVG and not Claimant is the party to the Usufruct Contracts, the Tribunal considers that the effect sought by Respondent would be appropriately achieved from a legal standpoint by conditioning payment of the award upon the transfer of Claimant's shares in FVG to Respondent.\n\nContract 41 never became effective and need not be further considered.\n\n268.\n\nTurning now to the assessment of damages, the Tribunal recalls that the parties disagree on the amount, on the applicable method of calculation, on the discount rate to apply, and on the components to be included in the calculation. In the Tribunal's view, the diverging results in the calculation of damages performed by the parties' experts show the malleability and uncertainty of such calculations.\n\n269.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent that, given the past performance of FVG, the claim of lost profits is speculative. To say the least, it has not been proved that after eight years of operation a sharp improvement in FVG's performance was in the offing, as Claimant's experts have assumed. However, there are in the experts' considerations certain known quantities related to the amount invested and the actual rents received from leases of the real estate. The Tribunal will anchor its assessment to these certainties, which have the additional merit of arguably representing benefits which may be considered to accrue to Respondent on payment of the amount awarded to Claimant.\n\n270.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, quantum in the present case has three elements. First, it is unquestioned that Claimant invested funds in the rehabilitation and operation of the railway sufficient to complete Phases I and II. As revised in the Reply, $19,025,321 represents the total amount invested in FVG by Claimant and local shareholders, of which $15,108,861 (79%) were contributed by Claimant. A portion of these funds claimed as investment, viz. $10.8 million, was invested by FVG's shareholders to cover the losses of FVG (Counter-Memorial, para. 615, First Report, of Dr. Spiller, Respondent's expert, para. 82 and Exhibit C-27); of this, $8,532,000 corresponds to the 79% contributed by Claimant. The Tribunal considers that the funds invested by Claimant to cover these losses represent the risks Claimant took when investing in Guatemala and cannot be attributed to any action of Guatemala contrary to CAFTA. Furthermore, the railway equipment in FVG's possession is considered valuable property by Respondent. The Respondent's Attorney General has pleaded before the Administrative Tribunal that the railway equipment is \" *un patrimonio millonario* \". Part of the funds invested by FVG's shareholders were used to restore the railway equipment necessary to bring trains back into service. While Respondent has contended that the railway equipment has not been well maintained, approximately a year and a half prior to the *Lesivo* Resolution FEGUA's Overseer presented to FVG's Chairman on behalf of the FEGUA-affiliated Railroad Museum an award for \"the rescue and restoration of the Historic Railway Patrimony of Guatemala\" (Memorial, para. 120). Based on these considerations, the Tribunal awards Claimant $6,576,861 ($15,108,861 minus $8,532,000).\n\n271.\n\nSecond, FVG receives rents for leasing the real estate. These rents at the time of the *Lesivo* Declaration amounted to $716,316 per year (Reply, para. 520). Over the 42 years left of the Usufruct and as calculated by Claimant, the net present value (\"NPV\") of these leases is $10,751,437. Respondent disputes the discount rate applied by Claimant as being too low at 12.9%. Respondent claims that a rate of 18.75% would be more appropriate. Claimant explains that the difference between the two rates arises from three factors:\n\n(a) Respondent's expert assumes that Claimant would have borrowed in Guatemala rather than in the United States, which has an impact on the rate of 1.8 percentage points.\n\n(b) The size premium of Morningstar used by Respondent's expert is based on \"category 10b\" data rather than \"category 10\" data, which increases the discount rate by a further 2.66 percentage points. Dr. Pratt, Claimant's expert, explains that, when calculating the cost of equity for a company using the Morningstar categories, the category 10 size premium should be utilized and not the category 10b premium, which includes \"an abundance of distressed companies\". He further explains that Category 10 reflects the bottom 10 percent of the combined stock on the NYSE, ASE and NASDAQ, while 10b includes the bottom 5 percent of the combined stocks on these exchanges.46\n\n(c) Respondent's expert assumes a 50/50 weighted railway cost of capital and real estate cost of capital instead of the actual 8% contribution by the railroad and the 92% contribution by the real estate, which increases the rate by a further 1.5 points.\n\nReport of Shannon Pratt Valuations, Inc. p. 10.\n\n272.\n\nOn the other hand, Dr. Spiller, Respondent's expert, has insisted in that \"it is not standard valuation practice to assign a cost of debt to a company operating in a particular developing country, experiencing substantial operational and financial difficulties, as if it was a successful and profitable company operating in the US and other jurisdictions, as assumed by Dr. Pratt.\" (Second Report, para 85). On the issue of the size of the premium, Dr. Spiller argues that, (a) \"[g]iven that the size of FVG places it in the 10b group, whether under Claimants' own experts' assessment, or my own, there is no credible reason to use any other category for selecting the size premium\" (Ibid. para. 91); (b) the same troubled companies are also included in the 10 group only that their effect on the premium is diluted; and (c) FVG needs to be compared with companies in a similar situation and FVG had shown negative results during the seven years prior to its valuation (ibid. paras. 88 and 89). As to the relative weights of the railway cost of capital and the real estate cost of capital, Dr. Spiller explains that, \"Railroad activities account for an average 50% contribution to FVG's EBITDA over the remaining years of the concession, while real estate exploitation represents the remaining 50%. However, when calculated as net present value, railroad activities' contribution to EBITDA increases to 60% of the total, leaving the remaining 40% to real estate activities. Since railroad activities have a higher WACC rate, I judged the 50/50 distribution more conservative and thus adopted it for our combined WACC rate\" (Ibid. para. 97)\n\n273.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, as to the first factor, FVG's cost of capital should be used to value FVG assets, including the income stream from the real estate leases. The fact that RDC borrowed funds in the United States, rather than Guatemala, does not detract from this conclusion. To the extent that RDC borrowed funds in the United States and then used those funds to finance FVG, this was in effect a subsidy that would be inappropriate to incorporate into the valuation analysis of a FVG asset. As regards Morningstar categories 10 and 10b, in the Tribunal's view, the size premium for companies in group 10b is justified given the size and uncertain financial condition of FVG. As regards the calculation of the WACC, the Tribunal accepts the weight given by Claimant to the railway cost of capital (8%) and the real estate cost of capital (92%) because it reflects the actual situation.\n\n274.\n\nTo conclude and based on the preceding considerations, the Tribunal finds that a discount rate of 12.9% plus 2.66 percentage points (the effect of using the 10b instead of the 10 size premium) plus 1.8 percentage points (the effect of using FVG's cost of capital), for a total of 17.36%, would be an appropriate discount rate to calculate the NPV of existing leases.\n\n275.\n\nThirdly, as for future leases, while the Tribunal does not deny that such leases could have materialized, the Tribunal considers that after eight years of operation Claimant had secured only the leases taken into account here. They show the difficulty of Claimant in enlarging its real estate lease portfolio as registered in FVG's annual reports and pointed out by Respondent (p. 293 and ff. of CounterMemorial). Hence, only the leases in place at the time of the *Lesivo* Declaration have been taken into account.\n\n276.\n\nClaimant has also included as part of its claim the lost revenues from Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n trans loading operations. This segment of the railroad connects M\u00e9xico to Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n and was disrupted by hurricane Stan. According to Claimant, at the time of filing the Reply it was scheduled to resume operations in 2011 (Reply, para. 521). Since the service at Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n was interrupted long before the *Lesivo* Declaration through no fault of Guatemala and the Tribunal has no evidence of service resumption in 2011, the Tribunal has not included future revenues of the Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n trans loading operations in its assessment of damages.\n\n277.\n\nTo sum up and based on these considerations, the Tribunal determines that Claimant is entitled to: (a) $6,576,861 on account of its investment in Phases I and II; (b) $1,350,429 for operating the railroad for another year after the *Lesivo* Declaration which permitted an orderly closure of the railroad service (Reply, para. 550); and (c) 82% (the percentage of shares in FVG held by Claimant, and which will be transferred to Respondent after full payment of the Award by Respondent) of $4,121,281.62 (which is $3,379,450.93), the NPV of the existing real estate leases measured over their remaining life as of the date of *Lesivo*, minus 82% of rents paid to FVG under such leases post- *Lesivo* and until payment by Respondent of the awarded compensation, at which point Respondent will receive Claimant's shares in FVG. Because the Tribunal cannot determine at this time when Respondent will pay the award, there will be a need for a final calculation of this amount.\n\n**X. INTEREST**\n---------------\n\n278.\n\nClaimant has argued for compound interest at a rate of 9.34% based on the rate that Respondent paid to private and public creditors in 2006 and on the notion of a coerced loan from Claimant to Respondent. Respondent has suggested a preaward interest rate equivalent to six-month LIBOR plus two percentage points. The Tribunal disagrees with the coerced loan rationale of Claimant to arrive at the proposed rate of interest. The rationale for pre-award interest rests on a claimant's loss for not being able to dispose of the funds awarded from the moment the breach of an international obligation has been determined in the award. Claimant would not have been able to obtain the rate of interest claimed in its normal course of business nor would have paid such rate for funds borrowed to replace those due for the breach of an obligation by Respondent.\n\n279.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the rate proposed by Respondent is a commercially reasonable rate and determines that this is the interest rate that shall apply to the awarded funds from the date of the *Lesivo* Declaration until such funds are paid.\n\n280.\n\nThe parties disagree on whether compound interest is applicable. Claimant relies on an increasing number of precedents that have awarded compound interest. Respondent pleads that compound interest needs to be justified on the basis of special circumstances which Claimant has failed to show exist in its case.\n\n281.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the determination of whether or not a compound interest rate is applicable needs to be justified by the Tribunal as any other determination. Given the length of these proceedings because of two jurisdictional phases in which the jurisdictional objections of Respondent were rejected, and several postponements in the procedural calendar at the Government's request, the Tribunal determines that compound interest is justified.\n\n**XI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n282.\n\nEach party has pleaded that it be awarded counsel fees and expenses as well as the administrative expenses of ICSID and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal. CAFTA Article 10.26.1 permits the award of costs and attorney's fees in accordance with that section and the applicable arbitration rules. The ICSID Arbitration Rules only require that the award contain \"any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding\" (Rule 47). On the basis of the discretion bestowed on the Tribunal by CAFTA and the applicable arbitration rules, the Tribunal determines that they shall be responsible for their own counsel fees and expenses. As to administrative expenses of ICSID and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the Tribunal distinguishes between the jurisdictional phases and the merits phase of the proceedings. Given that Respondent's objections to jurisdiction were twice rejected in an unusually protracted process, Respondent shall be responsible for the administrative expenses of ICSID and fees and expenses of the Tribunal related to the two jurisdictional phases. Each party shall be responsible for 50% of the administrative expenses of ICSID and 50% of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal related to the merits phase.\n\n**XII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n283.\n\nOn the basis of the preceding considerations the Tribunal has unanimously decided as follows:\n\n1. That Respondent breached the minimum standard of treatment under Article 10.5 of CAFTA in respect of Claimant's investment.\n\n2. That Respondent shall pay Claimant: a) $6,576,861 on account of its investment in Phases I and II; b) $1,350,429 for operating the railroad for another year after the *Lesivo* Declaration which permitted an orderly closure of the railroad service; and c) 82% (the percentage of shares in FVG held by Claimant) of $4,121,281.62 ($3,379,450.93) - the NPV of the existing real estate leases measured over their remaining life as of the date of *Lesivo* - minus 82% of rents paid to FVG under such leases post *lesivo* and until payment by Respondent of the compensation here awarded. Because the Tribunal cannot determine at this time when Respondent will pay the award, there will be a need for a final calculation of this amount.\n\n3. That, on payment of the awarded compensation, Claimant shall forfeit and renounce all its rights under the Usufruct Contracts and transfer to Respondent Claimant's shares in FVG.\n\n4. That the awarded amount of compensation shall carry compound interest at a rate equivalent to six-month LIBOR plus two percentage points as from the date of the *Lesivo* Declaration to the date of payment.\n\n5. That Respondent shall be responsible for the administrative expenses of ICSID and fees and expenses of the Tribunal related to the two jurisdictional phases. As calculated by the ICSID Secretariat, such fees and expenses amount to $384,854.01. Since each party has advanced 50% of the amounts requested by the ICSID Secretariat to finance these proceedings, Respondent shall pay Claimant $192,427.00. Such amount shall carry interest at the rate set forth in sub-paragraph 4 above.\n\n6. That each party shall be responsible for 50% of the remainder of administrative expenses of ICSID and of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal.\n\n7. That each party shall be responsible for its own counsel fees and expenses.\n\n8. That all other claims are dismissed.\n\nDone in Washington, D.C."}, {"Title": "Decision on Claimant's Request for Supplementation and Rectification of Award", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2013-01-18T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissent in respect of the Second Rectification Request of Arbitrator Stuart E.

Procedure**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 10 August 2012, Claimant filed a \"Request for Supplementation and Rectification of Award\" under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention (the \"Request\"). The Secretary-General registered the Request on August 20, 2012.\n\n2.\n\nOn August 23, 2012, the Tribunal fixed the following time-limits for exchange of submissions by the parties: September 12, 2012 for Respondent to file its observations on the Request and 13 days each for Claimant and Respondent to file their respective reply and rejoinder. Claimant filed its Reply on September 25 and Respondent its Rejoinder on October 8, 2012.\n\n3.\n\nPursuant to CAFTA Article 10.20.2, on November 9, 2012, the Tribunal invited the non-disputing Parties to submit observations, if any, regarding the interpretation of the Agreement by November 16, 2012. No observations were filed.\n\n4.\n\nOn November 15, 2012, The Tribunal invited the Parties to submit by November 27, 2012, any observations they may have on the following issues:\n\n\"The weight, if any, to be given by the Tribunal to the fact that funds from real estate rents have been accumulating in the hands of Claimant since September 2006 and may have generated further income for the Claimant;\n\nWhether in the consideration of discounting the real estate rents any weight should be given to the decision of the Tribunal to award compound interest on damages as from September 2006.\"\n\n5.\n\nBoth Parties filed their observations on November 27, 2012.\n\n6.\n\nOn November 28, 2012, Respondent objected to Claimant\u2019s submission of new materials not in the record together with its observations. On the same day the Tribunal invited the Claimant\u2019s observations on Respondent\u2019s objection. Claimant filed its observations on November 29, 2012.\n\n7.\n\nThe Tribunal deliberated by teleconference on several occasions.\n\n**II. Summary of the parties\u2019 arguments**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Request***\n--------------------\n\n8.\n\nClaimant argues that it claimed and it is entitled to recover a reasonable rate of return on its investment up to the date of Respondent\u2019s breach and that the Tribunal failed to address this claim. According to Claimant, the legal authorities and \"the damages experts presented by both parties are in agreement that inclusion of a reasonable rate of return on the amounts invested is necessary to put Claimant back in the same position it would have been absent Respondent\u2019s breach.\" (para. 5). Claimant submits that the Tribunal should apply to the sunk investment costs the same rate as applied by the Tribunal to calculate the NPV of the future income stream of FVG\u2019s existing leases. In addition, Claimant submits that, \"Regardless of what rate of return the Tribunal ultimately chooses to apply, the rate should compounded for the same reasons the Tribunal awarded compound pre-award interest from the date of Lesivo.\" (para. 15)\n\n9.\n\nClaimant also points out that the Tribunal made two arithmetical errors. First, it miscalculated the net present value (\"NPV\") of FVG\u2019s existing real estate leases when applying the discount rate. Second, the Tribunal also erred by not applying the same discount rate to determine the NPV of FVG\u2019s existing real estate leases to the actual rent amount received by FVG since the date of *Lesivo*.\n\n10.\n\nAs to the first rectification request, Claimant explains how by applying the discount rate used by the Tribunal the NPV of existing leases amounts to $6,818,865 of which $5,591,469.30 represents the 82% ownership of FVG held by Claimant.\n\n11.\n\nAs regards the second rectification request, Claimant notes that the Tribunal required FVG\u2019s projected real estate income to be discounted but it did not require that the actual set-off income be similarly discounted.\n\n12.\n\nClaimant requests the following relief:\n\n\"a. That the Tribunal supplement the Award to include, as additional compensation to Claimant, a reasonable rate of return, compounded annually, on Claimant\u2019s awarded sunk investment costs of $6,576,861, calculated from the dates of investment to the date of *Lesivo* (August 25, 2006);\n\nb. That the Tribunal rectify and amend paragraphs 277 and 283(2) of the Award by correcting its calculation of the NPV of FVG\u2019s existing real estate leases measured over their remaining life as of the date of *Lesivo*, so that Claimant is awarded $5,591,469.30 (or 82% of $6,818,865) rather than $3,379,450.93 (i.e., 82% of $4,121,281.62); and\n\nc. That the Tribunal rectify and amend the Award to require that the actual rents received by FVG since the date of *Lesivo* be discounted and valued as of the date of *Lesivo* at a discount rate of 17.36% before this amount is deducted from the NPV of FVG\u2019s existing real estate leases.\" (para.26)\n\n***2. Respondent\u2019s Observations***\n----------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nRespondent considers that Claimant misapplies the legal standard and misconstrues the scope of the procedure under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention. According to Respondent, \"Article 49(2) is not designed to afford a substantive review or reconsideration of the decision, or to permit the parties to reargue questions already addressed and resolved by the Tribunal.\" (para. 8) Respondent observes that a threshold issue concerns what is a \"question\" under Article 49(2) the Convention and Arbitration Rule 49(1). Respondent notes that \"ICSID jurisprudence has consistently recognized that tribunals are not obliged to opine directly on every argument put forward by the parties, provided they address the essential issues in the case.\" (para. 12)\n\n14.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"The real questions before the Tribunal on damages were whether Claimant proved that: (1) it suffered quantifiable, compensable damages; (2) whatever damages it suffered were proximately caused by the *Lesivo* Declaration; and (3) quantum.\" (para. 14) It is the view of Respondent that the Tribunal addressed all three.\n\n15.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant is attempting to resurrect the argument that the net capital contribution (\"NCC\") approach is appropriate in this case. Respondent explains that this approach requires updating historical investments by a theoretical rate of return and refers to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the losses incurred by Claimant in 2000-2006 were not attributable to *Lesivo*. Respondent concludes that \"[i]mplicitly, therefore, the Tribunal was ruling that no updating of Claimant\u2019s investment was required.\" (para. 20)\n\n16.\n\nAccording to Respondent, \"The Tribunal correctly grounded its award on known quantities, including the actual negative return after eight years of operation, a negative return not attributable to Respondent\u2019s violations of CAFTA. Accordingly, the Tribunal accepted the view of Guatemala\u2019s expert on FVG\u2019s losses, namely, that it is inappropriate to update the value of an investment using a theoretical rate of return when a business has been in operation for a considerable time after the date of the investment and there is an observable track record. Respondent concludes: \"There was no omission of a question or failure to consider Claimant\u2019s arguments. The Tribunal considered them and Claimant lost. Claimant cannot now reargue the issue.\" (para. 24) In support of this conclusion Respondent also refers to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that, given FVG\u2019s losses, the claim of lost profits was speculative, and that, since the only lost profits granted by the Tribunal were the NPV of existing real estate leases, there was no need to amortize Claimant\u2019s lost investment in order to avoid double counting. (para. 25)\n\n17.\n\nRespondent alleges the use of new material as a basis for the Request to supplement the Award. According to Respondent, \"Claimant presents new evidence and proposes three distinct methodologies resulting in additional damages of $14,199,805, $5,894,578 or $3,086,856. In essence, Claimant is asking the Tribunal to revise its reasoning and increase the damages awarded.\" (para. 26) Claimant adds that the Tribunal would exceed its powers if it were to rule \"on matters not pleaded by the parties and material not in the record before it closed.\" (para. 28)\n\n18.\n\nRespondent agrees with Claimant that to supplement an ICSID award is discretionary but disagrees on Claimant\u2019s proposed application of Article 49(2). According to Respondent, \"When a Tribunal declines either explicitly or implicitly to adopt a party\u2019s argument, it does not thereby open the door to Article 49(2) supplementation.\" (para. 29) In the view of Respondent, \"Even if [it] succeeds in showing that the Tribunal failed to answer the alleged question -which it has not, this alone would be insufficient to support a supplemental decision, *absent proof* that the Tribunal simply failed to address *quantum*. No such proof exists in this case as it is clear that the Tribunal paid extraordinary attention to quantum in the Award. (para. 29, emphasis in the original)\n\n19.\n\nAs to the rectification requested, Respondent disputes that the Tribunal had made any clerical, arithmetical or similar error that is susceptible of rectification. Respondent refers to the fact that Claimant invited the Tribunal to use the model designed by Claimant\u2019s expert and, therefore, \"Claimant can hardly complain now that the Tribunal made an erroneous calculation.\" (para. 34) Respondent adds: \"A reasonable estimate of such costs [the costs associated with revenues] produces numbers in the neighborhood reached by the Tribunal. The key point, however, is that the purpose of a rectification proceeding is not to reproduce accurately every cell of an Excel model. The Tribunal had available to it the tools it needed and cannot now be said to have engaged in a mathematical error.\" (para. 34)\n\n20.\n\nOn the second alleged error, Respondent argues that it is in fact the result of Claimant\u2019s own legal theory that rents collected post- *Lesivo* constituted mitigation of damages and applied to everything. Respondent notes that Claimant\u2019s expert did not discount the rental income received from 2007 to 2010; the expert \"simply added the rents collected and deducted the sum from the total damages claimed, which were computed as of December 2006.\" (para. 35). Respondent also points out that counsel for Claimant maintained this position in closing argument.\n\n21.\n\nRespondent disputes the correctness of the amount of NPV put forward by Claimant, and adds: \"Significantly, the very fact that arguments about these new calculations exist should put an end to any rectification request.\" (para. 36).\n\n22.\n\nRespondent requests that the Tribunal \"(A) deny Claimants [sic] Request in its entirety; and (B) order the Claimants [sic] to assume all fees and costs of the Republic\u2019s legal representation and other costs incurred by the Republic in connection with such proceeding.\" (para. 37)\n\n***3. Reply***\n--------------\n\n23.\n\nClaimant disagrees with Respondent that the Request seeks substantive review or reconsideration of questions decided by the Tribunal. Claimant argues that Article 49(2) allows the Tribunal to decide any question it omitted to decide in the Award, and refers to Professor Schreuer\u2019s explanation that an inadvertently omitted question must concern \"an issue that affects the Award and is of sufficient importance to justify the procedure leading to a supplemental decision.\"1 In the view of Claimant the Tribunal omitted inadvertently a question in the calculation of damages which, if decided in its favor, would substantially increase the damages awarded. It follows, according to Claimant, within the proper scope of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention. Claimant finds no support under Article 49(2) or in the jurisprudence for Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal is not obligated to decide a material omitted question relating to the calculation of damages unless the Award is completely silent on the amount of damages awarded.\n\nC. H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, 853 (2nd edition, 2009).\n\n24.\n\nClaimant also disputes that the Tribunal addressed implicitly Claimant\u2019s request that its sunk investment costs be updated to the date of breach by a reasonable rate of return. Claimant observes that it is undisputed that there is no mention in the Award of such request despite the prominence of this issue in the parties\u2019 briefing. This leads Claimant to believe that it was an inadvertent omission by the Tribunal. Claimant points out that the Award explicitly states that Claimant should not recover a portion of its sunk investment costs, and argues that \"had the Tribunal decided that these sunk costs are not compensable because they represent the actual negative rate of return on Claimant\u2019s investment [as argued by Respondent], it would have said so in the Award rather than expressly denying recovery of these costs on entirely different grounds.\" (para. 11)\n\n25.\n\nClaimant refers to the expert opinion of Respondent\u2019s expert in support of its argument that, \"if sunk investment costs are awarded, those investments *must* be \u2018brought forward to the date of [breach] at a rate equal to the theoretical return these investments would have had in the absence of the breach\u2019\" (Rebuttal Report of P. Spiller, para. 30, quoted in para. 13 of the Reply). Claimant, relying on the same opinion, points out that this is the case whether or not the company concerned has a history of profitability.\n\n26.\n\nClaimant also refers to the Respondent\u2019s expert recommendation that a compensation award measured by actual investment should be adjusted by business risk. Claimant observes that the Tribunal determined that Claimant should not recover certain investment costs because these costs represented risks that the Claimant took by investing in Guatemala. Hence Claimant concludes that, \"while the Tribunal by all appearances adopted Dr. Spiller\u2019s actual investment NCC methodology with regard to adjusting Claimant\u2019s compensation downward by $8.5 million to take into account business risks Claimant had voluntarily assumed, it inadvertently omitted in the Award the other key element of the methodology, which requires that an award of sunk investment costs, after adjustment for risks, include \u2018a return equal to the opportunity cost of capital\u2019 (Rebuttal Report of P. Spiller, para 34). The Tribunal should correct this omission by granting Claimant\u2019s Request and supplementing the Award.\" (para. 18)\n\n27.\n\nClaimant rebuts Respondent\u2019s argument that the Request is based on new material and explains that \"the rate of return analysis of Claimant\u2019s awarded sunk costs presented in Annex I of Claimant\u2019s Request is completely supported by Respondent\u2019s own expert and entirely consistent with the record and the Tribunal findings. It is not \u2018new evidence\u2019, and has been presented by Claimant simply to assist the Tribunal in its consideration of Claimant\u2019s Request for supplementation.\" (para. 20)\n\n28.\n\nClaimant then addresses Respondent\u2019s arguments on rectification of the Award. Claimant finds that Respondent offers little substance in its response and effectively concedes the error in its Observations. Claimant rejects Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal possibly made some cost deductions associated with the real estate lease revenue to arrive at the amount set forth in the Award. According to Claimant, \"the Award sets forth on a step-by-step basis how the Tribunal proceeded from Mr. Thompson\u2019s NPV calculation to the Tribunal\u2019s NPV calculation, and the only input change from Mr. Thompson\u2019s calculation that the Tribunal discussed and adapted is the change from a 12.9% discount rate to a 17.36% rate. There is no explicit or implicit suggestion in the Award that the Tribunal made other, unspecified adjustments to Mr. Thompson\u2019s calculation which cause the NPV value to drop from $6,818,865 to $4,121,281.62.\" (para. 12)\n\n29.\n\nAs to the valuation of the set-off, Claimant acknowledges that, as pointed out by Respondent, Mr. Thompson did not discount the set-off in his report. This notwithstanding, Claimant considers that the failure of the Award to discount FVG\u2019s post- *Lesivo* rental income is a computational error that should be rectified. Claimant maintains that Respondent has not disputed that, \"in order to determine the proper net amount owed by Respondent for FVG\u2019s existing leases, it is necessary that the set-off amount of rents paid to FVG since *Lesivo* be discounted at the same rate as FVG\u2019s leases. Respondent also does not dispute that the Award currently does not do this [...] Furthermore, Respondent does not dispute that, if this computational error is not corrected by the Tribunal, it could lead to the absurd result of Claimant receiving *nothing* for (and Respondent potentially *profiting* from) this item of damages.\" (para. 30, emphasis in the original). Claimant concludes by saying that: \"Article 49(2) does not afford the Tribunal discretion to tolerate an undisputed computational error in its damages calculation simply because Claimant\u2019s expert made a similar error.\" (para. 31)\n\n30.\n\nClaimant confirms its relief request and adds that the Tribunal award Claimant its costs, attorneys\u2019 fees and administrative expenses incurred in prosecuting its Request. (para. 32)\n\n***4. Rejoinder***\n------------------\n\n31.\n\nRespondent argues that the Request is based on the erroneous assumption that the Tribunal awarded Claimant sunk investment costs and sought to place Claimant in the same position as if the investment had never been made. According to Respondent, Claimant is trying to reformulate the compensation standard applied by the Tribunal. Respondent affirms that: \"The Tribunal listened to what Dr. Spiller said and awarded Claimant full reparation at the same time of the *Lesivo*, because that is when the breach of the Treaty obligation attributable to Guatemala occurred. Thus, the Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to address whether FVG\u2019s sunk investment costs should be adjusted to the date of the *Lesivo* was *not* an inadvertent omission.\" (para. 6, emphasis in the original) Furthermore, Respondent argues that, if the Tribunal had wanted to place Claimant \"in a position as if the investment had never been made\", Claimant would not have been awarded damages on account of real estate leases.\n\n32.\n\nAs to the NPV calculation, Respondent disputes that it conceded that the Tribunal erred as affirmed in Claimant\u2019s Observations and makes a calculation based on certain assumptions that result in an amount close to the amount calculated by the Tribunal.\n\n33.\n\nRespondent also disputes that the Tribunal committed a mathematical error by failing to discount FVG\u2019s post- *Lesivo* rental income. Respondent recalls that Mr. Thompson\u2019s [Claimant\u2019s expert] did not discount *post-Lesivo* rental and adds \"...when it is clear that the Tribunal used Mr. Thompson\u2019s analysis, and that Claimant now argues that such analysis was erroneous, there is no reason to fault the Tribunal for not discounting rents actually received when calculating mitigation damages.Article 49(2) should not be used by a party to change the methodology proposed by the Claimant for mitigation of damages.\" (para. 22)\n\n34.\n\nRespondent confirms its request for relief.\n\n***5. Replies to the Tribunal\u2019s Questions***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nIn their replies to the questions posed by the Tribunal the parties agree, although for different reasons: (a) that no weight should be given by the Tribunal to the fact that funds from real estate rents have been accumulating in the hands of Claimant since September 2006 and may have generated further income for the Claimant; and (b) that, in the consideration by the Tribunal of discounting the real estate rents, no weight should be given to the decision of the Tribunal to award compound interest on damages as from September 2006.\n\n**III. Considerations of the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nAt the outset it will be useful to reproduce Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n\"The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award. Its decision shall become part of the award and shall be notified to the parties in the same manner as the award. The periods of time provided for under paragraph (2) of Article 51 and paragraph (2) of Article 52 shall run from the date on which the decision was rendered.\"\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider the issue of the new evidence submitted by Claimant with its reply to the Tribunal\u2019s questions followed by the requests to supplement the Award and rectify it.\n\n***1. The Issue of New Evidence***\n----------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that congruent with the limited scope of a rectification request under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention no new evidence should be filed by the parties at such stage of the proceedings. In the instant case, in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, no new evidence was necessary to reply to its questions and it, therefore, upholds the objection of Respondent. The new evidence has been ignored in the deliberations of the Tribunal.\n\n***2. Supplementation***\n------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the parties are in agreement that the Tribunal has discretion as to whether or not to supplement an award under the terms of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention. The term \"may\" leaves no doubt that this is the case when the Tribunal has omitted to decide a question submitted to it. Hence the first issue to be addressed by the Tribunal is whether it omitted to decide in the Award a question submitted by Claimant. The parties disagree in this respect. Claimant alleges that the Tribunal omitted to deal with the question of discounting the sunk costs up to the date of *Lesivo*, Respondent considers that this matter was implicitly covered in the Tribunal\u2019s considerations underlying the damages calculation.\n\n40.\n\nThe parties\u2019 disagreement turns on what is a question under the Convention. The Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \"question\" as follows: \"A subject or point of investigation, examination or debate; theme or inquiry; problem; matter to be inquired into.\" In the instant case the problem faced by the Tribunal was \"how to assess the compensation on account of a measure which has an injurious effect, falling short of expropriation on assets which continue in possession of Claimant.\" (Award, para. 260)\n\n41.\n\nThere is no precise formula to determine damages on account of the infringement of the fair and equitable standard. Here, the Tribunal\u2019s damages analysis is additionally influenced by its decision to require \"Claimant, on the full and effective payment of the prescribed compensation by Respondent, to transfer to Respondent or its nominee all of the Claimant\u2019s shares in FVG.\" (Award para 265). This remedy, combined with the speculative nature of Claimant\u2019s claim of lost profits, led the Tribunal to award Claimant reparations based on \"certain known quantities related to the amount invested and the actual rents received from leases of the real estate\" that \"have the additional merit of arguably representing benefits which may be considered to accrue to Respondent on payment of the amount awarded to Claimant.\" (Award para 269.) In the Tribunal\u2019s estimation, this damages framework provides compensation for Guatemala\u2019s CAFTA breach, reflects the transfer of ownership that will take place when Guatemala makes payment of the prescribed compensation, and takes account of the fact that Claimant\u2019s investment was losing money for reasons independent of *Lesivo*.\n\n42.\n\nIn propounding an automatic application of various elements of a financial formula to Claimant\u2019s investment amount, the Request advances an analysis that is detached from reality. The Tribunal considers that to discount the investment made up to the date of *Lesivo* irrespective of the performance of the entity concerned would produce in the circumstances of this case an unfair and inequitable result. The assets invested overall generated losses not gains up to *Lesivo*. As the Tribunal noted (referring to the years of operation pre- *Lesivo*): \"the funds invested by Claimant to cover these losses represent the risks Claimant took when investing in Guatemala and cannot be attributed to any action of Guatemala contrary to CAFTA\" (Award, para 272; see also paras 274, 277, 278). To ignore this fact and discount sunk costs on the basis of what the return would be on an alternative investment is a theoretical exercise. Such exercise may perhaps be justified in cases where there is no record of the performance of the investment. In the instant case that record exists. The Tribunal would have engaged in contradiction if, after recognizing that the investment had made losses, it would have added to that investment a theoretical rate of return. To conclude, the Tribunal considers that in its calculation of compensation on account of the breach of the fair and equitable standard it dealt with all questions needed to reach its decision. In the view of the Tribunal the request to supplement the Award has no merit.\n\n***3. Rectification***\n----------------------\n\n*a) NPV Calculation*\n--------------------\n\n43.\n\nIn the Award the Tribunal did its own assessment of the appropriate discount rate to calculate the NPV of existing leases and noted the disagreement of the parties in this respect (Award, paras. 271 and ff). The Tribunal reached the conclusion that a discount rate of 17.36% would be appropriate. It is evident that the Tribunal misapplied the discount rate. The Tribunal has recalculated the NPV of the income streams of leased real estate set forth in Expert Thompson\u2019s Rebuttal Report2 using the 17.36% discount rate. The results are identical to those in the table in paragraph 18 of the Request. Paragraphs 277 and 283(2) of the Award shall be rectified accordingly. The correct amount awarded to Claimant on account of the real estate leases is $5,591,469.30.\n\nRebuttal Report of L. Thompson, Ex 1.\n\n*b) Discount of Actual Lease Rents*\n-----------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nRespondent has noted and Claimant has recognized that in its pleadings Claimant did not discount the income FVG received post- *Lesivo* from leased real estate. It will be useful to reproduce here the relevant parts of Claimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits and of Expert Thompson\u2019s Rebuttal Report. The Reply states:\n\n\"562. As a result, it was fortunate for Respondent that, because of these factors, these lessees and tenants did not stop paying rent to FVG and FVG, therefore, has been able to mitigate its damages in the amount of $2,704,310, which Mr. Thompson has deducted from *Claimant\u2019s total damage claim*.\n\n563. *Deduction of FVG\u2019s mitigation income* from Claimant\u2019s total damage claim yields of total revised net damages claim of $63,778,212.1286.\" (Emphasis added by the Tribunal)\n\nExpert Thompson\u2019s Rebuttal Report submitted with the Reply on the Merits states:\n\n\"42. Although FVG\u2019s railway operations rapidly declined and eventually ceased after the Lesivo Declaration, FVG has continued to collect income from four long-term right-of-way easement agreements and one long-term lease (COBIGUA) and other short-term rental activities. *This mitigation income should rightly be deducted from the value of the claim*.\n\n43. Table Seven shows the lease and easement income that FVG has received from 2007 through the end of 2010. *The total amount of income**is US$2,704,310. Deduction of this amount from the revised damages* claim yields a total revised net damages claim of US$63,778,212, as shown in Table Eight **.\" (** Emphasis added by the Tribunal )\n\n45.\n\nThis notwithstanding it is Claimant\u2019s view that the Tribunal committed an error by not discounting the income received by FVG post- *Lesivo* at the same discount rate that it discounted the stream of that income from the end of the railway concession to 2006. Claimant has argued that by \"discounting FVG\u2019s projected real estate income over the remaining term of the Usufruct, but not similarly discounting the amount that it is to be deducted from this amount, the Tribunal has created an apples-to-oranges calculation, where the plus side of the equation has been valued as of the date of *Lesivo* (August 25, 2006), while the set-off amount - the total actual rental payments received to date - have been valued as of the respective dates the payments were received by FVG from September 2006 to the present.\" (Reply, para. 22)\n\n46.\n\nThe power of the Tribunal to rectify the Award is limited. The threshold question is whether the rectification requested falls within the parameters of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention. The parties disagree on whether the request concerns a pure mathematical error or a change of methodological approach.\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal first observes that Claimant benefited from expert advice in the approach it took to claim and quantify damages. The Tribunal accepted that approach to the extent that concerns us here. With hindsight Claimant has realized that the approach that informed its pleadings had certain unfavorable mathematical implications and has asked the Tribunal to correct them. The Tribunal considers that to do so would exceed the terms of its powers under Article 49(2). It was not for the Tribunal to go beyond what Claimant pleaded prior to the Award and consider the mathematical implications of Claimant\u2019s approach when Claimant itself did not take them into account. In these circumstances to rectify the Award as requested is not just a simple mathematical operation, it implies the Tribunal accepting a change of pleading in the context of a rectification request. This is beyond the power of the Tribunal under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n48.\n\nClaimant has also argued that \"if there is no discounting and the Award is not paid by Respondent until 2015, then the absurd result will obtain that Claimant will likely *owe* Respondent money for this item of damage, as Claimant\u2019s share of FVG\u2019s actual non-discounted real estate income since the date of *Lesivo* will by then likely *exceed* Claimant\u2019s share of the NPV of FVG\u2019s lost future real estate income. The Tribunal certainly could not have intended such an incongruous result, where Respondent could potentially *profit from* Claimant\u2019s mitigation of its damages.\" (Request, para. 24. Emphasis in the original)\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Claimant in its Reply and during oral hearings pleaded the application of rental income to mitigation of *all* damages. It is not absurd that the mitigation of damages may exceed one of the damages items. Claimant will not owe Respondent money. As Claimant has pleaded, the amount of post- *Lesivo* income will be deducted from the total damages awarded by the Tribunal.\n\n50.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal considers that the Request does not concern rectification of a computational error but involves a change of approach by Claimant in respect of the treatment of the payments received post- *Lesivo* outside the scope of the terms of Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**III. Costs**\n--------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal has found merit in part of the Request. None of the parties has fully prevailed. Therefore, each party shall bear the costs and expenses of their respective counsel, and half of the Tribunal fees and expenses and of the administrative expenses of ICSID.\n\n**IV. Decision**\n----------------\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal decides:\n\n1. To uphold the objection to the new evidence submitted by Claimant with its reply to the Tribunal\u2019s questions.\n\n2. To reject the Supplementation Request and the Rectification Request as it relates to \"Not Discounting the Actual Rents Received by FVG Since the Lesivo Resolution.\"\n\n3. To rectify the Award as follows:\n\na) the amounts in line 7 of para. 277 shall be deleted and replaced by \"$6,818,865\" and \"$5,591,469.30\" respectively.\n\nb) The amounts in line 5 of para. 283(2) shall be deleted and replaced by \"$6,818,865\" and \"$5,591,469.30\" respectively.\n\n4. That each party shall be responsible for 50% of the administrative expenses of ICSID and of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal related to this decision.\n\n5. That each party shall be responsible for its own counsel fees and expenses."}]}
