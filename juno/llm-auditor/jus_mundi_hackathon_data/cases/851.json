SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS ORDER**\n-----------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present Order addresses an application for provisional measures in the form of security for costs submitted by the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (the \"Respondent\") on 18 October 2015 (the \"Application\"), which is opposed by Lighthouse Corporation Pty Ltd (\"Lighthouse\") and Lighthouse Corporation Ltd, IBC (\"Lighthouse IBC\") (together, the \"Claimants\" or \"Lighthouse Entities\"). In the Application, the Respondent seeks the following relief from the Tribunal:\n\na. a recommendation that the Lighthouse entities provide security for Timor-Leste\u2019s costs in the arbitration (initially for Timor-Leste's estimated costs up to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on bifucation [sic] and, in the event that the arbitration proceeds, with such security to be supplemented by a further appropriate amount);\n\nb. a recommendation that the Lighthouse entities provide such security in the form of an on-demand bank guarantee in the amount of US$201,628.49 or amount to be determined to be held by the solicitors for Timor-Leste and dealt with by demand in the event that an order of the Tribunal awarding costs to Timor-Leste remains unpaid 30 days after the date of any such order; and\n\nc. a stay of the arbitration until the Lighthouse entities comply with these recommendations.1\n\nApplication, \u00b613.\n\n2.\n\nIn his Second Witness Statement Mr. Liam Prescott gave the following additional indications about the amount of the security sought:\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s adoption of the narrow approach to jurisdiction (and the revision of my estimate) means that Timor-Leste seeks security to be provided initially in the amount of US$115,776.71 (Stage 1 [up to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on bifurcation]). Should security be recommended by the Tribunal and should the proceeding continue thereafter, Timor-Leste would apply, following the Tribunal\u2019s decision on bifurcation, to resume its application for security and at that time seek the next stage of security to reflect the Tribunal\u2019s decision.2\n\nReply, \u00b634; Second Witness Statement of Mr. Liam Prescott, \u00b645.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants request the Tribunal to deny the Application in the following terms:\n\n[T]he Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal decide that:\n\na. the Respondent\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures be rejected; and\n\nb. the Respondent pay the Claimants\u2019 costs incurred in defending the Application.3\n\nObservations, \u00b696; Rejoinder, \u00b620.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 16 December 2014, the Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID.\n\n5.\n\nIn accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Secretary-General registered the Request for Arbitration on 14 January 2015 and so notified the Parties. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible pursuant to Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n6.\n\nOn 7 August 2015, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. Its Members are Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler (Swiss), President, appointed by the co-arbitrators; Mr. Stephen Jagusch (New Zealand), appointed by the Claimants; and Professor Campbell McLachlan (New Zealand), appointed by the Respondent.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 14 August 2015, the Respondent\u2019s counsel notified the Tribunal that:\n\nour client anticipates that it will make an application for security in respect of its costs pursuant to Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Rules. Our client is conscious of the need to make such an application expeditiously.\n\n8.\n\nIn response, on 26 August 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the procedural modalities relating to such an application would be discussed during the first session of the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal provided the Parties with a draft agenda for the first session and a draft procedural order addressing the conduct of the proceedings. The Parties were invited to confer and provide comments on these drafts which they did on 29 September 2015.\n\n10.\n\nThe first session was held by teleconference on 6 October 2015. During the conference, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed procedural matters, including the timetable relating to the Respondent\u2019s forthcoming application for provisional measures. The Parties agreed to a schedule of written pleadings on such an application. They also agreed that an oral hearing would be held, possibly by teleconference or video link, on a date to be determined.\n\n11.\n\nOn 9 October 2015, the Respondent submitted the Application, including the witness statements of Ms. Kate Elizabeth Teixeira and Mr. Liam Thomas Prescott, Exhibits R-1 to R-82, and Legal Authorities RL-1 to RL-27.\n\n12.\n\nThat same day, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to submit their observations on the Application (by 6 November 2015), in accordance with the schedule agreed by the Parties.\n\n13.\n\nOn 13 October 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 concerning the procedural matters addressed during the first session. The Procedural Timetable was provided to the Parties in draft form on the same date and subsequently finalized. In particular, on 2 November 2015, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing on the Application would be held by teleconference or video link on 21 December 2015.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter of 2 November 2015, the Claimants requested an extension, until 17 November 2015 to file their observations on the Application. Upon the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent commented on 4 November 2015, informing the Tribunal that it agreed to the extension and would consent to giving the Claimants until 20 November 2015 to file their observations. In addition, the Respondent proposed that the Tribunal permit a short second round of written submissions. The Claimants responded to this proposal on the same day, opposing a further round of written submissions.\n\n15.\n\nOn 6 November 2015, the Tribunal confirmed the extended time limit of 20 November 2015 for the Claimants\u2019 observations on the Application. The Tribunal also informed the Parties that it would decide whether a short second round of written submissions would be useful after receiving the first round and would give appropriate instructions at that time.\n\n16.\n\nOn 20 November 2015, the Claimants filed their Observations on the Application, including the witness statements of Messrs. Albert Jacobs, James Podaridis, Sean Magee and Alan Fraser, Exhibits C-1 to C-32, and Legal Authorities CL-1 to CL-9 (the \"Observations\").\n\n17.\n\nOn 23 November 2015, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it had decided to allow a brief second round of written submissions. The Respondent was invited to submit a reply within ten days, and the Claimants were invited to submit a rejoinder ten days thereafter. The Tribunal limited the submissions to eight pages.\n\n18.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing on the Application would be held by teleconference and provided the Parties with the following agenda for the hearing:\n\n1. Respondent\u2019s oral argument - 20 minutes (maximum)\n\n2. Claimants\u2019 oral argument - 20 minutes (maximum)\n\n3. Tribunal\u2019s questions and parties\u2019 answers\n\n4. If it wishes, Respondent\u2019s closing argument - 5 minutes (maximum)\n\n5. If they wish, Claimants\u2019 closing argument - 5 minutes (maximum)\n\n19.\n\nOn 3 December 2015, the Respondent requested an extension until 5 December 2015 to file its reply. The Claimants did not object and the Tribunal therefore granted the Respondent\u2019s request. The Tribunal also noted that the Claimants would be granted a commensurate extension if they were to request it.\n\n20.\n\nOn 5 December 2015, the Respondent filed its Reply to the Claimants\u2019 Observations on the Application, together with the Witness Statement of Mr. Russell John Slocomb and the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Liam Thomas Prescott and Exhibits R-83 to R-100 (the \"Reply\").\n\n21.\n\nOn 8 December 2015, the Claimants complained with the Tribunal about the length of the Reply and requested an extension of time for their rejoinder. The Respondent did not agree with the Claimants\u2019 assertions, but had no objection against the extension sought. On 9 December 2015, the Tribunal confirmed that the filing date for the rejoinder was extended to 16 December 2015.\n\n22.\n\nOn 16 December 2015, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on the Respondent\u2019s Application for Provisional Measures, including the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Albert Jacobs and Exhibits C-33 to C-53 (the \"Rejoinder\").\n\n23.\n\nOn 20 December 2015, the Respondent requested that the scheduled teleconference hearing on provisional measures be postponed due to the sickness of one of its counsel. The President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that, under the circumstances, the Tribunal was inclined to grant the postponement, subject to any compelling objection by the Claimants. In response, the Claimants proposed that, rather than postpone the hearing, the Tribunal proceed to decide the Application based on the written submissions. The Respondent, in turn, objected to this proposal.\n\n24.\n\nOn 21 December 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the hearing would be rescheduled and proposed a new date for the teleconference. Based on the Parties\u2019 responses, on 23 December 2015, the Tribunal confirmed that the rescheduled hearing would be held by teleconference on 21 January 2016.\n\n25.\n\nThe hearing on the Application was held as rescheduled on 21 January 2016 by teleconference. The following persons participated in the teleconference:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **TRIBUNAL** |\n| Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler | President |\n| Mr. Stephen Jagusch | Arbitrator |\n| Prof. Campbell McLachlan | Arbitrator |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **ASSISTANT TO THE TRIBUNAL** |\n| Mr. Rahul Donde | Assistant |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **ICSID SECRETARIAT** |\n| Ms. Lindsay Gastrell | Secretary of the Tribunal |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **CLAIMANTS** |\n| Prof. Chester Brown | 7 Wentworth Selborne Chambers, Essex Court Chambers, Maxwell Chambers, University of Sydney |\n| Mr. Tony Johnson | Johnson Winter & Slattery |\n| Mr. Nicholas Briggs | Johnson Winter & Slattery |\n| Albert Jacobs | Lighthouse Corporation Pty Limited, Lighthouse Corporation Limited, IBC |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **RESPONDENT** |\n| Mr. Shane Doyle QC | Level 27 Chambers, Fifth Floor Selborne Chambers, Essex Court Chambers |\n| Mr. Jonathan Kay Hoyle | 11th Floor St James Hall Chambers |\n| Mr. Liam Prescott | DLA Piper |\n| Mr. Joel Borgeaud | DLA Piper |\n| Mr. Arndt Herrmann | DLA Piper |\n| His Excellency, Mr. Abel Guterres | Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary |\n\n26.\n\nAt the hearing, the Tribunal heard the Parties\u2019 oral arguments in accordance with the agenda provided on 23 November 2015. An audio recording was made, and a court reporter prepared a written transcript of the recording. Copies of the recording and the transcript were subsequently distributed to the Tribunal and the Parties.\n\n27.\n\nOn 28 January 2016, the Claimants sought leave to file a legal authority that had not entered the public domain until after the hearing. In response, on 1 February 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had all the necessary information to issue the decision and did not wish to receive further materials.\n\n28.\n\nBased on the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal deliberated and reached the decision set forth in Section V below.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n***A. Respondent\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal should grant the Application and order the Claimants to post security for costs in the requested amount because, based on the available evidence, it is clear that the Claimants do not have the ability or the willingness to satisfy an order for costs. According to the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 lack of assets and their history of misrepresentations and other conduct justify this relief sought.\n\n30.\n\nAddressing the applicable legal principles, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal has the power to grant the Application pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39.4 In modern ICSID cases, tribunals have accepted the principle that provisional measures contemplated by Article 37 and Rule 39 encompass contingent procedural rights such as pre-award security.5\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b620-21; Reply, \u00b62.\n\nApplication, \u00b620, citing RL-14, *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v.

However, according to the Respondent, without an order for security for costs, \"any such monetary award will be rendered entirely futile and its enforcement entirely moot\".8\n\nApplication, \u00b623.\n\nApplication, \u00b677;\n\nApplication, \u00b687; Reply, \u00b633.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent recognizes that provisional measures in the ICSID system are an \"exceptional remedy\" and that cases in which security for costs will be recommended must be \"compelling\".9 To show that exceptional circumstances exist, an applicant must establish that (i) the measure sought is necessary, meaning it is required to prevent \"irreparable harm\"; and (ii) the granting of the measure is urgent and must be dealt with before the final award.10 It must also show that its underlying case is a \"plausible, seriously arguable\" one.11 In making a determination, tribunals focus on whether the facts of each particular case justify an exceptional remedy of pre-award security.12\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b626, 70; Reply, \u00b63; Tr. 28:15-29:2.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b627-30, citing *inter alia* RL-6, *Burlington Resources Inc. and others v.

Mr. Jacobs is the sole director of both companies. While there is no evidence as to who owns Lighthouse IBC, it is known that Mr. Jacobs is its sole director. Thus, \"for current purposes, the Claimants are Mr Jacobs and Mr Jacobs is the Claimants\".22\n\n(i) Mr. Jacobs has a history of many corporate dealings, involving companies with nominal share capital and no assets, mostly in the catering industry.23 At least four of the companies he controlled have been deregistered by the corporate regulator for failing to submit required reporting.24 Mr. Jacobs also controls companies that have \"materially misstated their experience, financial standing and capacity\".25 Mr. Jacobs has personally held himself out to hold certain qualifications and affiliations in statements that have proven false.26 Indeed, he admits to misrepresenting his qualifications in marketing material concerning the Claimants\u2019 alleged standing as oil traders.27\n\n(iii) Mr. Jacobs created the Lighthouse Entities in 2008 and 2009, apparently for the purpose of dealing with Timor-Leste.28 In these dealings, particularly in promotional materials and correspondence, the Claimants (and Mr. Jacobs) made material misrepresentations about their experience, finances and capacity. These included statements that:\n\n\u2022 Lighthouse had three decades of professional experience serving blue chip corporations and governments, when in fact it was not incorporated until 2008;29\n\n\u2022 the \"Lighthouse Group\" had annual turnover of more than USD 2 billion, which the Claimants have admitted to be false;30\n\n\u2022 Lighthouse had \"representative offices\" worldwide, whereas they have none;31\n\n\u2022 Lighthouse IBC was a subsidiary of Seaways NV, a company with significant fuel infrastructure projects, which Mr. Jacobs now denies ever stating;32\n\n\u2022 Lighthouse had vast experience in the energy sector, but there is no record of Lighthouse participating in any commercial energy project or the sale/distribution of energy;33\n\n\u2022 Lighthouse had affiliations and relationships with major energy companies, yet there is no evidence of any of the purported relationships; the \"certificates\" from BP and Petronas that Mr. Jacobs provided with his Witness Statement are unconvincing and insufficient;34 and\n\n\u2022 Lighthouse had an exclusive agency agreement with Cummins to supply Cummins generators in Timor-Leste, when in fact Lighthouse has never been a Cummins distributor, as evidenced by the witness statements of Cummins executives.35\n\n(iv) Mr. Jacobs has continued to make statements in this arbitration that are either misleading or false, including his purported evidence regarding Cummins, AES Energy Corporation and DonOilGaz.36\n\n(v) The Lighthouse Entities \"have been structured to be judgement-proof\".37 In particular, Mr. Jacobs and Lighthouse Capital are not parties to this arbitration and there could be no recourse against them in enforcing a costs award.38 Further, Lighthouse is the trustee of Jacobs Family Trust (\"JFT\"), meaning that even if it did have assets, they would be held in trust for JFT and its beneficiaries, which are not party to this arbitration either.39\n\n(vi) Mr. Jacobs \"has in the past taken steps to prevent the satisfaction or to remove assets from [those] available to satisfy court judgment\", in particular in relation to the insolvency of Lighthouse Solutions Pty Ltd.40 Indeed, he \"has taken steps to put assets out of the Claimants\u2019 name in connection with these proceedings\".41\n\nAlthough the Tribunal has carefully considered each allegation, they need not be repeated here.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b69.c, 50, citing R-13, International Business Companies Act (Cap 100A); National Property Ownership Report (Lighthouse, Lighthouse IBC), 22 July 2015.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b650-63; Reply, \u00b6\u00b68-9, 33.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b651-55; Reply, \u00b623.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b662-63, R-32, Printouts of websites and annual reports (Mr James Podaridis), 29 September 2015; R-33, Printouts of websites and Supreme Court of Victoria decision (Mr Emmanuel Panourakis), 29 September 2015.\n\nApplication, \u00b675.d, citing R-14, Current and historical company extract (Lighthouse), 4 September 2015; R-19, Current and historical company extract (Lighthouse Capital), 4 September 2015.\n\nReply, \u00b630.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b637-45, 80.\n\nApplication, \u00b643 (Lighthouse Solutions Pty Ltd, Lighthouse Caf\u00e9 Australia Pty Ltd, Citicapital Corporation Pty Ltd and Trendline Images Pty Ltd).\n\nApplication, \u00b684.b.

St. Lucia:*\n\nThe predominant objective of provisional measures is to protect the integrity of the proceedings. This integrity comprises both substantive and procedural rights.... The right to seek reimbursement of one\u2019s costs in the case of a favourable award likewise constitutes a procedural right in that sense. Hence, there has to be an effective mechanism for protecting this right in order to render it meaningful.49\n\nApplication, \u00b69.d, 88-90; Reply, \u00b633.\n\nRL-23, *RSM Production v. Saint Lucia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/20, Decision on Saint Lucia's Request for Security for Costs dated 13 August 2014, \u00b669.\n\n39.\n\nWith respect to the element of urgency, the Respondent asserts that the finances of Timor-Leste would suffer great damage if it were to expend significant sums in this arbitration without any real prospect of enforcing its right to seek reimbursement. Critically, \"[t]hat damage is incurred now and will be irreparable where there is no ability to recover the expenditure later\".50 The Respondent notes that it has treated this matter as urgent from the outset, raising its concerns as soon as reasonably practicable following the registration of the Request for Arbitration.51\n\nApplication, \u00b693.\n\nApplication, \u00b692.\n\n40.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that it has met the requirement of showing that its underlying case is seriously arguable or plausible. In this context, during the hearing, the Respondent described its \"core complaint\" as follows:\n\nRespondent... was induced to enter into the contracts by conduct in which the Claimants presented themselves as having a gravitas, a history, an experience, the size and connections with standing in the oil production and supply business, which they simply didn\u2019t have and which, indeed, they don\u2019t now have.52\n\nTr. 14:4-10.\n\n41.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the facts and objective evidence presented in its submissions show that these allegations are serious and certainly meet the standard of plausibility. Nevertheless, no prejudgment of the case is required to determine that security for costs is justified in this case; the need is demonstrated by the current factual circumstances.53\n\nReply, \u00b632.\n\n42.\n\nFinally, the Respondent addresses the principle that a tribunal must be satisfied that there is at least a *prima facie* basis of jurisdiction in order to order provisional measures. Although the Respondent raises a number of jurisdictional objections, it suggests that the registration of the Request for Arbitration by the ICSID Secretary-General \"provides a proper and sufficient basis for the Tribunal to order provisional measures\", irrespective of its eventual decision on the jurisdictional objections.54\n\nApplication, \u00b696.\n\n***B. Claimants\u2019 Position***\n----------------------------\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Application is \"speculative, unfounded and should be rejected\", and that the Respondent should be ordered to cover the costs which the Claimants incurred in defending it.55 According to the Claimants, a request for provisional measures can be granted only in the most extreme cases, and the Respondent has clearly failed to establish that this is such a case. In any event, the Respondent\u2019s allegations are baseless; the Claimants are not impecunious and have sufficient assets to satisfy an award of costs in this arbitration.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b693, 96; Rejoinder, \u00b620.\n\n44.\n\nRegarding the legal standard, the Claimants stress that provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 are extraordinary measures that should be recommended only in limited circumstances, as acknowledged by the Respondent.56 For the Claimants, two elements must be present: (i) the measure must be \"necessary to avoid imminent and irreparable harm\" and (ii) there is urgency.57\n\nObservations, Section B; Rejoinder, \u00b618.\n\nObservations, \u00b69, quoting CL-1, *Burimi SRL and Eagle Games v. Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/18, Procedural Order No 2 dated 3 May 2012, \u00b634.\n\n45.\n\nWith respect to pre-award security as a provisional measure, the Claimants highlight that security for costs has been ordered in only one ICSID case, *RSM v. St. Lucia,* and by only a majority of the tribunal.58 While the Claimants acknowledge that \"a small number of ICSID tribunals\" have recognized their power to order pre-award security, the Claimants argue that \"these decisions have been issued against a background of ICSID practice which either denied the existence, or was doubtful as to the existence, of a power to order security for costs\".59 The Claimants point to a number of cases that have rejected requests for security. Reviewing past decisions on the issue of security for costs, the Claimants extract a number of considerations which they find relevant to the Application, including *inter alia:*\n\n(i) Security for costs \"will not be granted in the ordinary course of ICSID arbitration\", but only in \"the most extreme case\";60\n\n(ii) A tribunal should avoid prejudging how it might use its discretion in allocating costs;61\n\n(iii) The Respondents\u2019 interests must be balanced against the Claimants\u2019 right to access to justice, and there is no requirement in the ICSID system that an investor demonstrate its solvency;62\n\n(iv) The absence of assets alone does not warrant an order for security; there must be a \"material and serious risk that a costs award would not be complied with\", shown for instance by an investor\u2019s past failures to satisfy orders on costs in other proceedings;63\n\n(v) A tribunal must be convinced that a claimant\u2019s conduct \"threatens the integrity of the proceedings, that their conduct amounts to abuse, or that it is being pursued in bad faith\";64 and\n\n(vi) Third-party funding of a claim \"may heighten any concern that the Claimants may not comply with a costs award, but ICSID practice on this issue is inconsistent\".65\n\nObservations, \u00b610\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b610-15, citing CL-4 Paul Friedland, \"Provisional Measures and ICSID Arbitration\" (1986) 2 *Arbitration International* 335, 344-345, 347-348 (discussing the unpublished decision *Atlantic Triton Company Ltd v.

See Tr. 34:7-16.\n\nObservations, \u00b627.i.\n\n46.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the Claimants contend that \"the facts and circumstances of the present case simply do not justify an order for security\".66 The Claimants deny the Respondent\u2019s allegations regarding the Claimants\u2019 lack of assets and Mr. Jacobs\u2019 misrepresentations, arguing, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(i) The Claimants are not impecunious or without substance. Mr. Jacobs owns a 10% interest in Lighthouse DonOilGaz (\"Lighthouse Don\") in trust on behalf of Lighthouse IBC.67 Lighthouse Don has substantial assets, namely 85% of the shares in JugGeo (held in trust for Lighthouse Don), which has 12 subsoil licences to areas in Russia with proven commercially recoverable hydrocarbon reserves (three licences held in trust for Lighthouse Don and nine in the process of being transferred to it).68 Based on the valuation of an independent expert, Lighthouse IBC\u2019s 10% stake in Lighthouse can be valued at USD 784,300,000.69\n\n(ii) The Claimants currently have business premises in Melbourne and, consistent with the information on the Lighthouse website, have a \"development and research address\" on the Monash University Campus.70 The address of \"legal chambers\" indicated on the website was previously the address of a barrister who acted as General Counsel for the Claimants.71 Indeed, Timor-Leste\u2019s Ambassador to Australia, Abel Guterres, attended a meeting at that location, as well as at the Claimants\u2019 previous Melbourne address.72\n\n(iii) The Respondent\u2019s allegations in respect of the Claimants\u2019 dealings with and statements to Timor-Leste are baseless. In particular:\n\n\u2022 The statement in the 2010 brochure indicating that Lighthouse has three decades of experience \"is a reference to the experience of Lighthouse\u2019s close business partner, Seaways\" and was included at the behest of Ambassador Guterres, who told Mr. Jacobs to highlight the experience of Lighthouse\u2019s conjunctive associations;73\n\n\u2022 Mr. Jacobs and the Claimants do in fact have significant experience in the fuel supply business. For example, from 1999 to 2008, Mr. Jacobs worked for Seaways, NV, which \"is predominately a trader of petroleum and hydrocarbon products\", and he later established AES Energy Corporation Pty Ltd. Further, the Claimants have entered into a joint venture and trade agreement with Kulla Exim, which operates an oil refinery in Kosovo and provides other fuel-related services;74\n\n\u2022 The Claimants concede that the brochure produced in December 2010 contained an incorrect statement that Lighthouse Group\u2019s annual turnover was USD 2 billion, but the Claimants did not intend that version of the brochure to be provided to the Respondent; it was sent in error by Mr. Sean Magee of Zebra Fuels without the knowledge of Mr. Jacobs or the Claimants;75\n\n\u2022 The identification of \"representative offices\" around the world refers to the Claimants\u2019 network of agents;76\n\n\u2022 The Claimants\u2019 representations that they have affiliations or relationships with major energy companies are true, as shown by the fact that they are \"approved contractual counterparties with British Petroleum and Petronas\u2019s distribution company\";77\n\n\u2022 Mr. Jacobs himself has never represented that Lighthouse IBC was a subsidiary of Seaways NV, and when that statement was made in a letter from Mr. Magee to the Prime Minister of Timor-Leste, Mr. Jacobs made clear that it was incorrect;78 and\n\n\u2022 The Cummins Commercial Trading Supply Application and Terms of Trading Agreement was properly concluded on 21 October 2010 between the Claimants and Cummins South Pacific after a series of meetings and negotiations between Mr. Jacobs and Cummins from September to October 2010.79\n\n(iv) The \"Respondent is ignorant of the true story of Lighthouse Solutions Pty Ltd\" and therefore makes an unfounded allegation that Mr. Jacobs attempted to avoid a judgment against the company.80 In reality, the judgment debt, which arose out of \"proceedings that can only have been commenced in error\", was for only AUD 2,048.81 Further, the transfer of assets to which Respondent refers had nothing to do with the judgment and was concluded before Mr. Jacobs was served with the relevant demand letter.82\n\nObservations, \u00b628.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b691-92; First Witness Statement of Mr. Jacobs, \u00b640.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b68, citing C-52, Letter from Vladimir D'Jamirze (Lighthouse DonOilGaz), 15 December 2015.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b66-10; C-0037, Professor Eduard Sianisyan, \"Value Assessment of Fossil Minerals of Subsoil Area of the Rostov Region (Hydrocarbon Crude)\" dated 14 December 2015.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b646-47; \u00b6Rejoinder, \u00b616.\n\nObservations, \u00b646.c.\n\nObservations, \u00b646.b and c.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b639-43; First Witness Statement of Mr. Jacobs, \u00b6\u00b667-71.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b631-36; First Witness Statement of Mr. Jacobs, \u00b6\u00b620-24.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b660-66; Witness Statement of Mr. Magee, \u00b6\u00b629-30.\n\nObservations, \u00b647; First Witness Statement of Mr. Jacobs, \u00b6\u00b635-36.\n\nObservations, \u00b645, First Witness Statement of Mr. Jacobs, \u00b639; C-2, Letter from BP Singapore Pte.

In addition, their claim is not being financed by a third-party funder.85\n\nObservations, \u00b694.a.\n\nObservations, \u00b694.b.\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent has failed to put forward convincing evidence of threat to the integrity of the proceedings or of abuse or bad faith. Rather, the Claimants view the Application as one that \"relies in large part on speculation, inference, and unfounded allegations of fraud\".86\n\nObservations, \u00b694.c.\n\n50.\n\nIn any event, according to the Claimants, the Application is speculative, as it presumes that the Respondent will prevail on the merits (which is far from assured given the Claimants\u2019 substantial claim), and that the Tribunal will decide to order costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.87\n\nObservations, \u00b64.\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n***A. Preliminary matters***\n----------------------------\n\n51.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal emphasizes that this decision is made on the basis of the Tribunal's understanding of the record as it presently stands. Nothing contained herein shall pre-empt any later finding of fact or conclusion of law. Further, the Tribunal\u2019s decision could be revisited if relevant circumstances were to change.\n\n52.\n\nAs a further preliminary matter, it is undisputed that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to rule on the present request, even though the Respondent has stated that it intends to challenge the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Indeed, it is generally accepted that an ICSID tribunal has jurisdiction to rule on provisional measures if there is a *prima facie* basis for jurisdiction. In this case, this basis is provided by the presence of an ICSID arbitration clause in Article 18(2) of the Lighthouse Energy Standard Terms and Conditions Applying to the Sale of Goods (October 2010)88 referenced in the Fuel Supply Agreement and by the registration of the case by the ICSID Secretary-General.\n\nExhibit 5 to the Request for Arbitration.\n\n***B. Legal Framework***\n------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s power to grant security for costs as a provisional measure is undisputed. This power stems from Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39, which read as follows:\n\n**Article 47**\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n**Rule 39**\n\n**Provisional Measures**\n\n(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n[...]\n\n54.\n\nOn the basis of these provisions and more particularly of ICSID Arbitration Rule 39, an application for provisional measures must specify \"the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\" ICSID tribunals have interpreted these requirements to mean that provisional measures must (i) serve to protect certain rights of the applicant, (ii) be necessary, which implies the existence of a risk of irreparable or substantial harm; and (iii) be urgent.89\n\nSee, for instance, RL-20, *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Procedural Order No. 9, 6 September 2005, \u00b638; RL-6, *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1, 29 June 2009, \u00b651.\n\n55.\n\nICSID jurisprudence also accepts that the applicant must establish the facts underlying these requirements with sufficient likelihood, without having to prove them.\n\n***C. Discussion***\n-------------------\n\n**(i) Rights requiring preservation**\n-------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe first requirement for provisional measures is that the latter seek to preserve rights of the applicant. These rights can be substantive or procedural in nature and need not necessarily exist at the time of the request. Indeed, the application may well serve to protect contingent rights.90\n\nSee, for instance, RL-23, *Rachel S. Grynberg, RSM Production Corporation and others v. Republic of Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Decision on Respondent's Application for Security for Costs dated 14 October 2010, \u00b65; RL-10, *EuroGas Inc and Belmont Resources Inc v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/14, Decision on Provisional Measures dated 23 June 2015, \u00b6\u00b6119-123; RL-17, *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on Provisional Measures dated 25 February 2001.\n\n57.\n\nHere, the rights sought to be protected are conditional in the sense that they rely on the occurrence of two hypothetical events (that the Respondent will prevail and that it will be awarded costs). This said, they meet the requirement set by ICSID jurisprudence as it is generally understood and was just recalled. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the Application fulfills the requirement according to which it must seek to preserve rights of a party.\n\n**(ii) Risk of harm - Exceptional circumstances**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent agrees that provisional relief can only be granted in exceptional circumstances. It also agrees that the mere lack of assets of the possible future debtor is not a sufficient reason to grant an order for security for costs.\n\n59.\n\nAs a general proposition in line with the requirement of irreparable or substantial harm, the Tribunal is of the view that an application for security for costs may only be granted in exceptional circumstances where there is a real risk that the claimant will not comply with a potential order for costs because it is unable or unwilling to do so. On the basis of the record as it presently stands, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not established the existence of such exceptional circumstances for the following main reasons.\n\n60.\n\nFirst, there is no requirement in the ICSID system that a claimant must demonstrate its solvency. Nor did the Respondent establish in this case that the Claimants\u2019 assets are insufficient to meet a hypothetical future award of costs against the Claimants. The Claimants point out that Mr. Jacobs, the ultimate owner of the Claimants, holds a 10% interest in Lighthouse Don in trust on behalf of Lighthouse IBC. While the Respondent contests this position pointing out that the shares are presently held in the name of Mr. Djamirze and not by Mr. Jacobs, the Claimants have supplied some evidence in support of their position91 and made a representation that Mr. Jacobs has begun the process of transferring the shareholding to his name. The Claimants value Lighthouse IBC\u2019s 10% interest in Lighthouse Don at USD 784,300,000. It is true that there are real issues about the entitlement to, recoverability and valuation of this asset, as it in particular became clear during the hearing.92 Yet, it remains that at present the Respondent has not sufficiently shown that the Claimants lack any assets to pay a possible award of costs.93\n\nExhs. C-29, 33.\n\nTr. 52:11-62:21 (Questions of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to Claimants' counsel) and 62:2-63:10 (Question of Professor McLachlan to Claimants' counsel).\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b646-47; \u00b6Rejoinder, \u00b616.\n\n61.\n\nSecond, even if it were assumed that the Claimants have insufficient assets, this would not be enough in and of itself. Something more is required. Here too, the Respondent has not convincingly demonstrated that \"something more\".\n\n\u2022 The Respondent observes that a default judgment was rendered against a Lighthouse entity and another one against Mr. Jacobs personally. However, none of these judgments, one for a debt of AUD 2,048 and the other for AUD 10,000, appears to concern the Claimants. The first judgment related to a debt of a company called \"Lighthouse Construction\", an entity which has no connection with the Claimants. The second judgment seemed to deal with the debt of a former employee of one of Mr. Jacob\u2019s companies. This debt is also unrelated to the Claimants.\n\n\u2022 The Respondent next alleges that Mr. Jacobs has in the past removed assets to avoid satisfying a judgment. The Claimants have given a plausible explanation in respect of this allegation - assets were transferred to a different company for reasons related to the Jacobs Family Trust and the transfer took place before Mr. Jacobs was served with the relevant demand letter.94 Further, that a party may transfer its assets is neither exceptional nor sufficient to establish a risk of defaulting on a potential order for costs. This is especially relevant here as it has not been established that the Claimants have ever defaulted on any of their financial obligations.\n\n\u2022 Finally, while it alleges several instances of false statements and \"materially misleading\" conduct, the Respondent has failed to substantiate how these statements or conduct, if true, would be relevant for the Tribunal\u2019s decision on security for costs. For instance, statements about the number of the Claimants\u2019 employees or Mr. Jacobs\u2019 qualifications and affiliations give no indications of the Claimants\u2019 ability or willingness to pay. Equally unavailing for present purposes are the Claimants\u2019 dealings with and statements to the Respondent at the time when it entered into the relevant contracts with the Respondent.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b682-83.\n\n62.\n\nThird, an application for security for costs has only been granted once in an ICSID arbitration, namely in *RSM v Saint Lucia* by way of a majority decision. All the other known examples of requests for security for costs in ICSID arbitrations have been denied. Unlike the claimant in *RSM*, here, the Claimants have no record of failing to comply with orders for costs. To the contrary, the Claimants have complied with their obligation in terms of cost advances in these proceedings so far. Neither is their claim financed by a third-party funder as was the case in *RSM*. The Claimants expressly confirmed to the Tribunal at the hearing that no third party is funding their claim.95 The exceptional circumstances in which an order for pre-award security was made in *RSM* are thus not present here.96\n\nTr. 51:6-7 (Statement by Claimants' counsel).\n\nCL-3, *EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources, Inc. v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No ARB/14/14, Procedural Order No 3, Decision on the Parties' Requests for Provisional Measures dated 23 June 2015.\n\n63.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal concludes that the facts invoked by the Respondent are insufficient as the record currently stands to show the \"exceptional circumstances\" required for an order for security for costs. In other words, the requirement of a risk of irreparable or substantial harm is presently not met. The Tribunal can thus dispense with reviewing the third requirement mentioned earlier, namely urgency.\n\n64.\n\nAs a result of this analysis, the Application is denied.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n65.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\n(1) Denies the Respondent\u2019s application that the Claimants post security for costs; and\n\n(2) Reserves its decision on the costs of this application for a later stage of these proceedings."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Bifurcation)", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2016-07-08T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 3 (Bifurcation)\n------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nIn accordance with the revised Procedural Calendar of 18 May 2016 (\"Procedural Calendar\"):\n\na. On 19 May 2016, the Respondent filed its Preliminary Objection to Jurisdiction and Request for Bifurcation in which it requested bifurcation (\"Respondent\u2019s Application\").\n\nb. On 13 June 2016, the Claimants filed their Observations on the Respondent\u2019s Application for Bifurcation (\"Claimants\u2019 Observations\").\n\n2.\n\nIn its communication of 17 June 2016, the Respondent alleged that the Claimants had introduced \"new unsworn material\" as part of the Claimants\u2019 Observations, to which it objected. It requested the Tribunal not to receive or consider paragraphs 56 to 58 of the Claimants\u2019 Observations and the Claimants\u2019 Exhibits C-0197-200 (collectively \"the New Material\"), and to stay its decision on bifurcation until the Tribunal had determined that request.\n\n3.\n\nActing on the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, on 17 June 2016, the Claimants commented on the Respondent\u2019s communication.\n\n4.\n\nOn 4 July 2016, the Tribunal notified the Parties that because requests were made to the Tribunal after the Parties\u2019 scheduled submissions on bifurcation, the Tribunal would not be able to issue its decision as scheduled in the Procedural Calendar, but would do so shortly.\n\n5.\n\nThe principal issue to be addressed by the Tribunal is whether or not bifurcate the present proceeding. The Tribunal will address the other requests made by the Respondent referenced above in the course of its analysis.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n***A. Respondent\u2019s Position***\n------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal has the power under the ICSID Convention to bifurcate the present proceeding into jurisdictional and merits phases. If necessary, the Tribunal could even suspend the merits phase pending the outcome of the jurisdictional phase.\n\n7.\n\nIt contends that in deciding whether to bifurcate, previous tribunals largely focused on four issues: \"(a) do the jurisdictional objections have substance?; (b) if the jurisdictional objections are successful will this result in a dismissal of the entire case or a significant reduction in the scope and complexity of the arbitration?; (c) are the jurisdictional issues distinct from the merits issues or are they intertwined?; (d) will bifurcation harm or prejudice the Claimant.\" According to the Respondent, a consideration of each of these issues supports bifurcation in the present case:\n\na. First, the Respondent presently advances three jurisdictional objections: (a) that there has been no consent by it to ICSID arbitration; (b) that there has been no \"investment\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention or the Timor-Leste Foreign Investment Law (\"FIL\"); and (c) that the Claimants are not a \"foreign investor\" for the purposes of the FIL. These objections are all \"substantial\", and not \"trivial or frivolous\";\n\nb. Second, if all its objections are successful, there would be no need for a merits phase. Even if only one objection is successful, it would still lead to a significant reduction in the scope of the arbitration;\n\nc. Third, the jurisdictional objections do not substantially raise merits issues. While the first objection would require an examination of some underlying facts, those facts \"are of small compass\". Moreover, those facts would have no bearing on the Claimants\u2019 case on merits. The second objection can be decided by accepting most of the evidence as presented by the Claimants. While the Respondent does contest some of that evidence, deciding on that evidence \"[would] not infringe upon or otherwise affect the substantive consideration of the Claimants\u2019 merits case.\" Resolution of the third objection too would not require consideration of any facts that are likely to form part of the Claimants\u2019 case on merits; and,\n\nd. Fourth, no \"irreparable harm\" will be suffered by the Claimants because of bifurcation. As the Claimants have only claimed monetary losses, any possible prejudice that they would suffer can be compensated by an award from the Tribunal.\n\n***B. Claimants\u2019 Position***\n----------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants submit that neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules contain a presumption in favor of bifurcation once a jurisdictional objection is raised.\n\n9.\n\nThey contend that while the four requirements identified by the Respondent would have to be considered by the Tribunal, the Tribunal would also have to consider an \"overarching\" question as to \"whether fairness and procedural efficiency would be preserved or improved\" as a result of bifurcation.\n\n10.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, considerations of procedural efficiency do not always support bifurcation. This is also true in the present case because of the \"factual overlap\" between the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections and the merits. It makes little sense, so the Claimants\u2019 submit, to bifurcate here as the Tribunal will have to consider the same evidence (and call the same witnesses) twice. Further, bifurcation would make it difficult for the Tribunal to arrive at a fair determination of the disputed issues as the Tribunal would be unable to assess how factual questions in the jurisdictional context would affect the subsequent merits context. Moreover, bifurcation would delay the proceeding and increase the costs of the arbitration.\n\n11.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections are not appropriate for bifurcation. None of the objections is \"serious\" or \"substantial\". Further, all the obj ections are intertwined with the merits of the Claimants\u2019 claims. The Tribunal may have to hear testimony from multiple witnesses in circumstances where they may need to be recalled as witnesses for the merits phase, which would not only be procedurally inefficient, but would also create difficulties for the Tribunal. Finally, the Claimants point out that even if the third jurisdictional objection was accepted, this would not materially reduce the scope of the proceeding.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n***A. Preliminary matters***\n----------------------------\n\n12.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal emphasizes that this decision is made on the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s understanding of the record as it presently stands. Nothing contained herein shall pre-empt any later or different finding of fact or conclusion of law.\n\n13.\n\nAs a further preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the purpose of this Order is to decide whether to bifurcate the present proceedings between the three jurisdictional objections advanced by the Respondent on the one hand, and, on the other, all other objections that may arise and the merits. At this stage, it is not to decide on the merits of the jurisdictional objections themselves. The Tribunal will do so later at the relevant time as provided in the calendar for this proceeding.\n\n14.\n\nFinally, as mentioned above, in its correspondence of 17 June 2016, the Respondent objected to the inclusion of the New Material in the Claimants\u2019 Observations. It requested that this Material not be \"received or considered\" by the Tribunal \"for the purpose of the Respondent\u2019s Application [...] or otherwise in this proceeding.\" In reaching its decision on bifurcation below, the Tribunal has not considered this Material. However, as mentioned further below, the Tribunal does not reject this Material.\n\n***B. Legal framework***\n------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s power to rule on the Respondent\u2019s Application is composed of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n16.\n\nWith regard to the procedural stage at which the Tribunal may address any objection to its jurisdiction, Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention states that:\n\n**Article 41**\n\n(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.\"\n\n17.\n\nFurthermore, Rule 41(4) of the Arbitration Rules provides in relevant part that:\n\n**Rule 41**\n\n**Preliminary Objections**\n\n(4) [The Tribunal] may deal with the objection as a preliminary question or join it to the merits of the dispute. If the Tribunal overrules the objection or joins it to the merits, it shall once more fix time limits for the further procedures.\"\n\n18.\n\nIt is clear from ICSID jurisprudence that Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and Article 41(4) of the Arbitration Rules do not establish a presumption either in favor of or against bifurcation.\n\n***C. Discussion***\n-------------------\n\n19.\n\nAs a general matter, the Tribunal believes that it is good practice to deal with jurisdictional objections preliminarily, so as to avoid imposing full-fledged proceedings on a party disputing that it is subject to arbitration, whenever bifurcating such objections would likely result in increased efficiency in terms of both time and costs. On the other hand, if the bifurcation was unlikely to eliminate the need for a merits stage, either because the jurisdictional objections *prima facie* were not substantial, or because they were only directed to a few claims, a tribunal should be disinclined to bifurcate, unless there are other circumstances that would lead to a contrary conclusion.\n\n20.\n\nHere, the Parties agree that four factors are to be examined by the Tribunal in deciding whether to bifurcate:\n\na. Whether the jurisdictional objections have substance;\n\nb. Whether, the objections, if accepted, would result either in a dismissal of the entire case or at least a material reduction in the \"scope and complexity\" of the proceeding;\n\nc. Whether the objections raise questions of merits which would need to be examined; and,\n\nd. Whether the bifurcation would prejudice the Claimants.\n\n21.\n\nThese factors largely replicate considerations found to be relevant by other investment tribunals.1 For instance, the tribunal in *Philip Morris Asia Ltd v Australia* considered the following factors:\n\n\"(1) Is the objection prima facie serious and substantial? (2) Can the objection be examined without prejudging or entering the merits? (3) Could the objection, if successful, dispose of all or an essential part of the claims raised?\"2\n\nSee, for instance, Exh. RL-0028, *Accession Mezzanine Capital LP v Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No ARB/12/13, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Notice of Jurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation of 8 August 2013); Exh. CL-0040, *Emmis International Holding BV v Hungary* (ICSID Case No ARB/12/2, Decision on Bifurcation of 13 June 2013), para. 37(2).\n\nCL-0048, *Philip Morris Asia Ltd v Australia* (Procedural Order No 8 of 14 April 2014), para. 109.\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimants submit that while all these factors are to be considered, an \"overarching question\" to be decided is \"one of procedural efficiency\". According to the Claimants, bifurcation is \"procedurally inefficient\" in the present case as (i) the same individuals may have to be examined twice; (ii) the jurisdictional objections advanced by the Respondent cannot be fully segregated from the merits; and (iii) it would result in a longer proceeding with higher costs. These issues are considered in the course of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the four factors listed above.\n\n23.\n\nTurning now to these factors*,* the Tribunal notes first that the Respondent\u2019s objections do not appear frivolous:\n\na. The first objection, concerning the Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration raises genuine questions of incorporation of an ICSID arbitration clause. The Parties dispute not only the law applicable to such incorporation, but also whether the relevant contractual documents incorporate consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\nb. The second objection, that there has been no \"investment\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention or the FIL, is equally legitimate as it raises questions as to whether the matters listed in paragraph 251 of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on Merits of 14 March 2016 satisfy the requirements of an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention and the FIL.\n\nc. Finally, the third objection, that the Claimants are not a \"foreign investor\" for the purposes FIL, is also substantial as it raises concerns of satisfaction of the requirements of Article 18 of the FIL, particularly whether the Claimants hold a \"Foreign Investors\u2019 Certificate\" and whether the Fuel Supply Agreement constitutes a \"Special Investment Agreement\" for the purposes of Article 18.\n\n24.\n\nSecond, if any of the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections were to succeed, they would, at least, likely narrow the scope of the issues to be briefed at the merits stage. The first two objections are directed towards the Contract Claim.3 Therefore, if they were to succeed, this would significantly narrow the scope of issues to be briefed at the merits stage, which the Claimants do not specifically dispute. Similarly, the third objection, if successful, would exclude consideration of the Investment Law Claim.4 Bifurcating the proceedings may thus result in a reduction in the time and costs of any future merits phase. In such event, neither Party is likely to be put to the burden of raising/defending the entire case on the merits.\n\nDefined in the Respondent\u2019s Application, para. 9.\n\nId.\n\n25.\n\nThird, on the basis of the record as it presently stands, it appears to the Tribunal that the facts likely to be involved in determining the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections may not be sufficiently intertwined with the facts likely to be involved in determining the merits of the claims. The Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections give rise to legal questions that are likely to be largely separate and distinct from those arising on the merits:\n\na. For the first objection concerned with the Respondent\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration, the Respondent submits that the facts to be examined \"are of a small compass\" and that they are independent of the Claimants case on merits. The Claimants do not specifically object to this submission, rather they point out that the same witnesses may have to be recalled at the merits stage. While this may happen (equally for the second objection mentioned below), for now this is merely a possibility that may not even occur. Moreover, even if the same individuals are to be examined twice, which is not yet certain, the subject-matter of their testimony will probably be substantially different.\n\nb. The Claimants submit that the second objection involves consideration of \"(a) the proper characterisation of the Fuel Supply Agreement [...] (b) the extent of the Claimants\u2019 rights to Port Caravela; and (c) whether the Claimants actually made the contributions asserted in the Memorial on the Merits.\" The Tribunal believes that to address these issues it may not have to enter into a full array of facts pertinent to the merits. While the Tribunal may have to engage with some factual evidence, it is not sufficiently convinced that significant issues involved in the Claimants substantive claims would have to be determined.\n\nc. In respect of the third objection, the Tribunal would probably have to determine whether the Claimants hold a \"Foreign Investors\u2019 Certificate\" and whether the Fuel Supply Agreement constitutes a \"Special Investment Agreement\" for the purposes of Article 18 of the FIL. Here too, the issues to be considered appear likely to be unrelated to the Claimants\u2019 case on merits in respect of the FIL (that the Respondent breached its obligations under the FIL, specifically Articles 10 and 11 thereof).\n\n26.\n\nIt thus appears to the Tribunal that the issues to be analysed to determine the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections are not very likely to overlap with the issues to be reviewed at the merits phase, if any. Consequently, separating the presentation of these objections and the rest of the proceedings could possibly lead to a more efficient proceeding.\n\n27.\n\nFourth, the Tribunal does not believe the Claimants will suffer any material prejudice as a result of bifurcation. While it is true that the proceedings will last longer and possibly be more expensive if the Tribunal were to reject the Respondent\u2019s objections, this would apply to both Parties. Moreover, this is something that can be taken into account when fixing interest on the sums awarded to the Claimants (in the event their claim is successful) and costs.\n\n28.\n\nAs a result of this analysis, the Application is granted.\n\n***D. Other requests***\n-----------------------\n\n29.\n\nHaving decided to bifurcate the proceeding, the Tribunal believes it is no longer necessary to decide the Respondent\u2019s request not to \"receive or consider\" the New Material. Indeed, in the bifurcated scenario, the next step is for the Claimants to submit a Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections. In that submission, the Claimants could attach evidence and raise defences in response to the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections. The Claimants have merely submitted the New Material earlier (in their Observations), and should not be penalized as a result.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that this decision will not prejudice the Respondent. The New Material is now part of the record and may form the subject-matter of document production requests by the Respondent. Besides, the Respondent will have an opportunity to address all of the Claimants\u2019 submissions including the New Material in its Reply on Preliminary Objections, including by raising new jurisdictional objections in respect of the New Material.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in its Application, the Respondent has submitted that \"this memorial does not constitute the entirety of its objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. The other objections maintained by the Respondent are [...] properly not the subject of a request for bifurcation [...] Those further jurisdictional objections will (if necessary) be the subject of further submissions during any merits phase.\" The Claimants submit that the Respondent has not acted in accordance with its duty to file jurisdictional objections as soon as possible which \"exposes [the Claimants] to prejudice\". However, they have not made any specific request in respect of the jurisdictional objections \"reserved\" by the Respondent. The Tribunal will address the issue, including admissibility of these other objections, if and when such objections are raised by the Respondent and opposed by the Claimants.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n32.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\n(1) Grants the Respondent\u2019s request to bifurcate the proceeding between (i) the three jurisdictional objections advanced by the Respondent, and (ii) all other objections that may arise and the merits of the case;\n\n(2) Directs the Parties to follow the scenario in the Procedural Calendar of 18 May 2016 that assumes bifurcation; and,\n\n(3) Reserves its decision on the costs of this application for a later stage of these proceedings."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2017-12-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **LIST OF MAIN ABBREVIATIONS** |\n| Additional Evidence | Additional exhibits submitted by the Claimants under separate cover following meeting between the Claimants' new counsel and Mr. Jacobs. |\n| Addendum, Nomination and Variation | Agreement dated 26 November 2010 titled \"Addendum, Nomination & Variation for: TLZEBHSD20101022LEAJ9 / dated: 22nd -OCT-2010\" (also the \"Third Agreement\") |\n| Australia | Commonwealth of Australia |\n| C-Mem | Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections dated 19 August 2016 |\n| C-PHB | Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief dated 18 April 2017 |\n| C-RPHB | Claimants' Rebuttal Post-Hearing Brief dated 5 May 2017 |\n| Contribution Summary | Document dated 22 October 2010, titled \"10.16 MW Diesel Generator Infrastructure Contribution Summary\" |\n| December General Terms | Document dated December 2010 titled \"Lighthouse Energy General Terms and Conditions of Supply of Goods and Related Services\" |\n| Exh.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis is a dispute submitted to arbitration under the auspices of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") on the basis of (a) a contractual arrangement for the supply of fuel and generators, (b) the Timor-Leste Foreign Investment Law (Law No 05/2005) (the \"FIL\"),1 and (c) the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\nExh. RL-047, FIL.\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANTS**\n--------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are Lighthouse Corporation Pty Ltd (\"Lighthouse\"), a company incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia (\"Australia\"), and Lighthouse Corporation Ltd, IBC (\"Lighthouse IBC\"), a company incorporated under the laws of the Seychelles (together, the \"Claimants\").\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants are represented by Mr. Tony Johnson and Mr. Nicholas Briggs of the law firm Johnson Winter & Slattery; by Dr. Gavan Griffith of 2301 Owen Dixon Chambers West; and by Professor Chester Brown of 7 Wentworth Selborne Chambers.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT**\n---------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (\"Timor-Leste\" or the \"Respondent\"). The Respondent has been an ICSID Contracting State since 22 August 2002.\n\n5.\n\nThe Respondent is represented by Mr. Liam Prescott and Mr. Joel Borgeaud of the law firm DLA Piper Australia; by Mr. Vernon Flynn QC of Essex Court Chambers; by Mr. Jonathan Kay Hoyle of 11 St James Hall Chambers; and by Mr. Shane Doyle QC of Level 27 Chambers (Brisbane), 5th Floor Selbourne Chambers (Sydney) and Essex Court Chambers (London)\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"Parties\".\n\n**II. OVERVIEW OF THE RELEVANT CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe following summary gives a general overview of the relevant contractual arrangements. It does contain an overview of the disputes, or describe all facts which may be of relevance. To the extent relevant or useful, additional facts will be discussed in the Tribunal's analysis.\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants' case arises out of a contractual arrangement that, according to the Claimants, comprises three interrelated agreements with reference number TLZEBHSD20101022LEAJ9 entered into in October and November 2010 (collectively, the \"Fuel Supply Agreement\"). The first agreement on which the Claimants rely (the \"First Agreement\") consists of the following documents:\n\n\u2022 An agreement dated 22 October 2010, titled \"Supply for Allocation & Contract\" (the \"Supply Agreement\").2 It provides for the sale and shipment of high speed fuel from the Supplier (the Claimants) to the Buyer (the Respondent) on monthly terms, as well as the supply of eight diesel generators. It also sets out terms such as the quantity of the goods, their origin, delivery, price, margin, and payment. The Supply Agreement is executed by Prime Minister Kay Rala Xanana Gusm\u00e2o and Mr. Januario da Costa Pereira, Secretary of State for Electricity, on behalf of the Respondent; Mr. Carlos Oliveria on behalf of Zebra Fuels; and Mr. Albert Jacobs on behalf of the Claimants.3\n\n\u2022 A document dated 22 October 2010, titled \"10.16 MW Diesel Generator Infrastructure Contribution Summary\" (the \"Contribution Summary\").4 The Contribution Summary covers many topics, primarily relating to the energy market in Timor-Leste. It also states that \"Lighthouse 'Standard Terms and Conditions Applying to the Sale of Goods' will apply\".5\n\nExh. C-088, Supply Agreement, 22 October 2010.\n\nExh. C-088, Supply Agreement, 22 October 2010, pp. 5-6.\n\nExh. C-087, Contribution Summary, 22 October 2010.\n\nExh. C-087, Contribution Summary, 22 October 2010, p. 8.\n\n9.\n\nAs explained further below, the Parties disagree on the relevance and effect of that reference to \"Standard Terms and Conditions Applying to the Sale of Goods\". The Claimants' position, which the Respondent disputes, is that this language refers to a document with \"Release Date: Oct-2010\" titled \"Lighthouse Energy Standard Terms and Conditions Applying to the Sale of Goods\" (the \"Standard Terms\").6 Clauses 17 and 18 of the Standard Terms address applicable law and dispute resolution as follows:\n\n\"17 APPLICABLE LAW\n\n17. The Contract shall be interpreted in accordance with and in subjection to the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia, in the State of Victoria, unless stipulated otherwise in any applicable Special Conditions of Contract.\n\n17.2 Any foreign court of law or tribunal of competent jurisdiction engaged by either party in any proceedings between the Seller and purchaser, shall apply the Applicable Law herein determined, or as specified in any Special Conditions of Contract.\n\n18. RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES\n\n18. The Purchaser and the Supplier shall make every effort to resolve amicably by direct informal negotiation any disagreement or dispute arising between them under or in connection with the Contract.\n\n18.2 Where a dispute cannot be resolved amicably by agreement, the parties agree the matter can be referred for arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\"), in accordance with the rules of the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"convention\"), so long as the host countries of both parties are members to the convention, at the time of engagement or contract.\n\n18.3 The preferred venue of both parties in the case of an ICSID proceeding shall be the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration at Melbourne.\n\n18.4 Both parties agree that the decision of ICSID shall be binding and final, and shall at all times comply fully with the rules of the convention, and the resulting ICSID award.\"\n\nExh. C-192, Standard Terms, October 2010.\n\n10.\n\nThe second agreement on which the Claimants rely (the \"Second Agreement\") includes:\n\n\u2022 An agreement dated 18 November 2010 titled \"Floating Storage Addendum & Nomination\" (the \"Floating Storage Addendum\").7 It is executed by the individuals who executed the Supply Agreement.8 Under the Floating Storage Addendum, the Claimants are to provide high speed fuel \"in accordance with the main supply contract noted above, (and in conjunction with our *Standard Terms & Conditions of Supply*, also attached hereto)\".9 The Parties disagree as to the content, meaning and effect of that reference to \"*Standard Terms & Conditions of Supply*\".\n\n\u2022 An agreement dated 18 November 2010 titled \"Special Conditions of Contract for Supply of Goods & Related Services\" (the \"Special Conditions\"), which is executed by the individuals who executed the Supply Agreement and the Floating Storage Addendum.10 According to the Claimants, the purpose of this document was to revise the Fuel Supply Agreement for consistency with the Floating Storage Addendum.11 The Special Conditions provide that they must be \"read in conjunction with\", *inter alia,* the \"Lighthouse Energy - General Terms & Conditions of Supply\".12\n\nExh. C-092, Floating Storage Addendum, 18 November 2010.\n\nExh. C-092, Floating Storage Addendum, 18 November 2010, p 2.\n\nExh.

C-093, Special Conditions, 18 November 2010, p. 5.\n\n11.\n\nThe third agreement that the Claimants cite is dated 26 November 2010, titled\n\n\"Addendum, Nomination & Variation for: TLZEBHSD20101022LEAJ9 / dated: 22nd -OCT-2010\" (the \"Third Agreement\" or \"Addendum, Nomination and Variation\").13 Again, it is executed by the same individuals.14 Like the Floating Storage Addendum, the Third Agreement contains a reference to \"*Standard Terms & Conditions of Supply*\", the content, meaning and effect of which is disputed.15\n\nExh. C-095, Addendum, Nomination and Variation, 26 November 2010.\n\nExh. C-095, Addendum, Nomination and Variation, 26 November 2010, p. 10.\n\nExh. C-095, Addendum, Nomination and Variation, 26 November 2010, p. 3.\n\n12.\n\nItem F of the Addendum, Nomination and Variation provides that \"the Supplier will commit to the engineering, manufacture, development and installation of a state-of-the-art fuel storage facility at Port Caravela\".16\n\nExh. C-095, Addendum, Nomination and Variation, 26 November 2010, Item F.\n\n13.\n\nRegarding its relationship to other contractual documents, the Third Agreement stipulates as follows:\n\n\"[T]he following documents are attached for your reference, and form integral part of the original Supply Contract and Agreement, TLZEBHSD20101022LEAJ9 I DATED: 22ND- OCT-2010:\n\n1.

LE - Special Conditions of Contract dated 261h-Nov-2010 (v2)\n\n5. LE - Bonus Period Election Form (Dated 261h-Nov-2010)\n\n[...]\n\nAny previous Addendum, Nomination and Variation is subject to this one, in all its parts, and any conflict in terms, definitions, charges, meanings or otherwise, shall surrender to those stipulated by this Addendum, Nomination and Variation. The Prevailing Special Conditions of Contract shall be the most recent version as executed by the parties, and all former Special Conditions of Contract shall be surrendered in so far as they conflict with the latest executed version.\"17\n\nExh. C-095, Addendum, Nomination and Variation, 26 November 2010, p. 8; *see also* p. 9 (\"By signing this Addendum, Nomination and Variation you acknowledge that you have received, read and understood all nine (9) documents referenced above, and further acknowledge they form an integral part of the aforementioned contract\"). The other four documents referenced are \"floating storage barge I vessel 088 Reports\".\n\n14.\n\nAs explained further below, the Respondent's position is that the reference in the Addendum, Nomination and Variation to the \"LE - General Terms & Conditions of Supply\" is not to the Standard Terms, but rather to a document titled \"Lighthouse Energy General Terms and Conditions of Supply of Goods and Related Services\". The Respondent relies on two versions of this document: one dated September 2010 (the \"September General Terms\"),18 which was attached to the Second Agreement, and one dated October 2010 (the \"October General Terms\"),19 which the Respondent received at some time later. Clause 17 of the September General Terms provides the following dispute resolution clause:\n\n\"17.1 The Purchaser and the Supplier shall make every effort to resolve amicably by direct informal negotiation any disagreement or dispute arising between them under or in connection with the Contract.\n\n17.2 Any Supplier that claims to have suffered loss or injury due to a breach of an obligation imposed on the procuring entity, by law may seek review in accordance with the public procurement law of the Buyer.\"20\n\nExh. R-119, September General Terms, attached to Email from Sean Magee to Abrao Gabriel Oliveira (copying Ambassador Abel Guterres) of 19 November 2010, with subject 'FINAL PACKAGE'.\n\nExh.

R-119, September General Terms, Clause 17, attached to Email from Sean Magee to Abrao Gabriel Oliveira (copying Ambassador Abel Guterres) of 19 November 2010, 'FINAL PACKAGE'.\n\n15.\n\nClause 17 of the October General Terms is identical, except that it adds the following language at the end of Clause 17.2: \"or the standard laws applicable to Suppliers, under Commonwealth laws of Australia\".21\n\nExh. R-132, October General Terms, Clause 17.2.\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants' position, disputed by the Respondent, is that the Claimants prepared a revised version of the General Terms and Conditions in late November 2010, which was dated December 2010 (the \"December General Terms\").22 Clause 17.2 of this version provides:\n\n\"Where a dispute cannot be resolved amicably by agreement, the parties agree the matter can be referred for arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\"), in accordance with the rules of the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"convention\"), so long as the host countries of both parties are members to the convention, at the time of engagement or contract.\"23\n\nExh. C-200, December General Terms.\n\nExh. C-200, December General Terms, Clause 17(2).\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n17.\n\nOn 16 December 2014, the Claimants filed with ICSID a request for arbitration dated 4 December 2014, together with Exhibits 1 through 10 (the \"Request for Arbitration\"). By letter of 18 December 2014, the ICSID Secretariat asked the Claimants to provide additional information relating to the Request for Arbitration, which the Claimants submitted on 29 December 2014.\n\n18.\n\nIn accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Secretary-General registered the Request for Arbitration on 14 January 2015 and so notified the Parties. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible pursuant to Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n19.\n\nOn 25 March 2015, the Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. Specifically, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators.\n\n20.\n\nOn 19 April 2015, the Claimants appointed Mr. Stephen Jagusch, a national of New Zealand, as arbitrator, and Mr. Jagusch accepted his appointment on 22 April 2015. On 20 May 2016, the Respondent appointed Professor Campbell McLachlan QC, a national of New Zealand, as arbitrator, and Professor McLachlan accepted his appointment on 27 May 2015.\n\n21.\n\nIn accordance with the Parties' agreed method of constituting the Tribunal, on 15 June 2015, the co-arbitrators made a proposal for a President of the Tribunal and asked the Parties to confer and inform the ICSID Secretariat whether they had any objection. The Parties were unable to agree on the co-arbitrators' proposal. By correspondence of 24 June 2015, the Parties agreed that the co-arbitrators would have 30 additional days to make an alternate proposal.\n\n22.\n\nOn 30 July 2015, the co-arbitrators proposed the appointment of Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, to serve as the President of the Tribunal. ICSID informed the Parties that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler had confirmed her independence, and that she was prepared to accept the appointment. ICSID also provided the Parties with Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's transparency statements. The co-arbitrators asked the Parties to confer and inform the ICSID Secretariat whether they had any objection to this proposal.\n\n23.\n\nBy letters of 4 and 5 August 2015, the Respondent and the Claimants confirmed that they had no objection to the appointment of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler.\n\n24.\n\nOn 7 August 2015, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler accepted her appointment. On the same date, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Lindsay Gastrell, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal. ICSID provided the Parties with copies of the declarations required under ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2), signed by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, Mr. Jagusch and Professor McLachlan, as well as Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's statement.\n\n25.\n\nBy letter of 14 August 2015, the Respondent's counsel notified the Tribunal that:\n\n\"1. our client will be filing a jurisdictional objection pursuant to Rule 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules;\n\n2. our client currently expects to file a preliminary objection pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Rules on the basis that some or all of the Claimants' claims are manifestly without legal merit. In the event that we receive final instructions to file such an objection it will be filed on or before 6 September 2015 (being 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, in accordance with Article 41(5)); and\n\n3. our client anticipates that it will make an application for security in respect of its costs pursuant to Rule 39(1) of the ICSID Rules. Our client is conscious of the need to make such an application expeditiously.\"\n\n26.\n\nIn response, on 26 August 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the procedural modalities relating to any application under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) or 39(1) would be discussed during the first session of the Tribunal.\n\n27.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal provided the Parties with a draft agenda for the first session and a draft procedural order addressing the conduct of the proceedings. The Parties were invited to confer and provide comments on these drafts. The Tribunal also proposed the appointment of Mr. Rahul Donde as Assistant to the Tribunal.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter of 10 September 2015, the Respondent advised that it would not be filing preliminary objections pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), but that it would soon file an application for security for costs pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1).\n\n29.\n\nOn 29 September 2015, the Claimants filed an amended Request for Arbitration, correcting an inaccuracy in paragraph 10 and updating the list of the Claimants' legal representatives at paragraph 5.\n\n30.\n\nAlso on 29 September 2015, the Parties provided their joint comments on the draft agenda for the first session and the corresponding draft procedural order.\n\n31.\n\nThe first session was held by teleconference on 6 October 2015. During the teleconference, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed procedural matters, including the applicable arbitration rules, modalities for written submissions, and the procedural calendar.\n\n32.\n\nThe Parties also confirmed that they had no objection to the appointment of Mr. Donde as Assistant to the Tribunal. Mr. Donde provided his signed declaration to the Parties on 6 October 2015.\n\n33.\n\nOn 9 October 2015, the Respondent submitted an Application for Provisional Measures, together with the Witness Statements of Ms. Kate Elizabeth Teixeira and Mr. Liam Thomas Prescott, Exhibits R-001 through R-082, and Legal Authorities RL-001 through RL-027.\n\n34.\n\nThat same day, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to submit their observations on the Application for Provisional Measures, in accordance with the briefing schedule agreed by the Parties during the first session.\n\n35.\n\nOn 13 October 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 concerning the procedural matters addressed during the first session. The Procedural Timetable was provided to the Parties in draft form on the same date and subsequently finalized.\n\n36.\n\nBy letter of 2 November 2015, the Claimants requested an extension until 17 November 2015 to file their observations on the Application for Provisional Measures. Upon the invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent commented on 4 November 2015, informing the Tribunal that it agreed to the extension and would consent to giving the Claimants until 20 November 2015 to file their observations. In addition, the Respondent proposed that the Tribunal permit a short second round of written submissions. The Claimants responded to this proposal on the same day, opposing a further round of written submissions.\n\n37.\n\nOn 6 November 2015, the Tribunal confirmed the extended deadline of 20 November 2015 for the Claimants' observations on the Application for Provisional Measures. The Tribunal also informed the Parties that it would decide whether a short second round of written submissions would be useful after receiving the first round, and that it would give appropriate instructions at that time.\n\n38.\n\nIn accordance with the revised procedural calendar, the Claimants filed their Observations on the Application for Provisional Measures, dated 20 November 2015, together with the Witness Statements of Mr. Albert Jacobs, Mr. James Podaridis, Mr. Sean Magee, and Mr. Alan Fraser, Exhibits C-001 through C-032, and Legal Authorities CL-001 through CL-009.\n\n39.\n\nOn 23 November 2015, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it had decided to allow a brief second round of written submissions. The Respondent was invited to submit a reply within ten days, and the Claimants were invited to submit a rejoinder ten days thereafter. The Tribunal limited the length of the submissions to eight pages.\n\n40.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing on the Application for Provisional Measures would be held by teleconference and provided the Parties with an agenda for the hearing.\n\n41.\n\nOn 3 December 2015, the Respondent requested an extension until 5 December 2015 to file its Reply to the Claimants' Observations on the Application. The Claimants did not object, and the Tribunal therefore granted the Respondent's request. The Tribunal also noted that the Claimants would be granted a commensurate extension if they were to request it.\n\n42.\n\nOn 5 December 2015, the Respondent filed its Reply to the Claimants' Observations on the Application, together with the Witness Statement of Mr. Russell John Slocomb, the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Liam Thomas Prescott, and Exhibits R-083 through R-100.\n\n43.\n\nOn 8 December 2015, the Claimants complained to the Tribunal about the length of the Reply to the Claimants' Observations on the Application and requested an extension of time for their rejoinder. The Respondent did not agree with the Claimants' assertions, but had no objection to the extension sought. On 9 December 2015, the Tribunal confirmed that the filing date for the rejoinder was extended to 16 December 2015.\n\n44.\n\nOn 16 December 2015, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on the Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures, together with the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Albert Jacobs and Exhibits C-033 through C-053.\n\n45.\n\nOn 20 December 2015, the Respondent requested that the scheduled teleconference hearing on provisional measures be postponed due to the illness of one of its counsel. The President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that, under the circumstances, the Tribunal was inclined to grant the postponement, subject to any compelling objection by the Claimants. In response, the Claimants proposed that, rather than postpone the hearing, the Tribunal proceed to decide based on the written submissions. The Respondent, in turn, objected to this proposal.\n\n46.\n\nOn 21 December 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the hearing would be rescheduled.\n\n47.\n\nThe hearing on provisional measures was held as rescheduled to 21 January 2016 and conducted by teleconference. At that hearing, the Tribunal heard the Parties' oral arguments in accordance with the agenda provided on 23 November 2015. An audio recording was made, and a court reporter prepared a written transcript of the recording. Copies of the recording and the transcript were subsequently distributed to the Tribunal and the Parties.\n\n48.\n\nOn 28 January 2016, the Claimants sought leave to file a legal authority that had not entered the public domain until after the hearing. In response, on 1 February 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had all the necessary information to issue the decision and did not wish to receive further materials.\n\n49.\n\nOn 11 February 2016, the Claimants transmitted to the Tribunal a revised version of the transcript of the hearing on provisional measures, reflecting the corrections agreed by the Parties.\n\n50.\n\nOn 13 February 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, containing the Tribunal's Decision on the Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures. The Tribunal denied the Respondent's application for security for costs, based on its finding that \"the facts invoked by the Respondent are insufficient as the record currently stands to show the 'exceptional circumstances' required for an order for security for costs\".\n\n51.\n\nOn 23 February 2016, the Claimants requested a 14-day extension until 18 March 2016 to submit their Memorial on the Merits, to which the Respondent had consented. On 24 February 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Tribunal could not accede to the Claimants' request in light of the date reserved for a potential hearing on preliminary objections. Instead, the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties a revised procedural timetable providing a ten-day extension until 14 March 2016 for the Claimants to file their Memorial on Merits, and reflecting other adjustments to account for that extension.\n\n52.\n\nIn accordance with the revised schedule, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits, dated 14 March 2016 (the \"Mem.\"), accompanied by:\n\n\u2022 the Third Witness Statement of Mr. Albert Jacobs,\n\n\u2022 the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Sean Magee,\n\n\u2022 the First Witness Statement of Mr. Shane Tissera,\n\n\u2022 the Second Witness Statement of Mr. James Podaridis,\n\n\u2022 the First Witness Statement of Mr. Nelson Ribeiro,\n\n\u2022 the First Expert Report of Mr. Brian Morris,\n\n\u2022 Exhibits C-054 through C-196, and\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities CL-010 through CL-038.\n\n53.\n\nOn 3 and 18 May 2016, the Tribunal confirmed further amendments to the procedural calendar that had been agreed by the Parties.\n\n54.\n\nIn accordance with the revised procedural timetable, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction and Request for Bifurcation, dated 19 May 2016 (the \"Preliminary Objections\"), accompanied by:\n\n\u2022 the First Witness Statement of Mr. Valentino Dariel Sousa,\n\n\u2022 the First Witness Statement of Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusm\u00e2o,\n\n\u2022 the First Witness Statement of Mr. Noel Bernardo de Carvalho,\n\n\u2022 the First Witness Statement of Mr. Arcanjo da Silva,\n\n\u2022 the First Witness Statement of Mr. Jose dos Reis Francisco Abel,\n\n\u2022 the First Witness Statement of Mr. Constantino Ferreira Soares,\n\n\u2022 the First Witness Statement of Mr. Abel Guterres,\n\n\u2022 the First Witness Statement of Mr. Florencio da Conceicao Sanches,\n\n\u2022 the Third Witness Statement of Mr. Liam Prescott,\n\n\u2022 Exhibits R-101 through R-134, and\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities RL-028 through RL-089.\n\n55.\n\nAlso in accordance with the revised procedural timetable, the Claimants then filed their Observations on the Respondent's Application for Bifurcation, dated 14 June 2016 (the \"Observations on Bifurcation\"), together with Exhibits C-197 through C-200, and Legal Authorities CL-039 through CL-056.\n\n56.\n\nBy letter of 17 June 2016, the Respondent complained to the Tribunal that the Claimants had inappropriately introduced new and unsworn material into the proceedings in the Observations on Bifurcation. The Respondent claimed that the introduction of this new material prejudiced its position and requested that the Tribunal (a) not consider the new material, (b) make a ruling that it would not consider the new material, and (c) stay any decision in respect of the Request for Bifurcation until it had determined the status of the new material.\n\n57.\n\nOn 18 June 2016, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to comment on the Respondent's letter of 17 June 2016. By letter of 24 June 2016, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal deny the relief sought by the Respondent.\n\n58.\n\nOn 8 July 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 on Bifurcation and Related Requests. It granted the request to bifurcate the proceedings into a first phase addressing the three jurisdictional objections and a second phase addressing other objections that may arise and the merits. In addition, it denied the Respondent's 17 June 2016 request for relief.\n\n59.\n\nOn 8 August 2016, the Claimants requested a seven-day extension to file their countermemorial on preliminary objections, which the Tribunal granted on the same date in light of the Respondent's consent.\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections on 19 August 2016 (\"C-Mem.\"), accompanied by:\n\n\u2022 the Fourth Witness Statement of Mr. Albert Jacobs,\n\n\u2022 the First Witness Statement of Mr. Mark Beanie,\n\n\u2022 the First Witness Statement of Mr. Nickoloas Mitropoulos,\n\n\u2022 the First Expert Report of Mr. Filipe Alfaiate (with Exhibits AFG-1 through AFG-4, and Timor-Leste Legislation 1 through 17),\n\n\u2022 Exhibits C-201 through C-204, and\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities CL-057 through CL-085.\n\n61.\n\nThe Parties exchanged document production requests on 5 September 2016, produced certain responsive documents, and objected to the production of others on 19 and 20 September 2016, and 4 October 2016. They conveyed their objections to the Tribunal on 7 October 2016.\n\n62.\n\nOn 21 October 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, on document production.\n\n63.\n\nBy letter of 25 November 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Claimants had filed proceedings against it in the Melbourne Registry of Supreme Court of Victoria, and that, as a result, it may require an extension of the procedural timetable. The Respondent also raised the issue of confidentiality of the proceeding, stating that \"[w]hile at present no application may be necessary, in the event that the Claimants take any further step that is inconsistent in the maintenance of confidentiality, the Respondent will apply to the Tribunal for the necessary provisional measures\".\n\n64.\n\nOn 29 November 2016, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they did not accept the Respondent's suggestion of 25 November 2016 that the Parties were bound by a general duty of confidentiality in the Victorian court proceedings.\n\n65.\n\nOn 1 December 2016, the Parties requested that several amendments be made to the procedural calendar. On 3 December 2016, the Tribunal agreed to the proposed modifications and sent a revised procedural timetable to the Parties.\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Reply on Preliminary Objections on 16 December 2016 (the \"Reply\"), accompanied by:\n\n\u2022 the Second Witness Statement of Mr. Abel Guterres,\n\n\u2022 the Fourth Witness Statement of Mr. Liam Thomas Prescott,\n\n\u2022 the First Expert Report of Mr. Darren Hopkins,\n\n\u2022 the Second Expert Report of Mr. Darren Hopkins,\n\n\u2022 the First Expert Report of Mr. Nuno Miguel Dos Santos Marrazes,\n\n\u2022 Exhibits R-135 through R-163, and\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities RL-090 through RL-115.\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimants submitted their Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections dated 26 January 2017 (the \"Rej.\"), accompanied by:\n\n\u2022 the Fifth Witness Statement of Mr. Albert Jacobs,\n\n\u2022 the Third Witness Statement of Mr. Sean Magee,\n\n\u2022 the First Witness Statement of Mr. Alan Harper,\n\n\u2022 the First Expert Report of Mr. Craig Macaulay,\n\n\u2022 Exhibits C-205 through C-219, and\n\n\u2022 Legal Authorities CL-086 through CL-111.\n\n68.\n\nOn 28 January 2017, the Claimants submitted the Second Expert Report of Mr. Filipe Alfaiate, together with Exhibits AFG-005 through AFG-008, which was also meant to accompany the Rejoinder.\n\n69.\n\nOn 30 January 2017, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had appointed Dr. Gavan Griffith QC to replace Mr. John Karkar QC as senior counsel. The Parties then exchanged several letters, copied to the Tribunal, concerning Dr. Griffith's connections with the Members of the Tribunal. Neither Party requested any order from the Tribunal in this regard.\n\n70.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural timetable, on 30 January 2017, each Party identified the witnesses and experts presented by the other Party whom it intended to crossexamine at the hearing.\n\n71.\n\nOn 1 February 2017, the Tribunal sent to the Parties a draft procedural order addressing the organization of the hearing, and informed the Parties that this draft would serve as the agenda for the pre-hearing teleconference.\n\n72.\n\nThe President, acting by delegation of her co-arbitrators, held the pre-hearing teleconference with the Parties on 3 February 2017. During the call, the President and the Parties discussed various matters of hearing organization, such as the daily schedule, allocation of time, order of testimony, and the sequestration of witnesses.\n\n73.\n\nOn 7 February 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 addressing the organization of the hearing, which contained the Parties' agreements and the Tribunal's decisions on matters discussed during the pre-hearing teleconference.\n\n74.\n\nBy letter of 10 February 2017, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that its lead counsel, Mr. Shane Doyle QC, would not be able to represent the Respondent at the hearing due to illness and that Mr. Vernon Flynn QC would appear in his place.\n\n75.\n\nOn 12 February 2017, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to request leave to submit additional witness statements prepared by Mr. Albert Jacobs (his Sixth Witness Statement) and Mr. Sean Magee (his Fourth Witness Statement), as well as additional exhibits (the \"Additional Evidence\"). The Claimants stated that when their new counsel, Dr. Griffith, met with Mr. Jacobs, additional relevant and material information had been revealed. The Claimants noted that they would provide the Additional Evidence to the Respondent under separate cover.\n\n76.\n\nIn response, the President of the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment within 24 hours on the admissibility of the Claimants' request. Alternatively, the President invited the Respondent to notify the Tribunal within 24 hours that it did not wish to comment on the admissibility of the request, and to instead comment on the request itself and the Additional Evidence within a further period of 24 hours.\n\n77.\n\nBy letter of 14 February 2017, the Respondent opposed the Claimants' request. It argued that the Additional Evidence was extensive and contained entirely new allegations, and that the Claimants had failed to provide any reasonable justification for waiting to submit the Additional Evidence until 10 days before the hearing. However, the Respondent acknowledged that it was for the Tribunal to decide whether to admit the Additional Evidence and invited the Tribunal to examine the Additional Evidence for that purpose. The Respondent also requested that, if the Tribunal were to admit the Additional Information, the following procedural adjustments be made: (a) the Respondent be granted an opportunity to respond and submit additional information by 22 February 2017; (b) the Respondent be allotted additional time to cross-examine Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Magee at the hearing; and (c) all factual witnesses be required to give their evidence under oath.\n\n78.\n\nThe Claimants responded later on the same day. They challenged the Respondent's objection to admitting the Additional Evidence into the record. However, they essentially agreed to the three procedural adjustments that the Respondent requested in the event the Additional Evidence were to be admitted.\n\n79.\n\nAfter reviewing the Additional Evidence, the Tribunal ruled on the Claimants' request by email of 14 February 2017. The Tribunal agreed with the Respondent that the Additional Evidence should have been submitted earlier, but also found that the Additional Evidence appeared relevant and material to the issues in dispute. Therefore, the Tribunal admitted the Additional Evidence into the record. To avoid any prejudice, the Tribunal adopted all the Respondent's proposed procedural adjustments.\n\n80.\n\nOn 19 February 2017, the ICSID Secretariat received two emails from the Claimants' witness Mr. Sean Magee, stating that he feared for his safety and would not attend the hearing. He also stated: \"EACH OF MY WRITTEN AFFIDAVITS / WITNESS STATEMENTS ARE HEREBY WITHDRAWN\". After consulting the Tribunal, the Secretary of the Tribunal provided Mr. Magee's emails to the Parties, noting that the Tribunal would hear any submissions that the Parties wished to make on the matter at the commencement of the hearing.\n\n81.\n\nBy letter of 20 February 2017, the Claimants argued that \"the Tribunal should regard Mr. Magee's Witness Statements as having been regularly filed and forming part of the evidential record of these arbitration proceedings\" because he had provided a valid reason for failing to appear at the hearing.\n\n82.\n\nOn 21 February 2017, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 5, the Claimants submitted a demonstrative exhibit to be used at the hearing. By separate letter of the same date, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they intended to adduce oral testimony from their witness Mr. Jacobs at the hearing concerning two new matters. They also stated that they would be content to have Mr. Jacobs testify first.\n\n83.\n\nBy letter of the same date, the Respondent commented on two matters. Regarding Mr. Magee's witness statements, the Respondent argued that \"Mr Magee's evidence is inadmissible as evidence of the truth of its contents. Mr Magee has specifically and emphatically disavowed all of his four witness statements\". Regarding the Claimants' intention to have Mr. Jacobs give oral testimony on new matters, the Respondent stated that if Mr. Jacobs had *any* new evidence to adduce, it should be submitted by 22 February 2017 in the form of a written witness statement.\n\n84.\n\nOn the same day, the President of the Tribunal invited the Claimants to file a brief supplemental witness statement by Mr. Jacobs the following day. She also confirmed that Mr. Jacobs would be the first witness to testify.\n\n85.\n\nBy separate letter of 21 February 2017, the Claimants submitted a further email from Mr. Magee regarding his non-appearance at the hearing, which was addressed to the Claimants' counsel.\n\n86.\n\nOn 22 February 2017, the Claimants submitted the Seventh Witness Statement of Mr. Albert Jacobs.\n\n87.\n\nOn the same day, in accordance with the Tribunal's instructions of 14 February 2017, the Respondent submitted the Second Witness Statement of Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o, responding to the Sixth and Seventh Witness Statements of Mr. Jacobs. Later that day, the Claimants also submitted the Third Witness Statement of Ambassador Guterres and the Fifth Witness Statement of Mr. Prescott, relating to \"matters including the recent emails from Mr. Magee\".\n\n88.\n\nAfter receiving these witness statements, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to object to Mr. Prescott's Fifth Witness Statement, arguing that it fell entirely outside of the scope of leave granted by the Tribunal.\n\n89.\n\nThe hearing on preliminary objections was held on 23 through 25 February 2017 at the Australian Disputes Centre in Sydney (the \"Hearing\"). The following persons were present at the Hearing:\n\nTribunal\n\nProfessor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, President\n\nMr. Stephen Jagusch QC\n\nProfessor Campbell McLachlan QC\n\nAssistant to the Tribunal\n\nMr. Rahul Donde, L\u00e9vy Kaufmann-Kohler\n\nSecretary of the Tribunal\n\nMs. Lindsay Gastrell, ICSID Secretariat\n\nClaimants\n\n*Counsel:*\n\nDr. Gavan Griffith QC\n\nProfessor Chester Brown\n\nMr. Nicholas Briggs, Johnson Winter & Slattery\n\nMr. Tony Johnson, Johnson Winter & Slattery\n\n*Party/Witness* :\n\nMr. Albert Jacobs, Director, Lighthouse Corporation Pty Limited and Lighthouse Corporation Limited, IBC\n\n*Experts* :\n\nMr. Craig Macaulay, Korda Mentha Mr. Filipe Alfaiate (by video link), AFG\n\nRespondent\n\n*Counsel:*\n\nMr. Vernon Flynn QC, Essex Chambers\n\nMr. Jonathan Kay Hoyle, 11th Floor St. James Hall Chambers\n\nMr. Liam Prescott, DLA Piper\n\nMr. Joel Borgeaud, DLA Piper Ms. Emily Chalk, DLA Piper Mr. Stephen Webb, DLA Piper *Parties* :\n\nHis Excellency Hermenegildo Augusto Cabral Pereira, Minister of State and of the\n\nPresidency of the Council of Ministers\n\n*Witnesses* :\n\nHis Excellency Kay Rala Xanana Gusm\u00e2o, Minister for Planning and Strategic Investment (Former Prime Minister of Timor-Leste)\n\nHis Excellency Ambassador Abel Guterres, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Timor-Leste to Australia\n\n*Experts* :\n\nDr. Darren Hopkins, McGrathNicol\n\nMr. Nuno Marrazes, Da Silva Teixeira & Associados\n\n90.\n\nAt the opening of the Hearing, Mr. Jagusch QC and Professor McLachlan QC addressed the Parties' correspondence relating to their relationships with Dr. Griffith QC, whom the Claimants had recently retained as lead counsel. Mr. Jagusch QC and Professor McLachlan QC confirmed their independence and their ability to decide the Parties' dispute fairly and impartially. The Parties made no comments or reservations.\n\n91.\n\nBefore they proceeded to their opening statements, the Tribunal invited the Parties to make oral submissions on the following outstanding procedural matters: (a) the Claimants' objection to Mr. Prescott's Fifth Witness Statement, (b) proposed adjustments to the order of witness examination set out in Procedural Order No. 5, and (c) whether additional time would be needed for direct and/or cross-examination of Mr. Jacobs, Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o and possibly Mr. Prescott. The Tribunal also invited the Parties to address in their opening statements the consequences of Mr. Magee's non-appearance and withdrawal of his witness statements.\n\n92.\n\nAfter hearing the Parties' positions on the admissibility of Mr. Prescott's Fifth Witness Statement, the Tribunal decided not to admit the statement because it constituted evidence that could have been submitted earlier, and allowing it into the record at such a late stage would give rise to due process concerns. However, the Tribunal admitted certain exhibits to the statement: Exhibits R-164, R-178 (the compare version of the General Conditions, admitted as a demonstrative exhibit), R-180 and R-184.\n\n93.\n\nFollowing the Parties' opening statements, in which they addressed the consequences of Mr. Magee's non-appearance, the Tribunal decided that, because Mr. Magee had specifically indicated his intention to \"withdraw\" or \"revoke\" his witness statements, the Tribunal would disregard those statements, as well as the portions of the Parties' opening statements that referred to Mr. Magee's statements.\n\n94.\n\nOn the second day of the Hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties determined that the Hearing would need to continue into the following day, Saturday, 25 February 2017, which had been held in reserve.\n\n95.\n\nThe Hearing proceeded as planned and the Tribunal heard, in addition to opening statements, the testimony of Mr. Albert Jacobs, Mr. Filipe Alfaiate, Mr. Nuno Marrazes, His Excellency Ambassador Abel Guterres, His Excellency Kay Rala Xanana Gusm\u00e2o, Mr. Craig Macaulay and Mr. Darren Hopkins.\n\n96.\n\nAt the close of the Hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties discussed the further procedural steps, including transcript corrections, post-hearing briefs, and cost submissions. On 7 March 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, memorializing the Tribunal's directions on these matters.\n\n97.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 6, on 17 March 2017, the Parties submitted their agreed corrections to the transcript, which the court reporter subsequently entered into the final transcript.\n\n98.\n\nOn 18 April 2017, each Party submitted a Post-Hearing Brief (\"C-PHB\" and \"R-PHB\"). By letter of 25 April 2017, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 6, the Claimants applied for leave to file a Rebuttal Post-Hearing Brief to address two matters arising from the Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief. On the same day, the Respondent indicated that it would not seek leave to file a Rebuttal Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n99.\n\nBy letter of 27 April 2017, the Respondent sought leave to file an Answer to the Claimants' Rebuttal Post-Hearing Brief, if the Tribunal were to allow the Claimants to file such a Rebuttal.\n\n100.\n\nLater on 27 April 2017, the Tribunal granted the Claimants' request to file a Rebuttal Post-Hearing Brief, limited to the two matters identified in the Claimants' letter of 25 April 2017 and to a length of 10 pages. The Tribunal denied the Respondent's request for leave to file an Answer to the Claimants' Rebuttal because Procedural Order No. 6 had not contemplated sur-rebuttals, and the Tribunal saw no reason to introduce the possibility at that stage. In accordance with the Tribunal's instructions, on 5 May 2017, the Claimants filed their Rebuttal Post-Hearing Brief (\"C-RPHB\").\n\n101.\n\nOn 24 May 2017, each Party submitted its Statement of Costs.\n\n102.\n\nOn 22 December 2017, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**A. THE RESPONDENT'S REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent seeks the following declarations and orders from the Tribunal:\n\n\"a) there has been no consent by the Respondent to ICSID arbitration (Objection 1);\n\nb) there has been no \"investment\" for the purposes of the ICSID convention or the Timor-Leste Foreign Investment Law (Objection 2);\n\nc) the Claimants are not a \"Foreign Investor\" and do not hold a Special Investment Agreement for the purpose of the Foreign Investment Law (Objection 3);\n\nd) the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear or determine the Claimants' claims in this arbitration;\n\ne) the Claimants' claims in this arbitration be dismissed for want of jurisdiction; and\n\nf) the Claimants pay to the Respondent its costs of the arbitration and pay the Tribunal's fees.\"24\n\nR-PHB, para. 157; *see* Preliminary Objections, para. 6.\n\n**B. THE CLAIMANTS' REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimants ask the Tribunal to decide that:\n\n\"a. it has jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims,\n\nb. the Respondent's preliminary objections are rejected;\n\nc. the arbitration should proceed to the merits phase; and\n\nd. the Respondent be ordered to pay the Claimants' costs and the costs of the arbitration.\"25\n\nRej., para. 116; C-PHB, para. V; *see* C-Mem., para. 94.\n\n**V. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n105.\n\nPrior to considering the merits of the Parties' positions, the Tribunal will address the scope of this Award (A); the maxim *iura novit curia* (B); and the relevance of previous decisions or awards (C).\n\n**A. SCOPE OF THIS AWARD**\n--------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe present proceedings were bifurcated between jurisdiction/admissibility and merits in Procedural Order No. 3. The present Award thus addresses the Respondent's objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n107.\n\nThe Respondent has raised three objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction: the first two of which concern the Respondent's consent to ICSID jurisdiction. The Respondent challenges that it consented to ICSID arbitration as part of the Parties' contractual arrangements. It also disputes having given its consent to ICSID arbitration through the FIL. As a third objection, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have made no investment within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n108.\n\nIf upheld, the objections concerning the Respondent's consent to ICSID jurisdiction are dispositive of the Claimants' case. Further, if the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has not consented to ICSID, be it by contract or through the FIL, then it can dispense with determining whether the Claimants' investment satisfies the \"investment\" requirement of Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n**B.** ***I******URA*** ***N******OVIT*** ***C******URIA***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nWhen applying the governing law, the Tribunal is not bound by the arguments or sources invoked by the Parties. Under the maxim *iura novit curia* - or, better, *iura novit arbiter* -the Tribunal is required to apply the law of its own motion, provided always that it gives the Parties' an opportunity to comment if it intends to base its decision on a legal theory that was not addressed and that the Parties could not reasonably anticipate.26\n\n*Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Decision on Annulment, 7 January 2015, para. 295 (\"[...] an arbitral tribunal is not limited to referring to or relying upon only the authorities cited by the parties. It can, *sua sponte*, rely on other publicly available authorities, even if they have not been cited by the parties, provided that the issue has been raised before the tribunal and the parties were provided an opportunity to address it\"). *See also Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland)*, Merits, Judgment, 25 July 1974, para. 18 (\"[i]t being the duty of the Court itself to ascertain and apply the relevant law in the given circumstances of the case, the burden of establishing or proving rules of international law cannot be imposed upon any of the Parties, for the law lies within the judicial knowledge of the Court\"); *Albert Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. The Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL Case (\"*Oostergetel*\"), Award, 23 April 2012, para. 141; *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, para. 287.\n\n**C. RELEVANCE OF PREVIOUS DECISIONS AND AWARDS**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nIn support of their positions, the Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards, either to conclude that the same or similar approaches or solutions should be adopted in the present case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from an approach or a solution reached by another tribunal.\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the same time, it is of the opinion that it should pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. It believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it should be respectful of the reasoning and solutions established in a series of consistent cases. It also believes that, subject to the circumstances of an actual case, it has a duty to seek to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards certainty of the rule of law.\n\n**VI. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n112.\n\nIt is common ground that the Tribunal has the power to rule on its own jurisdiction and that the latter is governed by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which reads as follows:\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\"\n\n113.\n\nFor a tribunal to have jurisdiction under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, four conditions must be satisfied: (i) the arbitration must be between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State, (ii) there must be a legal dispute arising directly out of (iii) an investment, and (iv) the Contracting State and the investor must have consented in writing to ICSID arbitration. In addition, of course, the ICSID Convention must have been applicable at the relevant time.\n\n114.\n\nHere, the Claimants submit that the Respondent expressed its consent to arbitrate the present dispute before ICSID through Clause 18 of the Standard Terms and through Clause 17 of the December General Terms, both of which the Claimants' allege were incorporated into the Parties' contractual arrangements. The Claimants further allege that the Respondent also consented to ICSID arbitration in Article 23 of the FIL. The Respondent opposes both of these submissions, and adds that the Claimants' investment in Timor-Leste does not fall within the ambit of Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n115.\n\nThis section first discusses the law applicable to determine consent to ICSID jurisdiction (A), and then reviews the Respondent's arguments that it has not consented to ICSID jurisdiction ((B) and (C)) before turning to the Respondent's argument that the Claimants have not made an investment within the ambit of Article 25(1) of the Convention (D).\n\n**A. LAW GOVERNING CONSENT TO ICSID JURISDICTION**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Tribunal must first determine which law governs consent.\n\n**1. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n***a. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent's position is that \"consent is to be assessed by reference to the terms of the ICSID Convention in accordance with international law and ICSID tribunal practice\".27 Article 42 of the ICSID Convention28 specifies the law governing the merits and does not apply to jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, as confirmed by numerous ICSID tribunals.29\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 52.\n\nArticle 42(1) states: \"The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable\".\n\nReply, paras. 7-8, *citing* Exh.

Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005, para. 200.\n\n118.\n\nBased on a review of past ICSID cases, including in particular *CSOB v. Slovak Republic*30 and *Plama v. Bulgaria*,31 the Respondent proposes the following three principles of international law that are relevant to its jurisdictional objection:\n\n\"a) consent can be found only where the position is clear and unambiguous. Jurisdictional instruments (including, in this case, alleged contractual documents) should be construed neither restrictively nor expansively but in good faith by taking into account the consequences of the commitments the parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged;\n\nb) a State may not be compelled to submit disputes to arbitration without consent. Such consent cannot be assumed but must be established by an express declaration or by actions that demonstrate consent; and\n\nc) in order to ascertain the common will (or intention) of the parties to incorporate an arbitration agreement by reference, the Tribunal may have regard to a range of factors, including the negotiating history of the parties and general interpretive principles.\"32\n\nExh. RL-037, *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka SA v. Slovak Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999.\n\nExh. RL-065, *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005.\n\nReply, para. 9; *see* Preliminary Objections, paras. 53-64.\n\n119.\n\nFor the Respondent, it follows that the Claimants, who bear the burden of establishing consent, must show the Respondent's clear and unambiguous consent to ICSID arbitration based on all the circumstances.33\n\nReply, para. 10.\n\n*i. Consent Through Incorporation by Reference*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nIn respect of the incorporation of (i) Clause 18 of the Standard Terms and (ii) Clause 17 of the December General Terms into the Parties' contract, the Respondent insists that international law governs. The Claimants' reliance on the law of the State of Victoria to determine consent, as well as their reference to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (the \"Model Law\") is misplaced. The Model Law applies to commercial arbitration and is \"of tenuous relevance\" to ICSID arbitration.34\n\nReply, para. 14.\n\n121.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that, under the applicable principles of international law, \"a reference to something called the 'Standard Terms and Conditions' is not, and cannot be, determinative of whether the Respondent gave consent in the present case\".35 It relies in particular on *Plama*, which stated that:\n\n\"a reference may in and of itself not be sufficient; the reference is required to be such as to make the arbitration clause part of the contract...This is another way of saying that the reference must be such that the parties' intention to import the arbitration provision of the other agreement is clear and unambiguous.\"36\n\nReply, para. 10.\n\nExh. RL-065, *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005, para. 200. The Plama tribunal was considering the effect of an most-favored nation clause in the applicable bilateral investment treaty.\n\n122.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that written arbitration agreements may be entered into indirectly by reference to another instrument, and that such incorporation by reference is well established in international commercial arbitration.37 However, in this case, according to the Respondent, the \"indirect\" nature of the alleged incorporation is one factor, among others, that points toward *lack* of consent.38\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 56.\n\nReply, para. 11.\n\n123.\n\nIn this context, the Respondent notes the requirement in Article II(2) of the New York Convention that an arbitration agreement must be in writing. While a specific reference to an arbitration agreement is likely to satisfy the writing requirement, a reference to general conditions that contain an arbitration agreement is much less likely to do so.39 For the Respondent, in considering whether such a reference is effective, \"[t]he particular circumstances of the entry into the contract and the nature of the documents themselves are paramount\".40\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 57.\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 58.\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent's alternative position is that, even if the Tribunal applies the law of the State of Victoria, the Claimants still have failed to establish consent to ICSID arbitration.41 While a reference to a document containing the arbitration agreement (as opposed to an express reference to the arbitration agreement itself) may suffice to incorporate that arbitration agreement under Victorian law,42 the latter requires that the language used to incorporate the document be clear and unambiguous.43 In this regard, the Respondent cites to the New South Wales Supreme Court in *Charltons CJC Pty Ltd v Fitzgerald* :\n\n\"Whether a document is incorporated by reference is a question of construction. In effect, the court asks 'What did the parties agree to?' The approach to the resolution of that question requires the application of conventional principles. If the incorporated document is clearly identified, if the language of the incorporation is clear and if the objective intention is readily discernible, the court will usually be satisfied that the extraneous document has been incorporated.\"44\n\nReply, paras. 100 *et seq.*\n\nReply, para. 112.\n\nReply, para. 112.\n\nExh. RL-094, *Charltons CJC Pty Ltd v Fitzgerald*, [2013] NSWSC 350, para. 61.\n\n125.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, authorities cited by Claimants also support this approach. For example, the Supreme Court of Victoria in *Bogart Lingerie Ltd v Steadmark Pty Ltd* held that reference to terms and conditions \"may well be sufficient\" to incorporate specific clauses into the main contract, but it did not hold that such a reference would *necessarily* be sufficient.45 Instead, the court stated that \"it must be clear, from an objective analysis of the documents constituting the sales contracts, that the parties intended that the [...] clause be incorporated into the sales contracts\".46\n\nReply, paras. 107-108, *quoting* Exh. CL-053, *Bogart Lingerie Ltd v Steadmark Pty Ltd*, [2013] VSC 212, para. 30.\n\nReply, para. 109, *quoting* Exh. CL-053, *Bogart Lingerie Ltd v Steadmark Pty Ltd*, [2013] VSC 212, para. 30.\n\n126.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Supreme Court of Western Australia in *Carob Industries Pty Ltd v Simto Pty Ltd*, held no contrary opinion when accepting that an arbitration clause contained in standard terms and conditions had been incorporated into a construction subcontract.47 There, the contract at issue was a standard contract widely employed in that particular industry.48 The opposite is true in the present case, which \"centres on a series of bespoke contracts drafted by the Claimants\".49\n\nExh. CL-052, *Carob Industries Pty Ltd v Simto Pty Ltd*, (1997) 18 WAR, paras. 1, 15, 19.\n\nExh. CL-052, *Carob Industries Pty Ltd v Simto Pty Ltd*, (1997) 18 WAR, paras. 1, 15 (\"the fact that a submission to arbitration is a collateral self-contained contract within a more comprehensive agreement between the parties is no justification for denying it incorporation by reference when parties engaged in the industry for which the standard form contract has been developed expressly agree to contract on the terms of the standard form, which includes an arbitration clause\").\n\nReply, para. 106.\n\n*ii. Consent Through Domestic Law*\n----------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the practice of ICSID tribunals is relevant to the question of consent given through domestic law. In this case, the standing offer to arbitrate in Article 23 of the FIL is conditional, and the requirements contained therein are to be understood \"both for the purposes of the FIL and for the purposes of consent under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention\".50 The Respondent further submits that the Tribunal must turn to Timorese law to interpret the FIL.51 Portuguese law may assist to fill gaps in areas where Timorese law does not provide clear answers.52\n\nReply, para. 155.\n\nReply, para. 154 (\"Although the FIL controls the interaction between the Respondent and foreign inward investment, it does so as a matter of Timorese law. Timorese law will therefore be the principal basis on which to assess the meaning and effect of the foreign investment certificate requirements\").\n\nMarrazes ER 1, (\"Portuguese laws, doctrine and jurisprudence are of the essence to help interpreting the Timorese laws and filling the gaps in those laws\"); Tr. 244:11-26; R-PHB, para. 150.\n\n128.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the approach adopted by the Claimants' legal expert, Mr. Filipe Alfaiate. In particular, it disagrees with Mr. Alfaiate's willingness to go beyond the legal text and his reliance on government practice.53 For the Respondent, Mr. Alfaiate's evidence is \"a carefully structured attempt to reason backwards from the Claimants' desired position\", which led him to offer \"nothing more structured and principled than the proposition that the FIL could not be read literally and government practice was unclear\".54\n\nC-PHB, paras. 148-150. The Respondent states that in his testimony, \"Mr Alfaiate sometimes appealed to, or hinted at reliance upon, special knowledge about government practice to which he was privy that was not in evidence, could not be tested, and was in some way determinative of what were legal questions\". *Id.*, para. 148, *citing*, Tr. 217:13-46.\n\nC-PHB, para. 153, *citing* Tr. 214:47-215:1.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nThe Claimants put forward the following considerations to guide the Tribunal in analyzing the Respondent's consent under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention:\n\n\"a. The Tribunal should approach the issue of consent to the jurisdiction of ICSID in an even-handed way, i.e., adopting an approach which is neither expansive nor restrictive.\n\nb. There is no requirement that the Parties' consent be \"clear and unambiguous\".[55]\n\nc. It is permissible to incorporate an arbitration agreement by reference in international arbitration, including in ICSID arbitration, and in order to do so, it is not necessary that the arbitration agreement actually be provided.\n\nd. In reaching its decision on consent, the Tribunal must take into account the nature of the instrument which confers jurisdiction on ICSID.\"56\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's reliance on the statement in *Plama v. Bulgaria* that consent must be \"clear and unambiguous\". Exh. RL-065, *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005, para. 200. The Claimants state that the context of this decision (interpreting an MFN clause) is not applicable to the present case, and that, in any event, this statement has been \"repeatedly disapproved\". Rej., paras. 8-9.\n\nRej., para. 12 (footnotes omitted); C-PHB, para. 87 (footnotes omitted).\n\n*i. Consent Through Incorporation by Reference*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nFor the Claimants, the incorporation of Clause 18 of the Standard Terms and Clause 17 of the December General Terms into the Fuel Supply Agreement must be determined by application of Victorian law, which is the governing law of the Fuel Supply Agreement, the Standard Terms, and the General Terms.57\n\nC-Mem., paras. 7-9; Exh. C-192, Standard Terms, October 2010, Clause 17.1; Exh. C-132, October General Terms, Clause 19.1; Exh. C-200, December General Terms, Clause 19.1.\n\n131.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimants accept that Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention must be interpreted in accordance with international law.58 However, where the parties' consent is contained in a contract governed by domestic law, the relevant question is \"whether the contract is an effective means of providing consent (as interpreted under the relevant system of domestic law) with the result that the question of consent for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is satisfied\".59 The Claimants submit that this approach is consistent with previous ICSID cases, including those cited by the Respondent.60\n\nC-Mem., para. 7, *citing* Exh. RL-037, *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka SA v Slovakia,* ICSID Case No ARB/97/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, para. 35.\n\nC-Mem., para. 7.\n\nRej., para. 6, *citing* Exh.

Ecuador*, ICSID Case No ARB/06/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, 5 March 2008, paras. 85-118 (analysing the terms of the applicable contractual agreements to determine jurisdiction).\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimants note that the UNCITRAL Model Law,61 which is enacted into the law of Victoria, covers arbitration agreements entered into by way of incorporation.62 Specifically, Article 7(6) (Option 1), provides as follows:\n\n\"The reference in a contract to any document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement in writing, provided that the reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract.\"63\n\nThe Claimants cite the 1985 version of the UNCITRAL Model Law, as well as the revised version of 2006. Exh. CL-061, UNCITRAL Model Law (1985); Exh. CL-062, UNCITRAL Model Law (2006).\n\nC-Mem., paras. 11-12, *citing* Exh.

CL-061, UNCITRAL Model Law (1985), Article 7(2) (\"The reference in a contract to a document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement provided that the contract is in writing and the reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract\").\n\n133.\n\nThe Claimants then cite to the UNCITRAL Explanatory Note, which clarifies \"that applicable contract law remains available to determine the level of consent necessary for a party to become bound by an arbitration agreement allegedly made 'by reference'\",64 Which, for the Claimants, confirms that incorporation by reference is subject to the law of Victoria.65\n\nExh. CL-063, Explanatory Note by the UNCITRAL Secretariat on the 1985 Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration as Amended in 2006 (2008), para. 19.\n\nC-Mem., para. 17.\n\n134.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Timor-Leste advances a \"false distinction\" between \"express reference to an arbitration agreement and an indirect reference in standard terms\".66 Timor-Leste is wrong, the Claimants say, for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022 This distinction adopted in some English decisions, applies only in \"two-contract cases\", which involve (i) one contract containing the substantive obligations between the parties to the dispute, and (ii) a second contract containing the arbitration agreement, which is between either one of the parties and a third party, or two third parties. The principle is applied to the question of whether the arbitration agreement in the second contract can be incorporated into the first. It is inapposite in the present case because there is only one contract at issue.67\n\n\u2022 In any event, this approach has not been followed by Australian courts.68\n\nC-Mem., paras. 18-39.\n\nC-Mem., paras. 18-31, citing Exh.

CL-052, Carob Industries Pty Ltd v Simto Pty Ltd (1997) 18 WAR 1, 15.\n\n136.\n\nContrary to the Respondent's position, the Claimants argue that this principle is particularly relevant in the present case, in light of the widespread use of international arbitration in international energy contracts.71\n\nRej., para. 20, *citing* Exh.

Philippines* :\n\n\"[W]hen the question is whether the investment is made in accordance with the law of the host State, considerable arguments maybe made in favour of construing jurisdiction *ratione materiae* in a more liberal way which is generous to the investor.

Philippines,* ICSID Case No ARB/03/25, Award, 16 August 2007, para. 396.\n\n139.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, this approach is particularly apposite in the present case because the Respondent's \"nascent legal system is still prone to omissions, contradictions, and in many cases, a marked distance between what is established in Law and the practice\".77\n\nRej., para. 90; Alfaiate ER 1, para. 21.\n\n140.\n\nThe Claimants agree with the Respondent that, in order to interpret the FIL, the Tribunal must resort to Timorese law.78 However, they dismiss the Respondent's literal interpretation of the FIL.79 In the Claimants' view, \"you also have to take into account the structure of the legal system, custom and practice, among other things and its evolution since independence\".80\n\nRej., para. 95; Alfaiate ER 1, para. 16 (\"the solution should be found. within the Timorese legal system rules and general principles of Law of Timorese Law\").\n\nRej., paras. 94-97.\n\nC-PHB, para. 113.\n\n**2. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n141.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention requires the parties to the dispute to 'consent in writing' to submit their dispute to the Centre. It does not further specify the manner in which such consent is to be given. In the present case, consent is alleged to be given through incorporation by reference into the relevant contracts of an ICSID arbitration clause contained in other documents (a below) and through a provision in domestic legislation (b below).\n\n***a. Consent Through Incorporation by Reference***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nThe requirement of written consent is embodied in an international treaty and is one of the conditions necessary to establish ICSID jurisdiction. The determination of whether this condition has been met is governed by international law. The tribunal in *CSOB v.**Slovakia*, for instance, so held. There, the parties had entered into a contract, the Consolidation Agreement, which provided that it would be governed by Czech law and by the bilateral investment treaty between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. The treaty in turn provided for ICSID arbitration.81 The CSOB tribunal applied international law to determine whether the reference to the treaty in the Consolidation Agreement was effective for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the Convention:\n\n\"The question of whether the parties have effectively expressed their consent to ICSID jurisdiction is not to be answered by reference to national law. It is governed by international law as set out in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"82\n\nExh. RL-037, *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka SA v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, para. 49.\n\nExh. RL-037, *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka SA v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, para. 35.\n\n143.\n\nHere, the Claimants submit that the Respondent has consented to ICSID arbitration because the Standard Terms (and the December General Terms), which contain an ICSID arbitration clause, were incorporated into the relevant contractual framework. While the Respondent accepts that an arbitration agreement may be entered into by reference to another instrument,83 it disagrees that it has consented to ICSID arbitration in this particular instance.\n\nReply, para. 10.\n\n144.\n\nIncorporation by reference of an arbitration clause into a contract is indeed one of the methods by which contracting parties can express their agreement to arbitrate future disputes; in other words, it is a method of expressing consent.84\n\nThe Parties appear to agree - and rightly so - that incorporation by reference is a substantive requirement of validity of the arbitration agreement, not a formal requirement (Mem., para. 63; C-Mem., para. 16). There is no dispute that there is a writing.\n\n145.\n\nIn the ICSID context, the *CSOB* tribunal referred to above held that the reference in the Consolidation Agreement to the bilateral investment treaty, which contained an ICSID dispute settlement provision, was sufficient to incorporate that provision into the relevant framework and fulfill the requirement of consent under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. In reaching this conclusion, the tribunal paid particular attention to the parties' conduct while entering into the Consolidation Agreement, reviewing *inter alia* the negotiating history of the agreement. It noted that the parties had discussed arbitration and that the respondent had specifically rejected domestic arbitration. Based on this analysis, the tribunal concluded that by referring to the BIT, the parties intended to incorporate into the Consolidation Agreement the ICSID arbitration clause of the BIT.85 It found comfort in this conclusion from the fact that the provisions of the BIT were known to the contract negotiators on both sides.86\n\nExh. RL-037, *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka SA v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, para. 53 (\"The negotiating history of the clause under consideration thus indicates that the issue of the dispute settlement method had been discussed by the parties and that the proposal to resort to domestic arbitration in the Czech Republic had been rejected by the Slovak party. These considerations support Claimant's contention that the parties eventually agreed on international arbitration. In the absence of a separate dispute resolution provision, the reference to the BIT satisfies the requirement that international arbitration, as specified in its Article 8, is the agreed dispute resolution mechanism\").\n\nExh. RL-037, *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka SA v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, para. 55 (\"The Tribunal concludes, therefore, that by referring to the BIT, the parties intended to incorporate Article 8 of the BIT by reference into the Consolidation Agreement, in order to provide for international arbitration as their chosen dispute-settlement method. *The soundness of this conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the provisions of the BIT were well known to the negotiators for both parties*\") (emphasis added).\n\n146.\n\nIn *Plama*,87 reviewing the incorporation of the dispute resolution provision of another treaty into the base treaty through a most-favored nation clause, the tribunal referred to the UNCITRAL Model Law's provision on incorporation (then Article 7(2) and now 7(6)), which reads as follows:\n\n\"The reference in a contract to a document containing an arbitration clause constitutes an arbitration agreement provided that the contract is in writing and the reference is such as to make that clause part of the contract.\"\n\nExh. RL-065, *Plama Consortium Limited v. The Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005.\n\n147.\n\nThe reference to the UNCITRAL provision is helpful because it shows a transnational consensus allowing for the conclusion of arbitration agreements by way of incorporation. The *Plama* tribunal read into that provision a requirement that the parties' incorporation intent must be \"clear and unambiguous\".88 This is not the meaning which UNCITRAL itself assigns to it.89 Neither is it in line with the general rule in international law, set out among others in *Amco v. Indonesia, SPP v. Egypt* and *CSOB*, according to which an agreement to arbitrate \"is not to be construed restrictively nor, as a matter of fact, broadly or literally. It is to be construed in a way that leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties\".90\n\nExh. RL-065, *Plama Consortium Limited v. The Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2005, para. 200.\n\nFor UNCITRAL, this provision \"clarifies that applicable contract law\" - in the context of ICSID arbitration, this must read international law - \"remains available to determine the level of consent necessary for a party to become bound by an arbitration agreement allegedly made 'by reference'\". Exh. CL-063, *Explanatory Note by the UNCITRAL Secretariat on the 1985 Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration as Amended in 2006* (2008), para. 19.\n\nExh. RL-037, *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka SA v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, para. 34, *quoting* Exh. CL-030, *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Award on Jurisdiction, 25 September 1983; *see also* Exh. RL-076, *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 April 1998, paras. 143-144 and *Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008, paras. 129 *et seq*.\n\n148.\n\nIn its analysis below, the Tribunal will thus review the facts to determine whether it was \"the common will\" of the Parties to consent to ICSID jurisdiction. It will do so \"neither restrictively\" nor \"broadly or literally\". The Tribunal recalls that consent cannot be presumed; it must be established by an express manifestation of intent or implicitly by conduct that demonstrates consent. Further, the burden of proving the existence of consent is on the Claimants, as they are the ones asserting jurisdiction.\n\n***b. Consent Through Domestic Law***\n-------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that the Respondent consented to ICSID jurisdiction through Article 23 of the FIL, which the Respondent denies.\n\n150.\n\nHere again, the Tribunal must start by determining the applicable legal principles to assess whether the FIL satisfies the requirement of consent under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n151.\n\nIt is well established that legislation expressing consent to ICSID jurisdiction constitutes a unilateral declaration of a state formulated in relation to a treaty, and that it must therefore be interpreted as such. This means that - in the words of the *Tidewater* tribunal - \"the declaration must be interpreted in good faith 'as it stands, having regard to the words actually used' and further 'in a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the State concerned.'\"91 In this context, domestic law may play a \"useful role\"92 in determining the intention of the state.\n\nExh. RL-0079, *Tidewater Inc & Others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No.ARB/10/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2013, para. 102(5).\n\nExh. CL-12, *Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings BV and others v. Bolivarian Republic Of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, para. 96(i).\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimants insist that jurisdictional provisions should be construed liberally, relying on *Fraport,* which was quoted above and advocates in favor of a \"liberal\" interpretation, \"generous to the investor\".93 The Tribunal believes that the relevant provisions of the FIL, which are reproduced below, are clear, with the consequence that there is no need to resort to any interpretation of the legislators' intent. The Tribunal can simply apply the language of the legislation as it reads.94\n\nExh. RL-048, *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Award, 16 August 2007, para. 396.\n\nThe *Desert Line* Tribunal also suggested that there was no need for interpretation when the relevant provisions were clear, i.e. when they identified the type of document required for a foreign entity to qualify as a foreign investor and identified the department issuing the document. Exh. RL-045, *Desert Line Projects LLC v. Republic of Yemen*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award, 6 February 2008, para. 109.\n\n153.\n\nThis said, the Tribunal has not ignored Mr. Alfaiate's cautionary observation that a literal interpretation may lead to \"results that are not in line with the system\".95 In its analysis, the Tribunal has been careful to avoid this outcome, in particular by considering the intentions of the state, by giving due regard to the context of the FIL and by considering relevant subsequent practice.\n\nTr. Day 2, 211:4-19.\n\n154.\n\nHaving set out the applicable law to determine whether the Respondent has consented to ICSID jurisdiction, the Tribunal now proceeds to review the Respondent's jurisdictional objections in sections (B)-(D) below.\n\n**B. CONSENT TO ICSID ARBITRATION IN THE FUEL SUPPLY AGREEMENT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n***a. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nThe Respondent's first objection is that it did not consent to ICSID arbitration in the Fuel Supply Agreement. The Respondent argues that (i) the contractual documents upon which the Claimants rely do not show that the Parties agreed to incorporate the Standard Terms into the Fuel Supply Agreement; (ii) there is no evidence that the Respondent was ever made aware of the Standard Terms; and (iii) the ICSID arbitration provision in the Standard Terms was superseded by Clause 18 of the General Terms.96 It also disputes the existence of the Standard Terms and the December General Terms in the period between October and December 2010.\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 52.\n\n*i. Whether the Standard Terms were Incorporated into the Fuel Supply Agreement*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to establish that the Standard Terms and the ICSID arbitration clause they contain were incorporated by reference into the Fuel Supply Agreement.97 More specifically, the Respondent offers the following support for this claim:\n\n\u2022 The Respondent did not sign or initial the Standard Terms or any other document to which the Standard Terms were attached.98\n\n\u2022 The first reference to the Standard Terms on which the Claimants rely is in an unsigned ancillary document, the Contribution Summary, which states that \"Lighthouse 'Standard Terms and Conditions Applying to the Sale of Goods' will apply\".99 The Claimants allege an obscure two-step incorporation: first, incorporation of the Standard Terms into the Contribution Summary and, second, incorporation of the Contribution Summary into the Supply Agreement.100 The Standard Terms were not attached to either document.101\n\n\u2022 The references in the Second and Third Agreements are to an \"attached\" document titled \"*Standard Terms & Conditions of Supply*\".102 However, the Standard Terms were not attached to either the Second or Third Agreement.103\n\n\u2022 As described further below, the Respondent never received the Standard Terms.104 In addition, there is no contemporaneous document that refers to any specific clause of the Standard Terms. Thus, there is no evidence that the Standard Terms existed in November or December 2010, other than Mr. Jacob's testimony which is not to be believed, and emails from Mr. Albert Jacobs, which are inauthentic.105\n\n\u2022 There is no evidence that the Parties ever discussed the resolution of disputes through ICSID arbitration.106\n\nReply, paras. 20 *et seq.* The references on which the Claimants rely are set out in Section VI.B.1.b below.\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 67, 69.\n\nExh.

This is again referred to on Page 3, under STORAGE\". While the Standard Terms do not contain any such provisions, they appear on pages 2 and 3 of the First Agreement.117\n\n\u2022 Similarly, the letter of 8 February 2011 from the Claimants to the Respondent mentions specific provisions contained in the \"Standard Terms & Conditions Applying to the Sale of Goods\" that do not appear in the Standard Terms, but are in fact contained in the First Agreement and the General Terms.118\n\nReply, para. 26; Exh.

C-088, Supply Agreement, 22 October 2010, p. 3 (item \"PAYMENT\" provides that payment is to be made by way of letter of credit against normal shipping document).\n\n158.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the Claimants have failed to show that the three references to \"Standard Terms & Conditions\" identify the Standard Terms without ambiguity.119 Thus, there is no basis on which to conclude that the Respondent consented to ICSID arbitration under international law.\n\nReply, para. 27.\n\n159.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the language of the three references on which the Claimants rely is insufficiently clear to establish the objective intention of the Parties to incorporate the Standard Terms.\n\n160.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent denies that the Contribution Summary was incorporated into the Supply Agreement by the language: \"please evaluate this proposal in conjunction with our state-of-the-art [Contribution Summary], attached as an addendum to this document\".120 It advances the following facts in support for this position:\n\n\u2022 The reference to the Contribution Summary is expressed as a polite request, rather than binding, contractual language.121 The meaning of the words is to invite the Respondent to consider the Contribution Summary.\n\n\u2022 The documents do not use the word \"incorporation\" or any similar term.122\n\n\u2022 The content of the Contribution Summary shows that the Parties could not have intended to incorporate it into the Supply Agreement as contractual terms.123\n\n\u2022 The language of the Supply Agreement itself \"raises considerable doubt about whether, on its own terms, [it] was binding or whether it was simply to form an integral part of future contracts\".124\n\nReply, para. 119; Exh.

It draws particular attention to the testimony of Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o, who could not recall being provided with a blue folder or the Standard Terms.132\n\nReply, para. 37.\n\nGusm\u00e2o WS, paras. 8-12; Tr. 317:26-320:11.\n\n167.\n\nThe Respondent dismisses Mr. Jacobs' testimony on this point, asserting that his recollection of providing the Standard Terms to the Prime Minister is unsupported.133 Moreover, he has offered the following three different versions of the meeting:134\n\n\u2022 In his Third and Fourth Witness Statements, Mr. Jacobs' testimony was that he printed the contractual documents at a local printer in Dili and put them in a blue folder, which he took to the meeting and gave to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o. Mr. Jacobs stated that he went over the documents with the Prime Minister, but did not mention any discussion of the ICSID clause.135\n\n\u2022 In his Sixth Witness Statement and at the Hearing, Mr. Jacobs testified that he and Mr. Magee printed the documents using a printer they purchased in Dili, after trying unsuccessfully to have them commercially printed. Mr. Jacobs allegedly brought five blue folders to the meeting, and discussed the documents one by one with the Prime Minister for two hours, specifically noting the importance of the ICSID arbitration clause. Mr. Jacobs also stated that he left the meeting with a copy of the documents, showing annotations that he and the Prime Minister had made.136\n\n\u2022 On the day before the Hearing, Mr. Jacobs offered for the first time a new detail (presumably to explain why the documents allegedly provided to the Respondent on 20 October 2010 were dated 22 October 2010): the Prime Minister planned to hold a signing ceremony two days after the 20 October 2010 meeting.137\n\nReply, para. 38, *citing* Jacobs WS 4, paras. 4-7.\n\nR-PHB, paras. 79-80.\n\nR-PHB, para. 82, *citing* Jacobs WS 4, paras. 6-7.\n\nR-PHB, para. 83.\n\nR-PHB, para. 84; *see* Jacobs WS 7, paras. 8-9.\n\n168.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, this \"story is constructed on a large number of implausibilities, inconsistencies and contradictions\", such as the method of printing, the number of folders, the annotations on the documents and the purpose of the meeting.138 Thus, the Respondent states that Mr. Jacobs' evidence is \"at the very least, unreliable\" and must be disregarded.139\n\nR-PHB, para. 49.\n\nR-PHB, para. 45.\n\n\u2022 Second Jacobs Email (Exhibit C-148)\n-------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the Claimants' allegation that Mr. Jacobs sent the Second Jacobs Email to Mr. Magee on 27 November 2010 with a copy of the Standard Terms attached (Exhibit C-148),140 and that Mr. Magee then forwarded that email to Mr. Oliveira.141 The Respondent denies that Mr. Magee ever provided Mr. Oliveira with the attachments to the Second Jacobs Email142 and stresses that the Claimants have presented no documentary evidence in support of this allegation.143\n\nExh. C-148, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee of 27 November 2010, with subject 'Timor-Leste Fuel Supply Variation Documents for Execution'.\n\nMr. Jacobs sent the first email of 27 November 2010 at 9:14 am. It states that he is attaching \"essential documentation for execution\" and attaching (i) the Addendum, Nomination & Variation Agreement, (ii) the Special Conditions, and (iii) the \"Bonus Period Election Form\". Exh. C-147, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee titled of 27 November 2010, with subject 'Timor-Leste Fuel Supply Variation Documents for Execution'. The second email, allegedly sent at 9:18 am, requests Mr. Magee to provide additional documents to Mr. Abrao Oliveira and attaches (i) a document entitled \"General Definitions\", (ii) the Standard Terms, and (iii) a \"Lighthouse Energy Guide to I.C.C Incoterms 2000\". Exh. C-148, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee of 27 November 2010, with subject 'Timor-Leste Fuel Supply Variation Documents for Execution'.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the evidence shows that Mr. Magee emailed the documents attached to Mr. Jacob's *first* email to Ambassador Guterres on 28 November 2016. Preliminary Objections, para. 85; Reply, para. 45; Exh. R-120, Email from Sean Magee to Ambassador Abel Guterres of 28 November 2010. However, the Claimants are unable produce a copy of the Second Jacobs Email from Mr. Magee's inbox.\n\nReply, paras. 43-44.\n\n170.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent submits that the Second Jacobs Email is fabricated and did not exist on 27 November 2010, when it was allegedly sent.144 In the Respondent's view, the Claimants' evidence is internally inconsistent, inherently implausible and irreconcilable with the expert evidence.145\n\nReply, paras. 62, 68 *et seq.* ; R-PHB, paras. 48 *et seq.*\n\nR-PHB, para. 56 and Schedule A, 33-36.\n\n171.\n\nAs to the alleged inconsistency, the Respondent highlights details of Mr. Jacobs' \"first version of events\" set out in his Fifth Witness Statement: Mr. Jacobs stated that after he sent his first email of 27 November 2010 to Mr. Magee (the \"First Jacobs Email\"), he left the St. Kilda office to go to a meeting at the Winsor Hotel, for which he was late; on his way, he called one of his staff members, Yuliana, and dictated the Second Jacobs Email with instructions to send it Mr. Magee on Mr. Jacobs' behalf.146\n\nR-PHB, paras. 48-50.\n\n172.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Mr. Jacobs' testimony at the Hearing added critical details that were absent from, and inconsistent with, his written statements. For example, he testified that before calling Yuliana from his car, he received a call from Mr. Magee requesting documents missing from the First Jacobs Email; his meeting was at the Westin Hotel, not the Winsor; and Yuliana drafted the email herself.147\n\nR-PHB, para. 56.\n\n173.\n\nMore generally, the Respondent argues that the whole account of what happened between 9:14 am, when Mr. Jacobs sent the First Jacobs Email, and 9:18 am, when Yuliana allegedly sent the Second Jacobs Email, is inherently implausible:\n\n\"The essence of that implausibility is that Mr Jacobs asks the Tribunal to accept that, ***within a period of 240 seconds***, he was able to go to his car, start driving, receive a call from Mr Magee whilst driving, discuss with Mr Magee the specific documents that needed to be sent, make a new call to Yuliana, inform her of what needed to be done and Yuliana then access [sic] the relevant documents, identify the previous email Mr Jacobs had sent, select the Monash University Address signature, draft the email and send it.\"148\n\nR-PHB, para. 55 (emphasis in original; footnotes omitted).\n\n174.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent relies on a report of its forensic expert Darren Hopkins to advance, *inter alia*, the following allegations of technological irregularities with the Second Jacobs Email:\n\n\u2022 The Claimants' office address as it appears in the Second Jacobs Email is different from the address used in the First Jacobs Email. The Claimants did not occupy the address indicated in the Second Jacobs Email (at Monash University) until mid- or late 2011.149 As of the date of the Second Jacobs Email, an unrelated third party occupied that address.150 Subsequent emails that Mr. Jacobs sent did not display the address at Monash University.151 The first email which the Respondent received with this address was dated 30 June 2013.152\n\n\u2022 There are several other discrepancies between the Second Jacobs Email and authentic contemporaneous emails sent by Mr. Jacobs, such as the formatting of the email addresses, the language (US English rather than Australian English), the time zone, and the font.153\n\n\u2022 The underlying metadata of the Second Jacobs Email reveals that the attachments to the Second Jacobs Email were attached on 21 April 2016, which is clearly inconsistent with the date on which it was allegedly sent.154\n\n\u2022 Mr. Jacobs' testimony that the time stamp on the Second Jacobs Email was the time that it left the outbox, rather than the time it was sent, is contradicted by the experts' joint evidence given at the Hearing.155\n\nReply, paras. 68-69; Exh.

C-198, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee and Ambassador Abel Guterres of 7 December 2010.\n\n176.\n\nAmbassador Guterres testified that he never received the Further Jacobs Email.157 In addition, the Respondent finds it suspicious that the Claimants submitted the Further Jacobs Email for the first time with the Counter-Memorial, after the Respondent had raised its Preliminary Objections.158\n\nGuterres WS 2, paras. 7(a) and 8; Tr. 404:4-406:19; Tr. 405:12-406:7.\n\nReply, para. 51; R-PHB, paras. 61-64.\n\n177.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Further Jacobs Email and its attachments did not even exist on the date they were allegedly sent:\n\n\u2022 As with the Second Jacobs Email, the Further Jacobs Email displays an address which is not shown on contemporaneous emails and at premises which the Claimants did not occupy in December 2010.159\n\n\u2022 An attachment to the Further Jacobs Email displays a DOC ID number in a format that does not appear on any of the Claimants' documentation from that time. The Claimants did not begin to insert that form of DOC ID until 2012.160\n\n\u2022 There are multiple formatting inconsistencies between the attachments contained in the PDF version of the Further Jacobs Email that Claimants submitted as Exhibit C-198 and the electronic copy that Claimants subsequently produced.161\n\n\u2022 The underlying metadata of the Further Jacobs Email reveals that the attachments were attached on 16 June 2016.162\n\n\u2022 There are several other discrepancies between the Further Jacobs Email and authentic contemporaneous emails sent by Mr. Jacobs, such as the formatting of the email addresses, language, time zone, and font.163\n\nReply, para. 82; Exh.

Mr. Jacobs' written testimony contained no detail in this regard.164 Then, at the Hearing, he offered \"an entirely new story\" that he created the Further Jacobs Email by forwarding the Second Jacobs Email.165 The Respondent alleges that Mr. Jacobs invented this story only to explain why the characteristics of those two emails differ from all the other emails that the Claimants sent.166 Furthermore, that story fundamentally contradicts Mr. Jacob's testimony about Yuliana sending the Second Jacobs Email.167\n\nR-PHB, paras. 65-66.\n\nR-PHB, para. 68.\n\nR-PHB, paras. 66-71, n. 64.\n\nR-PHB, paras. 72-76. The Respondent states that the metadata of Exh. C-148 and Exh. C-198 suggests that they were sent from the same computer; yet, Mr. Jacobs' testimony is that Yuliana sent Exh. C-148 from her own computer and that he sent Exh. C-198 from his computer.\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that there is no credible evidence showing that it was ever provided with a copy or made aware of the Standard Terms (or the December General Terms); in such circumstances, the Tribunal cannot find that the Respondent consented to ICSID arbitration.168\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 76.\n\n*iii. Whether the General Terms Displaced the Standard Terms*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Respondent's alternative position is that, even if the Standard Terms were somehow incorporated into the Fuel Supply Agreement (which it denies), the Standard Terms were displaced by the September or October General Terms, which do *not* contain an ICSID arbitration clause.169\n\nPreliminary Objections, paras. 72 *et seq.* ; Reply, paras. 30 *et seq.*\n\n181.\n\nFor the Respondent, it is telling that the Claimants created the General Terms by modifying the Respondent's General Conditions of Contract, as made evident by a comparison of the documents.170 The September and October General Terms provide for the resolution of disputes by means other than arbitration, which the Respondent considers consistent with the dealings between the Parties in 2010 before they entered into the Fuel Supply Agreement.171\n\nPreliminary Objections, paras. 72-74; R-PHB, paras. 106-107; Exh. R-178, Comparison between Government's General Conditions of Contract and General Terms (September). The Respondent argues that this comparison undermines Mr. Jacobs' testimony that the General Terms arose out of the relationship with Cummins, and were not based on the Respondent's standard terms. R-PHB, paras. 106-107.\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 75; Exh. R-118, Email from Ambassador Abel Guterres to Sean Magee of 12 April 2010.\n\n182.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the September or October General Terms were incorporated by reference into the Addendum, Nomination and Variation, and that the latter prevail because the Addendum, Nomination and Variation was executed last in time, and by its terms, the Addendum, Nomination and Variation prevails over prior inconsistent terms.172 Indeed, on the Claimants' own case, the Second and Third Agreements referred to and attached the General Terms.173\n\nPreliminary Objections, paras. 70-71, *citing* Exh. C-095, Addendum, Nomination and Variation, 26 November 2010 (\"Any previous Addendum, Nomination and Variation is subject to this one, in all its parts, and any conflict in terms, definitions, charges, meanings or otherwise, shall surrender to those stipulated by this Addendum, Nomination and Variation\").\n\nReply, para. 32.\n\n183.\n\nThe Respondent challenges the Claimants' contention that Clause 2.2 of the Standard Terms overrides the dispute resolution clause in the General Terms.174 The words \"protections at law\" contained in that provision refer only to protections arising by *operation of law*. This would not include the Parties' alleged consent to ICSID arbitration, because such consent through a commercial agreement would arise by *operation of contract*.175\n\nReply, para. 33. Exh. C-192, Standard Terms, Clause 2.2 (\"Application of these Standard Terms & Conditions shall not detract from the provision of other applicable terms and conditions provided by the Seller, in so far as a conflict does not occur. When any conflict occurs, the specific terms shall override these standard terms, so long as they do not remove the afforded protections at law provided by these minimum standard terms and conditions herein\").\n\nReply, para. 33.\n\n184.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the Claimants' reliance on the December General Terms, which included an ICSID arbitration clause.176 First, it emphasizes that the Claimants did not raise this alleged basis of the Parties' consent to ICSID arbitration in the Request for Arbitration, or in any other submission before the Counter-Memorial.177\n\nReply, paras. 47 *et seq.* ; Exh. C-200, General Terms, December 2010.\n\nReply, para. 57; R-PHB, paras. 25-29.\n\n185.\n\nSecond, the Respondent points out that, on the Claimants' own case, the December General Terms were not provided to the Respondent with the Third Agreement on 27 November 2010. In an attempt to show that the Respondent was made aware of the December General Terms before the execution of the Third Agreement, Mr. Jacobs offers the vague assertion that the December General Terms were \"provided to Timor-Leste on or about Monday, 29 November 2010\".178 This assertion is denied and considered inconsistent with the date of the December General Terms.179\n\nReply, para. 55, *quoting* Jacobs WS 4, para. 13.\n\nReply, n. 73.\n\n186.\n\nThird, the Respondent states that there is no evidence of any negotiations or agreement concerning the amendment of the October General Terms to include an entirely new dispute resolution clause.180\n\nReply, paras. 55-56.\n\n187.\n\nFourth, the Respondent disputes that Mr. Jacobs provided the December General Terms to Ambassador Guterres (along with the Standard Terms) in the Further Jacobs Email.181 Its position is that the Further Jacobs Email was fabricated, and that the December General Terms did not exist at the relevant time.182\n\nReply, paras. 59, 81 *et seq.*\n\n*See* Section VI.B.1.a.ii above and Section VI.B.1.a.iv below.\n\n*iv. Whether the Standard Terms and December General Terms Existed in**October-December 2010*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, in light of the fabrication of the Second and Further Jacobs Emails, the Tribunal should find that neither the Standard Terms nor the December General Terms existed in the relevant period of October to December 2010; therefore, these documents cannot establish the Respondent's consent to ICSID arbitration.183\n\nReply, paras. 95 *et seq.* ; R-PHB, paras. 97 *et seq.* and Schedule A, 18-31.\n\n189.\n\nIn addition to the arguments summarized above, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants never mentioned the Standard Terms or the December General Terms in any correspondence with the Respondent or third parties.184 To cite one example, the document that Mr. Magee sent to Mr. Jacobs on 4 February 2011 titled \"RDTL -Lighthouse Summary of Agreement Documents\" summarizes every contractual document except the Standard Terms and December General Terms.185\n\nReply, para. 96.\n\nExh. R-141, Email from Sean Magee to Albert Jacobs of 4 February 2011. *See also* Exh. R-140, Email from Sean Magee to Fernando Torrao of 14 December 2010, with subject \"Folder 3 of 4 Complete executed set of RDTL - Lighthouse contracts\" (sending a bank representative all of the contractual documents (including the September General Terms), except the Standard Terms and December General Terms); Exh. R-121, Email from Mr. Magee to Ambassador Guterres of 21 December 2010 (stating that \"[t]here are a total of NINE documents which constitute the Contract, together, they represent the ENTIRE CONTRACT\" and listing nine documents, not including the Standard Terms and December General Terms).\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent challenges the oral testimony of Mr. Jacobs on this issue. Mr. Jacobs characterized the Standard Terms (and the ICSID arbitration clause) as part of the Claimants' long-established practice in fuel trading transactions.186 However, certain \"difficulties\" are identified by the Respondent:\n\n\u2022 The Standard Terms are derived directly from the Cummins \"Terms and Conditions Applying to the Sale of Goods\", which are part of a Cummins Commercial Trading Supply Application form that Mr. Jacobs signed on 23 March 2011.187\n\n\u2022 The Standard Terms \"are cast in terms that are consistent with the Australian domestic market... and unsuitable for the international market\".188\n\n\u2022 Many of the terms in the Standard Terms are inconsistent with fuel trading transactions.189\n\n\u2022 The Claimants apparently applied the Standard Terms (and the ICSID clause) in transactions with private parties, as Mr. Jacobs had no recollection of contracting with a State.190\n\nR-PHB, para. 99, *citing* Tr. 83:17-103:35.\n\nR-PHB, paras. 101-102; Exh. R-078, Cummins, Commercial Trading Supply Application Terms of Trade Agreement, 23 March 2011. Respondent identifies several clauses in the Standard Terms that are identical, or nearly identical, to the Cummins Terms and Conditions.\n\nR-PHB, para. 103.\n\nR-PHB, para. 104.\n\nR-PHB, para. 104(b)-(c).\n\n191.\n\nThus, for the Respondent, the Standard Terms are \"a hastily assembled borrowing of domestic commercial standard terms, adopted long after the time of the proposed contract to which they purported to relate and never actually provided to the Respondent\".191\n\nR-PHB, para. 105.\n\n192.\n\nThe Respondent similarly rejects Mr. Jacobs' evidence about the General Terms, as summarized above.192\n\n*See* Section VI.B.1.a.iii above.\n\n193.\n\nMore generally, the Respondent argues that the following correspondence from the Claimants regarding this dispute is inconsistent with the existence of an ICSID arbitration clause:\n\n\u2022 An email of 30 January 2011 from Mr. Magee to Ambassador Guterres, stating that the Claimants would \"immediately seek Judgement for Specific Performance\" in the Supreme Court of Victoria\".193\n\n\u2022 An email of 8 February 2011 from the Claimants to the Respondent stating that failure to perform contractual obligations would require \"lawful remedy in the appropriate Court of Law, within the appropriate jurisdiction as provided by the contract and conjunctive agreements\".194\n\n\u2022 Letters of demand of 4 and 7 August 2011 from Mr. Jacobs to the Respondent, threatening to \"issue proceedings\" but not mentioning ICSID.195\n\n\u2022 A letter of 22 August 2011 from the Claimants' former Counsel to the Respondent, stating that the firm had instructions to \"issue proceedings forthwith and to seek summary judgment for and in respect of such proceedings\".196\n\nExh. R-143, Email from Sean Magee to Ambassador Abel Guterres of 30 January 2011, pp. 11-12.\n\nExh. C-104, Letter from Albert Jacobs to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o and others of 8 February 2011, titled 'Request for Performance and LC Issuance'.\n\nExh.

C-124, Letter from Albert Jacobs to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o and Januario da Costa Pereira of 17 August 2011; *see also* Exh. C-110, Letter from Albert Jacobs to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o and others of 20 May 2011, titled 'Supply for Allocation and Contract Generator Provision'.\n\nExh. C-128, Letter from Marshalls + Dent to Bernard Collaery of 22 August 2011, titled 'Claim against the Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste'.\n\n194.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants did not mention ICSID until 25 October 2011, when their former counsel requested that the Respondent execute a document titled \"Consent to Arbitration under the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States\".197 This document did not refer to an ICSID arbitration clause in the Fuel Supply Agreement or to the Parties' subsequent acceptance of the December General Terms.198 For the Respondent, the Claimants' request would have been unnecessary if the Respondent had already consented to ICSID arbitration.\n\nReply, para. 99; R-PHB, paras. 12-14; Exh. C-129, Letter from Marshalls + Dent to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o of 25 October 2011.\n\nFor the Respondent, the fact that Mr. Jacobs had pre-signed this document disproves the Claimants' argument that their former counsel sent this correspondence in error. R-PHB, para. 15, *citing* Tr. 51:41-46.\n\n195.\n\nWhen the Claimants first asserted the existence of an ICSID arbitration clause in the Standard Terms in 2014, two years had elapsed since the Respondent's rejection of the Claimants' request for consent.199 Moreover, the Claimants relied on the December General Terms as a separate basis of consent only after the Respondent raised its preliminary objections in this proceeding.200 The Respondent concludes that \"the manner in which the issues have been raised by the Claimants makes the entirety of their case inherently improbable from the outset\".201\n\nR-PHB, para. 18; Exh. C-133, Letter from Johnson Winter & Slattery to Bernard Collaery of 3 March 2014, titled 'Lighthouse Corporation - Claims Against Timor-Leste'.\n\nR-PHB, para. 25.\n\nR-PHB, para. 5.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal must dismiss the first objection to jurisdiction because the Respondent consented to ICSID arbitration in the Fuel Supply Agreement. The Claimants' position is that (i) the ICSID arbitration provision in Clause 18.2 of the Standard Terms was incorporated into the Fuel Supply Agreement; (ii) the Respondent received the Standard Terms; (iii) the General Terms do not replace the Standard Terms; and (iv) the Respondent has failed to substantiate its allegations that the Standard Terms and the December General Terms did not exist in the period between October and December 2010.\n\n*i. Whether the Standard Terms were Incorporated into the Fuel Supply**Agreement*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe Claimants' case is that the Standard Terms, including the ICSID arbitration clause, were incorporated by reference into the Fuel Supply Agreement. The Claimants rely in particular on three references to the Standard Terms in contractual documents.202\n\nExh. C-224, Demonstrative Exhibit for the Claimants' Opening Submissions (identifying references to the Standard Terms in the Fuel Supply Agreement).\n\n198.\n\nFirst, the Claimants point to the Contribution Summary, which states that \"Lighthouse 'Standard Terms and Conditions Applying to the Sale of Goods' will apply. Copy of terms and conditions available on request\".203 The Claimants consider this a clear statement incorporating the Standard Terms into the main contract.204\n\nExh. C-087, Contribution Summary, 22 October 2010, p. 8.\n\nRej., para. 16(b). The Claimants state that this is not undermined by the fact that they are \"available on request\", especially because the Standard Terms were in fact provided to Respondent.\n\n199.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Contribution Summary \"forms an integral part\" of the Fuel Supply Agreement.205 In this regard, the Claimants highlight the following language of the Fuel Supply Agreement:\n\n\u2022 Claimants \"make herein an offer of continuing supply, and associated extensive infrastructure investment\";206\n\n\u2022 \"Investmnt [sic] Contributn [sic]\" is \"$7.5 - $8.0 million\";207 and\n\n\u2022 \"Please evaluate this proposal in conjunction with [the] Contribution Summary, attached as an addendum to this document\".208\n\nRej., para. 16.\n\nExh.

C-087, Contribution Summary, 22 October 2010, p. 10.\n\n201.\n\nFor the Claimants, to the extent that language of incorporation must be \"both clear and unambiguous\", as proposed by the Respondent, the test is amply satisfied with respect to the incorporation of the Contribution Summary into the Supply Agreement.211 It follows that the clear reference in the Contribution Summary to the Standard Terms incorporated that latter document into the Fuel Supply Agreement.212\n\nRej., paras. 25-26, *citing* Reply, paras. 112-114; *see* R-PHB, para. 88.\n\nRej., para. 16(b).\n\n202.\n\nThe Claimants also rely on the following reference contained both in the Floating Storage Addendum and in the Addendum, Nomination and Variation:\n\n\"We note for reference that in accordance with the main supply contract noted above (and in conjunction with our Standard Terms & Conditions of Supply, also attached hereto), we are to supply the following [\u2026]\"213\n\nExh.

Whether the Respondent was Aware of the Standard Terms*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe Claimants dispute the Respondent's assertion that it was not made aware of the Standard Terms.221 They provided the Standard Terms to the Respondent on at least three occasions: at the meeting in Dili on 20 October 2010; by the Second Jacobs Email of 27 November 2010; and by the Further Jacobs Email of 7 December 2010.\n\nC-Mem., paras. 44-45; Rej., para. 19.\n\n\u2022 The 20 October 2010 Meeting\n-----------------------------\n\n206.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Mr. Jacobs gave the Respondent all the relevant contractual documents, including the Standard Terms, at a meeting in Dili on 20 October 2010.222 Their account of the meeting is as follows:\n\n\u2022 After months of negotiations between the Claimants and the Respondent's officials, Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o personally invited the Claimants to meet in Dili on 20 October 2010.223\n\n\u2022 Mr. Jacobs arrived in Dili in the morning of 20 October 2010. Present at the meeting were Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Magee, Mr. Oliveira and the Secretary of State for Power, Water and Urbanisation, Mr. da Costa Pereira.224\n\n\u2022 The \"key evidence is that Mr. Jacobs took with him to the meeting five blue folders, each of which contained the relevant contractual documentation, including the Standard Terms and Conditions\".225 He gave one folder to the Prime Minister, one to Secretary da Costa Pereira, and left one on the desk of the Prime Minister's secretary, Ms. Calapes. Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Magee each retained a folder.226\n\n\u2022 Mr. Jacobs then knelt on the floor next to the Prime Minister and \"explained the purpose and content of each document, page by page\" for almost two hours.227 During this time, Mr. Jacobs, the Prime Minister and Secretary da Costa Pereira made various annotations on Mr. Jacobs' copy of the documents, as can be seen on Exhibit C-221.228 Notably, Mr. Jacobs wrote \"IMPORTANT\" on the Contribution Summary next to the reference to the Standard Terms, and placed an asterisk next to the ICSID arbitration clause in the Standard Terms.229\n\n\u2022 The Prime Minister was pleased with the arrangement, and over the next five days, without further negotiation, the Fuel Supply Agreement was executed.230\n\nC-Mem., para. 44; Rej., para. 20; R-PHB, para. 58; Jacobs WS 3, para. 84; Jacobs WS 4, para. 6; Jacobs WS 6; Jacobs WS 7, paras. 3-7.\n\nR-PHB, para. 61; Jacobs WS 3, paras. 34-87; Exh.

C-221, Replica of the blue folder with annotations.\n\n208.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants argue that this account \"was not directly contradicted by Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o although he claimed that he did not remember any details of the meeting\".232 In the Claimants' view, the Tribunal need not find that the Prime Minister has made false denials; it is sufficient to find that he was not engaged with the details and did not recollect them.233 Prime Minster Gusm\u00e2o's detachment is demonstrated by the fact that he could not recall that he had overseen Timor-Leste's accession to the ICSID Convention after independence, even before the State joined the United Nations.234\n\nC-PHB, para. 67, *citing* Tr. 312:8-10.\n\nC-PHB, para. 71.\n\nTr. 304:17-305:11; C-PHB, para. 73.\n\n209.\n\nThe Claimants find it telling that the Respondent elected not to file witness testimony from Secretary da Costa Pereira, Mr. Oliveira or Ms. Calpes regarding the 20 October 2010 meeting. They ask the Tribunal to infer that such testimony \"would not have assisted, and indeed [would] have been adverse or otherwise unhelpful to the Respondent's denial of the detail of Mr Jacob's evidence\".235\n\nC-PHB, paras. 69-70.\n\n\u2022 Second Jacobs Email (Exhibit C-148)\n-------------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nThe Claimants allege that, on 27 November 2010, Mr. Jacobs sent the Second Jacobs Email to Mr. Magee containing the Addendum, Nomination and Variation and the Standard Terms, and that Mr. Magee then provided those documents to Mr. Abrao Oliveira.236\n\nC-Mem., para. 45; Rej., para. 21(a); Jacobs WS 3, para. 101; Exh. C-148, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee of 27 November 2010, with subject 'Timor-Leste Fuel Supply Variation Documents for Execution'.\n\n211.\n\nThe Claimants oppose the Respondent's allegation that the Second Jacobs Email is fabricated237 and submit that the \"Respondent bears the burden of proof for its allegations of fraud, and a stricter standard of proof applies in such cases\". They add that the Respondent has not discharged that burden.238\n\nRej., paras. 28 *et seq.* ; C-PHB, paras. 9 *et seq.*\n\nC-PHB, para. 53. The Claimants further argue that if they \"were seriously minded to engage in fraudulent activity to support their case on jurisdiction, it would appear that they would have come up with something other than these two emails [the Second Jacobs Email and the December Jacobs Email]\". C-PHB, para. 55.\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimants explain the origin of the Second Jacobs Email as follows: on the morning of 27 November 2010, Mr. Jacobs was at the St. Kilda office and sent Mr. Magee the First Jacobs Email, attaching the Bonus Period Election Form, the Special Conditions of Contract, and the Addendum Nomination & Variation Agreement (Exhibit C-147). He then left the office to attend a meeting at the Windsor hotel. On the way, Mr. Jacobs received a call from Mr. Magee, informing him that he had not attached certain documents to his email (including the Standard Terms). Mr. Jacobs then called his assistant, Yuliana, and asked her to send Mr. Magee the requested documents. Yuliana composed the Second Jacobs Email and sent it on behalf of Mr. Jacobs from a different computer than the one from which Mr. Jacobs sent the First Jacobs Email.239\n\nC-PHB, para. 18; Tr. 169:21-176:42.\n\n213.\n\nFor the Claimants, \"[t]his explanation of events is entirely plausible as the innocuous truth\".240 They raise several points to respond to the Respondent's allegations, including:\n\n\u2022 The Respondent's forensic expert, Mr. Hopkins, based his analysis on the false assumption that \"the Second Jacobs Email was sent using the same email address, the same computer, using Microsoft Outlook\" as the other emails he reviewed, which undermines his findings.241 The discrepancies between the Second Jacobs Email and contemporaneous emails (formatting of the email addresses, language, the time zone, and font) are explained by the fact that the Claimants had at least seven computers at two different addresses at the time, and Mr. Jacobs could send emails, or have emails sent on his behalf, from any of those computers.242 The Second Jacobs Email was sent from Yuliana's computer.\n\n\u2022 \"[T]here is nothing untoward or surprising about the fact that Yuliana used a different email signature for Exhibit C-148 from the email signature which Mr. Jacobs used for Exhibit C-147\".243 Yuliana likely selected the email signature with the Monash address because it included the \"Lighthouse Energy\" logo.\n\n\u2022 At the time, the Claimants did in fact occupy the address indicated on the Second Jacobs Email (at Monash University), as well as the address indicated in the First Jacobs Email.244\n\n\u2022 The Respondent's submissions regarding the timing between the First and Second Jacobs Emails are misplaced, because Mr. Jacobs' computer and Yuliana's computer could have been set to different times, as confirmed by the Parties' experts. Thus, \"the apparent four (or five) minute window... could actually have been a significantly longer period of time\".245\n\n\u2022 Regarding the metadata of the Second Jacobs Email, the Claimants' forensic expert Craig Macauley explains that, when the Claimants provided the Second Jacobs Email to Johnson Winter & Slattery as an attachment to another email, the Claimants' IT system \"updated the file system metadata\". This made it appear as if the attachments to the Second Jacobs Email were attached at that time, rather than when they were originally attached.246\n\nC-PHB, para. 19.\n\nRej., para. 40, *quoting* Hopkins ER 1, para. 2.5.4; C-PHB, paras. 12-14.\n\nJacobs WS 5, paras. 18-20.\n\nC-PHB, para. 18(e).\n\nRej., para. 31; Jacobs WS 5, para. 11. Mr. Jacobs states that the Claimants occupied the Monash University address pursuant to a license agreement with Unicorp Investments 2 Pty Limited. Exh. C-209, License Agreement for use of Office Premises, 14 January 2010.\n\nC-PHB, para. 20; *see Id.* paras. 21-24; C-RPHB, para. 14.\n\nMacauley ER 1, para. 55. The Claimants also state that the \"attachments to the Second Jacobs Email were not attached on 21 April 2016 because Johnson Winter & Slattery was first provided with a copy of it weeks prior to that date\". Rej., para. 37; *see* C-RPHB, para. 16.\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimants reject the Respondent's answer on these points; namely that the Claimants should have provided access to all of the relevant metadata (including from Yuliana's computer and Mr. Magee's email account).247 According to the Claimants, they \"no longer have the computers which were in use in 2010, and the Claimants' server which relates to that period is in storage and has deteriorated\".248 Similarly, Mr. Magee no longer has access to the relevant email account.249 Therefore, \"the Tribunal can draw no conclusions whatsoever as to the absence of any further evidence concerning the metadata\".250\n\nC-PHB, *citing* Tr. 37:19-36 (Mr. Flynn).\n\nC-PHB, para. 31.

C-198, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee and Ambassador Abel Guterres of 7 December 2010.

Prime Minister himself?\").\n\n216.\n\nAs with the Second Jacobs Email, the Claimants deny that the Further Jacobs Email is fabricated, asserting that the Respondent has failed to meet the high burden of proving fraud.252\n\nC-PHB, para. 52.\n\n217.\n\nAt the Hearing, Mr. Jacobs explained that he created the two emails sent on 7 December 2010 as follows: he opened the First Jacobs Email (Exhibit C-147) and the Second Jacobs Email (Exhibit C-148) to use as templates. He clicked \"forward\" and changed the subject lines to read \"Electronic copies of agreements - RDTL - LE\" and \"Electronic copies of agreements - RDTL - LE -2-\", respectively.253 Then Mr. Jacobs attached three additional documents (including the December General Terms) to the second email and clicked \"send\". The forwarded version of the First Jacobs Email is Exhibit C-197, and the forwarded version of the Second Jacobs Email is Exhibit C-198 (the Further Jacobs Email).254\n\nTr. 278:16-27; C-PHB, paras. 40-44.\n\nTr. 278:3-14, 279:20-280:42; C-PHB, para. 43.\n\n218.\n\nThe Claimants seek to rebut the Respondent's allegation that the Further Jacobs Email did not exist at the time it was purportedly sent:\n\n\u2022 As explained in respect of the Second Jacobs Email, the Claimants had several computers from which Mr. Jacobs could send emails at the time, which clarifies why there may be differences between the Further Jacobs Email and others sent by Mr. Jacobs during that period.255 The assumptions underlying Mr. Hopkins' analysis are wrong.256\n\n\u2022 Because Mr. Jacobs forwarded the Second Jacobs Email (sent by Yuliana) to create the Further Jacobs Email, it makes sense that these two emails share the same metadata, which differ from that of other contemporaneous emails.257\n\n\u2022 The fact that the attachments to the Further Jacobs Email appear in a different order than the attachments to the Second Jacobs email cannot be considered evidence of fabrication, given that the Parties' experts could not confirm that the order of attachments would remain the same when additional documents are attached.258\n\n\u2022 Because the PDF conversion process can create formatting irregularities, it is not surprising that there are inconsistencies in formatting between the printed and electronic version of the Further Jacobs Email.259\n\n\u2022 The DOC ID on one of the attachments to the Further Jacobs Email was not inserted in 2012, as alleged by the Claimants. Similar DOC IDs do not appear on other documents sent by Claimants during that period because Mr. Jacobs usually deletes the document numbers before sending documents to counterparties, but he forgot to do so in this instance.260\n\n\u2022 Regarding the metadata of the Further Jacobs Email, Mr. Macauley explains that, as with the Second Jacobs' Email, Claimants' IT system updated the metadata to the date on which Claimants sent the email to their counsel.261\n\nRej., paras. 64-69; C-PHB, para. 37.\n\nC-PHB, para. 40.\n\nC-PHB, paras. 401-41.\n\nTr. 434:25-435:16; C-PHB, paras. 45-48.\n\nRej., paras. 62-63; Macauley ER 1, para. 121.\n\nRej., para. 57; Jacobs WS 5, para. 23.\n\nMacauley ER 1, paras. 86-89; C-RPHB, para. 16.\n\n219.\n\nFurther, the Claimants do not accept Ambassador Guterres' testimony that he never received the document.262 Ambassador Guterres testified that he invited the Respondent's legal representatives to search his inbox in 2016.263 However, as confirmed by both Parties' experts, if he had deleted the email, it is highly unlikely that a search of his Gmail account carried out six years after the fact could show whether that email existed.264\n\nRej., para. 71.\n\nC-PHB, para. 50, *citing* Tr. 404:14-406:22.\n\nTr. 435:18-28; C-PHB, paras. 49-51.\n\n220.\n\nThus, the Claimants conclude that the Respondent received the Standard Terms and the General Terms on multiple occasions. In any event, they argue that it is irrelevant as a legal matter whether the Respondent received these documents.265 They explain that Australian courts have held that, to be applicable, terms and conditions do not need to be provided to the parties, if they are referred to in contractual documentation.266 Thus, the Standard Terms apply to the Fuel Supply Agreement whether or not the Respondent actually received them.267\n\nC-Mem., paras. 46-51.\n\nC-Mem., paras. 46-51, *citing inter alia* Exh.

Whether the General Terms Displaced the Standard Terms*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nThe Claimants further contest the Respondent's allegation that the Standard Terms were superseded by the September or October General Terms, which contain no ICSID arbitration clause.268 In the Claimants' view, the Respondent's interpretation must be rejected because the Addendum, Nomination and Variation expressly refer to the Standard Terms.269\n\nC-Mem., paras. 52-62; Rej., paras. 73-74, paras. 131-132.\n\nExh. C-095, Addendum, Nomination and Variation, 26 November 2010, p. 3 (\"in accordance with the main supply contract noted above (and in conjunction with our *Standard Terms & Conditions*, also attached hereto), we are to supply the following\").\n\n222.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants rely on Clause 2.2 of the Standard Terms, which states that specific agreed terms may not \"remove the afforded protections at law provided by these minimum standard terms and conditions herein\".270 According to the Claimants, the ICSID arbitration provision in Clause 18 of the Standard Terms is an important \"protection\" that falls within the meaning of Clause 2.2 and therefore cannot be displaced.271\n\nExh. C-192, Standard Terms, October 2010, Clause 2.2.\n\nC-Mem., para. 54, *citing* Exh. CL-082 *,* *RosInvest Co UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation*, SCC Case No. V079/2005, Award on Jurisdiction, October 2007, paras. 131-132.\n\n223.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants argue that, even if the General Terms superseded the Standard Terms, the Respondent has consented to ICSID arbitration because the General Terms were revised in late November 2010, and the revised version (dated December 2010 and defined herein as the \"December General Terms\") includes an ICSID arbitration clause.272 When there are multiple versions of contractual terms and conditions available, \"the latest edition is to be taken as having been incorporated in the contract\".273 Therefore, the December General Terms became part of the Fuel Supply Agreement via the Addendum, Nomination and Variation.274\n\nC-Mem., para. 55; Rej., para. 74; Exh. C-200, December General Terms, Clause 17.\n\nC-Mem., para. 60, *citing* Exh. CL-081, *Smith v South Wales Switchgear Ltd* [1978] 1 All ER 18, 25 (Lord Fraser of Tullybelton).\n\nC-Mem., para. 56. Although the Addendum, Nomination Variation is dated 26 November 2010, Claimants state that it was signed on or about 2 December 2010.\n\n224.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the December General Terms were sent to the Respondent with the Further Jacobs Email.275 As summarized above, they deny the Respondent's allegation that this email did not exist at the time it was purportedly sent.276\n\nC-Mem., para. 58; Rej., para. 73; Exh. C-198, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee and Ambassador Abel Guterres of 7 December 2010.\n\nRej., paras. 54-72; *see* Section VI.B.1.b.ii above.\n\n225.\n\nMore generally, the Claimants argue that \"it is not open for the Tribunal to find that explicitly or implicitly Mr Jacobs elected to abandon the international disputes resolution mechanism he deliberately included in Clause 18 of the Standard Terms and Conditions\".277 Mr. Jacobs stipulated ICSID arbitration in his contractual documents based on his connection with Mr. Ioannis Kardassopoulos, the Claimant in the ICSID case *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia*.278 Even if these are \"somewhat confused reasons\" to select ICSID, Mr. Jacobs would not have subsequently agreed to delete or substitute that clause.279\n\nC-PHB, para. 78.\n\nC-PHB, para. 78. The Claimants assert that ICSID also happens to be \"Respondent's international disputes procedure of choice\". C-PHB, para. 74.\n\nC-PHB, paras. 78-79.\n\n*iv. Whether the Standard Terms and December General Terms Existed in**October-December 2010*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nAs summarized above, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal must reject the Respondent's allegation that they fabricated two emails sent by Mr. Jacobs.280 There is no evidence of fraud, and hence no basis for a finding that the Standard Terms or the December General Terms did not exist in October-December 2010.\n\n*See* Section VI.B.1.b.ii above.\n\n227.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants argue that the Respondent's position is unreasonable in light of the numerous references to the Standard Terms in the Fuel Supply Agreement and in contemporaneous correspondence.281 Furthermore, metadata extracted by the Respondent's own expert shows that the Standard Terms were created on 10 October 2010, and the December General Terms on 1 December 2010.282\n\nC-PHB, para. 89, *citing* Exh. C-104, Letter from Albert Jacobs to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o and others of 8 February 2011, titled 'Request for Performance and LC Issuance'.\n\nC-PHB, para. 89, *citing* Hopkins ER 2, Annex F, p. 25; C-RPHB, para. 7.\n\n**2. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n228.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Respondent consented to ICSID arbitration under Clause 18 of the Standard Terms and Clause 17 of the December General Terms, the text of which has been reproduced above in paragraphs 9 and 16.\n\n229.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants assert that the Standard Terms were incorporated into the contractual framework by means of three references:\n\n\u2022 a reference in the Contribution Summary, a document ancillary to the Supply Agreement, to \"Standard Terms & Conditions Applying to the Sale of Goods\";\n\n\u2022 a reference in the Floating Storage Addendum to an \"attached\" document, the \"Standard Terms & Conditions of Supply; and\n\n\u2022 a reference in the Third Agreement to an \"attached\" document, the \"Standard Terms & Conditions of Supply\".\n\n230.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that the Respondent was aware of the Standard Terms, as it received a copy of that document on three occasions:\n\n\u2022 directly, in a blue folder handed over at a meeting with Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o on 20 October 2010;\n\n\u2022 indirectly, via an email with attachments that included the Standard Terms, sent on 27 November 2010 at 9:18 a.m. from Mr. Jacobs to Mr. Magee (the Second Jacobs Email). Mr. Jacobs allegedly asked Mr. Magee to provide the attached documents to Mr. Oliveira so that the latter could hand them over to the Respondent; and\n\n\u2022 indirectly, via an email with attachments that included the Standard Terms, sent on 7 December 2010 at 5:23 p.m. from Mr. Jacobs to Mr. Magee (the Further Jacobs Email). Ambassador Guterres was allegedly copied on this email.\n\n231.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that the Further Jacobs Email also attached the December General Terms, which also contained an ICSID arbitration provision.\n\n232.\n\nThe Tribunal reviews these submissions below to determine whether the Claimants have established that the Respondent has consented to ICSID jurisdiction because of the incorporation of Clause 18 of the Standard Terms or Clause 17 of the December General Terms into the Parties' contractual framework. Before it does so however, the Tribunal makes some preliminary observations.\n\n***a. Preliminary Observations***\n---------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nOn reviewing the record, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have not established that there was a \"common intent\" to submit to ICSID jurisdiction. To the contrary, the record evidences an intent to resolve disputes through domestic court litigation, not through arbitration, let alone ICSID arbitration.\n\n234.\n\nOn 12 April 2010, more than four months before the Parties entered into the Supply Agreement, Ambassador Guterres sent Mr. Magee an e-mail attaching a document setting out the general terms used by Timor-Leste for procurement and investment transactions.283 Clause 17 of that document contained the following dispute resolution clause:\n\n\"17 Resolution of Disputes\n\n17.1 The Purchaser and the Supplier shall make every effort to resolve amicably by direct informal negotiation any disagreement or dispute arising between them under or in connection with the Contract.\n\n17.2 Any Supplier that claims to have suffered loss or injury due to a breach of an obligation imposed on the procuring entity by Law may seek review in accordance with the applicable public procurement law of the Democratic Republic of Timor Leste.\"\n\nExh. R-118, Email from Ambassador Abel Guterres to Sean Magee of 12 April 2010.\n\n235.\n\nThus, the only dispute resolution mechanism contemplated by the Parties before signing the Supply Agreement on 22 October 2010 was a form of domestic law review provided under the law of the Respondent, i.e. domestic court litigation.284\n\nThe Claimants' allegation that Mr. Jacobs discussed ICSID arbitration with Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o at the meeting of 20 October 2010 and that he handed the Standard Terms to Mr. Gusm\u00e2o at the meeting is examined below. Similarly, the Claimants' argument that mere reference to the Standard Terms in the relevant contractual documents is sufficient for the purposes of incorporating ICSID arbitration between the Parties is also examined below.\n\n236.\n\nOn 19 November 2010, i.e. a day after the Parties entered into the Floating Storage Addendum, Mr. Magee sent an email to Mr. Oliveira, with a copy to Ambassador Guterres, attaching the September General Terms.285 Clause 17 of this document contained a dispute resolution clause almost identical to the one reproduced above, except that the words \"Democratic Republic of Timor Leste\" were substituted by \"Buyer\":\n\n\"17.1 The Purchaser and the Supplier shall make every effort to resolve amicably by direct informal negotiation any disagreement or dispute arising between them under or in connection with the Contract.\n\n17.2 Any Supplier that claims to have suffered loss or injury due to a breach of an obligation imposed on the procuring entity, by law may seek review in accordance with the public procurement law of *the**Buyer, or the standard laws applicable to Buyers.\"*286\n\nExh. R-119, September General Terms, Clause 17, attached to Email from Sean Magee to Abrao Gabriel Oliveira (copying Ambassador Abel Guterres) of 19 November 2010, 'FINAL PACKAGE'.\n\nExh. R-119, September General Terms, Clause 17 (emphasis added).\n\n237.\n\nTherefore, even after signing the Supply Agreement and the Floating Storage Addendum, the only dispute resolution mechanism contemplated by the Parties was remedies available under domestic law.287\n\nThe Claimants' allegation that Mr. Jacobs discussed ICSID arbitration with Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o at the meeting of 20 October 2010 and that he handed the Standard Terms to Mr. Gusm\u00e2o at the meeting is examined below. Similarly, the Claimants' argument that mere reference to the Standard Terms in the relevant contractual documents is sufficient for the purposes of incorporating ICSID arbitration between the Parties is also examined below.\n\n238.\n\nOn or around 2 December 2010, the Parties entered into the Third Agreement. Attached to the Third Agreement were the October General Terms. Clause 17 of this document was identical to Clause 17 of the September General Terms (which, as mentioned above, was identical to the dispute resolution clause contained in the document supplied by the Respondent), except that the words \"standard laws applicable to Suppliers, under Commonwealth laws of Australia\" were added at the end:\n\n\"17.1 The Purchaser and the Supplier shall make every effort to resolve amicably by direct informal negotiation any disagreement or dispute arising between them under or in connection with the Contract.\n\n17.2 Any Supplier that claims to have suffered loss or injury due to a breach of an obligation imposed on the procuring entity, by law may seek review in accordance with the public procurement law of the Buyer, *or the standard laws applicable to Suppliers, under Commonwealth laws of Australia*.\"288\n\nExh. C-095, Addendum, Nomination and Variation, 26 November 2010, read with Exh. R-132, October General Terms (emphasis added).\n\n239.\n\nAccordingly, until at least 2 December 2010, the only dispute resolution mechanism contemplated by the Parties were domestic court remedies.289\n\nThe Claimants' allegation that Mr. Jacobs discussed ICSID arbitration with Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o at the meeting of 20 October 2010 and that he handed the Standard Terms to Mr. Gusm\u00e2o at the meeting is examined below. Similarly, the Claimants' argument that mere reference to the Standard Terms in the relevant contractual documents is sufficient for the purposes of incorporating ICSID arbitration between the Parties is also examined below.\n\n240.\n\nThe following month, on 30 January 2011, Mr. Magee wrote to Mr. Guterres that failing resolution of the parties' then existing dispute, the Claimants would \"immediately seek Judgement for Specific Performance\" in the Supreme Court of Victoria\".290\n\nExh. R-143, Email from Sean Magee to Ambassador Abel Guterres of 30 January 2011, pp. 11-12.\n\n241.\n\nNine days later, on 8 February 2011, the Claimants' sent a letter to the Respondent stating that:\n\n\"[F]ailing to undertake and fulfil necessary contractual obligations and responsibilities will cause RDTL / EDTL to unlawfully default, *requiring lawful remedy in the appropriate Court of Law, within the appropriate jurisdiction as provided by the contract and conjunctive agreements*.\n\n[We] shall have no hesitation in using this letter as evidence in a *court of law*.\"291\n\nExh. C-104, Letter from Albert Jacobs to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o and others of 8 February 2011, titled 'Request for Performance and LC Issuance' (emphasis added).\n\n242.\n\nThe words used show that, in February 2011, months after the alleged incorporation of the Standard Terms and the December General Terms, the Claimants were of the opinion that the applicable dispute resolution mechanism referred them to domestic courts. They did not consider that the Parties had consented to ICSID arbitration.\n\n243.\n\nSix months later, on 22 August 2011, the Claimants' former counsel wrote to the Respondent demanding payment for generators delivered in April 2011.292 That letter similarly stated that \"our instructions are to issue proceedings forthwith and to seek *summary judgment* for and in respect of such proceedings\",293 suggesting once more that the Claimants were contemplating court proceedings. Indeed, \"summary judgment\" is known in domestic litigation in Australia and is not a term associated with ICSID arbitration.\n\nExh. C-128, Letter from Marshalls + Dent to Bernard Collaery of 22 August 2011, titled 'Claim against the Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste'.\n\nExh. C-128, Letter from Marshalls + Dent to Bernard Collaery of 22 August 2011, titled 'Claim against the Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste' (emphasis added).\n\n244.\n\nThe most telling conduct of the Claimants occurred on 25 October 2011, i.e. a year after the signature of the Fuel Supply Agreement, when it is alleged that the Standard Terms were incorporated into the Parties' contractual arrangements. On that day, the Claimants' then counsel sent the Respondent a document entitled \"Consent to Arbitration under the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States\" and requested that the Respondent execute that document.294 No mention was made of the fact that an ICSID arbitration clause was already present in the Parties' contractual arrangements. Hence, continuing until October 2011, the Claimants still did not consider that the Respondent had consented to ICSID arbitration. Had the Claimants considered that the Respondent had previously consented to ICSID arbitration, then one might have expected their letter to have mentioned that the Respondent had already consented to ICSID jurisdiction through the Standard Terms and/or the December General Terms, and explained why it was thought that some confirmation was needed. Yet, the letter is silent as to the prior consent upon which the Claimants now rely.\n\nExh. C-129, Letter from Marshalls + Dent to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o of 25 October 2011.\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimants' explanation that this letter was sent in error due to poor legal advice at the time is unavailing. For one, the Claimants have not supplied any cogent evidence justifying such a conclusion. Moreover, Mr. Jacobs himself had pre-signed the document requesting the Respondent's consent, making it clear that he too believed that the Respondent had not consented to ICSID arbitration until that date.\n\n246.\n\nThese facts suffice to conclude that neither before nor after the conclusion of the Fuel Supply Agreement did the Parties intend to incorporate ICSID arbitration into their contract. This conclusion is strengthened by a review of the alleged incorporation of the Standard Terms and the December General Terms ((b) below) and of the alleged provision of these documents to the Respondent ((c) below).\n\n***b. Incorporation of the Standard Terms and the December General Terms into the Parties' Contractual Framework***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Claimants contend that the references in the Parties' contractual documents to the Standard Terms are sufficient to incorporate the ICSID arbitration and thus to conclude that the Respondent has \"consented in writing\" to ICSID jurisdiction as required by Article 25(1) of the Convention. In particular, the Claimants rely on references to the Standard Terms in (i) the Contribution Summary; (ii) the Floating Storage Addendum; and (iii) Addendum, Nomination and Variation Agreement.\n\n*i. Reference in the Contribution Summary*\n------------------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nThe Parties entered into the Supply Agreement on 22 October 2010. In the concluding paragraphs of that agreement, a potential buyer (in this case, the Respondent) was advised to \"*please evaluate* this proposal in conjunction with our state-of-the-art 10.16 MW Diesel Generator Infrastructure Contribution Summary\", which was stated to be attached to the Supply Agreement.295\n\nExh. C-088, Supply Agreement, 22 October 2010 (emphasis added).\n\n249.\n\nThe Contribution Summary contains the following statement:\n\n\"TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nLighthouse \"*Standard Terms and Conditions Applying to the Sale of Goods*\" will apply.\n\nCopy of terms and conditions available on request\"296\n\nExh. C-087, Contribution Summary, 22 October 2010, p. 8 (emphasis added).\n\n250.\n\nThe Claimants' case is that the reference to \"Lighthouse 'Standard Terms and Conditions\u2019\" in the Contribution Summary - which is an attachment to the Fuel Supply Agreement that was executed by the Government - shows that the Parties consented to ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal does not agree for the following reasons.\n\n251.\n\nFirst, the reference to the Standard Terms document itself is vague, and does not clearly express an intent to incorporate that document:\n\n\u2022 There is no direct language of incorporation in the Supply Agreement. The Contribution Summary had the stated purpose to \"evaluate\" the Claimants' technical proposal. The Supply Agreement does not provide that the Contribution Summary is \"incorporated\", \"made a part of the Agreement\", or use any other terminology of incorporation. The Tribunal does not accept that the stated request (\"please\") and the stated purpose (\"evaluate\") are words of incorporation.\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal is comforted in this finding by the fact that the Contribution Summary contains references which are unlikely to have been intended to be incorporated as contractual terms. For example, the Contribution Summary contains a summary of information about the power generation needs of Timor-Leste, an analysis of use and delivery of power in Timor-Leste, and a forecast of future energy needs and further growth in output.\n\n252.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the Standard Terms were supplied to the Respondent by the time of signing the Supply Agreement.297\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of the Claimants' allegation that the Standard Terms and Conditions document was handed over to the Respondent at the meeting of 20 October 2010. This allegation is examined below.\n\n253.\n\nThird, evidence of events shortly after the Supply Agreement was signed casts significant doubt on whether the Respondent could have known that the Standard Terms document existed at the time, or that it was incorporated into the Parties' agreement. Five days after the signature of the Supply Agreement, on 27 October 2010,298 Mr. Jacobs sent an email to the Respondent referring to a meeting in Dili between himself and representatives of the Respondent. In that email, he stated:\n\n\"[a]ccording to the *contractual standard terms* and *conditions*, Page 2 stipulates under HOLD FEE that if floating storage is required, then the cost of barge and management of same is for the Buyer, RDTL or EDTL. This is again referred to on Page 3, under STORAGE.\"299\n\nThe Second Agreement comprised of the Floating Storage Addendum and the Special Conditions.\n\nExh. R-137, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee of 27 October 2010 (emphasis added).\n\n254.\n\nThe Standard Terms do not contain such provisions on pages 2, 3 or elsewhere within the document. However, these provisions do appear on pages 2 and 3 of the Supply Agreement. The use of the capitalized term \"HOLD FEE\", the specific references to page numbers (\"Page 2\" and \"Page 3\"), and another capitalized term (\"STORAGE\"), would suggest that that the references were actually to the Supply Agreement.\n\n255.\n\nAs was discussed above, for there to be consent to ICSID jurisdiction through incorporation by reference, it must be demonstrated that the Parties intended to incorporate ICSID arbitration into their arrangements. Here, it has not been demonstrated to the Tribunal's satisfaction that the Parties agreed to refer their disputes to ICSID arbitration. Moreover, not only is the reference to the document containing the ICSID dispute settlement clause ambiguous as to its intent, but it also has not been sufficiently established that the Respondent knew that the document existed or that it was supplied to the Respondent, or that it was discussed with the Respondent.\n\n256.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal determines that the Claimants have failed to demonstrate consent to ICSID arbitration as required under Article 25(1) of the Convention at the time of entering into the Supply Agreement. The Tribunal cannot agree that the \"double incorporation\" claimed (the Supply Agreement allegedly incorporates the Contribution Summary, and the Contribution Summary then allegedly incorporates the Standard Terms, which in turn contain the ICSID jurisdiction clause) fulfils the requirement of consent under Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n*ii. Reference in the Floating Storage Addendum*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nOn 18 November 2010, the Parties entered into the Floating Storage Addendum in which the Claimants agreed to provide a barge for interim storage of the diesel fuel supplied by the Claimants.300 This Addendum states in relevant part:\n\n\"FLOATING STORAGE BARGE/ VESSEL\n\nSubsequent letters of instruction from EDTL, dated 29th October 2010 (reference numbers 380 /SEAU /X/2010), to our corporate attention, stipulate storage facilities are not currently available in Dili, Timor Leste, and that we are to provide interim storage facilities in Port Caravela. We note for reference that in accordance with the main supply contract noted above, (and in conjunction with our Standard Terms & Conditions of Supply, also attached hereto), we are to supply the following [\u2026]\"301\n\nExh. C-092, Floating Storage Addendum, 18 November 2010.\n\nExh. C-092, Floating Storage Addendum, 18 November 2010, p.2.\n\n258.\n\nWhile the relevant text says \"Standard Terms and Conditions of Supply, also attached hereto\", the Standard Terms were not attached.302 What was attached was the September General Terms, which do not provide for ICSID arbitration.\n\nExh. R-0119, Email from Sean Magee to Abrao Oliveira copied to Ambassador Abel Guterres (19.11.10).\n\n259.\n\nIn the present factual context, this mere reference to the unattached Standard Terms is insufficient to prove a common intent to incorporate a dispute settlement clause. This is all the more so here as this alleged reference postdates the conclusion of the Supply Agreement and it is included in a distinct contract with a limited scope.\n\n*iii. Reference in Addendum, Nomination and Variation Agreement*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe Parties entered into the Third Agreement, also referred to as Addendum, Nomination and Variation Agreement, on or around 2 December 2010.303 In relevant part, the Third Agreement provides as follows:\n\n\"(ITEM C). FLOATING STORAGE BARGE/ VESSEL\n\nSubsequent letters of instruction from EDTL, dated 29th October 2010 (reference numbers 380 / SEAU /X/2010), to our corporate attention, stipulate storage facilities are not currently available in Dili, TimorLeste, and that we are to provide interim storage facilities in Port Caravela. We note for reference that in accordance with the main supply contract noted above, (and in conjunction with our Standard Terms & Conditions of Supply, also attached hereto), we are to supply the following [...]\"304\n\nExh. C-095, Addendum, Nomination and Variation, 26 November 2010. This agreement is dated 26 November 2010 but was executed on or around 2 December 2010. *See* Jacobs WS 4, para. 15.\n\nExh. C-095, Addendum, Nomination and Variation, 26 November 2010, p.3.\n\n261.\n\nThis is a supplemental contract which provided *inter alia* that Timor-Leste would not have to pay storage costs for diesel fuel and referred to a commitment on the part of the Claimants to design, construct and install a fuel storage facility at Port Caravela. The Tribunal does not consider that his is capable of being construed as an expression of a common intent to submit disputes arising from the earlier signed Supply Agreement or the Floating Storage Addendum to ICSID arbitration.\n\n262.\n\nAs with the Supply Agreement and the Floating Storage Addendum, the contemporaneous evidence does not establish that the Respondent could be expected to know that a document like the Standard Terms was incorporated into the Parties' contractual arrangements.\n\n263.\n\nIndeed, in contemporary correspondence, the Claimants referred to \"contractual Standard Terms & Conditions\", which actually turned out to be references to other contractual documents.\n\n264.\n\nFor instance, on 8 February 2011, the Claimants sent a letter to the Respondent which contained three references to the Standard Terms:\n\n\"Further, I draw attention to the following agreements and documents which form an integral part of this supply contract abovementioned, and are the latest in their respective versions:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n3. STANDARD TERMS AND & CONDITIONS APPLYING TO THE SALE OF GOODS\n\n[\u2026]\n\nB) 10.16 MW DIESEL GENERATOR INFRASTRUCTURE CONTRIBUTION SUMMARY\n\n[\u2026]\n\nOn page eight (8) and at item \"TERMS AND CONDITIONS\", application of the Standard Terms & Conditions Applying to the Sale of Goods is made.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nD) STANDARD TERMS & CONDITIONS APPLYING TO THE SALE OF GOODS,\n\nOn page two (2) and at item \"PAYMENT\", delivery is conditional upon receiving acceptable and valid letter/s of credit as payment instrument from the Buyer's nominated banker, guaranteeing payment of the supply contract.\"305\n\nExh. C-104, Letter from Albert Jacobs to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o and others of 8 February 2011, titled 'Request for Performance and LC Issuance'.\n\n265.\n\nThe third reference provides details of what should be found on page 2 of the Standard Terms. However, the Standard Terms on which the Claimants rely does not contain any such provision on page 2 or elsewhere. By contrast, these provisions appear in the Supply Agreement and the October General Terms & Conditions.\n\n266.\n\nIt follows from the above that the Respondent did not know nor could it have known that the Standard Terms document was an altogether different document, much less that that different document would contain an ICSID arbitration clause.\n\n267.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the references that are alleged by the Claimants to incorporate the Standard Terms into the Parties' contractual arrangements are insufficient to demonstrate that the Parties have consented to ICSID arbitration.\n\n***c. Provision of the Standard Terms and the December General Terms to the Respondent***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, the Tribunal could dispense with reviewing the Claimants' allegations that they provided a copy of the Standard Terms to the Respondent on three occasions, namely (i) in a blue folder at a meeting with the Prime Minister on 20 October 2010; (ii) indirectly, via the Second Jacobs Email and (iii) indirectly, via the Further Jacobs Email. Indeed, even if these facts were proven, provision of the Standard Terms to the Respondent would be insufficient to establish the latter's consent to ICSID arbitration. Merely supplying a document with an ICSID arbitration clause, without more (for instance, without evidence of acceptance of such a clause), would not meet the requirement of consent under the ICSID Convention.306\n\nFor the same reason, the Tribunal need not examine the Claimants' argument that it is not necessary that an arbitration agreement which is incorporated into another agreement actually be supplied to the other party. Indeed, this argument is predicated on the Tribunal finding that the arbitration agreement contained in the Standard Terms was, in fact, incorporated into the Parties' contractual framework, which is not the case here. In any event, in the Tribunal's view, one should be cautious when considering the incorporation of a private document that is not within the possession of the party against whom it is invoked. Here, neither the Standard Terms nor the December General Terms were publicly available and it is disputed that they were ever in the possession of the Respondent.\n\n269.\n\nNevertheless, for the sake of completeness, the Tribunal will briefly examine the merits of the Claimants' allegations.\n\n*i. At the Meeting of 20 October 2010*\n--------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Claimants insist that Mr. Jacobs provided a copy of the Standard Terms to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o at the meeting of 20 October 2010. The Tribunal is unable to rely on Mr. Jacobs' testimony to this effect. For one, Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o not only denies having discussed ICSID arbitration with Mr. Jacobs, but also denies receiving the Standard Terms at the meeting on 20 October 2010 (or at any other time).307 The Claimants have not provided any cogent corroborating evidence in support of Mr. Jacob's testimony in response. Further, Mr. Jacobs' initial witness statement discussing the meeting with Mr. Gusm\u00e2o did not say that he discussed the ICSID arbitration clause in the Standard Terms with the Prime Minister.308 He only stated that he brought a blue folder containing documents to the meeting. Similarly, in his very next statement, even though he mentioned other discussions that took place at the meeting, Mr. Jacobs made no mention of ICSID arbitration.309 It was only in his Sixth Witness Statement that Mr. Jacobs gave evidence that the ICSID arbitration clause was discussed at the meeting.310 Moreover, the Claimants' insertion of a choice of court clause in the September and October General Terms appears difficult to reconcile with Mr. Jacobs' version of the October meeting. In the circumstances, the Tribunal cannot accept Mr. Jacobs' testimony that he discussed ICSID arbitration with the Prime Minister at their meeting on 20 October 2010 or that he provided a copy of the Standard Terms to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o at the meeting.\n\nGusm\u00e2o WS 1, paras. 8-11.\n\nJacobs WS 3, para. 84.\n\nJacobs WS 4, para. 6.\n\nJacobs WS 6, para13.\n\n*ii. Through the Second Jacobs Email*\n-------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe Claimants allege that they provided a copy of the Standard Terms to the Respondent indirectly as an attachment to the Second Jacobs Email. On 27 November 2010, Mr. Jacobs allegedly sent two emails to Mr. Magee:\n\n\u2022 the first one at 9:14 a.m., to which Mr. Jacobs attached the \"essential documentation for execution\" which included the Third Agreement; the Special Conditions; and a \"Bonus Period Election Form\" to extend the term of the Supply Agreement by a year (the First Jacobs Email); and\n\n\u2022 the second one at 9:18 a.m., in which Mr. Jacobs asked Mr. Magee to ensure that Mr. Oliveira deliver the documents attached \"with the execution documents\" (the Second Jacobs Email).311 This e-mail attached a document entitled \"General Definitions\", the Standard Terms, and a document entitled \"Lighthouse Energy Guide to I.C.C Incoterms 2000\".\n\nExh. C-148, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee of 27 November 2010, with subject 'Timor-Leste Fuel Supply Variation Documents for Execution'.\n\n272.\n\nThe record does not bear out the Claimants' contentions:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Jacobs testifies that the documents (including the Standard Terms) were sent to Mr. Oliveira so that he could hand them over to the Respondent.312 However, there is no corroborating evidence that Mr. Oliveira did so. On their part, Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o and Ambassador Guterres both testify that they have never received the Standard Terms.313 The Respondent's solicitor testifies that the email has not been received by any of the relevant government departments either.314 In the absence of evidence showing that Mr. Magee forwarded the Second Jacobs Email to Mr. Oliveira, it is difficult to accept that the Standard Terms were provided to the Respondent on 27 November 2010.\n\n\u2022 The Claimants have not produced a copy of the Second Jacobs Email from Mr. Magee's email inbox and (at the witness's own request and in the circumstances described above at paragraph 80 *et seq.*) Mr. Magee's testimony has been excluded from the record. There is consequently no evidence that Mr. Magee even received the Second Jacobs Email. In fact, on the next day, i.e. on 28 November 2010, Mr. Magee sent a copy of the documents attached to the First Jacobs Email and other documents to Ambassador Guterres with a request that they be passed on to the Prime Minister for execution.315 None of the attachments to the Second Jacobs Email (including the Standard Terms) were attached to Mr. Magee's email of 28 November 2010 to Ambassador Guterres.316\n\nJacobs WS 3, para. 101.\n\nGusm\u00e2o WS 1, paras. 8-12; Guterres WS 1, paras. 8-12, 15.\n\nPrescott WS 3, paras. 5-7.\n\nExh.

Through the Further Jacobs Email*\n---------------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nThe Claimants allege that they provided the Standard Terms directly to the Respondent as an attachment to the Further Jacobs Email. They further submit that the Respondent received the December General Terms, which also contain an ICSID arbitration clause, with that same email message.\n\n274.\n\nOn 7 December 2010, the following electronic messages were exchanged:317\n\n\u2022 An email at 4:18 pm from Mr. Jacobs to Mr. Magee, attaching a document entitled \"Addendum, Nomination & Variation (Dec 2010)-RDTL.pdf\"; a document entitled \"Bonus Period Election Form-RDTL (Dec2010).pdf\"; and a document entitled \"Special Conditions of Contract (Dec 2010)-RDTL.pdf\". Mr. Guterres was copied on this email.318\n\n\u2022 An email at 4:22/4:23319 pm from Mr. Jacobs to Mr. Magee, attaching the Standard Terms and the December General Terms (the Further Jacobs Email). Mr. Guterres was allegedly copied on this email.320\n\n\u2022 An email at 9:21 pm from Mr. Jacobs to Mr. Magee, attaching certain documents. Mr. Guterres and Mr. Oliveira were copied on this email.321\n\n\u2022 An email at 9:26 pm from Mr. Jacobs to Mr. Magee and Mr. Oliveira. Mr. Guterres was copied on this email.322\n\n*See* Guterres WS 2, para. 7, where he acknowledges receipt of three emails on the 7 December 2010. He insists that he never received any other email on that day, particularly the Further Jacobs email. *Id.*, paras. 8-9.\n\nExh. C-197, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee of 7 December 2010 (4:18 pm). This email was received by Ambassador Guterres at 5:18 pm, because of Australian daylight saving time.\n\nThe time appearing on the electronic version of the Further Jacobs Email produced by the Claimants on 17 June 2016 is different from the PDF version of the Further Jacobs Email (Exh. C-198), which is 5:23 pm. The electronic version displays 4:22 pm. While the discrepancy of one hour might be attributable to daylight saving time in Australia, the reason for the further discrepancy of one minute is unclear.\n\nExh. C-198, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee and Ambassador Abel Guterres of 7 December 2010 (4:22/4:23 pm).\n\nExh. R-135, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee of 7 December 2010 (9:21 pm).\n\nExh. R-136, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee of 7 December 2010 (9:26 pm).\n\n275.\n\nIt is notable that the Further Jacobs Email was only introduced into the record by the\n\nClaimants with the Reply. In Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal decided to allow the Further Jacobs Email and related submissions as it would not prejudice the Respondent.323 It remains, however, that prior to the Reply, the Claimants did not reference the Further Jacobs Email in any of their pleadings. Yet, they could have done so on a number of occasions, including:\n\n\u2022 in late 2011, when the Claimants' former counsel requested the Respondent's consent to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration and the Respondent's counsel advised that ICSID did not have jurisdiction;324\n\n\u2022 in early 2014, when the Claimants' current counsel, for the first time, raised the allegation that the parties had consented to ICSID arbitration by virtue of the Standard Terms;325\n\n\u2022 on 4 December 2014, when the Claimants filed their Request for Arbitration alleging that the Respondent's consent to ICSID arbitration was contained in the Standard Terms;326\n\n\u2022 on 29 December 2014, when, in response to a query from the ICSID Secretariat about the Respondent's consent to ICSID jurisdiction, the Claimants advised that such consent was contained in the Standard Terms;327\n\n\u2022 on 28 September 2015, when the Claimants filed their Amended Request for Arbitration which maintained their allegation that the Respondent's consent to ICSID arbitration was contained in the Standard Terms;328 and\n\n\u2022 on 14 March 2016, when the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits, again alleging that the Respondent's consent to ICSID arbitration (at least insofar as their contractual claims) was contained in the Standard Terms.329\n\nPO 3, paras. 29-30.\n\nExh.

The third email does not refer to the second email.\n\n\u2022 Mr. Guterres received the first email of 4:18 pm, but denies receiving the Further Jacobs Email of 4:22/4:23 pm. Both emails purportedly attached contractual documents. It is reasonable to expect that, if Mr. Guterres had received the Further Jacobs Email, he would have made some comments on the Standard Terms (which he had not received earlier),331 and also on the need for the December General Terms. This is all the more so as the Parties had agreed on the October General Terms, and no correspondence after that indicated that they would be revised. Moreover, up to that point in time, no discussion appears to have taken place about resolving disputes through ICSID.332 Since the only change in the December General Terms from the October General Terms was the replacement of the choice of local courts with ICSID arbitration, Mr. Guterres could reasonably be expected to question the change.\n\n\u2022 In response to the Respondent's allegation that it had never received the December General Terms, the Claimants assert that the December General Terms were prepared over the course of 26-28 November 2010.333 Mr. Jacobs alleges that the December General Terms were \"provided to Timor-Leste on or about Monday, 29 November 2010\".334 He does not say when precisely the document was handed over, nor where, nor to whom.\n\n\u2022 The Claimants allege that \"[t]he fact that Timor-Leste received the General Terms and Conditions (Dec 2010) is confirmed by Ambassador Guterres's request, in February 2011, that the 'General Terms and Conditions (Oct 2010)' be provided to him anew, presumably for the purpose of comparing the October 2010 version with the December 2010 version\".335 This is speculative and denied by Mr. Guterres.336 In any event, the document attached to Mr. Jacobs' email was the October General Terms.337\n\nExh. C-197, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee of 7 December 2010 (4:18 pm).\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 allegation that Mr. Jacobs discussed ICSID arbitration with Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o at their meeting of 20 October 2010 and that he provided a copy of the Standard Terms to the Prime Minister at the meeting has been examined above.\n\nThe Tribunal has explained that it is not persuaded by Mr. Jacob\u2019s evidence that this was discussed at the meeting on 20 October 2010. See para. 270 above.\n\nThe Claimants delivered the Third Agreement to the Respondent on 26 November 2010. This means that they sent the Third Agreement and its attachments to Mr. Magee to provide to the Respondent on 27 November 2010 without the December General Terms.\n\nJacobs WS 4, para. 13.\n\nC-Mem., para. 58, *citing* Exh. C-199, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee of 8 February 2011 (reproduced in Exh. R-138).\n\nGuterres WS 2, paras. 17-18.\n\nExh. C-199, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee of 8 February 2011 (reproduced in Exh. R-138) (\"[P]lease find a copy of the official LE - GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SUPPLY, as released October 2010\").\n\n278.\n\nAs a consequence, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the Claimants have not established that they provided a copy of the Standard Terms to the Respondent. Neither have they proven that they supplied the December General Terms to the Respondent.338 This conclusion confirms the finding already made above that no ICSID arbitration clause was incorporated into the Parties' contractual arrangements.\n\nHaving reached these conclusions, the Tribunal not need to consider the Respondent's allegations that the Second Jacobs Email and/or the Further Jacobs Email \"did not exist\" in November and December 2010.\n\n279.\n\nCertain additional facts buttress this conclusion even further. First, in correspondence with the Respondent or other third parties addressing the contract documentation regarding the Fuel Supply Agreement, the Claimants systematically omitted the Standard Terms and the December General Terms:\n\n\u2022 On 14 December 2010, i.e. one week after he allegedly received the Further Jacobs Email, Mr. Magee sent several emails to Banco Nacional Ultramarino to arrange a trade finance facility to issue letters of credit. The first of these emails stated that \"[t]he third file (to follow) contains the FULL LEGAL DOCUMENTATION between RDTL and Lighthouse Corporation Ltd\".339 The third email also referred to the complete contract documentation in the following terms: \"Attached is the complete set of executed documents between the Government (RDTL) and Lighthouse Corporation in respect of the agreed fuel supplies for the next 7 years\".340 The contractual documents were indeed attached, but not the Standard Terms and the December General Terms & Conditions.\n\n\u2022 On 21 December 2010, i.e. two weeks after he allegedly received the Further Jacobs Email, Mr. Magee sent an email to Ambassador Guterres writing that \"[t]here are a total of NINE documents which constitute the Contract, together, they represent the ENTIRE CONTRACT\".341 The nine documents listed in that email did not include the Standard Terms nor the December General Terms & Conditions.\n\n\u2022 On 2 February 2011, i.e. nearly two months after he allegedly sent the Second Jacobs Email, Mr. Jacobs sent a series of six emails to Ambassador Guterres. With the first of these emails, he was sending \"some of the important documentation, communication and agreements in place with RDTL and EDTL\".342 None of these emails attached the Standard Terms or the December General Terms & Conditions.\n\n\u2022 Two days later, on 4 February 2011 Mr. Magee sent an email to Mr. Jacobs attaching a document entitled \"RDTL - Lighthouse Summary of Agreement Documents\".343 In this email, Mr. Magee specified that: \"[t]he Summary provides a 15 page review of the documents with key points of each document highlighted and indexed to the chronology of documents\". The summary attached describes the contractual documents and relevant correspondence between the Claimants and the Respondent, but not the Standard Terms or the December General Terms.\n\nExh. R-139, Email from Sean Magee to Fernando Alves of 14 December 2010 (8:46 am).\n\nExh. R-140, Email from Sean Magee to Fernando Alves of 14 December 2010 (9:03 am).\n\nExh. R-121, Email from Sean Magee to Ambassador Abel Guterres of 21 December 2010.\n\nExh. R-122, Email from Albert Jacobs to Ambassador Abel Guterres of 2 February 2011.\n\nExh. R-141, Email from Sean Magee to Albert Jacobs of 4 February 2011.\n\n280.\n\nSecond, none of the few documents that do mention the Standard Terms to which the Claimants draw attention date from 2010. Neither do they establish that the Standard Terms were supplied to the Respondent:\n\n\u2022 The email of 10 February 2011 from Mr. Magee to Mr. Jacobs and others344 is an internal communication, not addressed or copied to the Respondent.\n\n\u2022 The letter of 8 February 2011 from Mr. Jacobs to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o345 has been examined above, and the Tribunal has found that the reference to the \"Standard Terms & Conditions\" therein is a reference to the Supply Agreement and the October General Terms.\n\n\u2022 The email of 8 February 2011 from Mr. Magee to Mr. Jacobs, requesting the latter to forward \"a copy of the Lighthouse 'Standard Terms & Conditions applying to the SALE OF GOODS'\"346 is not clear. It is not established that Mr. Jacobs did actually forward the Standard Terms, nor to whom he did, and whether the reference was to the Fuel Supply Agreement or the September/October General Terms.\n\n\u2022 The email of 11 February 2011 from Mr. Jacobs to Mr. Oliveira and others is an internal communication; it is not addressed/copied to the Respondent.347\n\n\u2022 The letter of 20 April 2011 from Mr. Jacobs to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o has two generic references to \"Standard Terms & Conditions\".348 Again, it is not clear whether the reference was to the Fuel Supply Agreement or the September/October General Terms.\n\nExh. C-217, Email from Sean Magee to Albert Jacobs of 10 February 2011.\n\nExh. C-104, Letter from Albert Jacobs to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o and others of 8 February 2011, titled 'Request for Performance and LC Issuance\u2019.\n\nExh. C-219, Email from Sean Magee to Albert Jacobs of 8 February 2011.\n\nExh. C-218, Email from Albert Jacobs to Sean Magee of 10 February 2011.\n\nExh. C-107, Letter from Albert Jacobs to Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o and others of 20 April 2011, titled 'Supply for Allocation and Contract Generator Provision'. In relevant parts, the letter reads: \"We also note that under Standard Terms & Conditions the generators cannot be released for use until the LC is drawn down, which is therefore dependent on the delivery of the fuel supply. [\u2026] As per the terms of the original agreement noted above, and as per our standard terms of supply, a mandatory regular maintenance, inspection and service plan, as approved by the manufacturer, must be followed for a continuous period of no less than eighty-four (84) calendar months from delivery of the first fuel supply pursuant to the contract\".\n\n281.\n\nThe foregoing analysis buttresses the Tribunal's prior conclusion that the Claimants have not established that ICSID arbitration was incorporated into the Parties' contractual arrangements and that in consequence, the Claimants have not established that the Respondent has agreed by contract to arbitrate the present dispute before ICSID.\n\n282.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants' case would fail for another independent reason. The Standard Terms - which contained the ICSID dispute arbitration clause - allegedly existed before the Supply Agreement was signed. The Third Agreement was the last agreement executed between the Parties. Attached to the Third Agreement was the October General Terms which provided for dispute resolution in local courts.349 In the circumstances - on the basis that later agreements between the Parties would prevail over previous agreements350 - even if the ICSID arbitration clause was incorporated into the Parties\u2019 contractual documents, *quod non*, it was later replaced by the October General Terms, which provided for dispute settlement through local courts.\n\nThe only document that contains a dispute resolution provision after the October General Terms is the December General Terms. For the reasons mentioned above in Section VI.2.c.iii, the Tribunal has concluded that the Claimants have not established that they supplied the December General Terms to the Respondent.\n\nThe Claimants agree. *See* Rej., para. 74 (\"Further, where there are multiple versions of a set of contractual terms and conditions, it is clear on the basis of settled authority that the most recent version is the one which prevails\").\n\n**C. CONSENT TO ICSID ARBITRATION THROUGH THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Parties' Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n***a. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claim that the Respondent expropriated the Fuel Supply Agreement in violation of the FIL.351 According to the Respondent, the Claimants cannot rely on the offer of ICSID arbitration contained in Article 23 of the FIL because they do not qualify as a \"foreign investor\" under the FIL ((i) below), and the Fuel Supply Agreement does not constitute a \"special investment agreement\" under the FIL ((ii) below).352 The Respondent also challenges the Claimants\u2019 alternative FIL argument ((iii) below).\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 176 *et seq.* ; *See*, Exh. RL-047, FIL.\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 176.\n\n*i. Foreign Investor's Certificate*\n-----------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s position is that the Claimants cannot rely on the offer of ICSID arbitration in Article 23 of the FIL because that offer \"is conditional: it only applies to disputes with 'foreign investors\u2019 as that term is to be understood, both for the purposes of the FIL and for the purposes of consent under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention\".353 Under the FIL, the Claimants are not foreign investors.\n\nReply, para. 155.\n\n285.\n\nThe Respondent points to Article 3(f) of the FIL, which defines \"foreign investor\" as a \"foreign individual or collective person or non-resident Timorese national, that holds a foreign investor\u2019s certificate\".354 The Claimants do not fall within this definition because, as the Claimants acknowledge, they have never applied for or obtained a foreign investor's certificate.355\n\nExh. RL-047, FIL, Article 3(f).\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 196; Reply, para. 252, *citing* C-Mem., paras. 80-82. Indeed, the Respondent alleges that \"Claimants were advised by the Respondent's representative in July 2010 about the Government's procurement and investment procedures, including the recommendation of submitting any investment proposal to TradeInvest\" but took no action on this advice.

R-113, Email from Jose Dos Reis Francisco Abel to Sean Magee of 28 July 2010.\n\n286.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that in cases of genuine uncertainty or ambiguity about the application of the legal requirement, ICSID tribunals may adopt a liberal interpretation for the benefit of the investor.356 Yet, \"the legality provisions in the FIL are sufficiently clear to be construed in a way that requires strict compliance by investors\".357 In this context, the Respondent cites to several provisions of the FIL:\n\n\u2022 Article 3(b) expressly defines \"foreign investor's certificate\" and indicates that foreign investor's certificates are issued by \"the competent authority\".358 The \"competent authority\" was TradeInvest, created in 2005 to promote and monitor foreign investment.359\n\n\u2022 Article 19 states that foreign investments made under the FIL are \"subject to authorization and approval by the competent government authorities\", which is given \"under the terms of applicable legislation\".360\n\n\u2022 Article 20 provides that a \"foreign investment shall be registered with the competent authority... under the terms of this law and applicable regulations\".361\n\nReply, para. 156, *citing* Exh.

The Respondent points to the example provided by the tribunal in Exh. RL-045, *Desert Line Projects LLC v. The Republic of Yemen*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award, 6 February 2008, para. 109 (\"Indeed, if an imperative formality were intended to be required, it would have been appropriate, if not indispensable to identify the type of document required in each of the two countries and to identify the issuing department or at least direct the attention of the readers of the Treaty - prospective investors - to the proposition that the precise nature of the required certificates is to be determined by \"specific regulations in force from time to time\").\n\nExh. RL-047, FIL, Article 3(b) (defining \"foreign investor's certificate\" as \"a document issued to a foreign investor by the competent authority, certifying the investor's foreign status\").\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 186; Carvalho WS, paras. 9-10.\n\nExh. RL-047, FIL, Article 19.\n\nExh. RL-047, FIL, Article 20.\n\n287.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, these provisions unambiguously put the Claimants on notice that, to gain the protections of the FIL, they need to obtain a foreign investor\u2019s certificate, or at the very least \"make reasonable enquiries with the Respondent as to the identity of the 'competent authority\u2019 and how they might apply for and obtain a foreign investors certificate\".362 As a matter of Timorese law, the Respondent asserts that the foreign investor certificate requirement is both substantive and clear.363\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 206.\n\nReply, para. 157.\n\n288.\n\nThe Respondent also accepts that ICSID tribunals have not demanded strict compliance with \"legality requirements\" that are found to be \"purely formal\" or designed to deprive investors of investment protection.364 However, it argues that the requirement for a foreign certificate in the FIL is a genuine requirement aimed at allowing the Respondent to exercise control over protected investments.365\n\nReply, para. 208, *citing* Exh. RL-045, *Desert Line Projects LLC v. the Republic of Yemen*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/17, Award, 6 February 2008, para. 106.\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 209. Respondent cites a number of provisions of the FIL to show that Respondent sought to exercise control over investments, such as Article 8, which reserved the Respondent's right to prohibit or restrict foreign investment in certain areas or sectors of economic activity, and Article 19, which required foreign investments to comply with the objectives of the National Development Plan. Exh. RL-047, FIL, Articles 8, 19; *see also* Articles 2(2), 9, 20-22, 24.\n\n289.\n\nThe Respondent dismisses Mr. Alfaiate\u2019s opinion that the FIL does not require a foreign investor\u2019s certificate, as long as investors comply with the \"material requirements\" of the law.366 This interpretation is inconsistent with the principle that the words \"foreign investor\u2019s certificate\" in Article 3 must be given meaning.367\n\nReply, paras. 159-160, *citing* C-Mem., paras. 80-81.\n\nReply, para. 160; Marrazes ER 1, para. 39, 74-84.\n\n290.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, Mr. Alfaiate fails to recognise that the Constitution of Timor-Leste requires that mechanisms be put in place to ensure effective control over foreign investment to protect the national interest.368 This is the role of the foreign investor\u2019s certificate. The importance of that certificate is also reflected in Government Decree 6/2005, which establishes detailed rules and procedures governing the application process, issuance and revocation of certificates.369\n\nReply, para. 160; Marrazes ER 1, paras. 53-55; *See* Exh. CL-108, Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, para. 140 (\"The State shall promote national investment and establish conditions to attract foreign investment, taking into consideration the national interests, in accordance with the law\").\n\nReply, para. 160; Exh. RL-101, Government Decree No. 6/2005 (Timor-Leste), Chapter III. For Respondent, Mr. Alfaiate's testimony at the Hearing regarding Government Decree 6/2005 (that it is invalid to the extent it requires a foreign investment certificate) is an example of his willingness to disregard the text of the FIL and the Decree altogether. R-PHB, para. 151 and n. 158, *citing* Tr. 222:32-47; Tr. 223:1-27.\n\n291.\n\nFurther, the Respondent disputes Mr. Alfaiate's opinion that there is a contradiction between Articles 2 and 3 of the FIL. These provisions \"can and should be read together: Article 2 applies to 'foreign investments' which, by virtue of Articles 3(g) and 3(b), are made by 'foreign investors' who have been issued with a 'foreign investor's certificate'\".370\n\nReply, para. 160.\n\n292.\n\nFinally, the Respondent challenges the Claimants' reliance on the Prime Minister's \"callback\" power under the Government Organic Law.371 The call-back power is limited to matters within the competence of a Ministry or Secretariat of State. Therefore, the Prime Minister could not use this power to override the FIL, Government Decree 06/2005, and TradeInvest's authority to issue foreign investor's certificates.372\n\nReply, para. 162, *citing* Alfaiate ER 1, paras. 47-53.\n\nReply, para. 162; Marrazes ER 1, paras. 93-111.\n\n*ii. Special Investment Agreement*\n----------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimants' contention that the Fuel Supply Agreement constitutes a \"special investment agreement\" under Articles 18(1) and 18(2) of the FIL (\"SIA\").373 It points to Article 18(2) of the FIL, which provides that SIAs \"shall be authorised by resolution of the Council of Ministers, clearly specifying the special conditions justifying the agreement, together with the special system applicable to the agreement\".374 The Claimants offer no evidence of such resolution.375 Nor have they addressed why they failed to act on the Respondent's advice and did not apply for a SIA through TradeInvest.376\n\nPreliminary Objections, paras. 211-215; Reply, paras. 163-168.\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 213(b); Exh. RL-047, FIL, Article 18(2).\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 213(b); Reply, para. 164.\n\nReply, para. 167.\n\n294.\n\nThe Respondent also disputes the Claimants\u2019 submissions that the Council of Ministers knew of the Fuel Supply Agreement and did not oppose it.377 The \"relevant enquiry must be whether the Council of Ministers has *passed a resolution* authorising a special investment agreement for the purposes of Article 18(2)\".378 This is not merely a formal requirement; it allows the Council of Ministers to exercise qualitative control over significant investments in the country.379\n\nReply, para. 166, *citing* Alfaiate ER 1, para. 92.\n\nReply, para. 166(d).\n\nReply, para. 166(c).\n\n295.\n\nNor does the Respondent accept Mr. Alfaiate\u2019s opinion that the requirement for a resolution of the Council of Ministers should be construed \"*cum grano salis*\" because of \"challenges\" of the developing legal system and \"the non-compliant practice of the Timorese Government\".380 The Respondent contends that Mr. Alfaiate has offered no evidence of these alleged \"challenges\"; nor have the Claimants explained \"how and to what extent government practice could properly modify or change matters of legal principle\".381 Moreover, Mr. Alfaiate\u2019s examples of purported SIAs are consistent with the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the FIL and Government Decree 06/2005.382 They show that there is an established practice of authorising SIAs by resolution of the Council of Ministers.383\n\nReply, para. 165, *citing* C-Mem., para. 90.\n\nR-PHB, para. 149.\n\nTr. 226:8-227:24; R-PHB, para. 152. *See* Reply, para. 166, *citing* Alfaiate ER 1, para. 85 and Exh.

AFG-4.\n\n296.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent concludes that there is no basis on which the Fuel Supply Agreement could constitute a SIA.\n\n*iii. Entitlement to Protection under the FIL*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nFinally, the Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 alternative argument that they are \"foreign investors who are in any event entitled to the protection of the Foreign Investment Law, including the ICSID clause in Article 23\".384 The Respondent\u2019s answer is that Article 23 of the FIL expressly states that ICSID arbitration is available only with respect to \"disputes between the State and foreign investors\".385 Without a foreign investor's certificate, the Claimants do not qualify as a \"foreign investor\" under Article 3(f). As a result, this dispute does not fall within Article 23.386\n\nReply, paras. 169 *et seq.*\n\nReply, para. 171, *quoting* Exh. RL-047, FIL, Articles 3(f), 13.\n\nReply, para. 171.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nIt is the Claimants' submission that they are entitled to resort to ICSID arbitration pursuant to Article 23 of the FIL.387 They argue that they do not need a foreign investor's certificate to benefit from the FIL ((i) below); the Fuel Supply Agreement falls within the protection of the FIL as a SIA ((ii) below); and the Claimants would be entitled to protection as \"foreign investors\" under the FIL in any event ((iii) below).\n\nC-Mem., paras. 77 *et seq.* ; Rej., paras. 88 *et seq.* ; C-PHB, paras. 108 *et seq*.\n\n*i. Foreign Investor's Certificate*\n-----------------------------------\n\n299.\n\nThe Claimants disagree with the Respondent's assertion that the \"foreign investor's certificate\" is an absolute requirement such that non-compliance deprives an investor of the protections of the FIL.388 Relying on their legal expert, the Claimants submit that there is a contradiction between Article 2 of the FIL (providing that the FIL applies to \"foreign investments made in Timor-Leste by foreign individuals or collective persons...\") and Article 3(f) (defining \"foreign investor\" as a \"foreign individual or collective person... that holds a foreign investor's certificate\"). Requiring a foreign investor's certificate to access the benefits of the FIL would be \"inconsistent with the unity of the Timorese legal system, and result in inconsistent terminology being used throughout the rest of the Foreign Investment Law\".389\n\nC-Mem., paras. 80-82; Rej., paras. 98-107.\n\nRej., para. 98.\n\n300.\n\nRather, the Claimants' interpretation is that the \"foreign investor's certificate\" is issued to certify the investor's foreign status so that the investor \"is exempt from proving the investment and its foreign status\".390 Foreign investors without such a certificate nevertheless fall within the ambit of the FIL, as long as the investment at issue fulfilled the \"material requirements\" of the FIL, which are set forth in Articles 2, 6 and 7.391\n\nC-Mem., para. 80; Alfaiate ER 1, para. 46.\n\nC-Mem., para. 81; Alfaiate ER 1, para. 64; C-PHB, para. 119.\n\n301.\n\nFor the Claimants, they have clearly satisfied these \"material requirements\" and therefore, the lack of a foreign investor\u2019s certificate is irrelevant.392 The Claimants dismiss the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the Timor-Leste Constitution to underline the alleged importance of foreign investor\u2019s certificate.393 They argue that the constitutional provision which the Respondent invokes merely confirms the Respondent\u2019s competence to enact legislation in relation to foreign investments; it says nothing about any particular form or requirement.394\n\nC-Mem., para. 82.\n\nRej., para. 101; Alfaiate ER 2, para. 36.\n\nRej., para. 101; Alfaiate ER 2, para. 36; Exh. CL-108, Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, para. 140.\n\n302.\n\nAlternatively, the Claimants submit that even if the FIL does require a foreign investor\u2019s certificate, that requirement was overridden in this case by the Prime Minister\u2019s \"call back\" power under the Government Organic Law.395 Article 6(3) provides that \"the Prime Minister has the power to issue instructions to any member of Government and to make decisions on matters included in the areas of responsibility of any Ministry or Secretariat of State\".396 By directly negotiating and signing the Fuel Supply Agreement, the Prime Minister validly exercised this \"call back\" power, which superseded the need for a foreign investor\u2019s certificate.397\n\nRej., paras. 104-107; Alfaiate ER 2, paras. 42-49; C-PHB, para. 120; Tr. 224:34-38; Exh. CL-109, Decree-Law No 14/2009, Article 6(3).\n\nExh. CL-109, Decree-Law No 14/2009, Article 6(3).\n\nRej., paras. 105-106; Alfaiate ER 1, para. 49.\n\n*ii. Special Investment Agreement*\n----------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 further argument is that the debate about the foreign investor\u2019s certificate is irrelevant because the Fuel Supply Agreement constitutes a SIA within the meaning of Article 18 of the FIL.398\n\nC-Mem., paras. 83 *et seq.* ; Rej., paras. 108 *et seq.* ; C-PHB, para. 121.\n\n304.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Fuel Supply Agreement falls within Article 18(1) of the FIL because Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o signed the agreement under his emergency powers; the Claimants were granted concessions such as tax incentives and waiver of port fees; the Fuel Supply Agreement had significant \"economic, social, environmental, or technological impact\"; and it was of \"great interest to the country under the national development strategy\".399\n\nC-Mem., para. 84, *quoting* Exh. RL-047, FIL, Article 18(1); Alfaiate ER 2, para. 82.\n\n305.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that Article 18(2) refers to the authorisation of SIAs by resolution of the Council of Ministers. However, they refer to Mr. Alfaiate's opinion that this formal requirement should be interpreted \"*cum grano salis*\" in consideration of the \"challenges of the nascent and still developing Timorese Legal System\",400 and because the Government's \"practice in this regard has been rather flexible and non-compliant\".401 According to Mr. Alfaiate, only one Government Resolution regarding a SIA was published between the FIL's entry into force and 2014, and it did not include an \"indication of the special conditions justifying the agreement, and of the special regime that applies to the agreement\" as required by Article 18(2).402\n\nAs evidence of the \"challenges\" of Respondent's legal system, the Claimants cite the World Bank's annual \"Doing Business\" Report, ranking Respondent low in the area of enforcement of contracts. Exh. AFG-6, p. 157 (2010), Exh. AFG-7, p. 199 (2011) and Exh. AFG-8, p. 131 (2012). They also rely on the Preamble of the FIL, which states that \"Timor-Leste (East Timor) faces enormous challenges arising from its historical process to gain independence that have affected the majority of its infrastructures.\". Exh. RL-047, FIL, Preamble.\n\nAlfaiate ER 1, paras. 84, 91-92.\n\nAlfaiate ER 2, para. 103; Exh. AFG-2, Government Resolution no. 22/2010 (approving the SIA with ENSUL MECI.). Mr. Alfaiate also submitted Government Resolution 17/2009, which he also considers noncompliant. Exh. AFG-3, Government Resolution 17/2009 (approving the SIA with the Paradise Group Limited).\n\n306.\n\nThe Claimants further rely on Mr. Alfaiate's opinion to substantiate their argument that the Fuel Supply Agreement \"materially qualifies\" as a SIA.403 Specifically, they submit the following:\n\n\u2022 As explained above, the Fuel Supply Agreement complies with the requirements of a SIA under Article 18.1.404\n\n\u2022 It can be inferred that the Council of Ministers knew of the Fuel Supply Agreement and viewed it favorably. In fact, the Fuel Supply Agreement \"was going to be subject to a Resolution of the Council of Ministers, which was meant to happen in December 2010 or January 2011\".405\n\n\u2022 The Council of Ministers indicated its agreement with the Fuel Supply Agreement to third parties. In particular, it \"apparently agreed to issue a Letter of Comfort to [Banco Nacional Ultramarino] in May 2011 in the context of the agreement between the State, Lighthouse and Zebra Fuels\".406\n\nRej., para. 112; Alfaiate ER 2, para. 115.\n\nC-Mem., para. 90; Alfaiate ER 1, paras. 91-92.\n\nC-Mem., para. 88; Alfaiate ER 1, para. 87, *citing* Exh. C-102, Letter from Prime Minister Gusm\u00e2o to Fernando Torrao Alves (Caixa Geral De Depositos) of 23 December 2010, titled \"Trade Finance Facility\".\n\nAlfaiate ER 1, para. 87, *citing* Exh. C-108, Email correspondence between Sean Magee and Albert Jacobs of 6 May 2011 regarding Banco Nacional Ultramarino.\n\n*iii. Entitlement to Protection under the FIL*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nIn the further alternative, the Claimants submit that they are in any event \"foreign investors\" entitled to the protections of the FIL.407 In this regard, they warn against a strict interpretation of the FIL,408 and point to various characteristics of the Fuel Supply Agreement that, in their view, bring it within the scope of the FIL.409\n\nC-Mem., para. 92; Rej., paras. 113-114; C-PHB, para. 126.\n\nRej., para. 113, *citing* Exh. CL-107, Law No 10/2003, Preamble.\n\nC-Mem., para. 92; Alfaiate ER 1, para. 102.\n\n308.\n\nFor all of these reasons, the Claimants ask the Tribunal to dismiss the Respondent\u2019s third jurisdictional objection.\n\n**2. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n309.\n\nThe Tribunal will first review the applicable legal framework ((a) below), then analyze the Respondent\u2019s objections ((b)-(d) below), and finally set out its conclusion ((e) below).\n\n***a. Legal Framework***\n------------------------\n\n310.\n\nThe FIL provides a legal framework for foreign investments in Timor-Leste:\n\n\"[T]his law shall apply to foreign investments made in Timor-Leste by foreign individuals or collective persons, or by non-resident Timorese nationals.\"410\n\nExh. RL-047, FIL, Article 2(1). The FIL was not the only mechanism through which foreign investors could make an investment in Timor-Leste. Further, the FIL was repealed and replaced by the Private Investment Law (Law No. 14/2011) (\"PIL\") in or around September 2011. This said, the Parties' experts appear to agree that the Claimants' investment would be governed by the FIL and not the PIL.\n\n311.\n\nA \"foreign investment\" under the FIL is an investment made by a \"foreign investor\" and which satisfies the following criteria:\n\n\"[A]ny direct investment made with financial resources, or subject to pecuniary assessment, originating from abroad at the risk and expense of a foreign investor.\"411\n\nExh. RL-047, FIL, Article 3(g).\n\n312.\n\nA \"foreign investor\" under the FIL is a foreign individual, \"collective person\" or nonresident Timorese national who holds a \"foreign investor's certificate\":\n\n\"[A]ny foreign individual or collective person or non-resident Timorese national, that holds a foreign investor's certificate.\"412\n\nExh. RL-047, FIL, Article 3(f).\n\n313.\n\nArticle 3(b) of the FIL defines a \"foreign investor's certificate\" as follows:\n\n\"a document issued to a foreign investor by the competent authority, certifying the investor's foreign status.\"413\n\nExh. RL-047, FIL, Article 3(b).\n\n314.\n\nAt the time when the Fuel Supply Agreement was executed, the \"competent authority\" responsible for issuing foreign investor's certificates pursuant to the FIL was \"TradeInvest\", created in 2005 for the purposes of promoting, coordinating, facilitating and monitoring foreign investment.414\n\nCarvalho WS, para. 9.\n\n315.\n\nArticles 19 and 20 of the FIL require all \"foreign investments\" under the terms of the FIL to be authorized and approved by the Government and registered with TradeInvest:\n\n\"Article 19\n\n1. Foreign investments to be made in the country under the terms of this law shall be subject to authorization and approval by the competent government authorities, under the terms of applicable legislation.\n\n2. The authorization referred to in Paragraph 1 above shall be granted so long as the applicant meets the legally required conditions and the proposed investment complies with the objectives of the National Development Plan.\n\nArticle 20\n\n1. Once a request has been granted under the terms of Article 19, a foreign investment shall be registered with the competent authority, under the terms of this law and applicable regulations.\n\n2. The registration referred to in Paragraph 1 above shall be separate from the commercial registration of a business, under the terms of applicable commercial legislation.\"\n\n316.\n\nArticle 18 of the FIL provides for a different type of foreign investment, where the state enters into a SIA with a foreign investor:\n\n\"Article 18\n\nSpecial Investment Agreements\n\n1. The government may establish special investment agreements with potential foreign investors defining special legal systems applicable to economic activities that, by their scale or nature, or by their economic, social, environmental or technological impact, prove to be of great interest to the country under the national development strategy, thereby justifying the adoption of special treatment or conditions beyond the general foreign investment system established by this law.\n\n2. The conclusion of the special investment agreements referred to in Paragraph 1 above shall be authorized by resolution of the Council of Ministers, clearly specifying the special conditions justifying the agreement, together with the special system applicable to the agreement.\"\n\n317.\n\nUnder the FIL, the process for obtaining a SIA is the same as for obtaining a foreign investor's certificate, except that when applying for approval through TradeInvest, the potential foreign investor must submit a request for a SIA. That request must then be considered by the Council of Ministers.\n\n318.\n\nDisputes between the State and \"foreign investors\" under the FIL are settled through ICSID arbitration:\n\n\"Article 23 Conciliation and arbitration\n\n1. Disputes between the State and foreign investors arising from the interpretation and application of this law and its regulations shall be settled by conciliation, in accordance with Timorese legislation, unless otherwise established in international agreements to which the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste is a party, or in agreements between Timor-Leste and the foreign investor in question.\n\n2. Disputes between the State and foreign investors of foreign nationality that cannot be resolved under the terms of Paragraph 1 above shall be settled by way of arbitration in accordance with the rules of the International Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID), unless there is an agreement to the contrary.\n\n3. The provisions of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above shall not prejudice the right to appeal to the competent courts of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste whenever both parties decide to do so.\"415\n\nExh. RL-047, FIL, Article 23.\n\n***b. Foreign Investor's Certificate***\n---------------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nThe Claimants concede that they do not have a foreign investor's certificate. However, relying on their expert on Timorese law, they submit that the FIL does not require a foreign investor to hold a foreign investor's certificate in order to obtain the benefits of the FIL, provided that the foreign investor fulfils the \"material requirements\" of the FIL.416 For the Claimants, the \"material requirements\" are those provided in Articles 2 (scope of application of FIL), 6 (composition of foreign investment), and 7 (forms of foreign investment).\n\nC-Mem., paras. 80-81.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept this submission. No authority is referred to for the Claimants' proposition other than their own expert. Yet, even Mr. Alfaiate does not cite instances where the explicit language of the FIL was disregarded because an investor fulfilled the \"material requirements\" of the FIL. Moreover, Mr. Alfaiate's interpretation deprives of any meaning the words \"foreign investor's certificate\" in Article 3 of the FIL. While these reasons are sufficient to reject the theory advanced by the Claimants and their expert, there are still other reasons for doing so.\n\n321.\n\nFirst, it is clear that the Respondent intended to exercise administrative control on incoming foreign investments. This is evident from the Timorese Constitution,417 the FIL418 - which was enacted to ensure administrative control on incoming foreign investments419 - and from other legislation enacted at the time. Indeed, shortly after the enactment of the FIL, Timor-Leste issued an implementing regulation, namely Government Decree 6/2005, entitled \"Foreign Investment Procedures Regulation\", which details the procedures and practical measures under the FIL, particularly the application process, and issuance as well as revocation of foreign investment certificates.420 As foreign investment certificates are strictly regulated, it seems counterintuitive to suggest that an investor who does not comply with clear administrative requirements may nevertheless benefit from the FIL. The various provisions of the FIL, constituted with the existence of a Decree setting out the detailed rules, requirements and procedures for the application, assessment, approval or denial, and revocation of foreign investor's certificates in Timor-Leste suggest that the requirement of these certificates is not to be disregarded.421\n\n*See* Exh. CL-108, Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, para. 140 (\"The State shall promote national investment and establish conditions to attract foreign investment, taking into consideration the national interests, in accordance with the law\").\n\n*See* for instance Article 8 of the FIL (reserving the Respondent's right to prohibit or restrict foreign investment in certain areas or sectors of economic activity), Article 19 of the FIL (requiring foreign investments to comply with the objectives of the National Development Plan, and stating that foreign investments made under the FIL are \"subject to authorization and approval by the competent government authorities\", which is given \"under the terms of applicable legislation\") and Article 20 of the FIL (providing that a \"foreign investment shall be registered with the competent authority [\u2026] under the terms of this law and applicable regulations\".).\n\nPedro Barcelar Vasconsuelos, Timorese constitutional law specialist, quoted in Marrazes ER 1, para. 54.\n\nExh. RL-101, Government Decree No. 6/2005 (Timor-Leste).\n\nFor the same reason, the Claimants' reliance on decisions of ICSID tribunals that have not demanded strict compliance with \"purely formal\" legality requirements that are found to be or designed to deprive investors of investment protection is irrelevant.\n\n322.\n\nSecond, Mr. Alfaiate opines that it would be inconsistent with \"the unity of the Timorese legal system\" to require a foreign investor to hold a certificate for him to have access the protections of the FIL.422 Such a requirement would \"result in inconsistent terminology being used throughout the rest of the Foreign Investment Law\".423 The Tribunal does not agree. There is no contradiction between Articles 2 and 3 of the FIL. These provisions make sense when read together: Article 2 applies to \"foreign investments\" which, by virtue of Articles 3(g) and 3(b), are made by \"foreign investors\" who have been issued a \"foreign investor's certificate\".424\n\nAlfaiate ER 1, paras. 37-39.\n\nAlfaiate ER 1, para. 40.\n\nThis conclusion (which is also put forward in Marrazes ER 1, paras. 74-84) is reached on the basis of the understanding of the text of the FIL.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore considers that a foreign investor was required to have its foreign investment approved and authorized in accordance with Articles 19 and 20 of the FIL and to receive a foreign investor's certificate issued by TradeInvest, in order to enjoy the benefits offered by the FIL.\n\n324.\n\nThe Claimants additionally argue that, if the Tribunal were to hold that they need a \"foreign investor's certificate\", the absence of a certificate is cured by the Prime Minister's exercise of the call back power under Article 6(3) of the Government Organic Law in force at the relevant time.425\n\nAlfaiate ER 1, paras. 47-53, *citing* Exh. CL-109, Decree-Law No 14/2009, Art. 6(3).\n\n325.\n\nArticle 6(3) of the Government Organic Law reads as follows:\n\n\"[T]he Prime Minister has the power to issue instructions to any member of Government and to make decisions on matters included in the areas of responsibility of any Ministry or Secretariat of State, as well as to create permanent or temporary committees or workgroups for any matters under the Government's purview.\"426\n\nEnglish translation Decree-Law No 14/2009, Art. 6(3) in Marrazes ER 1, para. 94. Mr. Marrazes testifies that on the date of signature of the Fuel Supply Agreement, i.e. 22 October 2010, the version of the Government Organic Law in force was the one amended by Decree Law 15/2010, of 20 October 2010 (6th amendment).\n\n326.\n\nThe language makes clear that the so-called call-back power is limited to matters within the responsibility of a Ministry or Secretariat of State. There is no cogent evidence that this provision empowers the Prime Minister to make decisions in areas that are within the competence of entities that are not mentioned, such as TradeInvest; nor is there any cogent evidence that this call-back power enables the Prime Minister to override the FIL and Government Decree 06/2005. The Tribunal therefore dismisses this argument.\n\n***c. Special Investment Agreement***\n-------------------------------------\n\n327.\n\nIn the alternative, the Claimants contend that they may benefit from the FIL protections because the Fuel Supply Agreement constitutes a \"special investment agreement\" (defined herein as \"SIA\") for purposes of Article 18(1) and (2) of the FIL.427\n\nRej., para. 108.\n\n328.\n\nThe provisions reproduced above show that Article 18(1) of the FIL empowers the government to enter into SIAs with potential foreign investors. It does not define which agreements may qualify as SIAs. Article 18(2), provides that a SIA requires a resolution of the Council of Ministers. Mr. Alfaiate, the Claimants' expert,428 acknowledges this requirement, and the Claimants concede that no Council of Minister resolutions approved the Fuel Supply Agreement as a SIA.429 In the circumstances and in light of the clear text of Article 18 of the FIL, the Tribunal has no basis to conclude that the Fuel Supply Agreement is a SIA.\n\nAlfaiate ER 1, paras. 83-84.\n\n*See* for instance, C-Mem., para. 88 *et seq*. where the Claimants submit that \"the Council of Ministers indeed considered the Fuel Supply Agreement and it can be inferred that the Council viewed it favourably\" without mentioning that the Council of Ministers resolved to approve the Fuel Supply Agreement as a SIA.\n\n329.\n\nThe Claimants seeks to counter this conclusion with the argument that the Council of Ministers resolution is not a mandatory requirement. They cite cases in support,430 which, however, do not support the Claimants' position. In the case of ENSUL MECI, a SIA was approved by the Council of Ministers through Government Resolution 22/2010.431 Similarly, six years later, a SIA was approved in respect of TL Cement, Lda. through Government Resolution 14/2016.432 While the text of these Resolutions is different, and while the Tribunal could agree with Mr. Alfaiate that \"progress has been made in this area since 2010\",433 these cases demonstrate that a resolution of the Council of Ministers is required for an agreement to qualify as a SIA under the FIL.\n\nReply, para. 166. The case of Pelican Paradise Group Limited relied on by the Claimants is irrelevant and not considered here as it does not ostensibly relate to any SIA. *See* Exh. AFG-003 (\"Thus, the Government resolves, in accordance with article 116, e) of the Constitution of the Republic, the following: [\u2026] To approve the project for the construction of a hotel complex in Tasi Tolu / Tibar, to be undertaken by the Pelican Paradise Group Limited\").\n\nExh. AFG-002 (\"The Government decides, in the terms of letter e) of article 116 of the Constitution of the Republic, the following: To approve the draft Special Investment Agreement to be signed with the company ENSUL MECI-GESTAO DE PROJECTOS DE ENGENHARIA, SA, regarding the construction of a real estate complex in Colmeia, between Presidente Nicolau Lobato Avenue, Rua Dr Antonio Machado and Rua D Sebasti\u00e2o da Costa\") (the Claimants' English translation).\n\nExh. AFG-004 (\"The Government hereby decides, in accordance with Article 116 (e) of the Constitution of the Republic and Article 29 (2) of Law No 14/2011, of 28 September, the following: 1. To approve the investment project presented by TL Cement. Lda. and the draft of the Special Investment Agreement to be entered into with TL Cement, Lda. for the construction of a cement production unit located in the Municipality of Baucau, published attached to this Resolution and forming an integral part thereof\") (the Claimants' English translation).\n\nAlfaiate ER 1, para. 86.\n\n330.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that the Respondent is estopped from claiming that the Fuel Supply Agreement was not endorsed by the Council of Ministers.434 However, the Tribunal considers that Article 18(2) of the FIL clearly requires a resolution of the Council of Ministers for an agreement to be considered as a SIA, which is also borne out by the implementation of the provision. In these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot sustain an argument on estoppel, all the more so because the Claimants have not cited any authorities in support.\n\nR-PHB, para. 122.\n\n331.\n\nFinally and in any event, even if the Fuel Supply Agreement were to be considered a SIA, that would not be of any assistance to the Claimants. Article 23 of the FIL, reproduced above, limits access to ICSID arbitration to \"foreign investors\", i.e. investors who hold a \"foreign investor's certificate\". The Claimants do not meet this requirement.\n\n332.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal holds that neither of the Claimants qualifies as \"foreign investor\" under the FIL, and that the Fuel Supply Agreement does not constitute a \"special investment agreement\" under that same legislation.\n\n***d. Entitlement to Protection under the FIL***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nInvoking various characteristics of the FIL, the Claimants argue that, despite not complying with the specific requirements of the FIL, they should be deemed \"foreign investors\" and benefit from the protections of the FIL. For the reasons already provided, the Tribunal considers that the FIL sets out a specific framework of administrative control on inbound foreign investments. The benefits granted through the FIL, particularly consent to ICSID arbitration, are available only to those investors complying with the law's requirements. That does not include the Claimants.\n\n***e. Conclusion***\n-------------------\n\n334.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal concludes that Article 23 of the FIL does not provide a basis for the Respondent's consent to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n**D. INVESTMENT WITHIN THE AMBIT OF ARTICLE 25(1) OF THE ICSID CONVENTION**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n335.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s third jurisdictional objection is that this dispute does not \"arise [...] directly out of an investment\" as required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.435 The Respondent argues that the meaning of \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention is objective and excludes ordinary commercial transactions and that the transaction in question is not an investment but rather an exchange of goods and services for payment.\n\nPreliminary Objections, para. 87.\n\n336.\n\nWhatever the outcome of this third objection, it would make no difference to the final assessment of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. If the objection is well founded, it reinforces the Tribunal's findings against jurisdiction. If it is ill-founded, the Claimants have still failed to overcome the absence of consent to ICSID arbitration. Therefore, for reasons of judicial and procedural economy, the Tribunal will dispense with determining this additional objection.\n\n**E. CONCLUSION**\n-----------------\n\n337.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims of the Claimants in these proceedings.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n338.\n\nEach Party has requested an award of costs covering its legal fees and expenses and the costs it incurred in connection with this arbitration. Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 6, the Parties filed statements quantifying their fees and costs, which are summarized in the following Sections ((A) and (B)), before the Tribunal discusses the allocation of costs in Section (C).\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANT'S COSTS**\n---------------------------\n\n339.\n\nThe Claimants' total costs and expenses incurred in connection with this arbitration amount to USD 1,669,194.80, which include (i) the ICSID lodging fee of USD 25,000; (ii) advance payments to ICSID of USD 325,000 and (iii) legal fees and expenses of USD 1,319,184.80.436\n\nClaimants' Statement of Costs, p. 1. The unused portion of the USD 325,000.00 in advance payments will be refunded to the Claimants.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S COSTS**\n-----------------------------\n\n340.\n\nThe Respondent's total costs and expenses incurred in connection with this arbitration amount to USD 3,432,328, which include (i) advance payments to ICSID of USD 325,000; and (ii) legal fees and expenses of USD 3,107,328.437\n\nRespondent's Statement of Costs, para. 1.2.1. The unused portion of the USD 325,000.00 in advance payments will be refunded to the Respondent.\n\n**C. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n341.\n\nThe costs of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal's Assistant, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):438\n\nArbitrators' fees and expenses\n\nProfessor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler 165,006.96\n\nMr. Stephen Jagusch QC 103,312.02\n\nProfessor Campbell McLachlan QC 57,563.74\n\nAssistants' fees and expenses 74,597.96\n\nICSID's administrative fees 106,000.00\n\nDirect expenses 40,387.83\n\n**Total** **546,868.51**\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account.\n\n342.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and paragraph 10 of Procedural Order No. 1, these arbitration costs have been paid out of advances made by the Parties in equal parts (50% by the Claimants and 50% by the Respondent). As a result, the Claimants' share of the arbitration costs amounts to USD 273,434.26, and the Respondent's share also amounts to USD 273,434.26.\n\n343.\n\nThe Tribunal has broad discretion in allocating the costs of the arbitration and the Parties' costs, including legal fees and expenses pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention which provides:\n\n\"[T]he Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.\"\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the Parties' arguments as well as the circumstances of this case. It observes that the issues involved in this case were complex, requiring extensive factual evidence. Nevertheless, on most issues, the Tribunal has found that the Claimants have failed to make out their case. Further, the Claimants raised additional arguments and filed new evidence just before the Hearing, which added complexity. In light of these factors and on an overall assessment of the course and outcome of this proceeding, the Tribunal concludes that it is fair for the Claimants to bear the entirety of the ICSID arbitration costs, i.e. the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID's administrative fees. The Claimants shall thus bear the direct costs of these proceedings, i.e. USD 546,868.51. They shall therefore pay to the Respondent USD 273,434.26.\n\n345.\n\nFor the remainder of costs, the Tribunal considers it fair for the Claimants to bear a reasonable portion of the Respondent's legal fees and expenses. The Tribunal is bound to observe that the amount of costs of USD 3.1 million that the Respondent claims (excluding its contribution to the fees and expenses of the Centre) is more than double the amount incurred by the Claimants. The Tribunal considers this a very high amount for a jurisdictional challenge in which the hearing itself lasted three days and the issues were relatively confined. In recognition of this, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants should reimburse the Respondent for USD 1,300,000 in respect of its legal representation, i.e. an amount in the range of the one which the Claimants themselves incurred for their representation.\n\n346.\n\nIn conclusion, the Claimants shall bear the costs of this arbitration, as well as USD 1,300,000 in respect of the Respondent's fees and expenses of legal representation.\n\n**VIII. AWARD**\n---------------\n\n347.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(i) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute;\n\n(ii) The Claimants shall bear the entirety of the costs of this arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal's Assistant, ICSID's administrative fees, and direct expenses, and thus pay to the Respondent USD 273,434.26;\n\n(iii) The Claimants shall pay USD 1,300,000 on account of the Respondent's legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with this arbitration;\n\n(iv) All other requests for relief are dismissed."}]}
