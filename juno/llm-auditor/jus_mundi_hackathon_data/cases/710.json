On August 5, 2004, the Respondent appointed Professor Catherine Kessedjian, a French citizen, as arbitrator. As the Parties did not agree on the name of a President, the Claimants invoked Article 38 of the Convention in order that the Chairman of the Administrative Council appoint the President of the Arbitral Tribunal. Pursuant to Article 4(4) of the Arbitration Rules, and after consulting with the Parties, the Chairman of the Administrative Council appointed Dr. Ahmed El-Kosheri, an Egyptian citizen, as President of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on September 17, 2004 by virtue of Article 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules. The Secretary General appointed Mrs. Aurelia Antoniettti, legal counsel to the ICSID, as Secretary of the Tribunal.

AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nPursuant to Article 43(2) of the Arbitration Rules which provides that \"[i]f the parties file with the Secretary-General the full and signed text of their settlement and in writing request the Tribunal to embody such settlement in an award, the Tribunal may record the settlement in the form of its award\", the Arbitral Tribunal unanimously hereby decides to give effect to the request of the Parties. Accordingly, the Settlement agreement of April 21, 2005 and the Report of November 23, 2005, both reproduced below, are embodied in this award and are deemed to form an integral part thereof:\n\n**\"SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT**\n\n**Between the undersigned:**\n\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo, represented for the purposes hereof by Tshibangu Kalala, Esq., attorney at taw, member of the Kinshasa/Gombe and Brussels Bars, acting by virtue of the special power of attorney granted him by letter of April 9, 2005 from the Minister of Justice and the Keeper of the Seals in the name of the Congolese government, on the one hand,\n\nhereinafter referred to as \"DRC\";\n\nand\n\nMiminco, LLC, an American company, located 9248 Three Oaks Drive, Silver Spring, MD 20901, United States of America, represented by its General Manager, Mr. John Dormer Tyson,\n\nMr. John Dormer Tyson, an American citizen, residing at 9248 Three Oaks Drive, Silver Spring, MD 20901, United States of America,\n\n**Dr. Ilunga Jean Mukendi,** an American citizen, residing at 9248 Three Oaks Drive, Silver Spring, MD 20901, United States of America, of the second part,\n\nhereinafter referred to as \"Investor\";\n\n**Whereas:**\n\n1. The Investor is the owner of two diamond-yielding mining concessions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: I) concession no. 222 (Lungu), granted by Ministerial Decree no. 483/95, and 2) mining concession no. 223 (Kabizwaya), granted by Ministerial Decree no. 484/95. These two mining concessions, 25 square kilometers each, are located in the Tshikapa Territory, Kasai Occidental Province.\n\n2. The Investor has established that since the month of October 2006, the beginning of the civil war that entailed the downfall of the regime of Marshal Mobutu, on various occasions the two concessions have been invaded, pillaged and unlawfully operated by the Congolese civil and military authorities to the great detriment of its legally protected rights and interests.\n\n3. In light of the above facts, the Investor is accusing the DRC before the ICSID of having violated the relevant provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States of March 18, 1965 (ICSID Convention) and those of the bilateral Treaty Concerning the Encouragement and Protection of Investment entered into with the United States of America on August 3, 1984. In this context, the Investor is claiming payment from the DRC in an amount of 35 million American dollars to compensate the losses sustained.\n\n4. Following a minutious examination of the elements furnished by the Investor, it appears that certain of its claims are founded. However, the DRC considers that the claimed amount of 35 million dollars in damages is highly exaggerated.\n\n5. In view of the preceding, and above all for the purpose of ensuring the promotion and protection of foreign investments within its territory, the DRC, together with the Investor, consider it useful to explore the ways and means that could lead to the conclusion of an amicable settlement agreement under the control and supervision of the Arbitral Tribunal instituted by the ICSID. The DRC agrees to an extra-judicial solution for the sole purpose of, on the one hand, avoiding the high financial cost of the proceeding before the ICSID and, on the other hand, the risk of a severe condemnation of the State to pay exorbitant amounts to the Investor which shall heavily and unnecessarily burden the public Treasury.\n\n**Consequently, the following was agreed to:**\n\nArticle 1.\n\na. The DRC agrees to pay the Investor the sum of USD15,000,000 as compensation for all of the losses sustained by it due to the acts committed by the Congolese civil and military authorities.\n\nb. The practical terms and conditions for payment of the above amount shall be subsequently determined by the parties.\n\nArticle 2.\n\nThe Investor agrees and undertakes to reinvest the above amount in the operation of the Lungu and Kabizwaya concessions with a view to the creation of jobs, social infrastructures and public facilities of a social nature and pay the levies and taxes due the Congolese State.\n\nArticle 3.\n\nThe parties agree that in consideration for the full execution of their reciprocal obligations, they shall consider themselves to have been totally satisfied and shall have nothing further to claim one from the other.\n\nArticle 4.\n\nin accordance with the provisions of Article 43, paragraph 2 of the ICSID Rules, the parties hereby request that the Arbitral Tribunal embody this amicable settlement in the award that shall be rendered.\n\nArticle 5.\n\nThis settlement agreement shall be effective as from its approval by the Congolese government.\n\nDone in Paris before the Arbitral Tribunal, in seven original counterparts, on April 21, 2005.\n\n/signed/\n\n24.\n\nand amended by the following document:\n\n**\"REPORT OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH A VIEW TO THE AMICABLE SETTLEMENT OF THE DISPUTE RELATING TO INVESTMENTS BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO AND** **MIMINCO L.L.C.** ***ET AL.***\n\nIn the year 2005, on the twenty-third day of the month of November,\n\nUpon instructions from Their Excellencies the Ministers of Justice, Mines and Finance, negotiations were held at the office of the Minister of Justice, between the experts of the Ministries of Justice, Mines and Finance and representatives of the company Miminco L.L.C, et *al,* to examine the terms and conditions for execution of the decision made by the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo during its meeting of October 28, 2005 in the investments dispute between the parties;\n\nWhereas the settlement agreement signed on April 21, 2005 in Paris between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, represented by Tshibangu Kalala, Esq., duly empowered and Miminco L.L.D., an American company, represented by its Managing Director, Mr. John Dormer Tyson, Mr. John Dormer Tyson and Dr. Ilunga Jean Mukendi, Chairman, both American citizens;\n\nWhereas considering Article 5 of the settlement agreement pursuant to which it is not effective until its approval by the Congolese government;\n\nWhereas during its meeting of October 28, 2005, while approving the principle of the settlement agreement reached on April 21, 2005, the Congolese government instructed the Ministries of Justice, Mines, Finance and the Budget to continue negotiations with Miminco L.L.C, *et al.* with a view to reducing the amount of USD 15,000,000 (fifteen million American dollars) set by the settlement agreement as compensation for all of the losses sustained by Miminco L.L.C, *et al.* due to the acts committed by the Congolese civil and military authorities;\n\nAfter having heard Miminco L.L.C, *et al.* both on the basis of its claims as well as the elements of assessment of the compensation requested and having taken into account the observations of the Congolese party, the two parties agreed as follows:\n\n1. the reduction of the amount requested by Miminco L.L.C, *et al.* and setting it at USD13,000,000 (thirteen million American dollars) as compensation for all combined losses sustained;\n\n2. the necessity and urgency of revising Article 1, point a) of the settlement agreement signed on April 21, 2005 in Paris with a view to compliance with the terms of the agreement thus reached;\n\n3. to submit the agreement reached to the competent Ministers, for the attention of the Congolese government and to leave it up to the Minister of Finance to propose to the other party the terms and conditions of payment of the amount thus determined.\n\nIn witness whereof, the parties have drawn up and signed this report in eight original counterparts in Kinshasa, on the above day, month and year.\n\n/signed/\n\n25.\n\nIn accordance with Article 5 of the Settlement agreement and point 3 of the Report, the DRC produced a letter of September 1, 2007 signed by His Excellency the Minister of Justice, Georges Minsav Booka, confirming the approval of this settlement agreement by the Congolese government and requesting the Ministers of Mines, Finance and the Budget \"to each take as regards it, the appropriate measures for payment of the afore cited amount in favor of the beneficiaries.\"\n\n26.\n\nIn accordance with the agreement of the Parties, the Arbitral Tribunal hereby renders this award.\n\n27.\n\nMoreover, the Parties agreed at the time of the meeting of April 21, 2005 and confirmed at the time of the meeting of November 17, 2007, that the costs of the arbitration and of the Centre shall be borne In their entirety by the Claimants and paid from the advances made to the Centre by the Claimants.
